			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the situation of the crystal wall does not mean personally, or the more precise term of the useer: no use of the ontology Go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First display the "Astral Projection" spell to create a avatar to the astral, and then cast this spell again to bring the projection to the original world, Siegel in the city of Miele I created a star body next to my own body. With the creative power of the astral world, his projections are exactly the same as the original body, and even the equipment is copied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he found that not everything was copied, and the twenty-faced scorpion, the one-sided scorpion and the obsidian capital were not projected on the body. According to the record of the spell, objects below the low-order artifact can be projected, so that the three things are at least higher artifacts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no awkwardness around the twentieth face, especially the inability to use the undead. But when he thought about it together, he saw that the real body became a scorpion form. After a second, his projection body became a scorpion form! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really weird. It is reasonable to say that once the astral projection is applied, the real body is equivalent to being stagnant by time and will never be affected by the outside world. Only with the time and space manipulation ability of the ** division, or the use of special spells and tools, otherwise it will not affect the state of the real body. The icosahedron can receive instructions in this case, and affects the body that is being stagnant, and can also affect the projected body. This ability is excessive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is all about adding security to the trip, and Siegel doesn’t think there is anything wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small council of Heim’s collar heard that he was going to receive the news of the 250,000 dwarves of Mora. The expression on his face was very wonderful and confused. Indignation is filled with indignation, there is a sudden realization, and there is worry. However, I heard that Mora’s own food was made, and everyone’s brushing became a happy one. They tried hard not to let the dwarfs see it, so they were very powerful. Eilet only glanced at it and knew that Siegel’s words were true. Heim’s leadership did have plans for the population of the New Territories’ various territories and races. He was very pleased to see that his "little apprentice" was able to grow so fast, but he was also worried about his threat to the dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in less than an hour, a rough plan was formed. Heim’s collar draws an area near the southern lord of the Ghost Fog. Handed over by the dwarves, and a large field was drawn according to the population. According to Heim's current planting capacity, these fields have just been able to maintain the minimum ration demand for the dwarfs, but for Elinte it is already an unexpected surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Janet’s idea. Although she knew that Mora had provided food. However, the ultimate goal of Heim’s collar is not to simply place the dwarf. Her plan is to allow the dwarves to stay safely, and to exert their strength in all walks of life while not giving trouble to Heim's tie. To achieve this goal, let the dwarfs only eat the food of the Mora, and they have to do something. They have to feel secure. And in the event of a more serious crisis at the top of the Mora, even the rations are not available, and the Heim collar has to ensure that these dwarves will not have an impact on Heim. In all respects, they have to have rations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are just means, not conspiracy, so Siegel has no opinion, and the small parliament passed and executed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this plan that has exceeded his expectations, Elinette was sent back to Mora by Siegel. At this time, the magical spaceship of the Federation has also flew to the dwarf kingdom, hovering over the opposite side of the Jingjin Gate. The energy of the nuclear energy of the secret can cover the sacred mountain of this dwarf. Drive all the snow and ice hail. The door of Mora's scorpion was rarely covered with golden sunlight, but it was covered by the shadow of the magic ship. Through this means, the Federation is showing "Dragon" to the dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Sigel’s idea to let the Federation’s spacecraft come over. He also needs to be within the scope of the Peruvian nuclear power to avoid any unexpected situations. As soon as the dwarves were on the verge of enemies, several newly built dwarven artillery pieces were lifted out and trembled at the magical spacecraft. For their weapons, Wendy, who is responsible for the protection of the spacecraft, smiled disdainfully. The kind of explosive weapon that fires metal pellets is impossible to close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Eileen’s face, Siegel finally saw the current ruling group of Moura’s squad: Fire Hammer Council. The two sides chilled a few words. I began to study the plan of Heim’s collar and tried to figure out if there was any trouble in it. Siegel didn't want to spend time with them, and he involved the specific plan and he had already handed it over to Heim's small parliament. He just pointed to the general direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will inform the Federation and Heim in a timely manner. Is it unnecessary for you to go in person?" A red-bearded dwarf raised his head and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elinette’s face immediately stiffened, his eyebrows and beard yelled. As the veteran of Mora, he will soon scream! Can this kind of unseen words actually speak out? Siegel was by his side, put his hand on Elinte's shoulder, and then said to the Dwarf Firehammer Parliament: "Since the Dwarf Kings meeting, Heim and the Federation have repeatedly proposed to the Mullah. Apply. I hope to be able to inspect the situation opposite the crystal wall. It can always be pushed three times. Can you explain to me, if you don't want to cooperate, what do the Dwarf King and Dwarf Saints organize in a meeting without a stone boat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-bearded dwarf hurriedly said: "You misunderstood. It is not open, but the wall barrier is now being attacked. It is very dangerous. We cannot guarantee your life." Safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gently said: "The implication is that when the dwarf can guarantee the safety of others, it will allow others to approach the wall barrier. Hey? This is good news. I don't think it takes a week. The human country and the lords of the world can know the goodwill of the dwarves for others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure lifting The stone licks its own feet. Eileen couldn’t stand it anymore, and said Siegel’s arm: “Don’t talk nonsense with them, I will take you there.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red beard I still want to say something, but I was stunned by the dwarfs beside me, only to make a cry from the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall channel is deep in the middle of the Mora, and needs to pass through the deep and dark mine channel. The damage to the earthquake was everywhere along the way, and many places have collapsed, but fortunately the main body of the mine has not been affected. A team of dwarves are busy, strengthening the support structure here, avoiding chain reactions such as landslides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Irene, the gem family still wants to re-board the ruling class of Mora and reproduce the glory of the three great families?" I asked the voice down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I understand your kindness. Thank you, but no need." Elinte is very firm: "I only hope that the younger generation can grow up well, the dwarf can Peace and safety, the other has no idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK. I listen to you." Siegel patted Elinette's shoulder and took it for him. Dust contaminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Fire Hammer Council came to power, the Heim Collar and the Federation have been in constant friction with Mora. The Firehammer Council has tried every means to obstruct the Federation's exploration of the crystal wall passages, and various reasons have emerged. It is impossible for the Federation to make various requests forever like a beggar, and soon everyone will be drained of patience. Only keep basic business contacts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the population resettlement plan, Heim’s collar has also developed a plan “How to help Elinte become the governor of Mora”, hoping to pass a The series of measures ousted the stubborn Fire Hammer Parliament. But this plan requires Elinte's approval and support. Since he refuses now, Siegel is not forced to force him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another earthquake struck, this time shaking under the head and feet, the entire cave space is like a scorpion, and Siegel and Elint are flying like inside. Scorpion. **The master grabbed Elinette in one hand and took out his wand in the other hand. "The earth element solidifies!" Use the mud to strengthen the stone's spell and rely on the powerful energy of the secret energy core. Siegel isolated the vibrations of the earth and forced the cave to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you go down, the lower the temperature of the cave and the more turbid the air. Dwarfs are not strong in the use of gas, and ventilation has always been a big problem. Siegel felt a bit sullen in his chest, but then he felt a tingling sensation. What can avoid the protective spells on him and make him feel pain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used spells such as magic, vision, and elemental vision were used in succession until they discovered the undead. In the dwarf's cave, the faint negative energy cloud slowly drifts, polluting the dust in the air. It is reasonable to say that some negative energy can not hurt Siegel. But in the negative energy, he found an unknown power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not Siegel, it’s likely that this power will be ignored for a long time. The high sensitivity of the elements and the study of elemental annihilation allowed Siegel to discover anomalous conditions: he perceives that matter produces a similar elemental transformation effect. In the process, some kind of energy fluctuations are released, which has a serious impact on the living body. The efficiency of this transformation is far less than the direct annihilation of the Peruvian nuclear, and not as the destructive power of the dissociated ray. But its advantage is that it lasts for a long time and can spread far away and can still be fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
