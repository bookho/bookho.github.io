			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of the Knox Association, Siegel’s defenses against mind control, charm, hints, and various phantom illusions It has always been a top priority. In addition, he once turned over the head of Wendy Master, so I know very well that once the seed is planted, no matter how small a sentence or a shot, there may be countless embarrassment, which has a huge impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he worked hard to learn Knox’s spell, and thoroughly understood the emotional control matrix such as the tranquility matrix, and then used the knowledge he learned to The body is protected by a layer of protection. He is confident that he can resist the invasion of his own mind, but how did he get rid of it this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at the surrounding environment, it seems to be no different from before, the same rock, the same road, the only change is that the gas element guard around is gone. . Why can there be a master of Faranes in this illusion, there can be Sir Bill and the old captain, but can't let the gas element guard appear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was thinking about the reasons, the fourth group of illusions appeared. Janet holds Isaac in her arms and looks at him a few meters away from the right hand side of Siegel. Janet didn't say anything, but her lips, which were tightly biting, kept trembled, her eyes full of fear and nostalgia. Siegel knows Janet's character, not a particularly terrible thing. She is not like this. I really want to go and take her in my arms and comfort her, but it’s all fake, isn’t it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, but heard that Isaac cried. Just then, Janet screamed and suddenly pointed her finger behind Siegel. The mage's neck turned slightly at an angle and then stopped. He uses the power of the flames to form a fluttering black flame tentacles behind his own—these black flames provide protection if there is danger. Siegel’s eyes stared at Janet and saw the light of the dagger she had drawn from Isaac’s arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion sees that he has no chance, and it becomes a bubble that disappears in front of Siegel. Siegel concentrated on the spiritual feelings, but still did not find any signs of elemental fluctuations. This will last forever, and it will be unclear in the thinking that the time of the outside world will pass, and everything may be out of control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? The ** teacher first recited the spell and liberated the power behind the black flame tentacles. Apply fire to the surroundings. Under the ravages of the flames, most of the stones and soil are broken into black sand, and a small part becomes shiny glass crystals, but neither of them is what Sigel wants. The elements are still not fluctuating abnormally. This shows that the surrounding scenery is real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has the power to pretend to be a ghost in his own mind? Siegel knew that Lear could not do this, otherwise he would have used mental control and then let himself surrender. If there is no way for the former magic god, who else? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s heart was shocked. Is there a direct involvement of divine power? It seems that there is only such a reasonable explanation. This is a higher rule power than legendary spells. And the surrounding elements are not fluctuating. Doesn't it mean that the power outside the element is in the ghost, isn't the power of God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which god is against himself, why not take it directly? When Siegel’s thoughts got up, he noticed that something was wrong. Why do you think so, it is totally unreasonable. The blind man is not always...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hastened to stop his thoughts and avoid important information leaks. It turns out that someone is thinking like this, and wants to have a glimpse of it from my mind! It has been interfering with the way the mage thinks and limiting the way of thinking. Comprehending this, Siegel immediately began to sort out his knowledge and abilities. To find out what is forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the canyon cracked a gap, and the poisonous black smoke erupted and gathered in front of Siegel. Just a few times in the blink of an eye, it has become the appearance of Lear. Lear’s top of the wand had a dangerous red glow, which was placed on the neck of the horsewoman Mana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hand over the dice, Siegel, or she will die." Lear's voice was very calm, as if to state a simple fact. The horsewoman closed her eyes and her face was very calm. She does not seem to want Sigel to be embarrassed. So don't say anything, do nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You threaten me with my knight?" Siegel looked at Lear and said, "You are false, you can't do it at all." Mana can only hurt my mood at most. And I already know who you are! I didn’t expect it at first. But you have more and more flaws, and it’s getting harder and harder to maintain your current state?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to threaten me, you should use a cane against Janet or Isaac's neck instead of Mana." Siegel said: "I wrote a letter to Lear, agreeing on the bottom line of the struggle. However, I have never received a reply. The only one in the world who feels that this thing can be negotiated is myself, so only I will create the illusion of Lear holding Mana. The previous illusion is the most I imagined. Reasonable state, but it is not the most likely situation. When the old captain did not sleep, he always observed whether there was a storm and could not use me. Faranes did not tell me about the gods, even though I really wanted Sir; Sir Bill will not fight without a word, he will warn before the start of the fight - although I think this is stupid; Janet will not put the dagger around Isaac, but I always want to let the son Get the weapon early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the illusion and took a deep breath. The method of breaking the mind control is actually very simple. If it is not the idea that is disturbed, I have already thought of it. He turned his head and turned himself into a state of undead, using the soul fire immune thinking control, and finally re-visited the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas element rune guard is still at his side, circling in place, falling into control because of the dilemma. It’s Siegel that caused it all, but not one, but two Siegels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mirror placed on the leftward road, Siegel’s hand was placed on it. This is not an ordinary mirror, but a deadly enemy mirror, a powerful and rare magical prop. Anyone who is completely reflected in the mirror will be copied and made. The avatar has the same items, abilities and magic as the body, and will always pursue the body and use all means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters Association has such a mirror in their towers. Used to guard against the most dangerous enemies. The cost of making such a mirror is similar to that of the Peruvian nuclear, but the knowledge and spells that are needed are more complicated. The secret nuclear core is completely the application of elemental power, and the mortal enemy mirror needs to be very proficient in time, space and life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history of history, only two or three people were able to create mortal enemy mirrors, and only five or six mirrors were created. Wars and accidents broke the four mirrors. I didn't expect to see one side here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel touched the mirror while turning and made himself. There is no choice to use aggressive spells because he is intelligent. He is very aware of the defensive spells on Siegel. His power is designed according to the anti-aircraft guns and the ultra-high-strength tranquility array. There is no way to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the battle is dragged into the spell, then the mortal enemy mirror will be affected, even directly destroyed by the war. So I chose the mind control, especially he himself knows how the mind control defense spell works in the mind, and also knows how to crack and bypass. And it was Siegel who was controlled by his own avatar, and the whole was in the canyon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that was tampered with was the exposure to the mortal enemy mirror, and then began to influence the way of thinking, avoiding Siegel’s thought of using the undead to change the way out of control. This consumes a lot of energy and causes problems in the illusion. The avatar is involved in the body. I can't pull my hand to release the second magic. He gave orders to let the element rune guards attack the ontology, which in turn caused the gas element to be confused and did not know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-faced scorpion as a high-level artifact will not be copied, so the avatar can not use the plasma energy, and can not use the ability of the elemental polymer. Nowadays, thinking control has failed, so the war between spells begins. The body lifted his hand and the power of the four elements gathered at the tip of his finger. It seems that it seems to be a four-pulse arrow, it is difficult for outsiders to distinguish between true and false, but Siegel can see at a glance that it is just an elemental arrow. But even then. Siegel is also reluctant to make a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the dust of the star back into the sheath, vacated a hand to grab it to the side, and directly grasped the border of the mortal enemy mirror. Although this is a powerful magic item, its size and weight are still the floor-to-ceiling mirror. Siegel lifted it with one hand. Then block in front of yourself as a barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The screaming of the screaming, the blink of an eye disappeared from the front of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the pace of the elves and any door, the avatar appeared behind Siegel, and the imitation star dust pricked to the heart. Siegel used the split mirror as a key, constantly placing it in the direction of the attack. This is no different from taking a hostage as a shield, but it is really helpful for this battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
