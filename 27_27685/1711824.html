			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s plan is simply to hide in the body of the trolls and then drift along the river to Macabu. This seems to be no different from camouflage in the wood, but it differs in some details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll was smashed, and most of the internal organs were thrown into the bag and hidden in the key space. Siegel's dagger can be used to simulate the bite of the bite. After all, the dagger is the tooth. Its main function is the thorn, and its cutting marks are not different from the metal profile dagger. Siegel used a dagger to simulate the cutting of the claws and teeth, then dig the eyeballs and empty the viscera under the protection of the ribs to form a space for hiding. In order to make the wound look more realistic, he also removed one of the trolls' arms from the 80%, leaving only part of the tendon attached to the shoulder and upper arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, he overturned the bonfire to create traces of struggle and struggle. The scammer's dent on the trunk with the head smashed Siegel a lot of trouble, he only need to deal with it simply. Footprints are a bit of a hassle, but there are good Ravens to help. Baron grabbed the pre-engraved mold with his feet and printed a footprint of sufficient depth on the snow with a dive. The raven keeps rising and falling until the trail is drawn to the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel dragged the almost hollowed-out body to the river and then turned into a cavity in the body of the slayer. This is a very disgusting experience, and Siegel can't do it. The line of sight around him is a blood-red body cavity, and many visceral blood clots that have not been cleaned are hung around. Fortunately, there is no sense of smell, otherwise the taste of light will be able to kill Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the eyes of the Raven, Siegel can know the situation around him even in the Ogre. He held the body of the trolls and jumped into the rushing river, twisting his body as much as possible. The water came in from the breach, but the thick fat still allowed the body to float on the water. As the speed increased, Siegel knew that he was facing the first level: the falling waterfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first disguise he needs to make, the so-called must let the orcs find the falling body. When he fell from the waterfall, Siegel lost his ability to balance for a time, and he could only hold himself tightly with the ribs of the trolls. This is similar to being thrown into the air by a stormy sea on a sea boat, but it is more difficult to control. Siegel clenched his teeth and resisted the urge to use the feathers to meet the impact of the impact on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only heard a loud bang, all the bones were shaking, the chin was hit by the spine, and one side had dislocated. If it wasn't for Siegel's quick response, grab the jaw with his hand in time, or he would lose this important bone forever. The other injured part is mainly concentrated in the skull. He can be sure that his head has split a few seams. It is very painful to recover not only time. If it weren't for the trolls that had thick, soft fat as a buffer, Siegel might have been broken into broken bones and couldn't fight anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most of the logging orcs saw this scene, and the horrible body of the eater was washed down by the waterfall, fell into the deep pool, and flew out his arms. . With the ups and downs of the splash, the eater's body floated back on the water and flowed down the river. The orcs don't want to salvage the bodies in this weather—especially not for the slaves who don't care. They looked at the drifting bodies on the bank of the river, only to find the cracks in the belly and the "bite and claw catch" scars all over the body. They immediately raised their vigilance and prevented the same "beast" from attacking again. The captain of the logging orc allowed his youngest and useless man to move downstream and then turned to the logging camp. He needs a new trolline slave and asks to send a patrol to scout around, drive away the beasts, or grab them and eat them together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel hides in the trolls, his surroundings are all cold rivers. Fortunately, it is now a state of paralysis, there is no need to keep warm internal organs, so the cold does not cause too much damage to him. If you keep the human state, you will not be able to wait until you drift to Macabu. From time to time, Siegel can feel that the trolls are constantly colliding with some hard objects, the sound should be the wood floating on the water, and then drifting downstream. In order to save energy, Siegel does not use the Raven's eyes to investigate. The connection between the mage and the magic pet is a kind of soul power, but it will not be detected by the surrounding protective enchantment, and can be used with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has gone all the way to Makarbu, he has felt that his undead identity has been detected by the surrounding detection enchantment, is going through Scanning over and over again. He can roughly distinguish between the spells of these enchantments: detecting magic, detecting undead, and detecting toxins. There are other features besides this, but those spells that Siegel don't know are indistinguishable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it may not be done. After all, the body of the trolls is big and heavy, and there is no use for fishing. Besides, drifting downstream along the river, the orcs who are logging are all on foot, not enough speed to inform the city guard before the arrival of the body, so Siegel will only face the possibility of two interceptions. First, the orc guards guarding the direction of the river, they will first shoot with a chaotic arrow, and do not care about any investigation work, directly tie the trolls into hedgehogs, and even destroy them with the Siegel inside. Siegel naturally does not want such an ending, so he hopes to face the second interception: the orc witch festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t stand the cold river without becoming a cockroach, and how to explain the aura of undead creatures is a problem that must be solved when it is mixed into the city. This solution lies on the orc witch sacrifice. They are able to detect the undead and have enough means to dispel the undead. They are smarter than the average orc, and they are more reasonable when they act. Reasonable means regularity, and regularity means that there are traces to follow and loopholes are available. Siegel waited patiently, and the longer he traveled, the more likely he was to succeed. It is best to drift down like this, and it is the perfect situation to go directly to the waters near the shipyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the orcs will not really let a dead soul enter the city. After feeling the warning of protective enchantment, the Witch Festival wore armor and weapons, took the holy emblem and the implements, and rushed to the river and stood on the first suspension bridge across the banks of the Black River. He sent a wolf cavalry to the vicinity of the logging yard to inquire about the situation, while expanding the line of sight with the help of the enchantment, and far away to observe the drifting body. He could see the torn wound, the broken body, and the broken flesh deposits. There is still a half of the remaining hand. From the current state of cognac, he can guess that the viscera's internal organs have been eaten a lot, leaving only the part protected by the ribs. Such wounds and hunting habits are not uncommon, and with the faint undead aura, the witchcraft judges that only one kind of monster is responsible for this: the ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bite of the wound and the disappearing viscera are the usual means of attack by the ghoul, and the creature killed by the ghoul has a chance to become the second Ghoul alone, which explains why there is an aura of undead creatures on the body of the trolls. In order to deliberately create the characteristics of the ghoul attack, Siegel can only poison the trolls: he needs a complete corpse, except for the tooth-shaped dragon tooth dagger, there can be no other weapons. The incision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse and the undead creature are two different things. The former does not cause any reaction to detect enchantment. I believe that the witch festival can be more sure of the existence of the ghoul after receiving the "eyewitness testimony" of the logging team. The footprints on the snow and the traces of the fight can be used as strong evidence. As for whether it is the result of a deformation spell? I believe that the arm that broke when falling off the waterfall can dispel the worries of the witch festival. Because the limb lost during deformation will not recover when it changes back. The Witches believe that there is no way for the caster to sacrifice his own arm after he becomes a eater of the trolls in order to enter the Makarbu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eater is getting closer and closer, and the witch festival is increasingly convinced of his own guess. He looked at the body that was about to become a ghoul, raised the badge of Gush, and sang the name of the orc god, hoping that God could dispel the wicked undead for his people and guarantee Macabu. Awkward security. A ray of light shines from the sacred emblem and accurately shines on the troll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel only feels that the surroundings have been surrounded by light, and the light that contains the horrible power is like a flame, emitting a hot temperature. His body seems to be melting, and it becomes soft and hot. Siegel knew that the moment to test himself came, and he ordered the blind man to turn himself back into a human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There’s the disappearance of the undead, as if it had been dispelled by the witchcraft. The orc nodded with satisfaction, let his entourage inform the shipyard, and let them send people to salvage the body from the downstream. Near the shipyard, there is a large net for intercepting the wood, and the body of the trolls will be blocked with the wood there. The Witch Festival ordered that the recovered bodies be burned to the place and processed in the simplest way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After changing back to human form is the biggest test for Siegel. Hidden in the belly of the trolls, the remaining air is not much, the cold river still carries his body temperature, the most terrible thing is that he still does not dare to move his limbs, and can not generate heat to fight the cold. In this case, the smell has become a fine detail, and Siegel is concentrating on waiting for a chance to get out of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that this opportunity will appear sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only heard the jingle, the trolls once again hit the floating trunk, this is the moment Siegel waits. He took a deep breath, grabbed the ribs of the trolls with both hands, and slammed it toward one side. It is normal for the body to turn over after being hit by the wood. And because the ogre is missing an arm, this reversal can save a lot of effort, and the orcs will not feel awkward when they look at the river bank - at least there will be no strange scenes in which the body flips over the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
