			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel secretly came to the camp of Elijah Liya. 『≤『≤小『≤说,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a forest that has been transplanted and is located on the vast plain. The golden glow of the Asahi Rising Sun was absorbed by the tall trees, and the dark shadow cast dropped the fields under the canopy. At the foot of the ancient tree of war, a crooked and scary scarecrow still maintains a happy smile, but it has caught the attention of the old trees. It bent down and poked it with bare branches and fingers, and the body made of straw fell down from the shelf and fell into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now winter, and only the elf's spells can transplant trees in this environment. The ancient trees of war continue to carry their own kind with their huge bodies, and complete the work of digging, planting, covering soil and watering. Siegel found that old trees would also be fatigued, and they needed to wander around and be very different from elements, undead or magic images. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to a low hill, where the bare brown ground was covered, and several collapsed tombstones were covered in mud, hidden in sporadic weeds. Among them. Siegel came alone, but there were many people in Lia. In addition to the three ancient war trees, there are two elves in the druid costume, a priest of the Moon Temple and an elf mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long table and two chairs under the tree, one for Siegel and the other for Lia. Fruit baskets and red wine are placed on one side of the table, and Siegel sees grapes, pears, strawberries, etc. that are not part of this season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still six Elf warriors on the ancient tree of war. They hold the longbow in their hands and have the ability to launch attacks at any time. Segal jumped out of Malay and said to the elf with a smile: "It seems that I am very valued. This scene is very grand. I really didn't think of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leah said: "Mystery City has been established for two years, and it has experienced two wars. One of them is facing the coalition of the southern human lords. The dwarf's rune wall is indestructible, and your spell power is also very magical. We are very natural. Pay attention to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of Elf Lia is weird and seems to be helping Wester. To improve the difficulty of siege in the city. No wonder the ancient trees of war have not tested the firmness of the walls, and the original Elijah has already instilled the wrong impressions to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's great, so I will listen more if I say it, and there will be more people reading the material." Siegel said to Leah. : "Do you not introduce these few?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The priest of the moon temple 茜Lagui. Ijour, the two Druids are Alamair. Luo and Querion. Nairo. They are brothers and our mage Rosian Amagir. They are not members of the war tree team, but they are the supervisors of the front line, and they have knowledge and suggestions for what happened on the front line. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel Lord, when do you want to surrender?" Druid Alamir suddenly asked: "You can't fight against the ancient trees of war." And the elf's army. In order to avoid the family's death, you should consider handing over the territory and surrendering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As you said, I am the lord, here is me The territory." Siegel put away a smile and replied solemnly: "If the ancient tree of war wants to step into my wall, it is an invasion. You There is no excuse to cover up, and there will be no more fig leaf. The name of the elf invaders will spread throughout the old and new continents, and will always be worn on your head until the end of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"If the old tree appears in your wall..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel interrupted the words of the priest of the Moon Temple and shook his head and said: "You Want to transfer the old trees? I am not here, magic enchanting and runes are working. The transfer process will be recorded. Your way will also lie to the ignorant lords of the South, don't think about it in Heim. If you use the wizard to open the war, is this the unscrupulous means? Perhaps you think that the title of the aggressor is not loud enough, but also to increase the name of the shameless villain and the liar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "How dare you dare!" The female pastor, Lagrange, took out the sword and pointed to Siegel. Her sword is engraved with many crescent shapes. When she uses a secret language, these crescents will fly away and kill the enemies around them. In addition, her armor enhances the wearer's power, and her bracelet can make the attack more accurate. There is a prayer book with a long chain fixed at her waist. It is also in the magical magic of the invention of the magic of the magic book, what kind of ability, Siegel can not guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"茜拉玫瑰. Igjar. These things you said are not good for today's negotiations." Elijah said: "The Siegel Lord is a rare lord of the New World in the New World, and it is very influential. If If he can take the lead, a lot of things can be solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Ms. Lia." The priest of the Moon Temple calmly receded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a temptation of the elf, but this is too much, and the expression is good. However, considering that the elves have never had such habits and experience in the past. It is indeed difficult for them to make impulsive and sly expressions on their always proud faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stardust re- quieted down, Siegel said to the elf: "I must not surrender now, but I don't want to fight the elves. As for me. I have the ability to fly with my family, and your ancient war trees can't catch me. Heim has strong barriers and advanced magic enchantment, and your offense is bound to cause heavy casualties. But I also know clearly, I It’s hard to stick to it forever.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea said: “Since you know very well, why are you here? For the situation in the whole South, as long as Pulling you out of this, the other lords can only surrender. Perhaps attacking Heim’s collar, a piece of land as large as the city of Mith, and sacrificing the lives of many compatriots is not worth the loss for us, but if it is more conquering One-fifth of the New World?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not a fifth continent, but a one-fifth wall-cage cage." Siegel correction To. "Lea Master, I tell the truth, I know that I can't fight the Elf army, but I also know that you can't deal with the Knox Association. If I am gone now, you will lose to those bald, I don't have nothing? You are now dominant, but you have not yet become a winner. How can I be willing to surrender?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knox will be trapped in Deepwater, they have a hard time "Mr. Rosian's voice is low and full of rhythm, like a drum with a rumbling sound, like always singing with bass." "We can let the Mage Federation keep their towers so that they can be excluded from the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the strategic judgment of who made this Do you want to kill all of your elves?” Siegel said mercilessly. “Do you have an agreement with the Master? Under the premise of launching a sudden attack, I hope the Masters of the Federation believe in you. I have received an invitation from the Federation. I have received an invitation from the Federation to let me go to Deepwater City to defend the Sanfeng Pagoda. If the Masters Federation can not win in the battle, it will not be able to stand on the New World in the future. Leaving a few isolated mage towers, surrounded by elves. Where do they collect apprentices? Simply merge the federation into your Elf Art Institute. Yes, your institute does not accept people from other races."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not insult our two basic IQs as Masters, Mr. Elf!" Siegel said later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elf Lia picked up a pear and handed it to Siegel, then poured herself a glass of red wine. "Let's relax, Siegel. We haven't dealt with this situation for a long time, and everyone is a little uncomfortable." She pointed to the ancient war tree behind her and said to the Master: "The old trees were once on the ground, According to the elf's age, it is more than 20 generations ago. Many records are legends for us. There is no precedent for the current war situation, but you have to admit that our elves really don't want to kill more."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are still consistently proud, they are convinced that the situation has been controlled, so it is possible to calmly negotiate with the local lords. But if you want to take advantage of the pride of the elves and control their ideas, the idea itself is very stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand this. So I came to you." Siegel ate a few pears in his hand and placed the core on the table. "I want to make a deal with your elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't need to trade with you. Admit defeat and then surrender is your only choice." Druid Querion said loudly. He has the hair of the porcupine's backstab, his hands like the talons, and his voice is like a viper. "Don't be obsessed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel's hand in his arms stretched out, except for Leah, several other elves touched the weapon, apparently very alert. However, Siegel took out the space bag and pulled out a reel from it. "This is part of the Knox Association, their spells and part of the background. Maybe your elf executives have begun to pay attention, maybe not. I don't like elves, but I also don't like Knox. If you guys Knox will fight together, I can help you reduce your losses and even win. My request is to keep the entire Heim collar and give me all the spoils of the Sanfeng Pagoda in Deepwater."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
