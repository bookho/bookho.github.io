			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before spending your time, spend some effort. After Siegel determined that the half-plane could be used, it immediately began construction of the entire continent. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cross-continental transmission array as the main road, Siegel consumes divine power and constantly creates one and another transmission matrix base, which is spread to all densely populated areas. Then he forcibly modified the difficulty of the spelling of the teleportation, and used the "fire subsidy" to tear open the spells of the space cracks, so that the transmission array can be further farther, more transmitted, and used more frequently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of the gods fell again and again, and soon there was only a four-fork flame to barely maintain. Siegel also seemed to be ashamed and weak as he was drained. However, this is a superficial phenomenon. Although Siegel is only a weak god, he has not lost much in the face of mortals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen saw the situation of Siegel, and some of them were eager to move. In addition to the Peruvian nuclear, magical spacecraft technology, secondary brain technology and elemental rune guards are all good things he wants. However, Lynch’s gaze was swept from him from time to time, and there was always a kind of pressure to accompany him. The businessman licks his lips, since it is not easy to grab, but no one will refuse to trade - as long as the price is sufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the transmission array throughout the continent, the Magic Temple meeting was held for the second time in two months. This time, Siegel did not have the strength to separate so many saints and noticed that the priests of the temple could only run errands. There are currently only seven people in the pastor group led by Rui, which is far from enough to complete the preparations for the meeting. So Siegel borrowed some messengers from the city of Mire, which made it hard to make up the number of errands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical god’s expression is easy to explain with the magical transmission array that appears everywhere on the mainland, although his power is still very large, but obviously It is much weaker. This time, the representative of the dragon was replaced by the most powerful golden dragon, and there was already a sense of divine power in the body. Its arrival, on the one hand, expressed respect for the meeting of the Magic God, but there is also no lack of demonstration. After all, the last time Siegel forced the Dragons to leave, they were not allowed to evacuate in advance, and they also brought great dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The semi-plane has been found, enough to put down the entire wall of the wall, but it is now empty. I and a few Masters thought of a solution It is to transfer a continent directly into the semi-position.” Siegel looks around the venue: “The New World and the Old World can only choose one. The old continent has the largest population, and the relocation and construction projects are the smallest, but the resources are running out, which is not conducive to the future. Development. The New World is larger than the old mainland and has more resources, but it must be built from scratch. The process of relocation will lead to the accelerated destruction of the world of thunder walls, so you can only choose one. At the same time, I have to pay enough power. Avoid destroying the storm and contaminating the new half-plane, so you still need to change your faith, at least temporarily push my power to the limit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel closed his eyes and fell silent. Everyone thought that he still had something to say, so no one spoke up, just looking at the magic god, and then exchanged their eyes. After two minutes, Siegel was "awake" and took a deep breath and opened his eyes: "Hey, have you unified your opinion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp His unusual fatigue fell into Lynch's eyes and caught his attention. In truth, the weakening of the fire does not mean that the body is weak. Siegel should be a powerful legendary mage. How can it become so sleepy? He left the venue thoughtfully, perhaps summoning several foreign powers to ask if there were similar "cases" in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who originally lived in the New World certainly want to send the New World, with the dragon and the dwarf being the most determined. The mountains of the Old World dwarves are almost hollowed out. They have long wanted to move to the walled mountains as a whole. This is a good opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are undecided, no matter how they choose to move their jobs. Let the remaining war trees stand in their homes and pass through the portal. As the elves gather together, the work will be relatively concentrated and will not take too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only humans are the most widely distributed, spreading all over the old continent. The work of organizing and coordinating is very arduous, and the kingdom of stars has been unable to do anything. "Magic god, land is more important than population, life is priceless. Which method can save more people, which method is the best. My opinion is to carry the East China." The tone of the text is very firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The half-plane will be a closed space, and the resources of the Old World will soon be exhausted. Are you humans ready to return to the primitive society of the past? "Golden dragon Mimi eyes, gently shook his head: "According to the speed of human reproduction, as long as the resources are sufficient, the number will soon recover. On the contrary, the resources of manufacturing tools are lost, your physique is difficult to survive, but the number is instead Will fall. The king of mankind, you must consider it clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world of thunder walls can only be relocated once, so the two continents can only choose one side. But the world of goblin? Can't you move from there once again to get enough land, ore and other resources?" The dwarf still remembers the earth. That place is full of fine gold and secret silver. They have already excavated a large number of mines on the earth and are prepared to prepare for the migratory population. It seems that all of them are now dry, but they still took the opportunity to harvest countless good ores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power to relocate a continent is enormous, even if it is a god, it takes a long break. Before that, the world of the thunder wall is finished, destroying the storm. The spread of the crystal wall channel will also destroy the goblin world. So it should be too late." Siegel thought and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you break the wall channel? Can't you keep the goblin world?" The dwarf still doesn't give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will make your power instantly fall to a low point, even weaker than it is now. Siegel looked at the dwarf. He wanted to reject his proposal. But honestly, he said the truth: "If my fire can not be lost when moving to the mainland, that is, no accident can happen." At that time, it is still possible to leave enough power to break the wall channel and save at least one world. But then, the power of magic will be greatly impaired, and you will face no magic in the New World and lack of arcane. The situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most races are worried, only the orcs are sneaking around. He touched his own fangs and took the opportunity to cover his smile with his hands. He had already begun to figure out how to use force to expand the site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." The halfling said: "Isn’t Heim’s collar in the New World? Where have you been to the Old World?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The territory of the East Continent has been largely divided, and there are no large areas to meet the "immigration." The Heim's collar, which was built and developed by the magic god, has the elves of the ancient war tree, the dwarves of the Mora, and the dragon. They don't have a good temptation. Where are they going to return to the East China? The elves and dwarves also have their hometowns, and the human kingdom is still there. However, the original residence of the dragon has long been occupied by other races, and the return of the dragon is bound to trigger a chain reaction. In the absence of magic and arcane help, the dragon will once again rule the earth, which is no doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, even if the magic god Siegel completed the planned plan and retained the goblin world, the mining there is still difficult, and the dust is still there. This time, there is no spell to protect the escort. In other words, the goblin world looks very good, but in fact it is like a castle in the air, it can not be expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this matter, I want to fully respect your opinions, so I convened this meeting. No matter what method I choose, I will do my best to help. Everyone. But time is limited, and the noon after two days gives me an accurate answer. After all, there is still a lot of work to be prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood up and left The meeting room, leaving only the magic statue Reid coordinated at the venue. Moore and Nata had long waited in the corridor, blocking Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, what's the matter? I know you've been looking for me, but I've been doing nothing." Siegel had a relaxed smile on his face. It is very different from the conference room. Moore is the lord he personally taught, and it is largely different from his son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leading...the magical god, I want to know about the twelve-faced scorpion. Is this thing a blessing or a curse, how should we control it?" The tower asked directly: "I lost my nephew when I was young, but then it always came back to me inexplicably. It was very novel at the time, but now I think it is terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Every time you find your nephew, is it that someone around you will be unlucky and suffer all kinds of misfortunes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nata widened his eyes : "Yes, how do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blind man has his own ideas, only the holder can control. The last generation of magic god Lear, gave up The gods came to study the scorpion, and then the scorpion returned to the master's hand, he naturally suffered a counterattack. If not, how can I get through his eyes and achieve the ultimate victory?" Siegel said: "The scorpion is with you. One, it won't hurt you, you can rest assured that this is how you use it. I am groping myself. I haven’t even figured out my own nephew. How can I give you some points? But there is a little bit of advice, don’t destroy the happiness you have gained in pursuit of power, then you will end up.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
