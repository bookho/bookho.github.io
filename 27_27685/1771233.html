			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of the fist castle is open, six knights guard their lords to greet at the gate, and the messenger sent by Mana, also the scout of the Knights of Lyon Followed by standing aside, smiling at Mana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyon’s hand lays a safe gesture on the thigh. When I see this time, the horsewoman is relieved. After finishing the clothes, the crowd goes up. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not convenient to expose his identity, and it is not good to dress up as a knight, so he left invisible. He personally went to scout the nearby elves and the ancient trees of war, hoping to gain something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fist castle can only be regarded as a small castle in the entire castle defense chain. According to the information collected by Fitzk, there are less than ten knights and the same The knight attendant, plus more than a dozen servants live. Usually no one cares about this, because there is no production, and there is no entertainment. Sometimes their lives are not even comparable to the orcs, and even the knights need to cultivate and hunt themselves to make a living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the actual situation is worse than the description in Fitzker’s intelligence. Mana understood it after careful observation. Although the opponent's lord rode a charcoal black horse, the variety should be the best horse, but the maintenance is really bad. The armor is from the hands of famous people. Whether it is texture, workmanship or defensive ability, it is considered to be the best, but it does not fit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armor can be passed down from generation to generation, but each generation of masters should find the right armor and craftsman to make changes according to their size. Is this castle even a qualified craftsman who can adjust the armor belt? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana hopes to let Heim’s trade route pass through the castle, and the fist castle has long been looking forward to this day, and the two sides have even completed the negotiations without even starting to chill. . The only trouble is the road that the Cavaliers can't do when they come, but both sides agree to send artisans to refurbish, at least to build a ramp that allows the trucks to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravan has always been on the ore boulevard, following the trend of the foothills of the walled mountains. But now there are elves patrolling the road. The ore boulevard is unobstructed and not safe enough. The elves are not addicted to killing, so the merchants are not afraid of losing their lives. But all the goods were confiscated and then locked into the cell by the elf. No businessman likes this result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wall Mountain Range is a dwarf, and the road to the castle's defensive chain is handed over to the human by the dwarves. The elf has not yet entered the city wall, so the road on the hillside is temporarily safe. Nor is it that no clever businessman wants to take this path, but in their capacity it is impossible to absorb all the profits through the castles and gates of so many lords. Only Siegel, who is also a lord, is qualified to talk to the lords, coordinate and distribute the interests of all, and Heim’s recent victory in two wars has added to him the right to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Half-mountain Road" was thus opened up, starting from the Heim collar and ending at the fist. Originally Mana wanted to continue eastward until the Bird's Nest City of the White Bird family. But after hearing that there was a passage in the middle of the road leading to the need to cross the rift, and only relying on the rope bridge, the idea was temporarily dispelled. It is not easy to build a stone bridge that can pass a carriage, and to see the meaning of the fist lord, he would rather not repair the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The road from me down the mountain is not difficult." He said: "And the road is hidden in the mountains, the elves will not pay attention." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked at the map, a long river flowing from the vicinity of the fist castle, always east, after entering the main stream, you can reach the deep water city. River transport is also a good choice, fast and carrying a large amount. Although Siegel has not yet provided support to Deepwater City, at least until the Knox Association was destroyed, it will not be an option in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not stay in the fist for too long. Even the enthusiasm of the lord cannot be retained. Mana still remembers her own tasks, so she used the excuse to look at the situation in the northern grasslands and hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The caravan will come soon. This business route will soon be operational." Mana’s words will make the lord excited. "I don't think there will be many at first, but it will gradually change afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely no problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The road down the mountain is as concealed and easy as they say. With the cover of the mountain, it is difficult to see this road from the plain. When Mana meets with Siegel at the foot of the mountain, the lord of Heim is sitting on a stump and quietly watching the book in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything follows your instructions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK. I think you have been curious for a long time, always wondering what weapons to test this time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took some crossbows from the space bag first. Give the knights. Unlike ordinary sacral arches, the new crossbow's wrench for winding is placed underneath the body, causing the center of gravity to sag somewhat. You need to adjust your hand to get used to aiming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They tried to move it. The new lever wrench, except for a lighter one, didn’t change too well. This kind of lower crossbow is not a new invention. What can be kept secret? As for the Cavaliers to take poison to try it out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is not an idiot, knowing that the lord must have the following. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Siegel took out the dark red ammunition and buckled it on the cross with one hand. The ammunition can move back and forth, and it can adapt to various types of body lengths. The magic array above can also determine when to push the sputum into the shooting slot. Then Siegel held the hand and moved the lever. The string was tightened, and the cockroach fell, and you heard a bang, and the shooting was ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flattened the crossbow, took a few steps, aimed at the stump that had just been seated, and then pressed the trigger. Just listening to the bang, 弩 没 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入 入<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power is not bad, Lord Lord." The knights said with a bit of compliment and flattering. Being able to penetrate the stumps like this can already pierce some of the thinner plates and pose a threat to the people inside. A slightly weaker chain and inlaid leather armor will definitely penetrate. In the case of one-handedly, this is a very good power. But according to the knights' assumptions, the power of this scorpion is not worthy of the public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t worry, take a look." Siegel pointed to the stump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took less than a minute. The power of the 弩 中 电 电 电 , , , , , , , 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电 电quickly. The stakes ignited from the inside out and slowly turned into a pile of burning bonfires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The effect of dealing with trees is basically the same. If you shoot on a person, the power is not much better." Siegel said: "I originally wanted to increase Power, but considering that the elves are relatively thin, if they are shot, they will not have the effect of internal combustion, and they will increase the cost of the sputum itself, so it is now the case."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights widened their eyes and looked at each other, and then said in unison: "The Lord, this is already very powerful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaking his head and shouting his head, he said: "The current tree that shoots into the trees. With the big fingers of the ancient trees of the war can not catch, can not pull out, so the burning can not be stopped. But the elves can help if they have time. The power of the pulled out is reduced by at least 90%. I haven’t solved the problem that the elf can pull it by hand. I suggest that I use the retractable barb, which will be hooked when I pull it out, at least it can expand the killing. I have not agreed yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nana quickly waved his hand and said palely: "Without consent, it is already ferocious!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too." Smiled. "This bow is taken to Zucker. I don't think he is a half-orc. The brain is actually not stupid. He came up with a new way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel held the squat right, and the left arm stretched forward, posing the action of grasping the reins. He then swept the bow from above the left arm. With the left arm blocking the wrench, the right hand pushes hard to complete the winding. The bow slammed and slammed, and Siegel raised his hand and shot, then continued the winding, shooting again, and repeating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The current ammunition can put four sputum inside, after the shooting, you must hold the cymbal right, and the left hand to replace the magazine. Mike said he can try I can't change the magazine with one hand. But there is no way at the moment.” Siegel demonstrated how to replace it, and then said: “This magazine is a magic item. Don’t throw it away, you can take it back and you can take it back.弩矢. But the ordinary 弩矢 did not hurt the burning of the ancient trees of war.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who are stunned and have no idea what language to use for comment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
