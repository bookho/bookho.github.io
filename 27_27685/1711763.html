			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack reached out and hid the wallet. Siegel took out another ruby, about the size of a nail, and gave it to Jack. He said: "If you are in danger, it is most important to keep your life. It is nothing to give money out. This gem is also for you, and you will live well after you return home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Jennis came back and ran out of breath. When he came in, he began to breathe a few mouthfuls and then said: "I asked, there is no caravan to the south. The last one left about two days ago, the gorge is going."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there no departure in two days?" Siegel asked <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenice took a few deep breaths Shake his head and said: "There are very few shipments in Deepwater City recently, and no seagoing ships arrive, so the caravans can't get together. I figured out how to wait for half a month before there will be a good caravan." There is still a foot trader, but there is no security."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a request." Jack looked around, and then quite embarrassed to say: "I can ride a horse, can you give me a horse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know this kid is so ignorant..." When Janis’s words were not finished, he was Siegel reached out and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "OK, no problem, Janis helped me bring the horse over." Siegel shook his head and said slowly: "If I have a chance again Going to the old captain, just like this little brother can go to find his father, that would be great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack’s eyes with tears, nodded hard : "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fangs brought a horse, which they had just prepared a few days ago. This horse is very quiet and very tame, and is suitable for long trips. Janis was upset, but he only expressed it on his face, staring at Jack with a look of scary eyes, but still handed the reins to the boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's get on the road." Siegel said: "You are going south along the Gorge Avenue, if you can catch up with the caravan, then Follow them, so that you will be safer when you meet the beast. You have also seen the slave trader and survived from a dangerous place. I believe you can take care of yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack nodded and rode on the horse to leave. However, he only ran a few steps away and stopped to look back and forth. He saw that Siegel had turned his head and went back to the house. He was busy with his own business, and no one stopped it, so he rode back again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door himself, slipped through the living room, saw Siegel in the backyard, stretched his limbs, and prepared to exercise. Jack knocked on the doorframe and walked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, why are you coming back? Is there anything else?" Siegel asked doubtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you want a translation to the north, in fact, I also know the savage language, and the orc language." Jack replied: "In fact, I will be much better." Language. I have been sensitive to language since I was a child, and I have been able to learn their words for a long time. I used to get along with the savage slaves from the north and learned a lot of tribes. I can help you, but I will not Write."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you are really good." Siegel said: "But you should still go to your father instead of following me to the north to take risks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can take care of myself and will not drag you down. And, I want to help you, I owe you your favor."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't owe me, just owe me safe home." Siegel shook his head and his eyes softened, explaining: "I don't know my parents are Who, but I know that I still have the feeling of being a loved one, and I am more aware of the sorrow of being alone, so you should go home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;Jake came forward and reached for Siegel’s cheek, then squeezed and gave a sigh of relief. Siegel was unclear. He only felt that his face hurt. He opened Jack's hand and said, "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You wait for me, Let me think about it.” Jack looked a little embarrassed, his eyes filled with hesitation and anxiety. He said: "I will borrow your toilet first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened, how did he come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I always feel that some gods are mysterious." Siegel scratched his head. The spreader said: "Maybe he was sold by a slave trader, and his spirit is always very tense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor child. Originally a good person, But I experienced such terrible sufferings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have seen slaves being trafficked, on the slave ship of the orcs, just like the scenery of hell." Every time Geer remembered it, he was still worried. "There was once a man who was tortured and mad. After being rescued, he took it to the sea when he took the deck. He couldn’t stop it. He thought we were all slave traders, and couldn’t listen to anything. At that time, it was still in the sea. There are wounds on his body, and sharks are drawn in the water. We can't catch up with a few sailors swimming, only to watch him finally being killed by sharks. But even if he died in the shark's mouth, he actually Still laughing, shouting that he is free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s terrible." Ms. Linda sighed and sighed: "Hey, I still go see Look at Jack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the floor was lightly footsteps, it is estimated that Jack is down. Ms. Linda turned back to the house and suddenly screamed and heard the sound of her falling on the floor. Siegel rushed in and found a person he had never seen before standing on the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl with short red hair is wearing Jack’s clothes, her face is good, and Jack is very similar, but with two short pointed corners on her head. The pupil is also dark red like hair. A thin, long tail swayed from behind, as if he was very dissatisfied because he was tied by a belt. She reached out and went to help Ms. Linda. Just after seeing Siegel, her movements stagnated and her face was very scared, like a child who had done something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a demon, although she does not know the specific blood heritage, but in all, she has the blood of the race of evil creatures. Many people think that the demon is the kind that the devil tempted after the mortal, but Siegel's knowledge tells him that it is only a long time ago. The Hell Devil injected the essence of the Mozu into the blood of the mortal, polluting and transforming the demon. The demon king integrates blackmail, hypocrisy and cruelty into this blood, so that it becomes the vanguard of conquest of the mortal world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance and character of the demons are not their fault, and many demons are trying to resist the evil nature of the blood, but the biggest difficulty is against the general public. The perception of them. Regardless of what they do, they are labeled as suspected, and are considered to be thieves, scammers, villains, and carriers of bad luck. After a long period of dealing with this distrust, most of the devils succumbed or indulged the evil factors in their blood and fell into hell creatures. A few of the devils who are still insisting will use various means to disguise themselves and protect themselves from being prejudiced. But as long as this prejudice still exists for one day, no matter where they are, they are actually being hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Siegel, I promise that this is not my fault." Jack said quickly: "This is what I really look like. I usually use the ability to change." Look and gender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand that Ms. Linda is just a startle, nothing." Siegel raised the housekeeper and moved her to on the chair. Jack rushed to pick up the glass of water and then stood nervously in the corner of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you are a demon, I noticed." Siegel looked so pitiful to her, and quickly comforted: "Reassured, I am not a fool. I know the origin of the demon. You don't have to worry about me if you don't do bad things. But I can't guarantee that you can stop the hostility and prejudice of people outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, okay." Jack said: "My name is not Jack, but Janet. Everyone calls me Jack to save trouble. I also have a nickname called a kitten. My father is also a devil. Descent, but his appearance is basically the same as that of human beings, except that the skin is a little red. I don't want to go back now, let me stay by your side? I can't easily meet an unbiased good person."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you think about it, you can stay." Siegel didn't hesitate, and promised: "Although I know this is not fair to you, but usually you still I want to hide the magical features. Don't think too much, I am actually doing this now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? I didn't find the smell of a demon on you? How did you do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a demon, but I have never met anyone who has the same characteristics as me. I am black and black, and now the brown hair is dyed. In fact, many people also treat me. Asking the East to ask the West, the original simple curiosity will bring no trouble. So we are all people who change their appearance, this is even."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
