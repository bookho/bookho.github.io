			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out a blue space bag inlaid with gold wire, and in the eyes of the public, took out a plasma ammunition. He hooked it with a flexible finger, took out a sputum inside, and placed it on his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" said Sir Brown: "The thing will burn soon after it is taken out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You are right," Siegel said. The sag broke and melted, but the plasma slid away from his fingers like a docile stream, smashing onto the floor, splashing a spark of stars. There is no smoke, no fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lords looked at Siegel with suspicious eyes, and did not understand why he was wasting such a shackle. Since the advent of such weapons, prices have remained high, making all the lords purse painful. However, the effect of Sui Ya on the battlefield is indeed very strong, and it is worth the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s action was given to the consultants of the school city. Only the same as the caster can understand the difficulty of controlling the violent plasma. In fact, the spells spelled in the ammunition itself are not so high, and all the casters who can make magic equipment can produce qualified products. It's just that this huge amount is surprising. Smart school consultants can't help but wonder if Sigel has some kind of contact with other world law enforcement organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plasma 弩矢 is certainly not manufactured by the Masters Association and the City of Education. The original suspected confederation currently seems to be basically ruled out. In addition to Siegel, only the dwarves of Mora on the New World have such production capacity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not long ago, I led the troops to a deep water city." Siegel’s words were like casting a stone on a calm lake. Most people Shocked eyes looked at him. Only a few people seem to be mentally prepared, either with no change in their eyes or a surprised expression. "Deepwater City has been attacked by elves, the Mage Federation has been destroyed, and the entire city has been looted by nomadic soldiers on the prairie. There is basically nothing left. The only thing fortunate is that the huge wealth of Deepwater City meets the nomadic tribes. Greedy, so there is no endgame of the massacre."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found a batch of plasma from the Three Peaks Tower, the headquarters of the Masters Federation. I am afraid this is the last batch. As a mage, I already know how to make this kind of weapon. The only problem is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Geer opened his hand and placed it on the table in front of him. He said to everyone: "I only have two hands, and it is impossible to satisfy the needs of the whole South.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of this sentence is: Only the closest ally can get the plasma, others can only say sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown Baron smiled and said to Siegel: "It’s a great thing that the Lord’s adult can make it. It’s better than completely out of stock. As far as I know, only 弩矢 is a consumable item. Can this ammunition be reusable? And 弩矢 is not a magic item. As long as it can have a plasma formula, it can be made through a blacksmith shop.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a smart guy, or he has followed the advice of a smart person. “Yes, it’s much simpler, and you don’t want the ammunition to do so. You don’t know who has the formula for the plasma?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is something that can't be said on the table. Both Brown and Dray understand that only the exchange of interests can make Siegel take what they want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Uther said: "As the best wise man in the South, I don't think this formula can't beat you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel used the off-camera to shoot the son's arm, a very familiar and excited look, haha ​​laughed: "Of course! This thing is hard to beat me! But it is the root , is not a thousand troops!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼. When the army was in full swing, it was only the name of the "One-Day War" victory. Drey Uther has never seen Siegel, and always tries to overestimate him, but he is repeatedly convinced by his endless means. I heard the news from the school counselor a few days ago. Heim secretly sent troops to Deepwater City, around the entire continent, avoiding all the elves' army, first fighting the orcs, and slashing at the most vulnerable time in Deepwater, which he thought he could not do. Viscount Uther, who is a self-contained person, believes that Siegel’s rushing into Deepwater City will surely yield a lot of benefits. But what did he get? unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cavalry! Thousands of cavalry. Really Uther. He originally had the best cavalry in the South, but suffered heavy losses in the first "day war." He looked at the smug Siegel, who was shot with a painful arm and smiled. The seemingly young lord smiled too madly, but only he knew that Siegel did have a mad capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we ship the empty ammunition to the Heim collar, don't know how much Siegel Lord can provide? What price?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if you are unwilling, you can also lick this knife. The lords of the South stared at Siegel's lips, afraid to hear terrible news from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the youngest among the various lords in the South, and it has not been three years until now." Siegel said: "In addition to playing a few Oh, I don’t have any contacts with adults. It’s better. Since Viscount Uther proposed to form a coalition of southern lords, as long as there is no opinion on this matter, I will contribute to the method of copying my research. As a gift for the establishment of the alliance, how do you see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel threw a reel on the table. The apricot-colored parchment is full of text, carefully tied with a black string, and the seal of the nine-claw squid is used as a badge. The scroll twitched twice and stopped in the middle of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of the Master still keeps a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the root! Sir Brown did not think maliciously. He raised more than 20 hounds in the castle, and it was the posture and look when feeding food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hounds are going to use the caught prey for their usual bones. I don’t know what Siegel wants the dogs to do? Although I was struggling to get to the advisory mage of the school, I still seem to have a gap with the sergeant Siegel who became the lord. They did not expect this practice of Siegel, resulting in constant loss of initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Baron Siegel, in the South, can there be alchemists in the castles of several lords?" Brown frowned and said: "Let me come Say, after opening the scroll. It knows me, I definitely don't know it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meat bone that can't eat, the attraction will be greatly reduced . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a gift<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. It’s never an excuse to shirk responsibility. Ammunition, I am willing to install plasma for you. There are only two points: this is not free. Everyone has to meet the needs of his territory to provide it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hardware? Why don't you grab it?" There was a lord who didn't know where to come out and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, very sincere expression: "This is really not as good as robbery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Uther pressed his hands down: "In the war, weapons and armor will be more expensive than usual, let alone this kind of weapon. But as you mean, Heim is not responsible for transportation. Others need to bring After the ammunition, go to the city of Mire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Siegel said: "I am only a lord, only have rights in my own territory. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heim is in the far north, and many territories need to cross the control areas of multiple elves to reach. All the way is dangerous."<br />< Syler nodded and agreed: "This is indeed a fact. But since everyone has to fight the elves northward, they will always pass through Heim, not too far away." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Uther snorted, his mouth slammed, and took a corner cup to drink a hot drink of spices. Heim is on the north side of all the southern lords and has always been the front line against the elves. Although I don't know how Siegel reached an armistice agreement with the elves, since it is now officially engaged, then Heim's collar is undoubtedly under the greatest pressure. All elves will come from the north, in the best condition and in armor; even if the elves are repelled. It will also go from the north, and the land that Heim leads must be at least two times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone is an aristocrat who speaks honor and has an oath. Naturally, he must unite. Facing difficulties together." Viscount Uther shook his fingers from behind. The school counselor had to pass a roll of paper and handed it to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
