			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain continued until the middle of the night before it weakened into a patter of light rain. The elf only needs 4 hours of sleep a day, so Leah has finished the break at this time and left the tent. The moon can only cast a faint light behind the layers of dark clouds. The elves stand in this moonlight, combing and caring for the horses, and sorting out the trucks that are wet by the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a change from the field, accompanied by the sound of countless small animals crawling. The elf was alert, and she slammed the tent and woke up the Siegel inside. At the same time, take out the longbow and stand by at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What surprised her was that these abnormal sounds did not cause the war horse to be alert, and the two donkeys were also eating leisurely. In general, these herbivores will have a keen sense, especially a premonition to danger. 'what happened? Leah narrowed her eyes and saw the wheat straw in the wheat field swaying slightly. It was only guessed that animals had drilled from below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel jumped out of the tent with a long whip, and he didn’t even wear the armor. The young man looked around nervously, but did not find any abnormality, so he asked: "Master Lia, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Don't Sound," the elf said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were carefully guarded by the tent and waiting. After a while, nothing happened. Even Leah can't feel the sound of those animals crawling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the elf said: "It may be my illusion, nothing, go back and sleep for a while."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Siegel be more sleepy at this time? He put down his arms, put on his clothes again, and started to work. They tied a lot of firewood with canvas under the truck, and they were not wet by the rain. Now they can just take it down and cook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's taste is more picky, only rice porridge can be prepared for her - add a little apple, sprinkle with a few vanilla leaves, right as a simple breakfast . After this, Siegel used some of the remaining rice porridge to simmer some minced meat with the pickles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When eating these things, Siegel is full of stories that Sir Bill has said. “The reception of the dwarves is the best. Every day there is a large barbeque and a cool beer. The meat is skewed with a big iron sign. The iron sign is full of your thumb and the meat is as big as the fist. The dwarf will The meat hangs on the magma, and the hot high temperature quickly bakes the surface of the cooked meat, pushing all the aromas inward, and the inside is still raw. The beer is brewed with the seasonal oats and the earth's ice springs, just eliminating the magma. The heat of the summer. I will never forget the taste!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever I think of this, Siegel is full of embarrassment, and I can’t go to Mora immediately. Hey. The tallest snow-capped mountain still stands on the horizon and can be seen every day. They approached it day after day, but it is estimated that it will take another month to arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, along with this kind of imagination, breakfast is a lot better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderstorms, the air is fresh, so that everyone's heart and lungs are happy, so the two decided to take a good mood ahead of the road. Siegel came to the tower with a tent and shouted a few times, but no dwarf took care of him. The young people did not think much, thinking that they might be too young and the other party did not pay attention to it. He pressed the tent with stones, placed it under the tower, and then turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Lia went to a wheat field to see where the change occurred last night. She smelled a pungent smell, and some wheat straw had blackened marks. Heavy rain poured down the soil and destroyed many traces, so in addition to finding some tiny footprints like mice, even Leah is the forester elite can not find more clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘What the hell is it? She has been thinking about this problem, so when Siegel came back, she did not ask the dwarf, but only indicated that she could start on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They learned the lesson this afternoon and stopped in a village called Scarecrow in the afternoon. They met here a team that had just left Moura and was about to travel to the hub of the hub. Their vans are filled with dwarf babies: large barrels of spirits, corners of underground creatures, refined steel ingots, combustion and explosive powders, and a few exquisite armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beautiful lady, it’s lucky to see you." The head of the caravan was a passionate self-satisfaction, and soon he said, " Where are you from? Can you tell me what is going on in front of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how Lia talks to people in this caravan, or simply because her charm is too high. In the evening, the caravan invited the two to dine together and talked about the things on the top of the Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, madam, if possible, I don’t really want to leave the top of Mora at this time." The man almost knows everything: "The dwarves Coming to the New World, starting with the first hammer at the top of Mora, it will be 674 years old. I don't know why they celebrate this number, but I know that this celebration will be unprecedented. The dwarves take A lot of good things have been made, and the festival supplies are purchased. They will also launch a series of forging, competition and wine tasting competitions to pay tribute to the patron saint of the dwarf. It will be a rare sight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you stay and see that?" Siegel asked <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still have to support my family, Young man." The man said with a smile: "When you have a son and three daughters, you can't travel as freely as you do now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I can't think of that now." Siegel replied: "The old captain made me try to be a knight. I hope that I will become a real aristocrat, saying that I can get ahead. Although I don't know what it feels like to be in the head, I just need to train hard now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Becoming a knight? Or a day to award a honour. It is a good idea, young man. When you become a nobleman one day, don't forget our poor people. If you can collect less road tax, I will I want to sing and praise you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can assure you this. I also hate those tax collections." Siegel said: "Our big ship When I enter Hong Kong, I have to pay a tax of 100 gold coins each time. God, I have to earn so much on the ship for ten years. Fortunately, I am taking risks now, and I have no such expenses."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are also city gate taxes, accommodation taxes, bridge taxes, and even garbage manufacturing taxes. Have you been harassed by the tax collector of the lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a knight who followed the jazz master." Dao: "And now with me, the elves will not pay taxes to humans. We can't understand this kind of behavior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the caravan laughed: "Let us cheer for the tax-free lords!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rush of hoofs sounded from outside the village, accompanied by the squeaking of metal armor. Several people looked out and found that there were twenty fully armed dwarf warriors riding a violent dog (a huge and strong hound dog) from the direction of the hub. They stopped in front of the caravan and looked like they were heavily guarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several violent dogs stretched their noses, sniffed hard, and screamed loudly at Siegel and Lia. The dwarves either took out the warhammer or grabbed the flying axe and surrounded the two. Three dwarves jumped out of the big dog, raised the shield, and pulled the chain from the other hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you are suspected of attacking the sentry, you have been arrested." A dwarf with an extremely thick eyebrow and beard, completely covering his expression, announced loudly: "Don't forget to resist We are very happy to use force!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the caravan heard the words and immediately stepped back, they would never blend into this kind of thing. Siegel was a little worried and didn't understand what was going on. The dwarves were surrounded by weapons, and they were all well-edged and sharp weapons from the hands of the Dwarf Blacksmith Master. There is no way for two people to squat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A caged prisoner became the current residence of Siegel, with his hands and feet tied to the shackles and the other end holding the stone ball. The cage was small and short and could only be bent over and sitting inside. The prisoner was pulled by two big dogs, and there were four alert dwarf warriors guarding around. He saw that Elf Lia was in the same car in the same car. The two people are far apart and communication is forbidden. Fortunately, the dwarves did not abuse the prisoners' habits, so as long as they don't try to escape, they are always in the cage, and the dwarves are still very easy to get along with. The dwarf who had to be thick was called "Gerard-Bou Pack" and he was the captain of the dwarf team. Except for him, all other dwarves are not allowed to talk to two prisoners, only the captain has the right to deal with prisoners. This includes distributing food and water, determining where to rest, and arranging toilets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf confiscated all the things of two people, and they naturally discovered the elf weapon of Leah. Also as a forging hand, the dwarves were able to tell that these weapons came from Xinlin and were distributed to border patrols, which caught Gerald's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
