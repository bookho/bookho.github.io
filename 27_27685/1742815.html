			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel keeps in mind the advice given to him by his bachelor Francis: "Since you are a lord, shelter your people and your territory." The Federation of Masters, then it is necessary to think from a perspective of the lord, no longer an adventurer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing about the Knights of Freedom Siegel immediately began to think about what the real purpose of these excited aristocratic descendants was. The ransom of five hundred gold coins is too high for a lord's servant and a grocery store owner, but for a gold mine lord, it is just at his psychological bottom line. The Freedom Knights cannot be regarded as robbers such as goblins, at least they should face up to the fact that they have normal intelligence. Siegel thought about it for a moment and thought that they wanted to use the method of adjusting the tiger to leave the mountain to earn a bigger profit - the zebra mountain gold mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these people have been observing Hemqiu in secret, and even dressed up as ordinary businessmen to come in for scouting. Before the castle was built, the site of Heimqi was not very resistant to the bandits that were looted by the horses. At most, it was only self-protection. It was too difficult to chase. Moreover, the local lord is only a "hair boy", and the youthfulness is a common feature of this age. The Freedom Knights believe that as long as the provocation, the Lord of Heimchu will lead the troops to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the first "crisis" encountered in the local area. I believe that the lord will not sit idly by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, as they expected, the young lord took the most elite soldiers to the abandoned mine, leaving behind fewer than 20 guards, including Part of it is also to protect the lady of the Lord who is in the tent. However, the lord here is not too stupid, ordering the beautiful female "Knight" under his hand to concentrate all the production of the mine to the castle area, first placed in the cellar where the pit was dug, and handed over to the three half-orc warriors day and night. . This is actually expected in the "Laughter" Turner, they have already done the corresponding countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day after the lord took the troops away, the Freedom Knights put the horseshoe on the cloth, stuffed the chews in the mouth, and quietly approached Mine. They wrapped themselves in black clothes and tried to be unobtrusive. In the other direction of the miners' rest area, horseback riding bandits throw torches and lamp oil. The truck was lit and the thatched house was led. The sound of "fire fighting!" everywhere, the whole construction site became chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner called in the half-baked orc language: "All go to the fire, the kitchen is burned!" In fact, he wants to say the warehouse where the food is stored. However, the vocabulary of the orc language he had mastered was insufficient and he had to change into a kitchen. Under his gaze, three half-orc guards wearing scales, shields, scimitars and shots glanced at each other, then turned away from the post and headed for the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no guard at the base of the castle. The people of the Freedom Knights are very excited. They threw the torch into the bottom of the cellar and saw three small boxes with the light of the flame. Several bandits couldn't help but get excited and rushed to the side of the box and opened it with a crowbar. The yellow gold and orange pieces are piled in the box, radiating the temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the robbers picked up the gold bars, felt the heavy weight, and then clenched his fists with excitement. He managed to restrain the urge to yell and yell, just waving his arms so that the people above could see their gains. The weight of the three boxes is amazing, and each one needs three people to carry them. Can move forward steadily. So there are a few "Knights" who jump into the pit and laboriously lift the spoils up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only six people left in the pit, and their eyes are focused on the good gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner is very proud and proud of his intelligence. These three boxes of gold are enough for them to spend more than a year, even if they go to the best selling gold caves in the Star City. Having said that, the gold mines in the Striped Mountains are really powerful, so much wealth can be produced in such a short time. It may be possible to tell this information to his father, who will send troops to the castle when it has not yet been established. What kind of background can a pioneer in Deepwater City have? The Mage Federation is not an organization that must be reported, they will not intervene in the war between the lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was thinking about this, suddenly a bad premonition hit my heart. He saw his accomplices watching the gold at the bottom of the pit. Who is watching around? Turner turned sharply and saw a young man in a red robe standing in a five-step distance from him. The weird appearance of black hair and black eyes is unique on this continent, and only the lord of Heimqi is this respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has a heavy hand in his right hand, and he is already waiting for the excitement. It is the heart of Turner that is aimed at it. His other hand stood up on his lips and made a "squeaky" movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dwarf holds a round runestone in his hand. The rune above indicating "silence" is shining. It was this thing that suppressed the sounds around, so no one guard heard the sound of the dwarf in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc 哼克 led the militia from the surroundings, with flying axe and spear in their hands. Although from the way they hold weapons, these are just the mercenaries of the beginners, but they are firmly occupying the heights, and the free knights who are still carrying the treasure chest are trapped like mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s smile at Turner looks very annoying, and what he said is even more irritating. "Remove your weapon and throw it with the armor on the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want me to unload, discard the dignity of the nobility like a farmer Captive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can also do it according to my words, and then die like a glorious bandit." Siegel dangles the bow in his hand, swaying The cockroach is aiming from Turner's chest to the eyebrow. "Either you can choose to run away and use your legs to compete with the horses. I believe that your mount will leave you some face and you will be able to catch up later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I clearly saw that you left Heimqi, when did you sneak back? Don't you worry about your own hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "That is another story. After the people in the mine are arrested, I will pick you up and talk to you." Siegel put away a smile and said, "Now, surrender or die, choose one." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You win, we surrender." Turner nodded and picked up his weapon and threw it at his feet. Later, under the onlookers of the Orcs, he untied his own chain armor and only wore close-fitting clothes to stand in the spring night wind that was still frozen. Yanke smiled and walked up, tied their hands with a rope, and shoved the Freedom Knights into a row like a duck. He also used a rough hand to look at the hair of these people, so that I could check what would be hidden inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few wires were found, usually this can be used to open the lock of the door. When Siegel saw it, he said to Turner: "If you still want to be treated by the aristocratic prisoners of war, you will hand over the things that the thieves used. My men don't mind searching through every hole in you. See if there is a hidden weapon. My dungeon has not been established yet, and the conditions are not allowed, so I can only rely on strict search to ensure that the ransom I want is not lost. Sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner never saw a sorrowful look from the face of the lord. He made a look at the back, and then a clever guy raised his hand and buckled from his mouth, hiding something. The denture was thrown to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't think you are victorious." Turner said: "There are many people in the Freedom Knights. If we have three long and two short, your territory will never have a day." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, I know, I know." Siegel perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archer Mara ran over while they were leaving. Her right arm was simply wrapped around a tourniquet, but blood was leaking out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporting the Lord, the fire in the fire has been controlled, but there are three arsonists who fled to the south. Their horses and archery are very good, I am One of them was shot when chasing, but the other two shot the mount and the arm was injured. They were not able to catch them all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My order is not to let go." Siegel said: "Do you still have the ability to fight again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana looked up, Without hesitation, he said: "As long as there is another horse, I will not let them escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Siegel said: "You There will be more than a horse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a bottle of therapeutic agent, let the female shooter drink it, and then took out his wand and began to cast a spell. . "The night can't stop your eyes," Siegel put his finger on Mana's eyelashes, giving her the ability to see darkness, and then he grabbed Mana's arm: "Your hand will be stronger than the cheetah." Then, Siegel placed the palm of his hand on the short hair of the female archer, a layer of pale pink halo attached to the outside of her body. "The arrow won't penetrate your protection, it won't hurt your flesh." The wizard touched the arrow of Mana with his wand and saw the power of lightning flashing on the metal arrow: "And your weapon will go straight to the target." , wind and iron will only help, and will not form a hindrance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
