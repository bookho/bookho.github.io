			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the wizard's spell, the witchcraft's spells are closer to nature, with vitality and vitality, rather than simple elements. The Witch Uses the wreckage of various animals and plants to cast spells. They can heal and strengthen the physical ability of the caster. They can also poison or use martial arts to harm people. In addition, they can predict the weather and divination in the future. The Witch Festival claims that the soul can be brought back from the land of death and brought back to the mortal world, but the priest of the Temple of Life strongly opposes this point, thinking that the resurrection ability of the witch offering is only a legend, a story of their exaggeration. Only the pastor and the great druid of the Temple of Life can resurrect the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is Siegel’s full understanding of the Witchcraft, and the entire Master’s Union’s library is so vocal. It is a fantasy for Siegel to want to learn the same ability as a witchcraft in a short time. He can only use the smoke, the flash and the strange sound to fool the people in the stone village, and then say a few blessings, even if they are sent. For the rest of the day, he read the magic book in the key space and prepared the casting materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few people in the hard stone village to disturb the witch festival, even if there is something, it is just going out to hunt for blessing, go home to sleep, ask for blessings, etc. . Siegel will use the lighter technique that lasts for a long time but the effect is weakened to the former person, and the spell that enhances the physical endurance is given to the latter person. One to two, the people in the village began to praise the new witch festival, saying that he is a powerful caster who is blessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deceptive behavior made Siegel feel very uncomfortable. He had wanted to leave it several times. In order to alleviate this sense of guilt, he took out what can be distributed in the key space and improved the lives of the poor in the village. In the cold north, salt, sugar and cabbage are very extravagant things, and a small bottle of pepper that Siegel took out is simply better than gold. After learning about this, Linke rushed over and took away the pepper, carefully hiding it in the secret place of the stone house. Siegel did not care, and continued to distribute things. In addition to his own, he also gave the fur of the original witch sacrifice to several pregnant women so that they can withstand the cold. However, this further satisfies the witch sacrifice of his "God of Reproduction". There are often female orcs who sneak up and pray for the child. It is best to be a child who is blessed by the witch festival. For these people's unrestrained living habits, Siegel can only refuse over and over again, using illusion to create the imaginary of casting spells, and to give them a comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s hard to explain why the pregnant mother in the winter village is the most in the past years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel once wanted to leave the village three times, once because of a blizzard, and he couldn’t see his fingers. The other two met the orcs, all of whom were more than a hundred people, including the real witch offering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can feel the scope of the enchantment released by the witchcraft, as long as he casts magic is likely to be discovered by the other party, but by his own The sneak ability cannot escape the orc's sight. If you want to be able to cross the walls of the city, it is definitely more strict than the protection here. At least flying and stealth can make a few chances to sneak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible spells have no problem, flying spells Siegel has not had time to learn, and there is no record in his spell book. ‘The spells that others can research, why can’t I? Siegel made a sigh of relief and began to try to study his own spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has passed for two months. It has been the beginning of the winter season. There are very few news from the South. I can only hear a few words: Two-headed Wolf King Wolf The cricket has entered the prairie, the wolves are hunting, and the skinners are close behind. The iron foot warlord is still in the city wall mountains, beware of the human army from the castle defense line to cut off the road. The purpose of the orcs is still looting, including food, weapons and slaves. Siegel heard that a certain amount of things had been transported back to the north of the mountain range. I could only secretly hope that the loss on the prairie should not be too great. The jackdaw tribe should not be included in the list of looted tribes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to playing a witch festival every day, Siegel spends the rest of his time meditating and practicing spells. He has already read "The Beginning of Illusion and Elemental Magic," and now he begins to look at the blood magician's spellbooks and notes. Although some of the spells appear to be gloomy and evil, they can still increase their knowledge and improve the level of Siegel's magic. In particular, some techniques of casting spells on the target of the body, the blood magician has unique insights, and the way of cursing through the blood also makes Siegel amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other good news is that the Magic Raven finally found the owner. After a month of flight, Barron experienced blizzards, hail, intense frost and arrows from orc hunters. He was injured in many places and managed to reach his destination. This also reflects the rigor of the defensive power of the Wall Mountain Range from one side. When Siegel feeds it and eats it, he puts the magic energy on the palm of his hand and gently combs the feathers for it - this will speed up the recovery of the magic pet and enhance the degree of magical affinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these villages, there is also a wood walled city on the lower reaches of the river, a distance of 100 miles from the stone village.Lin Ke said that it is called the town of bacon. It is the territory of an orc general Kaka, less than 800 residents, but at most it can gather 400 troops.This orc general belongs to the skinned corrugated, but he prefers money more than the enemy's skin, and the war is not as high as the transaction.So some other orc generals will go to the bacon town to sell things and exchange them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over time, a market in the town of bacon, a place to maintain order with fistsWhen the exchangeable value is insufficient, it is also possible to negotiate the transaction with the old punch.Siegel looked and listened through the eyes of the raven, knowing that a batch of valuable goods would be shipped back in half a month, and the general would bring his skinning guard back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel told the village chief, and he immediately understood what was going on."Siegel, I heard about this matter. The skinning general Kaka invited many towns and corps leaders around the town to go to the bacon town to attend the celebration ceremony, but the stone village is not invited.This may not be good news for you. It seems that the orcs have achieved great victories in the south of the Walled Mountain Range.You also know that in this operation, the three warlords did not participate in the three eyes, and the orc generals under his command must be quite complaining.In addition, some left-being orcs also need to taste the sweetness, or who knows if they will be black-handed after the returning compatriots? So the orcs on the front line will ship the spoils back.The bacon town market is one of the few places where the tears can be traded. It is estimated that this time Kaka came back personally, it is necessary to invite all the orc leaders in the vicinity to share the achievements of the South Army.On the one hand, you can change something that is urgent, and on the other hand, you can show strength and wealth to all orcs.After all, the orc strong is respected, and in this way it is often possible to recruit elites from other tribes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, where is the gathering of goods and the gathering of news? "Siegel thought about it. He still lacks a lot of things. If it happens to find a specific casting material, or if you can find a magic wand, you can greatly improve the success rate of Siegel's next plan."Even if you don’t, you can inquire about the situation on the southern grasslands and the situation of the walled mountains. You may use this as a basis to guess the orcs’ action plan.In short, for Siegel, the town of bacon is indispensable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, do you want to go?" Lin Ke asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this is a good opportunity"Siegel’s eyes are shining"Either intelligence or materials are urgently needed by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do? Used to deal with orcs? Lin Ke shook his head and hid his true intentions.When Siegel slipped away a few times, he was clear.If this mage is taken away by the orcs, what should I do if I reveal the village? Perhaps in the beginning, in order to protect the shackles, and to fight for the half-orcs in the village, especially the half-orcs of the last village chief’s cronies, the risks are too great.Siegel is becoming more and more difficult to control, and his ambition and ability to act will sooner or later threaten the safety of the village and the status of his village head.Lin Ke’s eyes drifted toward the weapons in the tent, but in the passionate battle with the female orcs, he took off his armor and had no protection. The only weapon he touched was the long dagger hidden under the blanket.He looked at Siegel and thought about the ability of the Master who had heard of it.Although you will die like a heart mage in a knife, can you have such an opportunity? Lin Ke thought about it, but he still can't do it. He only has to find a better chance to deal with the trouble.But if Siegel can still listen to his persuasion, maybe there is still room for recovery.As for dealing with the orc, this can be done by the Master, but the Witch Festival in the Stone Village cannot be done. Lin Ke can’t give up the life of the whole village.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t look at me with that kind of vision, my spells are faster than you can get weapons.Siegel guessed his thoughts and said, "I am a human being like you. In the eyes of others, this has already decided the position. The orcs can't treat you and me as friends."I recently counted the number of people and found that there was no army in Shoushi Village to send people to participate in the Nanzheng army.What if the Orc General heard about this news? Lin Ke, wake up, no matter the victory or defeat of the orcs, the stone village may suffer a major disaster.This is not the curse of Mike, just a simple inference"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You only know one, I don't know the secondThis is not a simple matter of not sending people to the legion, but we are trying to avoid the orcs who are catching Ding.This is not the south. The lord has appointed peasants to go out. Every village has a few people.Here is the wild and desolate north, the generals like the free slavesEspecially the skinny wow, the generals of his men are fierce beaters, and the soldiers who go out of the village like us rarely come back alive.We have our own way of survival, we can hide every time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can I hide? "Siegel patiently and Lin Ke said: "Now the Walled Mountain Range has fallen into a state of turbulent war. It is very likely that when we are talking here, the grasslands and the mountains are already in flames."Do you think the orcs can break through the deep water city? Can you fight against the Masters Federation? Can you face the alliance of humans, elves, and dwarves, standing on the south side of the Walled Mountain Range? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
