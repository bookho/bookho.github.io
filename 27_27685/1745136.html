			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Uther led his six knights and a hundred knights as forwards of the entire unit, quickly approaching the Heim collar from the Ore Avenue. They are all equipped with horses, and the knights have the advantage of being a double horse. This unit is the pride of the entire South, and only the Uther family has such a large number of cavalry. The land in the south is damp and hot, and it is more suitable for growing dense trees rather than flat grasslands. Every year, the Uther family buys a lot of the best pastures from the north to feed their horses. They believe that with the excellent horses, there will be excellent knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the newly established Heim collar, William Uther is still very curious. It is said that the lord there was only an ordinary sailor more than a year ago, and later he won the title because of the loss of Prince Aaron’s life. His baronial title can only be passed down for three generations, so in many people's eyes, it is not a real aristocrat, but from the management of his territory, this person is only for the gold mine's money. The merchants of Mora flocked and exchanged his gold with stone, wood and grain. In William's opinion, Hem led a bad business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we occupy this gold mine, we can equip more knights, and then the Uther family will have the unity of the southern lords and become the king's strength. The war didn't even need to find additional reasons. The singer's letter that slandered his brother Karov Uther as a thief was a challenge to the whole family. I remember when my father received the letter, his face was gloomy and he wanted to tear it into pieces several times. But in the end he smoothed the folds on the stationery and took the letter well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to watch the little boy eat this letter a little bit." The Viscountess made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to say whether this war is for revenge or for gold mines, maybe both. As the second son of the family, William Uther could not inherit the title of the Viscount, but he knew that the castle he had laid would be his territory in the future - although the gold mine would definitely belong to the family - but the rest has already made him Satisfied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least you have a good castle, you can become the lord of the lord, think of here, William let the team continue to speed up. Just found on the avenue After the caravans, they were unfortunately met with the attack of “Gnomes Robbers” and died on the roadside. The “Gnomes Robbers” saw Uther’s cavalry smashed. No time to plunder the goods – anyway, this is going to be The facts recorded, or no records at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to achieve the effect of the raid, rush to occupy the gold mine before the other party responds, William chooses Depart before dawn. Use a whole day to arrive at the Zebra Mountain Gold Mine before midnight. After a few hours of rest, you must occupy the mine before the sun reappears. This will prevent the mine from being destroyed by humans. It can also make the garrison troops of the city of Mithra fall into a dilemma.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very dangerous to ride in the dark, if it is in the forest He or she is absolutely afraid to do this. Whether it is a prominent stump or a tangled grass, it may hurt the horseshoe. However, on the ore boulevard, this situation does not exist. It's flat, but there are no obstacles that can hurt the horse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just turned this thought in his mind and heard the horse humming and the Cavaliers falling to the ground behind him. Then he felt the ground shaking under his feet and his mounts were somewhat unstable. He quickly made adjustments, allowing the horses to quickly change their pace, slowing down and relaxing the muscles of the four legs to cope with unexpected situations. He heard the constant clamor of the knight and the sound of the mount falling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is certainly not the normal situation. But the moonlight alone cannot see the surroundings. Form. Whether to ignite He has hesitated in his heart. Now he has entered the scope of Heim's collar. If the young lord has arranged a sentry post at the Striped Mountain Gold Mine, it is possible to discover the light of the torch and expose the action of this pioneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that at this moment, a cloud floats and covers the moonlight above their heads. This is the middle of the night, where is the cloud? William can’t understand The reason for this, but the surrounding became darker than before, and the cries of the knight and the cries of the horse urged him to make a decision as soon as possible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ignite the torch, be careful alert. "William has no choice but to order.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under the light of the torch. He finally saw the situation on the road. I don't know when there are hundreds of scattered on the ground. The fist-sized hole just happened to make the horseshoes sink, and then don't break the legs. When was this dug? William had an ominous premonition. Before killing the businessman, he also asked about the ore avenue. The road. The guy who was scared by the sword did not dare to lie. From his trembling voice, William clearly heard the answer he wanted: "The road is very flat, there is no way to stop the road. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off the javelin next to the saddle and threw it accurately. He penetrated the injured horse's neck and relieved his pain. Other broken-legged horses were treated like this, and the bodies were discarded on the road. "Leave a few horses, you clean up the weapons and equipment on the ground, and then follow up as soon as possible." William gave the order: "It seems that the enemy is ready, we must be ready to fight." He is on horseback Go straight up and look around the knight: "Remember, the sooner you occupy the mine, the more time you have to clean the battlefield, do you understand what I mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; There was a whisper of whistle around, and the torch shone many greedy eyes. Everyone understands the benefits of first occupying the gold mine: those gold that are too late to be transported in the alchemy room are more affordable than any other reward. Everyone is vying for the desire to join the vanguard, not for the sake of honor, but for something more practical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallen horse knight who was left behind took time to untie things from the dead mount, including long swords, shields, javelins, bows and other items. The Pioneer will not wait for them, and if they go late, they will not be able to get anything. They used a torch to the ground for illumination, and several people worked together to flip the body to remove the things that were pressed underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horses that stayed at this time suddenly screamed in horror, then broke free of the reins and ran to the south. They panicked, and two were trapped and fell to the ground. The horseless knight immediately took out the long sword and looked around with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They felt a slight vibration from the ground beneath their feet, and some small stones leaped gently on the road. Then they saw two mounds arched in the middle of the road, and humanoid monsters wrapped in rocks and dirt were drilled out of the ground. Although they are as tall and short as ordinary humans, and there are no weapons in their hands, this strange thing still makes several soldiers fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Siegel's rune element guard, and their masters are commanding not far away. Through communication, Siegel can accurately pass commands to the earth elements, and can guarantee their own safety. He can see the situation on the battlefield through the enemy's torch, but there is no light around him, and Uther's cavalry can't find him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven Barron discovered the cavalry early, and the wizard with the phantom is obviously more maneuverable and ready to hurry before the enemy. Siegel just didn't think that the innocent businessman would be killed, and he was determined to let the hands-on William pay the price. Using the ability of the earth element, he continued to hammer on the ground with his fist, and Siegel created a whole horseshoe crater. However, he only read such a tactic in the book, this is the first application, so the effect is not good. There are only six of the one hundred cavalry recruiters, but fortunately, it is not necessary to pay any casualties to achieve the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the earth elements in front of them, the soldiers of the Uther family face each other and don’t know what to do. The earth element did not receive an order to attack immediately, so it stood like a sculpture in the middle of the road. Siegel ordered the Raven Baron to land and head south to the Ore Avenue. I saw that the cloud that covered the moonlight quickly fell, and then covered the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud is a spell that can only be cast on itself, mostly used when escaping. However, the magic pet can share the spell effect released by the master, so the raven becomes the core of the cloud. This of course will make the poor bird unable to see anything in the air, but Siegel can command the soul on the ground and let it circle in a certain area. In this way, the clouds can be used to cover a certain range of moonlight, and the cavalry can be caught in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he uses the same spell to block the way the "infantry" flees south, and then orders the earth element to start attacking. Uther’s soldiers hesitated and saw that the road was blocked. They could only courageously launch a counterattack. They threw a javelin and threw a flying axe, but they gained little from the earth. In addition to very sophisticated weapons, iron weapons made by blacksmiths are hard to cause visible scars on the rocky shell of earth elements. If you use ordinary arrows, you can't even shoot through the shell. Ordinary people can only actually cause substantial harm to them if they use their full strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is Siegel, he only needs to attach "magic reinforcement" to his weapon to overcome this layer of protection, but he and the earth element. Seeing the earth monsters will rush to the front of them, the front of the soldiers raised their swords and struggled. The earth element in front of him suddenly fell short, and all of the waist below it fell into the ground. Just like the fusion, it was easy to escape the attack. The arm of the rock made a straight punch and the front hit the enemy's knee. I saw the flesh and blood fragments squeezing out from behind the iron plate of the knee guard, and the soldiers lost their balance and fell to the ground. The earth element swung upwards and hit the enemy's door. Nose blood and teeth flew together, and even the painful mourning was shrunk back. When the other soldiers just came to support, they saw the earth elements slowly sinking into the ground, like the crocodile lurking in the swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
