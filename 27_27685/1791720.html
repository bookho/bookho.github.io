			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the city, Janet obtained a refusal of 5 gold coins from the leader of the caravan and then walked straight toward the castle. Myrtle City is very different from her when she left, but she still feels the same in her heart: always busy and energetic. She saw a lot of new things, magic items should not be overwhelmed, as if it became a paradise park overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the gate of the town to the castle on the road to more than ten miles, she saw at least thirty people wearing robes of the mage. She still doesn't know that many of them are just apprentices in the college, and they think they are the official mages of the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always six guards standing in front of the castle, and a team of ten people patrolling near the wall, ready to drop the gate and ring the alarm. Janet knows that there will always be a gas element Rune Guardian in the humble little warehouse on the corner. They will come out after hearing the alarm and help defend the castle entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These guards are not equipped with a plasma crossbow, but the guards hidden in the tower are fully armed. Although the city gate has never been attacked, and Siegel also believes that the magic array hidden in the territory can solve all crises, Janet still arranges defenses like this. In her view, this aspect can show power to other lords in an intuitive way. On the other hand, this is the best defense system for her assassins in her cognition - but after training in the Temple of Murder, she is now I don't think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, woman, what's the matter with you entering the castle?" A captain with a feather on his pointed helmet put a spear on the ground and stopped. Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the hostess here, Janet wants to say this. However, her appearance is completely different from the past, and no one knows that this new body is filled with old souls. "I want to go to Pastor Ryder to pray and bless my family forever and peace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then go in, but remember not to leave the temple with stones Circle out the range, be careful to be shot by the guards!" The captain of the city gate laughed and scared her, then waved her hand to let her in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet took a deep breath and walked under the gate of the gate filled with dwarf runes. She could feel the vigilant look of the killing hole at the top of the head (blocked with an iron fence to dump hot asphalt or fire oil). Trained in the temple of the murder god. Let her feel the emotions and atmosphere around her. The residents in the city are happy, but why are the soldiers so nervous? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the deliberately low voice, the captain of the city gate floated into her keen ears. "I have never seen this woman, her accent is deliberately made into the city of Mire. You should let Hatch pay attention to it. Don't lose her whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Janet knows Hatch, a young servant of the castle who always wants to be a knight, but he has no talent for a sword. Usually he is responsible for the chores in the kitchen, but prefers to help the soldiers run errands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder's temple is still the same. The stone-built house was twisted, but unexpectedly very strong. There is still no holy emblem of the god on the arch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loose wooden door was open, and Reid came out from the inside with a pot of water, ready to water the flowers he planted. He saw Janet, suddenly stopped and then widened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...is Janet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet’s own surprise is absolutely more than Ryder It’s still big, and being recognized directly is never in her vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two demon, go to Mana or the Raven Baron, call the Lord Lord." Reid confessed to the konjac behind him, then Janet saw that there was no symmetry in the whole body. Then he staggered and walked out, swaying the body that was about to fall apart and heading for the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time only to find Baron can contact the lord adults, you take a step to sit." Reid looked up and down Janet: "Your soul is stronger However, but your body is still not well combined, it seems that something is wrong, you have to come to me often. But you can come back safely, Siegel has been waiting for you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet asked himself to smile and replied: "Have he been waiting for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That fool. How dangerous!" Janet is in the Old World and can know about the New World. The priests who had withdrawn from the town of Kaibu showed her before and after the attack, and Janet easily confirmed the style of Siegel. And as Siegel wiped out the top assassins again and again, her number is on the rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have he been okay?" Janet thinks the problem is stupid. But still can't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will be better to see you later." Reid sat down on the floor with a smile. He has no chairs in the temple, and he sits on the ground as tall as someone else sitting in a chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Siegel is not in the castle, he is busy with the wizards of the federation, while guiding them to make the secret nuclear, while for the federation The spacecraft made recommendations. The part of the spacecraft defense is mainly responsible for the protection of the mage, they can not wait to make the spacecraft into a tortoise shell. No gaps are left. In Siegel's thoughts, the more important task of this spacecraft is to attack and kill more enemies in order to contribute to the safety of Heim's leadership. Without this, he would not have to work hard to build a spaceship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wendy and Siegel struggled to face red, she is not willing to give up too much space for the ruling, that would destroy the overall effect of the defensive array. "Using the elements of the Urgian nuclear to summon power, relying on the elemental army can handle most of the situation. There is no need to continue to install so many spell sticks and spurs the array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp From the point of view of the spell, Wendy is right, her approach is better than Siegel's idea, whether it is the full use of energy or the maximum efficiency of the array. The optimisation plan does not represent a winning plan, and Siegel still insists on his own views. If it was someone else, Wendy couldn't have the courage to argue, but she was not nervous in front of Siegel. After her confession, there was no power to make her go back and lose. Strong, I want to be strong! Wendy kept encouraging herself, and she heard that Janet was like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is having a headache, not knowing how to reason with Wendy. At this time, he felt the message from the magic pet, and the second to say that the magic statue Rhett had important things to find him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Important things? Hope is not a new disaster prediction. Heim’s collar escaped the threat of water pollution and plague, but the ground and large volcanoes of the explosion have not yet appeared. Siegel jerked up and said goodbye to Wendy. Then I sent myself back to the castle of Mire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female mage took a moment and saw that Siegel suddenly left, and the feeling of fear suddenly came up and caught her. Wouldn't it be that I was angry with Siegel? He didn't even say goodbye! I am really stupid. Stupid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet sat in front of Rhett and held a cup of fragrant tea in his hand. She stared at the shaking tea and let the aroma of the steaming steam on her face. She can see her face in the cup: dark brown hair, some freckled face, slender nose and thin lips. Like a thin girl who missed development. Only these eyes can satisfy Janet, and the brown enamel is like a light sea. From time to time, it will flow out of the glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not sure if Siegel will like this look. In her time with her husband, Siegel’s things will change her appearance. I have not asked for such a similar face to live. If you don't look at your eyes, this face is very ordinary, and after training, the short and slender body and the big hands and feet are like a normal fisherman girl who works all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was transferred to the courtyard and walked straight to the stone temple of Reid. He saw the woman staring at the cup. I felt a little sigh in my heart, and there was an indescribable familiar feeling coming up. He slowed down and squinted his eyes and used all his magical powers between his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell flowed, the brilliance flashed, he saw everything, but he was stunned by tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this?" He asked himself in his heart and then decided. "Jinite? Is that you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet suddenly woke up, jerked up, tears in his eyes. "It's me. I am back!" She couldn't stop crying after she finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel dropped his staff and ran quickly, holding her in her arms. The soldiers and knights in the castle looked at the scene with astonishment and opened their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
