			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the orc's troops left the arena, they were close to the afternoon of the day, which gave Siegel a fairly long free time. He patrolled the round with a bloody round, three times, identifying the place where weapons and armor were stored, as well as the cages that held the beasts. While the other slave owners were still trembled, Siegel bought some food from the orc soldiers with a few words of the witch sacrifice, most of which were for the visceral sausages of the gladiators and the waists filled with garlic. And a barrel of ale. He called Mick to help move things together to the location of the villagers and let them open their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are afraid that they are eating "killing rice", the fear of fear makes them only swallow their mouths, their faces are covered with tears, but they dare not cry Come out loud. Some slaves carefully steal some food that is easy to preserve and prepare for the future; but more people choose to open their belly and slam into the chest, as if they want to kill themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at them, don't let them go." Siegel said to Zucker: "If they run away, they are likely to be taken back by the slave owners. I will I can't help them. But I guess that the slave owners will start to slow down tomorrow, knowing that I am only in the foxes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼克 nod, whisper Ask about Siegel's plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't tell you the details now, but if you want to escape, you must be prepared to kill a bloody road." Siegel Say: "Go to those who can listen to the command and dare to use the sword, and pay attention to those who have too many ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyes are again These unsuspecting slaves swept over, wondering how much more tonight could survive. Even if he is himself, he can't guarantee to pass the test of battle. Just like the legendary soldier Fidan in front of the flame of the dragon, Wu Hao Regula stepped into the vortex of time and space, they did not know whether they could have a chance to return, but they still embarked on the journey. Unlike previous adventures, Siegel was always passively accepted, or under the guidance of the elders. But now Siegel still has a choice. He can hide. When the city is in chaos, he can go to the port to find a boat and then slip away with the convenience that he will not be affected by the grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can’t accept that self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The so-called hero is to understand his responsibility and fight for it,' Siegel said to himself, 'These poor slaves are my current responsibility, they Under the whip, the light of the soul is faint. Only through the test of blood and iron, the journey of fire and water can be completed to regain a new life. I have to lead before. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and walked alone to the preparation area of ​​the arena. There are also many pharmacies that slave owners hoard for healing or helping, and there are many basic materials that Siegel needs to deploy more potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can help with this matter, his movements must be fast and steady. In the storage room, he also found a lot of empty wine sacs, all made of sheep stomach or cowhide, which can be used to hold pharmacy. Siegel locked himself in the door, opened the key space, took out all the needed materials, and placed it on an empty table. He finally took out the Yan Ling Jing, once again admired its touching red, and then hammered it into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never waste." Siegel said: "The best use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the night, the clouds and the stars disappeared, and the breeze soon began. Siegel was at the door of the arena, motionless like a statue. At the end of his vision, through the numerous low and dark wood houses, he could see the ship's hull being built at the dock. The tall masts clearly indicate their position, but the night will quickly swallow all the shadows, and then the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is very good, it is the cold wind that blows to the sea, just to swell the sails that leave. However, Siegel did not know the situation of the tides and currents, nor did he know the details of the waters around Macabu. But those are things that I worry about later, now he needs to clear his mind and wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been patiently waiting. Tonight, Siegel wore a large robe to hide the leather armor below. The arena can't find better armor, only the clothes that look more than the defense. But this does not hinder anything, because Siegel believes that magic will protect him. Outside the leather armor, he tied ten skin pockets on his waist, which contained a potent potion. Due to the incomplete materials, these agents are very unstable and can lose their effectiveness by holding up to one day. But I only need one night, and Siegel said to myself, it only takes one night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the surrounding terrain, he knew that there was an orc barracks not far from the arena. He was responsible for defending the docks and controlling all the roads to the three-eyed adult residence. Siegel keeps his position in his heart, ensuring that even the night will not let him lose his sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of orc patrols passed by, their iron shoes stepping on the ground and making a squeaking sound. This is not an orc that can be encountered in the wild. It is low in intelligence and unarmed. Here is the base camp of the three-eyed admiral among the four warlords of the orcs. The orc guards are armed with armor and armed with no less than four sets of weapons. But when they get messed up, the effect will be better. The whole city is said to have twelve witch festivals. Siegel doubled this number and then, like playing chess, calculated the trend of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all speculations require a realistic test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel thinks this way, he feels that the detection tactics of the entire city suddenly become active, just as a sleeping lion feels hostile, the whole body muscles Immediately tightened and made a counterattack. With the affinity gained in the magical awakening, he can feel the violent fluctuations of the surrounding magical energy, just like the rain falls into the lake, and the ripples are everywhere. He stood up and opened the sacred vision of the blind man, clearly seeing the wandering spirits in all parts of the city. Then he heard the alarm vibrate, the dogs were arrogant, and the whole city was awakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a sigh of relief and knew that time had finally arrived. He took out the biggest piece of inflammatory soul, threw it into the skin with a potion, and then shook it a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he took out his wand and held it in his hand. Although this is only the wand he has seized, it is not easy to use, but the feeling of magical rogue is so good that he can ignore these discomforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the Cavaliers declared war, Siegel bent over and saluted the direction of the three-eyed warlord, and then began to cast magic. The spell of the enemy attack has been useless for a long time, but it is still smooth and complete, just like the memory printed in the soul, it will never be forgotten. The mage felt the power of magic in the body, accompanied by a burst of ecstasy. He feels like an eagle that regains freedom and can soar in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the spell was over, Siegel aimed at the barracks and threw himself out of the skin in his hand. The skin with the potion and the scent of the soul quickly disappears into the night, but the power of magic can make it reach the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then a large group of grievances appeared in Siegel’s psionic vision, which broke out of his skin. This time the number of grievances is more than the other grievances that appear in the city, enough to cause great trouble to the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel turned and walked back to the arena. After a row of cells, the slaves that were originally held were concentrated in the preparation area of ​​Siegel. Take care of it. He opened the warehouse, and the weapon inside flew to him, stopped on the invisible floating dish, and then moved forward with the wizard. At the gate of the gladiator, Siegel hesitated for a moment, took a deep breath, and then pushed the door open. Even without any experience of leading the people, it is now necessary to take the lead in charging, without the space of timidity and hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s a gladiator or a villager who was arrested, they all had a good rest during the day, and now few people are sleepy. At least this is a good thing for Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to me." Siegel pulled off his face and revealed his true face. He said loudly: "I am from Sos. Siegel, the first person of the squid family, the brave of Mora, the royal baron of the starry kingdom. I am here to carry out the mission of fighting the orcs and saving the slaves. Who is with me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the cockerel orcs stood up and the others did not respond. Everyone is still immersed in shock, not knowing what happened. The life of slavery makes them numb and their reaction is declining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel lifts the warhammer high and lets the power of magic pass through his arm to the weapon. The mage deliberately imitated the dwarf Elinette, and the old dwarf's flame warhammer had left a deep impression on him. Siegel passed the power of the fire element and let his warhammer shine like a torch, releasing a bright light in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The orcs have been in a mess, and they want to save themselves. Now there are boats in the port, they are all prepared for us. People who don't want to be killed in the arena. Now pick up the weapon and kill a path to freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
