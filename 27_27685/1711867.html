			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about your dragon partners? How are they, are they dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Did you die?" Capricorn thought for a moment and then said, "No, not yet. But I sensed their failure, and a breath that made me feel very uncomfortable is approaching, my stomach. I started to feel uncomfortable. I don't want to stay here for a long time, but I will leave later. But because I have to follow the instructions of Longzu, I have to tell you and let you run quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and looked at the dragon girl, looking at the opposite yellow and blue with the unique black eyes. Capricorn did not care to look at the Master, but revealed a slight tension in the eyes that were not fluctuating. Siegel knew that this tension was not directed at himself, so he asked: "Can you tell me the Dragon's mission in the North now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you don't I want to lie to me, I won't tell you." The dragon girl screamed and said, "You are too young, don't worry about those things. Even if this place quickly becomes dead, there is a big threat in the mountains. What about the black cloud, I am too lazy to control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me guess." Siegel’s brains turned fast. In combination with what he saw and heard in Macabu, he said his own idea: "Is the shadow of the soul coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morocco She was shocked, and in a few seconds her expression combined with sorrow, surprise and incredible. “How did you get it?” she asked. “The names of the shadows are very secretive. It is more difficult to predict their actions. Tell me, how did you guess the answer?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confidence," Siegel replied quickly: "If your dragons are going to fight against the shadows of the dead, it must be a big loss. They are attached. The ability of others is very strong, even if you rely on your magical resistance, it is hard not to leak—especially when you encounter a large group of enemies.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Victory." Capricorn swayed his fists<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it will win." Siegel waved his hand, and there was no flattering emotion in his tone. "Tell me, Miss Capricorn, is there any protection in my mission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very happy to tell you, no." The woman squinted and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, then you should leave here as soon as possible." Siegel said calmly: "My magic is hard to produce. It can't protect you naturally." Security. If you are under the control of the shadows, I can't subdue you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Listen to what you mean, you are not going to follow me?" Capricorn did not expect the Master to make such a choice, but she still said: "I am strong. I can bring five more people. If I find a big enough net, I can add up to two. Keep flying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your concern, let's go," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caring?" Capricorn pouted. Very sad to say: "I just don't want to be like their failure. I don't care about you!" She turned her voice and said, "Do you think that you are very important? I accept the mission of the ancestral spirit and Doesn't mean that I like it, it's just a necessity... necessary waste of time. If you are willing to face death yourself, no problem, I have already warned you, if you don't obey, you can't count me as a failure!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longwei exudes, and Janet unconsciously grasps Siegel’s robes under her influence. Siegel found that he was still not affected by Longwei this time. Even the only one that was attacked by Longwei was much less harmful than others. He believes that there must be other forces that bind the Capricorn. Otherwise it won't be the result. Although he is more and more aware of the dragon girl in front of him, he has begun to be able to manipulate her mood swings, but Capricorn is still an uncontrollable factor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go to St. Joseph to find you and get back my land." Siegel deliberately said this. The life of the dragon is too long, and the rush is not enough to make it enough to make enough impressions. Only the emotion of the dragon can be fully mobilized. Only in this way can the subtle dragon's decision be subtly influenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah? What do you say? I can't hear..." Capricorn screamed deliberately and then flew into the sky at the fastest speed. A burst of meaning is inextricably transmitted from the sky, and then gradually disappears as the dragon goes away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel patted Janet’s hand and said, “She is happy to be lazy. It’s natural. But I’ve roughly figured out the core and limitations of her mission, and the next step is to do it.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next? Are you going to find the dragon?" Janet said quickly: "Don't go. There are many better land than St. Joseph, some no. Under the human land, there are not only rich mineral deposits, but also mysterious power. St. Joseph is a dangerous place. Under the pressure of the dragon, there are only three small villages with less than 100 people at the foot of the mountain. A rift is likely to pass. To the terrible underground world. I know that you want to be a lord, but it is not suitable as a territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet turned his head and said with a trembling voice: "Because I have seen all the maps on the east side of the New World Wall Mountain Range."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knox Association?" Siegel's tone became serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Janet thought that Siegel had asked himself to tell all the information about the Knox Association, and he apparently did not make it. "I thought..." She thought about it and changed her mind: "I'm sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet. It doesn't matter. But I am not Knox, though The same is the Master, but our pursuit is not the same. They don't necessarily want what I want, and what they give up doesn't mean it doesn't work for me. I have my own claim for the territory. Come on, let's go to Bill. Jazz." Siegel barely smiled. "The dragon and the territories will say later, solve the problem at hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard at the door of the conference room is still not Let Janet go in and only allow Siegel to enter alone. Janet found that Siegel pulled her hand and let go, her cheeks were gently kissed, but there was not much temperature. "Wait for me here." Siegel confessed. He seems to be somewhat ecstatic, and his thoughts are not concentrated on the person he kisses. Then the young mage walked over between the two guards, and the door of the conference room opened automatically in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles and priests inside looked at Siegel curiously, wondering why he returned to the venue. At this time, the door of the conference room was closed behind the wizard, blocking Janet's view. The magical creatures took a few steps back, relying on the cold walls, and the brain was lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, when the conference room door is closed, Siegel is finally temporarily out of the embarrassing situation, and can concentrate on the situation at hand. Under the gaze of everyone, he stood at the conference table. I heard it in a voice that everyone can hear: "The dragon is gone, there will be great risks here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he will be smashed All the words and my own inferences are said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd screamed at the Count of Todd. Being besieged by the orcs is one thing. There are towering cliffs and strong walls, there are enough weapons and ammunition and food, and there are two sweet wells in the castle that will never dry up. But these are completely useless in the face of ghostly enemies. Even though they gathered the excellent pastors and the determined paladins of the Temple of Dawn, they still felt feared inside. The sleepy stories of the monks who had heard at the bedside, the dangerous and terrifying images of the demons and ghosts all emerged. So the nobles shouted: "Retreat, leave this piece of death to the orcs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! Give me peace." Earl of Todd Road. His anger swept the entire room like a storm, temporarily suppressing fear and panic. "Siegel, can you be sure that you have no problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't get the exact evidence, but these are all the most reasonable inferences. Siegel replied: "I believe what I said will happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Then we must retreat as soon as possible." Count Todd nodded. "We can't risk the death of the prince to the prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This order gives everyone a sigh of relief and even ignores the casualties that may be encountered in the breakout. Sir Bill frowned, looking thoughtfully at Siegel's standing body. He feels that things are not so simple, and his disciples should have other ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Siegel coughed and suppressed other voices with a spell. Then he said to the count: "I believe that other nobles and civilians should be evacuated and the prince left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
