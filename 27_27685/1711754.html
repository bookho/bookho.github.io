In order to throw the warhammer, the dwarf fell to the knee again, and the blood re-exuded from under the bandage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, don't worry about the child for me, just a little bit of blood, something often." The dwarf said with a smile, the beard shook "When you see you in good condition, we are relieved. What happened in the cave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will tell you back, I will give it back You stop bleeding and dress up the wound.” Siegel looked around anxiously, and was shocked. He quickly asked: “Dio? Why didn’t you see him?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "He went to the mountain to watch the tower move the ammunition, rest assured." Elf Liya came over and took the last roll of bandage from the belt. "Take me here, you can clean up the battlefield and see what's left. Carefully on the bodies, they may still come to attack you, so don't forget to add a knife to each one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walks on the battlefield. The camps were destroyed in the explosion and the materials were the same. He found a bottle of healing potion from Carlos, just to heal the wound for the dwarf. He found a cube from the center of the explosion, the shape is exactly the same as the cube in the cave. Only this item is full of cracks and the damage is serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people can only guess the role of this thing, but everyone agrees that this is the key to unlocking Rubik's Cube architecture. "Only returning to the top of Mora, look for Master Rune." Elinte said, then he turned to the elf and said: "Maybe you have a wizard?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a mage, not a wizard." The elf shook his head and said, "If the dwarf really has no choice, I will try it. But this is, after all, something on your territory. It’s better for you to study first.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, treasure!” Elinette smiled a little, this time just happened to dawn, the sun drove away. The darkness brings warmth and light again, and the three-year-old moonless night is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a squeaking sound on the dragon lion's cliff, the stone statue stood up, shaken off the gravel, and then stood back next to the entrance - they did not know the treasure It has been taken away, and only the door is meaningful to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, when it comes to treasure, there is actually a part." Siegel took out the key and prayed that this thing should not be damaged. Fortunately, the light beam that turns on the space is still lit, forming a box in the air, showing the full treasure to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guardian's beard and warhammer!" The dwarf looked at him with surprise, then laughed. The laughter infects both the elf and Siegel, and all three are laughing in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dio came back with a large pack of weapons, they showed him the treasure again. The people of the plateau shed tears in excitement, thanking the gods and cuddling his companions. Then he and Siegel made a stretcher with spears, shields and ropes, forcing the dwarf to lie in, and then walked down the hill together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plateau ignited the wolf smoke when it returned to the watchtower - because at that time there was no need to worry about the enemy’s whereabouts and must seek reinforcements. They met the militia who came to help at the tower, and several soldiers of the Petit dwarf (short dwarf) were nearby. They have mounts and can transport the wounded faster. The captives trapped here by Siegel<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way back, the battle group of the gem family also arrived, and their team expanded instantly. Elinette took out the gold coins, thanked the militia who came to help, and used the wine to enter the Petti dwarfs, and then they returned to the top of Mora under the escort of the battle group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf priest came to he to heal the wound, but he was helpless to declare that Elint could only amputate, otherwise the broken bone might enter the blood and pierce his heart. . This incident even alerted the clan patriarch - Tulamon - "giant nemesis". He strictly forbids Elinte from leaving Mora and will only be able to take care of clan affairs, forging and educating the younger generation. Elinette just toasted him and made him healthy, and then he drove him away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t want to visit my cut-legs here!" Elinette explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, at the best moment, let's divide the money!" The dwarf took out a piece of parchment, prepared the quill, and then put on the glasses on the nose, one by one for everyone to explain - in fact, mainly to Siegel Make a statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The discoverers of the treasure are four people, Leah, Bill, Dio and I, so we have four shares of the treasure. Bill did not participate in this action. So his final share is less than others. Then say Siegel, the child you joined the team later, so you don't have this share, just the division of tasks. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem. It's fair." Dio nodded: "It's about the same as our tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the land and everything on it is a gem clan to Irene, you should take more..." Leah had not finished, and was interrupted by the dwarf. Elinte said: "Last time we have discussed this issue, I still insist on my opinion. The dragon cave is mine, this is enough. The treasure must be divided equally among all the discoverers."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Leah can only promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I probably calculated it, I, Leah and Dio, both take 22%, Bill has 18%, West Geer is 14%. There are still 2% of the remaining equipment expenses to pay for several adventures, taxation of the kingdom and other messy things. If not enough, I will settle; if it does not cost, then When asked me to drink, how about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people clap their hands and agree. Siegel didn't think he could divide so much, but everyone insisted on giving him this share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whenever you look at it, you can take it with you and leave the two-handed sword to Bill. This will be taken from the total. There are some unmelted ores, and Gems and gold and silver need to be processed, so the processing cost will be deducted first, and we will all be net profit. It takes time to realize the items. I can only give you what you need urgently, slowly raise funds or replace them with what you want. There is no fee, but it will not give you interest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dio is impatient, he laughs all day and his wife will not count, but he is These are actually impatient. When Lia saw it, he said in his ear: "This is actually a dwarf who is educating Siegel, so don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Rubik's Cube I have given to The Rune Master, see if I can open it. The cost of hiring a Rune Master is paid by me, and then I will replenish it from the Rubik's Cube. Since these costs don't know if it can produce results, if it succeeds, then when you replenish it, Calculated by double. This may take a long time, so everyone should be patient." The dwarf recorded this on parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have roughly calculated the two days, the value of the treasure in the key space is around 300,000 gold coins. Of course, if the sale is concentrated, it will not be worth so much. Now, I suggest that everyone still come slowly. There are still a few things to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf looks at Dio, pauses the quill, slow Slowly said: "Dio, you are still the original idea, do you want to buy food and daily necessities?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but also some building materials, good Let the tribes live better. Then buy some weapons that are not easy to rust.” The plateau nodded, then waved his hand: “I have given it to you anyway, I don’t talk about business.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene features nod and looks at the elf: "Do you have any suggestions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put some crafts and jewelry directly Just give it to me, I still prefer the style of our elves. If you are looking for elf craftsmen to process these materials, I know a few." He said. The dwarf nodded and recorded all of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, what do you want to add?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought for a moment, Then he whispered: "If there is news from Sir Bill, I will go to him. If I can't wait, I want to take the money to learn the spell." He was a little embarrassed, then added: "Listen to the master of Lia. There is a New World Federation of Masters in Deepwater City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf spits out his tongue and shook his head: "The caster is not reliable, you will know if you try it." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our mage never accepts students of other races, even half-elfs can't do it," Leah explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, anyway, we wish Siegel more. Maybe there will be a caster in our team. It is not a bad thing." The dwarf clap their hands and focus everyone's attention, then announce: "In order to support the young people, the books inside are all yours, and the key itself." After that, Elint took out the key from his pocket. , pushed to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This key is everyone's, it should be counted in the total treasure!" Siegel hurriedly refused. "Further the keys are dwarf characters, it must be your creation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To tell you the truth, this key is indeed of high value, though not comparable." The treasures contained therein are really valuable." The dwarf said seriously: "I am in the city all day, some are servants, I can't use this at all. Leah is going to return to Xinlin, and the Elf patrol can only use the match." The weapons and equipment that are sent, so they are not used. Dio is so stupid, and their tribes are in the western plateau. You don’t want this thing to lead the dragon. As for Sir Bill, if you meet, then his stuff. Still you are squatting, there is no difference. So you should hold it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sell it for money, is it bad?" Siegel said <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The money is enough, you are a little fool!" The dwarf pretended to be angry and knocked Siegel's head with his hand. "If we need this thing, we will naturally tell you. Would you not use it for us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not enough. Do you want to collect the custodian fee?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head. So everything was finalized, and each person first divided 5,000 gold coins, which is regarded as the "living expenses" at the top of Mora. After Siegel got the money, he said that he would also like to treat, so everyone celebrated at night. Dio wanted to take Siegel to the brothel, but he made a retreat under Lia's strict gaze, and he went alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earliest departure from Mora was Dio, and he couldn’t wait to escort the entire ten-car to the plateau. The freight paid for this trip is not low, but fortunately he is now a rich man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you go to the plateau and inquire about the bulls, you will find me. I will let my wife prepare the blood sausage and milk cake." Dio said this farewell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, when did you have your wife's?" The dwarf pulled him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I didn't say it? We just wiped out the Black Pig tribe, the blood-eared tribe asked for union, this time it was my turn to marry their woman, so It’s a kiss again,” Dio explained in a serious way. Then he turned to Siegel and said seriously: "Continue to keep exercising. If you go to our tribe, there will be many girls who like you. They are all tall and long legs, you must like it!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liya swayed her hand and urged him: "Okay, go, let's go, the caravan waits!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel always thought about the treasure that the old captain told him about the end of the New World, so when he said goodbye to Dio, "I will go to the plateau and I will definitely go to you!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he was knocked on by Elinte and Leah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dio haha ​​laughed, ** upper body, slanting the curved blade across the waist, carrying his cargo brigade on the top of the Mora The wind and snow down the mountain road. They will pass through the canyon to the west side of the mountain and enter the plateau from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf left after a few days. She needs to report back to Xinlin, and the patrol’s holiday is coming to an end. She didn't like people to go off, so she walked quietly, just leaving a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves began to be busy with clan affairs and gradually let their children participate in these political affairs. He still takes time to guide Siegel's martial arts every day, and asks his eldest son Colin and Siegel to train together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf town was harassed and several conflicts broke out, but were quickly dismissed by the city guard patrol. Siegel has been focused on training and does not care about these things. He waited for two more months, and there was no news of Sir Bill. At the end of the summer, Siegel decided to leave Mora and go to Deepwater to start his mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
