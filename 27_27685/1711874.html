			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time has passed quickly, and the moment dawned on the third day. Master Faranese sighed softly, then closed the book and pushed him to Siegel. "It’s time," the old man said. "You are leaving here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and received the "Building Guide" for the old man. In the space bag, then leaned over and embraced the three-day teacher. He felt that the bachelor's breathing became slower and slower, and the heart seemed to jump once in half a minute, and the vitality of the body was gradually dissipating. He thought about it, took the bottle of witch medic from the space bag and gently put it back into the hands of the bachelor. The old man's fingers moved. He lifted his eyelids to see the things in his hand, and hurriedly shook his head, panting and saying: "take away, take away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mage according to the words, backed away from the room. Master Faranese closed his eyes with confidence and waited quietly for the last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not attend the funeral of the old man, but silently mourned in his room. At the ceremony, Alexander opened the astral portal, and the body of the Faranis lord was placed in a black marble coffin, passing through the portal and floating above the free star. There, the flow of time does not cause corruption and festering, and everything is eternal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the funeral was the ceremony for Caspar to take over the Big Three, which also marks the official merger of the Knox Association into the Masters Federation. A large number of new spells, new spells, and new ideas have enriched the federation, and the price paid for it and the agreements reached by the giants are not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have felt the threat of the wizards, or the news of the Royal Fleet, the golden battleship docked at the dock has set sail. Siegel learned the news on his way home, but he finally settled down after seeing Jane, who was safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Bill said he knew, let you not worry about him, be a lord, then..." Janet pouted and spit her tongue and said: "Then let you marry me, find another good family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said this in front of your face?" Siegel laughed and laughed. But looking at Janet's playful expression in the sun, I know that the last sentence is just a joke. He gently twisted Janet's ear. It is a revenge for her jokes. Then he straightened up and said: "The two masters are gone, we should also set off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two masters?" Janet strangely Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. I will tell you about what happened in these three days." Siegel yawned, after all, he had not slept for three days. "But I have to take a break first. Help me tell Janis, get ready to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked back to the room and played it before going to sleep. Alert the spell and let the raven stand for him. Then he fell into a deep, dreamless sleep until the squeaky belly called him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving. He carefully counted his own things. The proceeds from the Deepwater City Cavaliers competition and the preparation for the Orc War in advance are basically exhausted in the procurement. As for the wealth found on Longshi Cliff, it is almost exhausted. Siegel calculated that he would almost spend the last gold coin when he arrived at the territory. That is to say, except for the goods on the cart and the team of more than one hundred orcs and humans, he has almost nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘No,’ Siegel touched the cockroach on the chin, ‘I still have magic. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The departure of such a team is bound to attract attention, especially after seeing so many strong orcs. The residents of Deepwater City were curiously watching and watched the team leave the West Gate. Then turn to the south. They stood on the side of the road and unscrupulously discussed the ugliness of the half-orcs while admiring the young lords. Siegel walked at the end of the team and rode on the phantom that was summoned. He wore a brand new red mage robes, and his magical mounts sparkling with stars, instantly caught everyone's attention. I don't know who was the first to shout: "Bring me, adults, I will dedicate my service to you!" Then it caused a group response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiles and waves, like a king. He once saw the style of Prince Aaron in Ximu Town. At that time, His Royal Highness was still healthy and full of vitality. Every move, smile, and glory showed the majesty of the kingdom of stars. But the prince has been dragging his dying body, leaving the hopeful New World with the golden warship, only Siegel is still here. The oyster mimics his royal majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One eye smiled and there was a complaint of fullness. But I can't say it under the enthusiasm of Siegel. Unlike Siegel’s identity as a mage and jazz, Fitzk’s credit is not taken seriously in the Sham Shui Po Lord’s Parliament. An undercover spy who wants to retire will no longer have any use and no threat. The “smart” of the merchants flourished in the lord's parliament, and the masked rulers did not value the honor of the true aristocracy. Two hundred gold coins, as a reward for Fazak’s efforts over the years, the lord’s parliament believes that this is the end of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Count of Maxim, since there are no descendants, the parliament only gave the family’s widows a sum of money, and then spread the news. Many aristocrats are very interested in the widows of empty titles and territories, and come to court for courtship. The original Wang family had become a market for bargaining and fighting, and lost their identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One-eyed Fazak was very discouraged and disappointed with the nobility. But in order for his child to have a chance to make a difference, he eventually found Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buffalo Siegel," Fazak bowed his head and said very solemnly: "I will contribute my loyalty to you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage is also serious, "I accept it and treat it with honor." After that, he resumed his previous enthusiasm and walked side by side with Fazak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can come too well. I have muscles and men, and there are no shortage of savvy businessmen, but there is a lack of brains that can analyze things." Siegel said "I have a big territory, but I don't know anything about the subjects I live in. How do they live, whether they are obedient to management, what kind of needs, these need a person who can collect intelligence and analyze. Fiza Gram, you can both read and write, and be proficient in numbers and analysis. I appoint you as my intelligence chief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a great honor. Lord Lord." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This honor is mine." Siegel smiled and replied: "It's still the thing, where is your grandson, I will accept him as a knight Followers, and also as my brother. When he has enough ability, I will promote him to a knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fyzak bent over and kissed Siegel On the back of his hand, his wish was fulfilled: "I will always be loyal to you, Lord Lord."希 /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel personally found a big car at the end of the team, driving the car is a fangs Janis, Janet is sitting in the car watching A book about the family pedigree of the Southern Constituency of the New World. Archer Mana is responsible for the defense of this car. Siegel gave an introduction to everyone and then let Fyzak ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed grandson is already fifteen years old, and it is too great to be a knight. His eleven-year-old second grandson, Moore Clive, was an awkward boy who was very nervous when he spoke, and was as strange to his grandfather as to Siegel. He intermittently said the words of allegiance, and symbolically handed over a gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, you follow me first." Siegel recalled that Sir Bill taught his own process and then assigned a task to Moore: "The first thing Learn to take care of the horses and maintain the weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good...well, adults. I can do this." Moore nodded, quietly following the West. Behind Geer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first task of a one-eyed Fazak is to keep accounts. Together with the fangs Janis, he counts the property of the lord. The average merchant can only calculate the goods and money, and the Fazak who can do the slave trade can count all the consumption of the horses. In the evening, Fitzkack found Siegel with a scowl in his face, holding a roll of parchment in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's say, look at your expression as if the sky is falling." Siegel watched the whole team in a well-organized camp under the management of the Musk half-orc Several fires ignited and someone was already responsible for heating the food. "You see, even the half-orcs can learn to follow the order and take care of themselves. Is there anything too difficult in this world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I calculated Let's wait. When the team rushes to Heimqiu, we will be poor and white. Unless the Lord of the Lord has hidden wealth there, I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel shook his head. "No. I told you all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then it is difficult for us to start production, unless the residents of the territory are immediately handed in Tax.” Fitzak replied: “At least enough food, wood and stone should be collected to build a castle with a storage room. Even if we don’t have any items, it will soon go bankrupt.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
