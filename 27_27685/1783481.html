It seems that magic is still applicable to the things here. From the cracks in the door, the squeaking of the teeth is sour, and the door is slowly opened to the sides. A warm breeze erupted from the room and was incompatible with the icy surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After opening a gap, the door seems to have encountered obstacles and keeps shaking. So Siegel strengthened the power of the spell and used the percussion again. This back door shattered the obstruction, and the bang sounded completely open to the sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceiling in front of the hallway suddenly flipped, and two strange things with multiple tubes suddenly popped out, pointing to Siegel and Evan. Two people thought that the machine like the arrow was quickly dodging. After waiting for a while, there was no sputum shot, and two people stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a conference room with rows of seats in a fan shape that surrounds the middle podium. Many people are sitting in danger and watching a golden ring floating above the rostrum without a word. After the door was opened, the cold wind outside entered, and all the participants collapsed into dust in front of Siegel and Evan, leaving only the piece of clothing falling into the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God!" Evan put the sword in front of him and made a defensive posture. "There were so many people who died at once, all of them became dust!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly thought that he had two one-piece clothes in his backpack. The dead were worn before they were born! He quickly pulled out his clothes and threw them aside. "I almost took these things back to commemorate, almost!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I found here are dead people. Actually, the difference is not big.” Siegel pointed to the golden ring on the podium and said, “Hey, I finally found some interesting discoveries.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people Go down the steps of the fan-shaped meeting room. At the same time, look at the surrounding furnishings. It can hold about two hundred people here. Far more than the sum of the number of small lounges outside. The moment I just opened the door. There are about a hundred bodies here, and dozens of bodysuits are found outside. What kind of purpose do these people gather here? It doesn't look like it is taking refuge. Siegel thought while walking and made many different speculations. But there is no documentary, he can not prove any one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ultimately people who have not escaped death, all of which are "stagnant" here. Siegel did not feel any traces of magic, and even the fluctuations of the elements were gone, but only the "eternal stagnation" in the magical effect that Siegel could think of was closest to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-six steps quickly came to an end, and two people stopped in front of the golden ring. This is an ordinary ring. There are no features other than the smooth surface. It seems to be worn on the little finger, but it may also be adapted to the smaller size and fingers of the "writer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring floats in the air, slowly spinning, seems to have endless charm. ‘This is a very important thing, containing all the expectations of the world’ – the same thoughts in both hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan swallowed, and this action was sharply captured by Siegel. "What do you think?" Evan said: "Is there something magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard shook his head and grabbed the finger of the defensive staff and made a slight effort. In the gap of the stick body: "There is no magic here, but every effect is similar to magic. I don't understand why this ring floats in the air. So we are still careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you come back and take this ring?" Evan's voice is still down. I have already reached out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel grabbed his wrist: "I still come, after all, I have more experience in magic protection."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan frowned, his wrists were slightly weak, but he was still tightly grasped by Siegel. "If you talk about the speed of reaction and your agility, you are not as good as mine. Besides, if you have a problem, you can help me, but if you have a problem, I will be at a loss. This time the wizard should hide far away. Just look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan took a step back and screamed angrily: "I won't fight with you! If you want to take it yourself, why should you smash me? As a king, how can you covet this little ring?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked helpless and walked up the steps with his staff and sat at the gate. "Let's follow you. When are you calm down, when will we talk again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this situation, Evan stunned and then 狠狠A lame, walked to the ring. He reached out and sneaked at Siegel's expression. There was a faint smile on the mage's face, but Evan saw the taste of teasing. That look seems to be saying, "Oh, His Majesty, everything is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn!" Evan took his hand and waved his sword. , slash the seat to the first row. The things here have long been fragile and shattered under the sharp "bonfire". Evan kicked the debris on the ground and watched them hit the wall. Siegel remained motionless and looked at him with the same expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand!" Avon pointed to Siegel: "You are an illusion! In fact, the real person has long been invisible, want to take away the gold ring. You are a villain with different words and deeds!" He went to the gold ring again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel raised the defensive staff, but hòu in Evan's defensive posture, the use of the stick scratched the back. "Do you want to understand? I have been tossing all night. I am going to be hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan found himself guessing wrong - there is a illusion that can be made like this Expressions and movements, can you speak perfectly? There was a suffocating temper in his heart, which made him uncomfortable! Evan grabbed his golden hair and shouted in hate and shouted hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, ah, ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He exhaled the last trace of air in the lungs The face was reddish, but hòu was breathing quickly, but this made him calm down. He used the corner of his eye to aim at the ring, but hòu went down to the steps and squatted on the steps, sitting next to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, what happened?" Evan said with some frustration: "I finally felt that something was wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel patted his shoulder and said: "After meeting the Knox Association. In order to prevent being controlled by them. I set a defense on my own mind. If I find out If you can not remind me in time, and trigger some spells at the same time. The situation here is rather strange, there is no magic fluctuation, but it still affects my thinking. I also want to understand after a few steps."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you give me this kind of protection in my heart?" Evan put the sword on the ground, rubbing his eyes with both hands, then hòu looked up. Siegel saw a shy expression on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I have already applied you a spell of mind protection, and you have a mind defense ring. This time it is not caused by magic effects, so these The means did not work." Siegel said to Evan: "As for the deeper means, you can only use it yourself." Siegel thought of Wendy. I went deep into her mind and thought that I could solve the problem, but now it seems that the trouble will continue in the future. So he said to Evan: "So far, I don't have a versatile and safe solution. So the King, continue to exercise your willpower!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well! I listen to you." Evan said: "The ghost ring can't affect you now, then you can hold it." He sighed: "I am destined to be a life without adventure!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel just smiled, but hòu the hand of the master grabbed the ring and placed it in front of him. Evan rolled his eyes, shook his head, and went to other places to check it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring is heavy in the hand, heavier than expected. Even if you get closer to observation. There is nothing special about it. Whether it's a spell that identifies a magical item or an analytical spell, it tells Siegel that it's just a normal gold ring. The straight jue of the Master can't believe the result of these spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All items exist for the purpose of interacting with them - Siegel keeps in mind the records in the Masters' Books. Then no longer use the molding spell, but use the most basic elemental power to influence it. Water, gas and earth elements do not respond to it, only when the fire element passes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
