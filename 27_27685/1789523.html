			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The real power is within reach of you. Why do you want to go far to hell and move to the reinforcements?" Siegel took a deep breath and stepped back. Two steps, and released the hand holding the defensive staff. On the fingers of his hands, the power of different elements condenses on the fingertips, and only two index fingers are empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empty is to better absorb the load, so that it becomes a hotbed of birth spells. Siegel is proficient in elemental energy, but not the plastic energy system is the mastery of using fireballs or ice storms, but the most pure elemental power essence as the curse system summoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary alien call is just a projection monster, killing nothing will not stay, and there are special spells to call it back. Rees is opening the space crack and picking up the devil's body. This power is certainly greater, but the process is much more complicated than the summoning projection, and it costs a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act of destroying space cracks requires a lot of mana as a support, and it's half the effort. Although it does not exceed the scope of Siegel's ability, he has new ideas and hopes to try. With the help of the Miereng nuclear, he has repeatedly tested the power of elemental aggregates, and he has gained a lot of experience in this area, but has never been used in combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that the devil's physique has a good resistance to many elements." Siegel said with a smile: "But I have always been curious, it is the right element. The spells are resistant, or the elements themselves. I guess they shouldn't be isolated from the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel index finger, a rainbow-colored ray strike In the right shoulder of the devil. No sound, no light, no explosion, no movement. The devil snorted, then laughed: "What kind of spell are you. Is it tickling? Even the ice-like rays of the trick will leave a white mark. Are you using illusion?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look carefully. The red skin is stupid." Siegel pointed. As he thought. Simple elements can avoid the devil's spell resistance when there is no spell structure. This is like the fire and ice that can't be illegally spelled by spell resistance, and can't be immune to the acid and poison produced by illegal surgery. Resistance is against spells, not the elements themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel projects pure elements, but not just simple launches, but rather attracts them to each other and gathers together at a given location. He made the elemental polymer at the fixed point, but this time placed the construction position in the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bulging big bag is generated from the devil's shoulder. Even the skin is transparent, but the devil still has no pain. He was terrified without pain, and he didn't know what to do with it. Not only the devil, but even Rees stopped for a while, curiously watching the effect of this spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental aggregate begins to wiggle, but there is no subsequent force to follow, making it difficult to maintain a stable shape. The earliest was the power of the gas element, which was the lightest, so it caused an inflated bag. The three elements also have the opportunity to form a stable structure when the fire element is thrown. A dramatic elemental reaction occurred immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four elements of frenzied energy erupted and exploded outside the devil's body. A fist-sized spheroidal flesh plaque appears on the devil's right shoulder. The sturdy body tissue plays a minor role in the face of elemental aggregates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there is a cracking effect, there is a prototype of material annihilation, just like the secret nuclear is almost the same." Siegel is still a practice test Leisurely appearance, focus on the power of their new means. "I have always wanted to know how the power of the nuclear collapse will be. Fortunately, there is no real need to try. Just a little bit of elemental aggregates can be blown up like this, and the secret can not take the entire Heim collar. Flattened to the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's flesh and blood squirmed, trying to heal and regenerate. Where does Siegel give him this opportunity, the index finger is a little bit, shoot the same five rays, and hit the devil's body different positions. After a while, several big bags bulged, and the devil shouted in horror, waving the flame sword in his hand and slashing it, trying to cut these big bags. He succeeded in getting rid of the two on his chest and arms, but what about the one on his head, do you have to behead yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed and immediately fled into the space crack, once he returned to hell, he was able to cast a variety of forms, abandon the "infected" part, and Rely on the powerful body resilience to survive. In the crack of the space crack, he can't do anything, which is too bad for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heavy fog!" Reese yelled, his wrinkled hands forward. A group of grayish white fog filled the entire room instantly. Every drop in the mist had a few pounds of weight, so the fog was so heavy that it was enough to restrain the action and break the spine. The laboratory is full of shattered sounds, and the various reagents and materials are mixed together to become unwanted waste on the ground. Rees believes that Siegel must have been trapped, and it is difficult to raise his hand and raise his head, let alone cast a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peculiar rays are so powerful that even the devil can easily kill. The poor guy had not yet had time to return to hell completely, and was blown into pieces, only to have a vicious curse to his summoner through the soul line. Rees didn't worry about this level of curse at all, but he didn't want to take his own body and try the rays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a new spell that relies on the existing defensive spell system to resist. The mage is able to cope with all situations. This sentence is a tribute to the Master, but there are some exaggerations. It should be that the Master can deal with all "known" situations. In the face of the unknown, even the best caster needs to investigate and study before there is a way to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the water droplets here are very heavy, their effects on light and peacetime are different, so the line of sight is severely disturbed in heavy fog. The effects of visually dependent spells, including true gaze (true knowledge), are greatly compromised and must be done by other means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spider Sensation!" Rees will use heavy fog and be prepared. He casts a spell and adds tremor perception to himself. It's like a spider squatting in the middle of a spider's silk. The movement of Siegel's body. Even the vibration caused by the heartbeat. It will pass through the ground and be captured by Rees. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he showed his spells, he couldnâ€™t find the figure of Siegel. Only the crushed medicament dripped to the ground within the range of the tremor perception. vibration. Excluding all the impossible explanations, the rest may be the result even if it is even more ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can he fly in heavy fog? Rees is unbelievable. The sensory sense of the spider can only feel the vibration from the solid, and can't know the change of the air, but this defect should be compensated by the cooperation of heavy fog? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rees thought for a second on withdrawing the heavy fog spell, still difficult to decide. The weird things I have encountered today are already too many. It is not good for yourself in the battle. He began to recite the spell, to remove the meta-anchor spell that controls his ability to move in space, and then left the place and fight again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't leave here." Siegel's voice suddenly sounded from behind him, and there was no information in the place where there was no tremor. Rees did not care about it and continued to remove the space anchor chain. "You can't go." Siegel's voice rang from the front of him, then the top of his head, and even his feet. "Don't you still understand? I will also play the spell of Knox. You still haven't figured it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...all this Is it fake?" Reese looked around and the spells in his hands failed because of fear. How terrible things are being controlled by the mind. How can Rees not understand? He is not ignorant of the spell of the Knox Association, a strange way. The means to control the human soul and mind completely... Rees saw the controlled walking dead, and he did not want that tragic thing to happen to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't believe it." Rees shouted: "I didn't have a trick, you are lying to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; As his voice fell, all the heavy fog around him was dispelled after a burst of light, and Siegel quietly suspended in front of him. He was really flying, Rees took a breath of air, how did he do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Rees read four killing magics, lightning and flames flying together to the shape of Siegel, which is enough to destroy a house. These magic hits Siegel and then passed through and failed to form any effect on him. The figure of Siegel reappeared from another place. The spell hit the wall and a violent explosion occurred. But in the roasting of the flames, Reese still felt cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Siegel, what can't happen?" The young mage flying in the air said: "Knox is in my hands, the elves The great work of Grand Vision suddenly ended in front of me, even Knox dominated the void in the air. I can't do it. The blood magic and mind control that you master are only part of my ability. As long as I think, I can use Infinite elemental power to cast Knox's spells, one can reproduce the emotional array of the red-red minaret! You certainly don't know how you are recruiting, because you are far worse than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
