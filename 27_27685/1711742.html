			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet has come to an end when he is awake again. The satiated guests were separated and left, and several others slept in the ground. The dwarf cooks and servants are packing up the banquet and collecting the rest of the food for reprocessing. Siegel saw Elinette sitting alone in front of the fireplace with a glass of wine in his hand. The fire shines on his face, portraying a tough line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked over, sat next to the dwarf and made a full meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf saw him and smiled happily. After eating, playing a long and loud fullness is the biggest compliment to the owner. Irene is beckoning, and naturally there are servants full of wine glasses. He handed the cup to Siegel and asked: "Your martial arts is learned with Lia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Elinette "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't call my husband, you can call my name directly." The dwarf swallowed a swig of cold ale and cleared his throat. Then went on to say: "You are the knight of Bill, and you have learned martial arts with Leah. Now you are a brave man. These are enough for you to get a bonus in the adventure. Now the only question is that you can What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I can help in the battle,” Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you have enthusiasm, but we don't lack combatants." The dwarf explained in detail: "Bill is an experienced warrior, and Leah is The superb ranger, like me, can also provide the power of healing. Dio - you have not seen him, but also a member of the team - he is extremely powerful and can face the most dangerous situations. We are all knowledge The guys who have passed the battlefield have already formed a tacit understanding. What can you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel lowered his head and thought about it. As a fledgling adventurer, compared to Elinette and others, Siegel can do very limited. He has clearly recognized this gap, but this gap cannot knock him down. He greeted the dwarf's gaze and replied with confidence: "I learn very quickly, I can make up any short board."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know me I didn't read you wrong!" Elinette smothered the rest of the glass and pointed at Siegel excitedly: "I like you like this! You know, you are a dwarf in your bones! The guys on the road have a dwarf warrior's heart. The great patron saint never makes a mistake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a perfect job to give to you now." Elint called Siegel to listen, and then whispered: "Dragon Lion Cliff and The nearby land belongs to the gemstone clan and is currently developed and managed by our diamond family. We found the entrance to the cave and went into the basic situation, but there are still many secrets uncovered. Collect as much information as possible. Our adventures helped. As the first race to come to the New World, our dwarves recorded a lot of historical information, and Longshi Cliff is no exception. This information is stored in the 'stone carving hall', but I need to deal with the clan. Great things, so I don't have time to check. You are a good man, you are qualified to enter there, and I heard that Leah said that your dwarf language is also very good. So kid, before you recover from frostbite, go to the information of Longshi Cliff. I turned to the bottom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What information do you want to check?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also I don't know, I will give it to you." Elinte said "I once told Leah and Bill about some speculation about Dragon Lion Cliff, but the actual situation has been covered up by history. Maybe you can find some clues from the book. If you can help the adventure process, then it would be better. "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the next day Siegel started working and was busy in the dwarf's library. This library records all the events of the New World that have been close to a thousand years, at least the part that can cause dwarfs' attention. Here is the first-hand history of the New World. Many people who want to discover secrets want to come here to find clues, but this is not an open library. About 70% of all books are not allowed to be viewed by outsiders, because most of this information is recorded in the dwarf's internal history, wilderness geography, undeveloped precious minerals and rune forging manuals, etc. It is the most important thing for the dwarves. They are reserved for the future development of their children and grandchildren. These books have a separate area for storage and are not accessible to outsiders. As for the information of other regions, the dwarves of Mora or the invited scholars are free to consult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
