			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel naturally did not see this scene of the Witchcraft on Fazza, otherwise it would be recognized that this is the magical means of the Knox Association, they The modified memory spells are quite clever and distinctive, and Siegel does not admit mistakes. Despite missing this clue, he found flaws in other aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has good reason to suspect that Karrug is a mage, pretending to be a witch offering, similar to his own situation. Perhaps his disguise is enough to deceive the orc warrior, but it is not sophisticated enough in front of another mage. Unlike Siegel, because there is no spell material package, plus the curse spells that have been used in blood magic, it is difficult to see the characteristics of the wizard from Siegel. On the other hand, "Kaluga", perhaps he noticed that the wand will reveal his identity and will not use it, and the spell material package is not carried on his body, but Siegel is still keenly discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the purpose of this "Karug"? Why are you looking for yourself? Segal thought while walking. Looking for two questions, why is it easier to guess Siegel? Under the assumption that Karug is a mage, he will certainly worry that the fluctuations of his spells will be detected by another witchcraft, causing unnecessary trouble. So he tried to get the foreign "Witches" to leave as soon as possible, or at least not to use witchcraft and establish witchcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s hard to guess what Karug’s purpose is. Siegel can only find clues from the conversation between them. No matter how to cover up, a person will always reveal clues in his own words. Why is he telling the story of the wolf group? Siegel thought about it. At first glance, he said that the purpose of the story is to warn Siegel: "There are already precautions against hungry bears." But in combination with his assumption that he is a mage, he is not actually a member of the wolves in the story. How to protect the responsibility of the wolf's nest? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘He wants to be the bear! 'Siegel’s flash of light flashed, and thought of this possibility. Naturally, the next question is raised: ‘Who is this person, will it be the Master of the Federation, and one of those who come to the North to perform special tasks? Is it because Macabu is surrounded by three-eye warlords, so it is necessary to create chaos behind the orcs to bring them out of the base camp? The Siegel idea suddenly became open, and the clues were connected step by step. ‘This is similar to the attack of the jackdaw tribe by the dragon. Most of the orc generals and thousands of captains launched attacks during the assembly of the town, which served as a beheading effect and mobilized the situation in the whole north. This plan is very bold. Should I reveal my identity and help him? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stopped and thought about it. The benefits of recognizing another wizard are immediate, casting kits, wands, spell wands, reels, and opportunities to learn magic from each other. Siegel has only a blood magician's spell book. The spell inside is very practical, but it also makes him feel uncomfortable. After all, not everyone likes the bloody means. Even if he only learns some fireballs, lightning beams and hail, his ability has already pushed the low-level spells to the limit, and he must add more new knowledge. He walked back a few steps and scared Lin Ke a lot, and quickly turned around to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, where are you going?" Lin Ke asked, "Do you want to meet again between the witch festivals? Don't be so dangerous." It’s a good thing, it’s good to be able to lie.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s stunned, not because of “deception of witchcraft”, but suddenly thought of Lin I have said something about the witch festival before. The two witch festivals in the town of bacon, which meet twice in one day, will attract the attention of the generals. Who knows whether it will lead to the impact of the chain and increase the risk of failure in the plan? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful and self-defeating, Siegel thought. I am not a real witch festival. Naturally, I will not interfere with his plan. Maybe I can help in the dark, and there is no harm in being cautious. So he turned again and returned to the area where he stayed. It is such a coincidence that the Knox Association’s mage also casts a ratchet, fearing that the “mask witch festival” discovered his true body and did not dare to kill him – after all, he was alone, and no other accomplice once again pretended to be a witch offering. If it wasn't for General Kaka who left the town of bacon, he would not dare to get rid of the Karug Witch Festival and use his identity to place traps in the town. Now it’s time to harvest the results. To be cautious, the Master of the Commonwealth decided to keep Siegel’s life for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know that Siegel, who escaped the catastrophe, returned to the accommodation area, and the spearman Akus still guards his position, you can see the experience here. There was a fight, but the spearman was unscathed. Several human slaves were carrying an orc's body and walking away, and a huge incision from the shoulder to the waist made him scream. Siegel nodded, sat back to the shop, and then let Akus come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well done, I promise to reward you." Siegel pointed to Lin Ke and said: "There is a bottle of potion here that can cure your simple injury. And restore some physical strength. If you still want to work for me, first serve the department and listen to his orders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was able to stand firm in the town of bacon, and through Lin Ke and Akus, it quickly heard a lot of news from the South.The nomads on the prairie have no heads, and the Benma people who have taken over the core of the Raven tribe have no power to unite with the grasslands, so the orc army continues to win.In the case of their own battles, many tribes were attacked by the two-headed Wolf King Wolff, and one could not escape, so they seized a lot.And the iron foot warlord Fuerte is confronting the deep water city coalition, who can’t help whoThe peeling warlord corrugated machine plundered and plucked his own hands and feet, divided into dozens of hundred people, scattered on the plains.If you see something, you will grab it. If you see someone, you will catch it. If you see a small army, you will kill it. If you see the brigade, you will run, and the human side will be bothered.According to the orcs, this is a rare time in a few decades. In addition to the things brought back by General Kaka, there will be spoils coming to the back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town of bacon is very lively, and the orcs are gathered here.Their skin color ranges from yellow to black, some are tall and fat, and some can also see the troll or the giants of the hills from the appearance.Siegel quickly developed the ability to distinguish the face of the orc. In the past, he could only distinguish it by his body shape and hairstyle. Now he has a lot of experience.Looking at it, the ugly faces of the orcs are everywhere, and there are disgusting smells everywhere.Moldy clothes, ** food residue, sour wine and strong sweat odor are even more terrible than the Master's poison cloudSiegel found the cloth and treated it with a little aromatic material and stuffed it into the nostrils.Anyway, there is a mask, no one can see the simple stuffy nose, but the sound of Siegel’s speech becomes strange.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel spends most of his time in the accommodation area, relying on thinking spells to pass the timeAs a witch offering, it is difficult for him to personally listen to the news. The ordinary orc is born to fear him, and he can't leave this identity, and make up the half-orc wandering around, so he can only rely on the increasingly strange forest.He was a little annoyed and felt that he had made another mistake: this is the first time that Siegel’s adventure was alone. No one told him what to do, he didn’t have a very clear goal, and he was even more unaccompanied.Losing someone who can be assured of negotiating, Siegel is like a leg, so that his actions are difficult, such as in the mudThe Walled Mountain Range seems to be incompatible with him, setting a layer of obstacles for each of his actions and choices.He is in a period of embarrassment, strength and insight are in a bottleneck, and some problems encountered have no good solution.At present, what he can do is to gradually improve his strength and make his magic means richer and more powerful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a difficult thing to get into meditation in a noisy place, but Siegel’s constant attempts to control the boundaries between lucidity and contemplation are only a little bit A little progressThere is a strange energy fluctuation in the air, similar to the magic enchantment, but more vitalThis energy is like a mischievous bear child. It hides most of the time, but it always comes out unexpectedly to destroy and disturb the thoughts that Siegel has just stabilized.Siegel was overwhelmed by the toss, so he made up his mind to find the source of this energy.He looked up and turned his attention to self-meditation to detect energy fluctuations, looking for hidden information with his eyes.At Longshi Cliff, he had inadvertently entered this state and discovered the taro suspended in the air.Later, after becoming a mage, he knew that this ability is called ether vision, just as dwarves can see through the darkness, angels can see the illusion, and some mage can be trained to find traces of energy scattered around.For a mage who is determined to learn enchantment and magic, this is a must-have skill.Siegel’s spells are not all learned, and there is no money to invest in various skills, so he can only rely on groping to try to reproduce the etheric vision at the time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first it was a light blue line in the field of vision, like a faint mistSometimes there is a light beam flashing from the corner of the eye, but nothing is found when I look back.The information that ordinary people receive through vision accounts for more than 80% of all the information they receive, but there are still too many things that cannot be recognized by both eyes.The mage believes that the eyes are the windows of the soul. To become a powerful mage, you must find ways to expand your horizons and see more levels of things.The prophet's goal is the net of destiny, the plasticist focuses on the elemental passage, the necromancer observes the fire of the soul, and the curse explores the cracks in the plane. Each direction of the special research requires a corresponding observation means. This is the blacksmith's furnace. Farmer's hoe and knight's horse<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel believes that Linke can see the "spirit" and is also a special visual ability.The Master had specifically asked him about this matter, intending to learn this skill.However, Lin Ke can't tell how his ability was acquired. He only said that he was a gift from Mother Earth."I was hit by a storm on the sea and was taken to the tundra in the north. I was dying.In order to be alive, I want the Mother of the Earth to pray and repent of her atonement.After I kissed the earth, I had this ability after I opened my eyes.The New World is a magical place. I settled down next to the stone according to the instructions of the mother.I pray daily, with the help of the soul, the village is well organized, and the half-orcs can hardly live and work in peace.You have to ask me how I can learn this skill, but I want to persuade you to embrace the Mother Earth as soon as possible and find your own life goals. This ability will naturally have”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
