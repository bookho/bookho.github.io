			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is neatly dressed, accompanied by a crib, gently stroking Isaac’s new soft hair. The magic pet has already flown to call Moore. It is now more and more capable of speaking, and has been able to say two or three jokes on its own - just hard to make people laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment came the sound of armor and scabbard collision, the Raven Baron flew back. The black raven shouldered the task of looking after the baby, and his master pushed the door out and waved at the knight, and the two came to the study together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is your fortress building?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol looks very happy, "Everything is going well. The ropeway system transports stone and wood, and our masons are skilled craftsmen. The dwarves are also very Help, some places also use rune reinforcement. Certainly not comparable to the city of Mire, but it is enough for the general attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said Give Siegel a light-tasting honey and then take a cup of it. “It’s totally unexpected to encounter these crawling dragons. A fog over the past two days shrouded the wilderness and lasted for a whole day. After the fog spread, the crawling dragons were not far away, and they opened the grass to find something to eat. It is estimated that they are lost because of the fog. Since the construction work of the fortress is the first, we did not bother them. But then it may be that the fire of cooking attracted their attention, a large group of crawling dragons rushed over, we Hurry to the wall to avoid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed a few times and seemed very relaxed: "The group of crawling dragons rushed to extinguish the fire and overturned our food. Then they gotten worse and wanted to eat our food reserves, so I ordered the attack and turned them into food reserves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sipping wine, Listen to him and continue to say. According to Moore's recent observations, this area west of the Wall Mountain Range is very peaceful. There is nothing happening in peacetime, and climate change is not too intense. "If you can immigrate to the past, the land there can support the peasants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a shadow of the barbarian?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There has not been discovered yet." Moore replied: "On the one hand, we did not send cavalry. The scope of investigation is limited, and the fortress should not be caused before it is built. Note. On the other hand, when the career is good, we observe whether there is any smoke on the horizon, and we have nothing to gain for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and smiled: "So far. You have done a good job. But remember not to leave the fortress easily. In addition to urging the construction process, you should also pay attention to the movements of the dwarves. They will go sooner or later, continue on the road to the west, and even death can not Stop them, you and I don't even have to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The construction of the fortress can't be separated from them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is known to everyone. I want to be basically finished. They are also leaving. Although they take what they need, they have helped us a lot. Don’t say anything, you have to prepare for them. Good things for travel. They may want An An Walking quietly does not attract the attention of Mora, but we must not let them empty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol nodded, and took the chest to ensure that he could do it. To. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master heard his assurance, but laughed. "What do you take for your chest?" He waved his hand and spread a piece of paper on the desk with dense numbers and forms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mor came over and signed the name on this owed." Siegel pointed to the end of the piece of paper. The signature of his creditor is already on the list, and the witness is the name of Fitzak. Moore did not say anything, took the ink brush and brushed his name, in triplicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you look at the contents?" Siegel put away one of them, and the other two gave Moore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I swear allegiance to you..." He noticed Siegel's harsh eyes and swallowed the words behind him and quickly spread the paper in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half is Moore’s loan of gold coins to Siegel to complete the castle’s terms, totaling 114,000. The latter is a detailed cost, including the cost of stone, wood and artisans and the cost of transportation. The detailed list is calculated by Fazak. According to the general price of the southern part of the New World. In fact, due to the proximity to the city wall and the forest is not far away, the cost of materials is not as high as on paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give a name to the fortress." Siegel suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol blinked and humbly said: "The Lord Lord, you are still named."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "That is your fortress, why should I name it?" Siegel patted him on the shoulder. Said: "You have to manage the fortress, and then slowly return the money. I have no other support, you need to pay for the debt, and then let Fazak pull away from the warehouse here. West of the city wall is a piece Broad land, your fortress is built on the most critical throat. Can you hold it, can you develop it, this responsibility is very heavy, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Moore understands the intention of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a long way to go from becoming a knight to becoming a lord. The knight only needs to understand how to fight, how to maintain his equipment and horses, how to keep on Keep your own vows in adversity. If you become a lord, you must understand the construction of the territory, the economy, the food, and the soldiers. Now I will give you a fortress, and there is no farming yet, but I will probably have a lot of things afterwards. Be prepared.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees his expression heavy and seems to be worried, so he comforts him and says, “Don’t worry, most things can be slow. Slowly, as long as you can do a few things, you can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore looked up, his right hand clenched his fist on his chest and said firmly: "I "Must do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good!" Siegel said to him with a smile: "After the fortress is established, you must first strictly guard the entrance and exit of the tunnel. Anyone who wants to pass, whether it is a person or a thing, even a beetle must check I will enchant my spells, and the dwarves will use runestones to ensure their safety, but the most important thing is not the secret language, but the people and institutions that are inspected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After that, you have to build a cavalry reconnaissance unit. Whether you want to choose from a serge or a mercenary, you must firmly master this unit. I want you to explore all the circumstances around the fortress and establish it with the barbarian. Contact and try to work with them. Heim is understaffed and lacks resources, but with the help of the fortress we can mobilize resources west of the Wall Mountain Range."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor Asked: "If you hire a barbarian to fight for us? Just wear the same armor and want to come to others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shakes his head: "Here In the war initiated by the field elves, the more troops you invest, the more you lose, and you will understand why in the future. In fact, the power of human beings is still there, but it is divided into small castles and there is huge supply pressure. It’s like a strong man In the slot, it can't be fully developed. But if you can bring in what they need, just like throwing a rope to the brawny, after he is picked up, his threat is different."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I probably understand." Mohr replied: "In addition to guarding the fortress and the entrance, and dealing with the barbarian, what else do you need to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ding Bao will open a canned food workshop at the fortress. Janis is responsible for selling on the tunnel side and purchasing goods for you. Your pure military fortress must be separated from these workshops and businesses, but it must also rely on the funds they provide to support it. You still owe me money, you have to face it from here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My life belongs to the Lord of the Lord!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid! What I have to die is that the element guards do it, and I don't need you. Siegel said to him: "This owe was drafted by Fazak. He gave you a lot of money, and I probably have it." But this is the margin you have to pay for independent leadership. As long as you do well, the fortress is just a starting point. By the way, have you got a good name? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought about it," Moore said. "What is the starting point?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK, it's set. "Siegel waved his hand: "The specific thing you go to find your grandfather, then return to the starting point as soon as possible." He unfolded a long-written command, added the name of the starting point's outpost, and drew his own badge with his wand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the official order." You are now the highest commander of the starting point. But you are only a knight now, and only if you have a title can really have a territory, you have to continue to work hard. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
