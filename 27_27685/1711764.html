			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no official name in the north of Deepwater City, but most of them are called "the savage site." Here is a vast grassland with only a few hills scattered throughout the grasslands, and most of them are flat. It is the sea to the east, the rolling hills and large forests to the south, and the mountains and mountains to the west and the north. The unobstructed terrain in the middle leads to dramatic weather changes and harsh environments. Adding the upstream herd can not cover the entire grassland, there is too much space for wildlife activities. In the spring, there are colorful flowers in the mountains and plains. The predators who wake up from hibernation trample on these flowers and wander around to hunt. In summer, the pastures can be high to the waist, but the mosquitoes are disturbed, and the rain is densely covered; At that time, the wolves ran in groups, hunting for the fertile beef and sheep that they ate. In the winter, the wind whistling all day, and ice and snow brought cold death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention the tornadoes and heavy rains that suddenly come here at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nomads living on the grasslands, they unite, fighting with the sky, fighting with the earth, fighting with others, hoping to take advantage of the beauty of the water, A leisurely day. They do not establish a country, nor do they have a lord. There is only one tribe, led by parents, and constantly migrating on the grasslands. They do not believe in God, but only believe in the three spirits - the spirit of nature, the spirit of ancestors, the spirit of war. These spirits teach them the ability to survive and multiply and help them live in this cruel place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deepwater City once wanted to expand into this land, build a town or build a castle. They did achieve some results in the early days, and many pioneers began to move north under a lot of incentives. But over the years, these places have gradually become ruined – or the changes in soil and water have caused the town to lose its foundation, or the looting of orc bandits has destroyed settlements. In short, Deepwater City later found that it was a better choice to let these nomadic savages live in the north and give them the grassland to stop the orc's pioneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the immigrants withdrew, and only those abandoned towns remained on the grasslands, telling the history of the past. Many wreckage walls can barely cover the wind and rain, and some merchants will use these building ruins as a reference for the road, so that they can determine their position in the grassland. The grazing swimmers also come here to check in order to prevent the robbers from occupying them as camps. Therefore, I can often see campfires here and meet the same passengers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel, Janet and Jarre are escaping from such a ruin, they have encountered seven wolves before, the "kitten" horse I was bitten by the leg, but fortunately I did not hurt the bones, but I could only walk slowly. It happened that three people saw the ruins here, so they decided to stop and treat them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard taught the Siegel a lot of things, including simple dressing and ambulance. And some of the botany knowledge he has learned from the Masters Association, although not enough to let him configure the pharmacy, can help him find some medicinal herbs that are effective in wound healing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet helped him to wrap the wound with the horse, and his heart was very annoyed. Her equestrian was just learning soon. When she encountered the wolves, she could not control the mood of the mount, causing the horse to be shocked and running around, which was surrounded by wolves. Fortunately, the other two were rescued in time to avoid losing important travel tools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, take a rest, you can continue on the road tomorrow. Although you can't run, this horse can still carry you on." Siegel comforted her. Road: "It's not a big deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it is not far from the Jackdaw tribe, it is still very careful." A face, the mood has not been high. He believes that he has done extra work: in addition to teaching the language of the Siegel Jackdaw tribe - which has taken up a lot of rest time - the number of passengers is also one more than Sigel. The thing that bothered him the most was that he didn’t succeed in raising the commission! Whenever he thinks about this, he feels strange, how he was convinced by the little woman, why isn’t the impression? This mission has already found the guarantor, actually the owner of the bubble barrel pub, the stubborn but powerful dwarf, Jarrell did not dare to offend him. So along the way, he no longer mentions the commission, always has a face and never sings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The threat of the horse can not run, and his wounds will attract predators." The poet said: "The wolves actually Well, it’s a big deal to lose the horse to save lives. But some horrible and evil creatures will smell the bloody smell of the wound, keep track of you, kill you, eat your flesh and blood. What are you worried about? ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Jarrell rushed in which direction and saw that there was nothing in the sky except the clouds. Janet’s laughter also made him understand that he was being played. He hid the laughter in his heart and figured out how to retaliate back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit of this land may have heard their conversation, and it took a little while to be fulfilled. A group of small black spots flew in the sky, gathered like a dark cloud, and made a special eye in the blue sky. It marched against the wind and quickly caught the attention of several people. Segal's hand on the pergola, squinting and trying to see it, can only be vaguely distinguished that it is a group of birds. Janet’s eyes seemed to be so good that she looked at it for a while and said, “That’s a bunch of crows.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s not an ordinary crow.” Seoul said: "You see them hovering in the air, quickly dive and descend, but they quickly rise and continue to sway and hover. The crows don't leave, just repeat this state there."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people watched for a long time, then saw that the crows would fall to the ground. Everyone waited for a while and didn't see any birds flying again. Affected by the uneven terrain of the grasslands, several people could not see the situation where the crows landed, and only estimated the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go check it out, I'm a little curious about what's there." Siegel puts out the equipment, hangs the shield and the machete, and Find nets and canvas in the backpack. Jenny nodded and was silently prepared. She sat on her ear and spoke gently, touching her mane and rubbing the injured horse. The horse bowed her head and let her ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Weird things represent danger, and don't take this risk." The poet is holding his arm, and his tone is unpleasant: "Let's go to the jackdaw." The tribe, don't take the initiative to cause trouble. This grassland is inherently dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go look at the situation, otherwise it will always be bothered by this matter. Siegel said: "Maybe there is just a deep valley, the crow flies away from the bottom of the valley, so we can't see it. Maybe there is a dead buffalo on the ground, the crow is just eating. Maybe not, who knows?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poetess saw Siegel’s attitude resolutely, so he had to turn over and go together. He stared at the back of the employer and figured out how to make more money to make up for the risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people have gone for a while, and as Siegel expected, there is indeed a deep valley, about 10 meters wide. This cracked deep valley is hidden behind a large piece of thatch, and it can't be seen a little farther away. Siegel estimates that this is caused by an earthquake, and it has been a long time since the traces of rain erosion. It is about 30 meters from the ground to the bottom of the valley, and the entire rift is half a mile long. There is also a small stream at the bottom of the valley, and some shrubs grow around it. The slopes are not too steep and the soil looks solid and there are no signs of landslides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked over the canyon and found a hidden body in the shadows. Far from observing, the corpse should belong to a human man. He was very strong during his lifetime and occupied a large part after his death. His cause of death was that his mouth was inserted by a spear, and he came out from the back of the head and nailed him to the ground. Siegel wanted to leave, but found a crow coming out of the back of the body, where it was just raised by a spear, forming a hidden space. The bird looked at him with a pair of smart eyes, then flew high and made a harsh, hoarse and angry whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet’s face looked annoyed and waved his hand, seemingly dispelling the odor that did not exist. He urged: “Let’s go, a corpse. It is likely that the savage fights with each other. This kind of thing happens frequently in the grasslands, and there is nothing to look at."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel hesitated for a while, or turned over, Start walking down the rift. Janet followed him without a word, with a scorn in his hand. The poet kept groaning: "I really hate Miss Young Master!" But I also took out the fine sword, about ten steps away from the two, and slowly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shrub next to the Rift Valley is a purple golden cow, and now there are some bunches of red fruit hanging. Siegel didn't know if the thing was poisonous, so be careful to use the machete to open the shrub and slowly descend. Janet had the same kind of learning, but Jarre picked some red fruits in the back and chewed them as snacks in their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They quickly came to the side of the body, only to discover the extraordinaryness of this dead body. Although the blood on the ground has already dried up, the water in the body is almost exhausted, but there is no smell at all, and there is no nuisance to the flies. This strong man was killed by a blow, his mouth and throat were bloody, and there were no other scars on his face. He was on the upper body and had a blue tattoo on his chest that looked like a bird's wings. There were no traces of fighting around the body, and there was no footprint, just some shattered soil. So Siegel judged that this guy was thrown after being killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
