			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say the ordinary flesh, even the thick steel armor is like a paper paste in front of the fine gold. Please search ()! The fastest-changing novel, the half-dragon inspiration, broke out and hit the target for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;弩vectors slanted down from the shoulders, with broken bones and flesh and blood tied to the ground. Lear, who was naked, screamed and yelled like a frightened hound, sitting on the floor and crying with his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously beyond everyone's expectations, and no one has thought that he actually did not fight. "Is there no poison on your sputum?" The half-dragon man with a skeptical gaze, the latter shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in front of you is funny, but it hides the key information that has an impact on the battle. The rules of the college prohibit the summoning of non-intelligent moving objects, but this newly emerging individual is obviously not very smart, why can it fight? Siegel can only speculate that his intelligence level is just slightly higher than that of animals, and the word "smart" bypasses the rules of the kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, if you have self-awareness and prioritized self-protection, you can appear?" Siegel’s heart was overjoyed, and his left foot was forced to step on the ground. Step on the magical array that is buried. When using physical contact, the magic array can obey the master's command and use the combination of deformation to form a spell grammar. This is a simplified version of the magic spacecraft's spell shell, which can be driven without a secret core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Summon... Summon Devils!" Siegel issued instructions to let the Factions display the simplest summoning spells and throw the bad devils to Lear. And increased the speed of adding bricks to the spell blocks. When the inferior demon appeared, it seemed to be a bit dull and unable to understand the situation around him. Siegel deliberately did not give orders to them, so that their spirit is closer to the source and self, and more reflects his own intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of a bad demon is to evolve, regardless of the evolution of the cost. In their eyes, Lear and Siegel are delicious meals, and the old man is closer, so they launched a wave of attacks on Lehr, and they rushed to the claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whip of lightning and flame is smashed, and many of the bad devils are directly smashed into ashes. This undoubtedly aroused the fierceness of the demon hunter, they rushed forward even more madly, even if there is a flame shield, do not hesitate. They can't cause substantial damage at all. After all, Lear's protective spells are not furnishings. The claws of the inferior magic can only catch the Mars. But their culling affected Lear's movements, and the efficiency and accuracy of casting spells began to decline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel seized the opportunity and immediately pressed the curse to the past! The first crack of the dam appeared. The original calm space suddenly showed the pale green halo of paralysis, rubbing Lear's body swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille is very decisive. He knows that although he does not necessarily fail, he will definitely pay more than his opponent's concentration and energy. Since the loss has to be stopped immediately, he put away the curse-like spell, the right hand is claw-like, and the volley catches the ****. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, he and the avatar exchanged positions. The dam of the mantra was pushed down by Siegel, and the accumulated spell energy slammed down like a waterfall. In a flash, Lier was overwhelmed, and even the chance of screaming was not given. Just dissolve it completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the avatar and the body have similar scent, the spell has no trouble finding the body. The remaining energy hits the ground, trying to exert the power of cursing on the earth. It is definitely a futile job, so the spell collapses, the energy overflows, and the continuous shock wave turns into a gust of wind, blowing in a burst. The ground frozen by the frost is under the influence of the storm. It became a scattered hail and continually hit Siegel's spell shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the invasion of this energy storm, Siegel also had to retreat, shrinking the body to minimize the impact of the impact. Instead of trying to deal with deformation transmissions or other spells, he saved the movements and energy of these spells and tried to detect Lear's movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensory senses of the human eye and the senses of the mind are affected. The storm also shields the sound and smell. Lear disappeared from his vision as invisible. Siegel hesitated for a second and quickly walked to the gnomes and others. Lear has a certain possibility of catching three of them as hostages to sing Siegel, which must be guarded against. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Lear did not do this, he came to the air and found one of the nine room balls. Stretched out and took three shots on the room ball, then read a spell. All the rooms returned to their original position and the door to the Anna room was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lear, a weird creature floated out of Anna's room. It is like a pointed hat with a spiral serrated mouthpiece. The thinner and thinner body floats in the air. Four slender and long-clawed hands are distributed on the side of the body, responsible for plugging into the huge mouthparts. food. This monster has two floors and is wide enough to swallow Siegel. Although the eyes of this creature, it does not seem to prevent it from finding the direction of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, this is the magic sunflower! Go away... No, walk slowly, climb and climb into the room." The dwarf was shocked, but fortunately Haven't forgotten the companions around you: "Don't use magic, whether it's toward yourself or someone else's, it will attract its attention and be sucked! This thing is called a mage killer, don't mess with it!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome is somewhat convinced: "Can the balloon-like figure hold the fist of the Mithril Golem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Of course not, but you also know that the Mithril Golem will not fly." The dwarf continued: "It not only absorbs magic, but also releases magic, which is more annoying than the immune immune system. Listen to me, Don't talk, you have to aim at us before... Oh, my goodness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magical sunflower floated out of Anna’s room, and The previous one is exactly the same. At a glance, Siegel used the method of copying magical creations and exchanged points. Anna should have transferred all of her points and permissions to Lear, otherwise she could not explain why he could manipulate the Elf room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is still filled with the remaining breath of the curse spell "torrent", which was suddenly sucked by the magic sunflower. Name them only to absorb the power of the spell, but in the feeling of Siegel they also took a trace of life. If you close your eyes, it is like being in the desert, losing the oasis of elemental magic, only the yellow sands of the sky. With the power absorbed, the magic sunflower began to split, from two to eight. Each body is slightly smaller than the original, but has an unsatisfied appetite for pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Draining his mana, sucking his energy, just leave the ** left!" Lear waved, Magic Kwai Initiating a charge to Siegel. The zigzag four-layered teeth are constantly rotating, and as soon as they are rolled in, they become flesh. Siegel, which exudes strong magical fluctuations, is the best food, enough to make them prosper into a single army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical image of its practical immune magic is the best choice to deal with this creature, at least to make the magic sunflowers retreat, but want to eliminate this Creatures are really impossible. Magic sunflower is very clever, how to fight with the Master in their blood. Using the wind and mind communication, the army composed of the magic sunflower is seamless, and the combination of spells is a hundred times better than the wizards who are fighting each other. In the front of the battlefield against the Master, Magic Sunflower can easily win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't want to escape, I will ban your transmission, so you can't leave here! You don't want to try to deceive the magical sense of the sunflower, just leaked There is energy in your spell that allows the magic sunflower to be positioned. They won't let you go! Hahahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille's laughter is not continuous Absolutely, but it also came to an abrupt end. Siegel took a heavy machine gun from the space bag, rotating the six barrels and the live ammunition supplied by the long chain, everything has nothing to do with magic. This was originally Siegel's weapon to prevent falling into the dead magic zone. All the parts can be run away from the magic. The alloy's warhead is not as strong as the fine gold, but it is enough to crush the scales and skin of the dragon under continuous impact. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a tear-like "squeaky" sound, Siegel's dual-handed heavy-duty rotary-turbine gun fired out the flame tongue and unreservedly hit the magical sunflower. The magic sunflower can absorb the power of the spell, but it is not bulletproof. For a time, the magical sunflower was cut into pieces by metal rays, and it fell from the air like rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical sunflower immediately uses the magic, forming a creepy palm and grabbing the past, trying to smash Siegel with a five-major corpse, this trick can always be against the thin wizard Produce the effect and make them difficult to see at the end. But the magic sunflower has no conception of the weapon of the goblin, thinking that it is only a kind of powerful engineering gun, it has only one level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the vibrations from the weapons in his hands, the touch of powerful firepower made Siegel laugh. In the face of the force fieldman who grabbed it, he used only one arbitrary door to escape. The bullets are drawn across the air, leaving the same dead path as the lava. After destroying an empire, the magical sunflower has no invincible power and has been fried into pieces in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only those wizards who are prepared can defend against the firearms of the Goblin. Lear took out the reel, deflected the magnetic field and dislodged the metal, and flew all the bullets that were shot. The stray bullets have spread and have threatened three inhuman wizards. God knows which shining Mars will take their lives, so Siegel loosened the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
