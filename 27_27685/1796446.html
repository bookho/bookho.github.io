			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd exited the room, and Siegel’s left hand was carrying a hundred-faced scorpion, holding the morning priest Aurora. WwW.XsHuoTXt.com A reading book ·ka hu·"The big sacrifice, help me, my arm is hurt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are now his sleeve is already It was soaked in blood, but it was only supported by the power of the spell, so it did not drip down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, my God, Countess, how did you do this?" Saulk, the chief of the palm print, exaggerated his mouth and asked with concern: " Would you like me to take some ointment? It can speed up your recovery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, there is work." Siegel barely lifted his arm and stuffed it Morning priest in the hands of the pastor. Aurora did not say much, holding the sacred emblem to make the healing light shine on the wound. The broken blood vessels healed and the bones were rejoined together, and the whole arm was as comfortable as the warm water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor kept chanting the prayers, casting spells three times in a row, and then said to Siegel: "The Earl of Siegel, your arm will not deteriorate any more. But don't use force for a month or two, try to recuperate. Is there any problem with the other hand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I use Left-handed spells are not affected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's good. If it's convenient, you can come to me every day, so you can recover faster. My few A member of the church told me about you and greatly appreciated many of the policies in your territory. I always wanted to go to Heim to see it. I don’t know if it is inconvenient?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Heim will always welcome you to visit, the main sacrifice adults. There should be more exchanges between the two big, like the Temple of the Morning, the Heim collar is also an important part of the starry kingdom."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very much looking forward to the scenery of Heim." After Aurora's gentle ceremony, he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the room has been left, the Guardian Card **** will return the Stardust to Siegel. He still squinted and said nothing. After completing the task, he returned to the door of the room to stand guard. Siegel thought about it and said to him: "Your anti-magic force field armor is flawed, it is difficult to cope with all the situations, and I think you should have some useful long-range weapons. A reading book · k ahu · I will provide The sample is for your reference. Who are you going to contact?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take it to me, Count Earl." Sorke ran over. Holding a small jar in his hand: "This is a therapeutic ointment that can eliminate swelling and pain, speed up recovery, and does not match any spells and drugs. Apply once a day. It doesn't cost anything. If anything, you Although I told you to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and smiled and patted his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear Master has been standing at the door, slightly squinting, looking at Siegel with gray eyes. He did not use any magic. Perhaps it is known that it is not appropriate to use a spell on this occasion, or that Siegel has enough power to guard against it. After the palm print manager smiled and left, he walked up. Siegel nodded to him, and the two men went to the deck one after the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves have completed the work of cleaning the deck and are now negotiating with the Royal Fleet approaching the stone boat and asking them to keep their distance. This fleet will be the first formed army to know the replacement of the king, and then they will bring the king's script to the Star City and then tell the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect Aaron to surrender the throne," Lear said first. "I didn't expect your spell ability to be so unique. The level of use is also very high." It’s a pity, but it’s a pity, but it’s no big deal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As a conversation between a mage and a mage, I want to ask you, Would you still be against Evan?" Siegel looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no need is necessary." Lear said: "I don't have to lie to you, Siegel ** division. The Lord of the Morning has already lowered. Clear intentions, and I don't believe you didn't see the magical protection spells contained in the Light. And I know that you are ready to fight. As long as I have any moves, you will fight back, then we will both be born. Spell battle. If it is before today, I will have the confidence to win. But now I don't think so. The end result is that you can't help me, but I can hardly catch you. But as long as the Master is confronted, then learn the city. It’s hard for you to get the water from the Master’s lord. It’s hard to win the new king. Now we have a temporary balance. Read a book ·ka book hu·but this balance has begun to tilt, I will gradually gain the upper hand.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not satisfied," Lear said bluntly: "I want what Evan has given you. The power contained in it is something you can't understand. You are not a king. You can't bear the fate of that thing." Burden. Give it to me and give it to the school, you will get all the spells, spells, books and knowledge you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your kindness I thought you wouldn't mention it." Siegel spread his hand, and the scorpion scorpion lay quietly on his palm, not radiant. "No, I won't give you this thing, I won't give you anything. From today, the federation is the federation, and I am me. Let the school counselors who are staying in Heim go home, they are going home. It doesn't make sense to stay there, it will bother me. It is a lesson to destroy the Three Peaks Tower. There is no need to let the New Federation and Heim Collar suffer disaster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Without the help of the Masters Association and the City of Learning, the things that the Federation lacks will never make up for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a voice came in, with With a unique lazy taste: "There is nothing left of it. You can find a way to make a new one. The most terrible thing is that you don't have the heart and the liver, and it's too hard to heal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dwarf swayed and showed William's appearance. He stretched out a little and yawned a big yawn: "I have been working here for a long time, and I finally waited for you to come out. Like it, it collapsed, right? If it collapses, it will collapse. It will be a big deal." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille nodded, as always, calm: "It seems that this is the clear meaning of the federation, I already know. Now I have to leave, here Although the scenery is good, it doesn't mean anything. It's better to delve into the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the stick of the sergeant and turned and left. William stood next to Siegel and said to him: "I just felt the power of legendary spells outside. How about, you didn't lose the face of the federation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Siegel snorted: "The situation is very obvious now. The Federation has no choice but to be self-reliant. You should not do other things, run less, first you will All the spells are left behind. After that, you still have an important task to find the Lion King Alexander. If you don't say anything, ask him, the Masters Association and the School of Education prepare for the Starvation Federation. Ask him to give him no food. If you don't help..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, if he doesn't help, I will dismantle its bones first!" William spit into the sea and spit, then I rubbed my teeth. Just like a hungry cheetah. When he finished, he fluttered his wings and flew up into the sky, patrolling around the stone boat, ready to find something to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A king guard came to the deck before the conflict between the Royal Fleet and the short life. The horn sound is used to pass the command to back off. Siegel couldn't understand their secret words, but the guess was similar. Soon, with the help of the Aurora High Priest, the matter of the script was passed on to the fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where, if I can fly around, it will be fine. Although I have seen many magics, I am still very excited every time!" Looking at the Royal Fleet, it was like talking to himself and talking to Siegel. He cleared his throat, this time really talking to Siegel: "The Earl, after the new king is enthroned. I will still worry about the condition of the old king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should give Evan this thing... I will go down and say." Siegel returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, will you feel that I have a lot of mouths?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you say It’s right, why not say it?” Siegel looked at Salk and said to him: “The king has a loyal knight, a sacred pastor, a wise scholar, and needs sharp eyes and awkward Aaron has a broad mind, he trusts Evan, and you should do the same. You should think more when you serve the king, far from the new big. There is also a lord lord, always staring at your actions. If the king is dissatisfied or receives damage, this damage will be added to you thousands of times. Believe me, it is a spell that death can't avoid revenge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Prince. I fully understand what you mean, please rest assured. You don't know me, although I have no use, but I am afraid that I am the most loyal to His Majesty the King."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope you are useful." Siegel said: "About Aaron's confession Things, Heim’s full cooperation, you don’t have any troubles on the old side. Today’s handover ceremony can be so smooth. It’s too easy, it’s really the best day in history. Because of this, The finishing touches must be done well. Your list should be carefully verified, there should be no gaps, and there should be no gaps left for speculators. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
