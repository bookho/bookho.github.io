			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language and accent of the Jackdaw tribe allowed the guards to believe in Siegel’s words and no longer treat them with an alert attitude. They took out a bag of kumiss and exchanged with the traveler, but did not expect to get the best wine from the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, even at the time of the contest, I couldn’t taste such a wine." The guard grinned and admired, while not forgetting the companion share it. "But there is no shortage of such things soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does this mean? Is the elf doing business with you?" Siegel frowned. Asked alertly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the guards, there was a struggle, and he looked at the group of travelers in front of him. They are all authentic humans with wounds on their bodies. At present, humans and elves are fighting. These people should not inform, so he said: "The warriors of the grasslands have gathered together to give a lesson to the elves who plant trees everywhere! The new king of Khan is rising from the Holy Land and leading the storm of the knights. Sweeping the entire grassland!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel grabbed the man's collar and dragged him to the front: "What do you say? The jackdaw tribe wants to fight the elves? Does this mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard wants to push away the powerful hands, but finds that he is controlled by a strange force and can't resist. There were a pair of whirlpools in the black eyes, which made him involuntarily say: "Yes! We will defeat the elves and seize the hegemony of the New World!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Geer released his hand, and the guard restored his ability to act. He reached out to the hilt on his waist and prepared to greet his companions to take the group of travelers. Mana and the knights reacted quickly and touched the sword and the crossbow on the saddle. Siegel made a snap and the guards on the prairie swayed twice, then all fell asleep on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, it seems that the Jackdaw tribe has a big deal." Siegel turned over and slammed his hips. "You must stop them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly whip, all the way, they ride to the Holy Land. Siegel was immersed in meditation on horseback. What made the giant Kerry’s brain hot, and he had the idea of ​​attacking the elf? The guard just said a word. "Khan King", it seems that the power on the grassland has a new structure. So the idea of ​​sending troops is Kerry’s own idea, or is it the choice of a new power circle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His thoughts were interrupted by a suffocation, and the crowd had already entered the Holy Land. The power of the elements is still around. However, it is impossible to form an effective operation in vitro. Siegel almost forgot the feeling of this uncomfortable, and now he has to adapt again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of things are not handled well without magic, and the Master knows that his strength has been greatly reduced. He tried to find a way to cast spells here, but he has repeatedly failed. This time, I don’t know what kind of things to wait before, and I must continue to find ways to solve the problem of casting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the same as the anti-magic area. Instead, it will break the structure of the formed spell and become useless. No power emerges out of thin air. It is a chaotic idea of ​​God. To produce an effect, it also requires the realization of rules. Siegel repeats over and over again, starting with the most basic unitary magic, starting with a small flame and searching for the secrets of the Holy Land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames turned into dust and dissipated over and over again with the wind. They rode all the way to the foot of the Holy Land, and Siegel still did not think of a way. He put away the magic and looked up to see the surroundings. But he was shocked by the sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foothills of the Holy Land Mountain are all tents of various colors, crowded together in a chaotic manner. There are a variety of paintings on the tents, some choose totems, and some choose simple lines. Siegel looked at it, and there were almost no tents with the signs of the Jackdaw tribe, most of which were scattered in other tribes on the grasslands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the guards say about the contest, these tents must be prepared for the contestants - Siegel guessed the answer without having to worry. There are almost no women and children in the tent area, all of them are strong soldiers and their handsome horses. These people looked at Siegel and his entourage with curiosity until they watched them come to the foot of the mountain. There is a gate without walls, with totem signs and amulets hanging on the arched frame of black wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry said this thing to Siegel earlier, able to dispel evil and judge the door of friendship. The three spirits will use every wise eye to check every person who passes through the gate. Those special evil monsters will appear here and cannot climb the holy mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the foot of the mountain, there is a flat road leading to the long hall. There are dozens of flags on the sides of the road. The cold wind blew, and the image of the beast on the flag shook and screamed. The flag representing the Jackdaw, Black Wolf and Red Sun tribes is closest to the long hall, indicating that at least these three tribes are still at the heart of the new power group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They dismounted in front of the arch and threw the reins to the guards wearing chain armor. The characteristics of Siegel's black hair are very well recognized. So the people of the Jackdaw tribe greeted him: "The Dragon Slayer! The Dragon Slayer is here!" Some said: "This elf is even worse!" There are people who simply express their joy and hope to invite Siegel. Go to his home to be a guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all tribes on the prairie know the name of Siegel, so they ask each other. They have been wondering how the Jackdaw tribe re-emerged, where the fine weapons, armor and gold coins that could not be spent came from, and where the fur, herbs and animal-processed crafts they collected went. They traced to the Bird's Nest, but the White Bird family apparently could not answer their questions. Now these people see Siegel and finally have the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master took Mana and others through the arch and continued along the road. The well-designed steps were placed close to the long hall, and the craftsmanship from the castle was seen at first glance. There are not many stones on the prairie, and the dwarves occupy the quarry of the walled mountains, so only the castle lords have qualified stonemasons. These steps come from the Bird's Nest City and will be laid down to the foot of the mountain in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place with the highest steps is flush with the long hall, and a platform is built, surrounded by many guards. The ten people closest to the gate were fully armed and stood proudly. The jackdaw's mark clearly appeared in front of their delicate breastplate, and only Kerry's blood and his most trusted warrior could use such a mark, which envied the other guards on the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaders of the tribe are meeting in the long hall, and their guards are left outside. In order to show that there is no hostility, everyone is not allowed to put their hands on the weapon, except when eating and cutting meat. Siegel and his party did not have any armor. Wearing a cold cloak, it looks very shabby. However, their weapons are very good, especially the long swords of the Master's waist, only the gleaming gems on the scabbard can change the entire set of Warrior equipment. These people did not say a word. Until the leader of them came to the door of the long hall, waiting for the opening, the guards of the Jackdaw tribe automatically opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can go in, but Mana was stopped when he wanted to go in. "The Dragon Slayer, there is no guard inside. The Jackdaw Tribe promises your safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Need to untie the weapon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need it." The guard guarded the right fist and raised the chest. After the ceremony, he let open the passage into the long hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stepped in. If the outside is still ruled by the cold winter, then the long hall has entered a hot summer. There are dozens of braziers lit in it, so they are bright and warm. After the completion of the long hall, it takes a hundred steps to get to the opposite side and thirty steps to cross. Two rows of stout pillars support the towering roof, both of which are decorated with historical patterns. There are many long tables under the pillars, and the wine ministers are serving the leaders who are sitting behind the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is approaching a hundred steps away, sitting in a throne placed on the third-order platform. There is a short section on his side, and the wine on it is always full. On the wall behind him, the ice stun gun hangs high. Exudes the airiness of the monks. Along with the artifact, there is also a brocade depicting a jackdaw wearing a crown flying over the grassland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sentence written in dwarf text: "The king of the grassland, the king of the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a maid around him to serve, and next to him, there is a strange face with a eagle hook nose, and he is talking to Kerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard walked forward, circling the blazing flames burning in the center of the hall under the watchful eyes of the two men, and went straight to the throne. "Kerry! I am coming again!" Siegel's voice was exceptionally clear: "I heard that the King of Khan was born on the prairie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Kerry’s eyes Flashing with excitement, he stood up from the throne and said in a loud voice: "Welcome to you. My brother. Everyone unanimously elected me as the new king on the prairie, shining on the land covered with snow. You are making a special trip. Congratulations on me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and stood under the steps. A few steps away, Kerry is very strange, as if losing the kind and warm feeling. He is still alive and kicking. The power of the giant has not diminished, but the temperament under this flesh has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
