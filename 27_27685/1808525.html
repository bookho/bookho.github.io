			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a cold, cold morning in the north, the sky is still not bright, Evan will take the royal family, the former parliament and Three hundred Guardian knights came to the Temple of the Morning, to pray before the first sunshine of dawn to request the gods. The cloak of the Guardian knight screams, and their scabbards collide with the armor's voice with rhythm. Evan squatted down in front of the team, and the cloak on the back was the symbol of the starry royal family, but he hung the sacred emblem of the god of the morning sun on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one hand holding the reins, one hand gently placed on the holy emblem, Evan is praying. He is very focused with his eyes closed, no need to worry about the direction of the horse. The tall temple of the morning sun is like a shadow in the dark, but when the dawn comes, the special architectural stone will make the whole temple shine. Evan just needs that effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not go, he had to prepare a very important thing. The cloning of the Count of Todd has been completed and only the last step has been debugged. In fact, Siegel has done all the work, he is only demanding himself, in order to be more secure and able to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the return of the Yari Forest, more than two months have elapsed. The autumn is irreversible, and the winter has shrouded the earth. In these two months, the Elf Saint came to him and tried to know what happened at Stonehenge. Siegel hopes that he can exchange with the wizard's high magic spells, and the result is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other saints are estimated to know the news, what action will they take? When Siegel worried, he was still busy with his own affairs. But in addition to the Elf Saint, no one actually came to him. Siegel’s talents suddenly realized that this is the balance of power of Turner. The more complex the situation, the greater the power, the balance of each other, and then trap everyone in a net like a net, no one can move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use this power in politics, you should be able to swim more. Siegel himself couldn't clarify his ideas from the politics and the hearts of the people. Instead, Turner should be like a duck. But Siegel has his own abilities. His learning ability was finally developed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writer's ring is the octagonal scorpion, and the reason why it can find other scorpions through it depends on its adaptability. The octagonal scorpion's hidden physique ability was adapted to it, so it could not play its original role. Siegel only needs to learn how to modify the adaptation of the Lord of the Rings, and you can use it to find anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original was just a try. Now found this road is feasible! Siegel took all his energy to experiment and learn, and finally figured out the designer's design ideas. He began dismantling the internal structure of the Lord of the Rings and replacing them with magical array components that he could control. This kind of activity finally lights up a new number and brings new capabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ultra-microscale analysis" can be used not only for magic arrays, but also for "circuitry" systems of writers and goblins. And the ultra-micro plasma array of Nexus. Originally these things were extremely small and complex, and the number of components reached an astronomical level. Siegel's mind could not be identified and remembered at all. Now with the help of the twentieth scorpion, he can switch between the whole and the part of the arbitrarily as he wants, and he can study which one can be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some technologies that I didn’t understand before are now very open, especially those that rely on high-precision electronic components in Goblin technology. The dualism of the goblin was originally built on the circuit technology of "open" and "off". All external functions are based on this addition and subtraction. Siegel had to admire the place where Goblin's head had its strengths, but he was still not very fluent about the technology of dualism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is a wrong inference. Goblin's technology has nothing to do with their dualistic thinking, but Siegel doesn't know it yet. He chooses to study selectively, and his purpose is also very clear, that is, to study and modify the function of the Lord of the Rings. He has made some progress in this regard, but it has not yet reached the point where it can be applied. But at least he has removed the rejection of the Lord of the Rings and can already wear it in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he really wants to kill himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the writer’s hatred of the blind user has been deeply rooted in every function of the Lord of the Rings. If it is not the protection of the defensive spell, Siegel will have an unstoppable suicide impulse. In order to get rid of the monitoring of the god of magic and knowledge, the whole world of the writers was sacrificed to the wall of the storm by Turner, and it was hard to expand the area of ​​a new continent. If this happens to yourself. I am afraid that the mind of revenge will be stronger than them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was not so strong when I was young." The count likes to comment on himself. This seems to give him a lot of fun. "Siegel, look, my body is good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not be narcissistic, what did you eat when you were young? I use it here. They are all rare materials!” Siegel always had a big pot in the lab, which contained strange things and exuded a disgusting taste. This taste can shorten the time the visitors stay, and the smoke can block the role of long-range detection prophetic spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you make some partial modifications?" the count suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. Not satisfied with some organs of your body?" Siegel teased and smiled, then shook his head: "No way, this In addition to being able to look exactly like you, the body can't do anything else. I can make it stronger and thinner at most, but I can't let him grow a second XX. In fact, I even have a certain person on him. These families are not cured by natural diseases."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My family has no history of disease!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; "I know no, I just give an example." Siegel explained: "You can rest assured that all the body will not move anything. If you really want to do bad things, you are facing you. Casting a spell is much simpler and more effective than casting your clone. The clone is very fragile, and if someone casts a spell on him, it will easily affect its growth, and the difference can be seen from the outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd nodded, he was not actually asking for himself, but for Asked. Once this spell is successful, the king of the starry kingdom can have an infinite life span, but at the same time the life and death continuation is handed over to the clone maker. He naturally fears that the makers—not necessarily Siegel—will move in it until they listen to Siegel's instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I expect the King to test after returning from the morning temple to the gods." Siegel patted the shoulders of Count Todd. "There is a long-term emphasis": "Although a lot of preparations have been made, it is still impossible to avoid danger. If you have any after-effects to deal with, just in these days!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd opened the hand of Siegel at the time and left without heading back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing about this incident. His Majesty deliberately sighed Siegel and tried his best to avoid the accident. He was not allowed to participate in the ceremony of the Temple of the Morning. Siegel was able to stay on the magical spaceship while listening to the stars and singing while he was busy with his own business. As for the will of the morning gods. In fact, I basically knew it before I went. The goblin is not a believer in the god of the morning sun, the human being in the kingdom of the stars is, so the result will be very clear. Although he did not say "to kill the group of goblins", he wished Evan to defeat all enemies and ushered in the dawn of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can already be interpreted as "Go, kill the goblin, I am quite you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The most important gods have already spoken, and the action plan to eliminate the goblin is officially put on the agenda. Although Evan still needs to go to other temples to perform a ritual, it will not affect the overall situation. Even if other gods raised their opposition, Evan was the saint of the morning god. It is also necessary to carry out the will of God - at least on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing detailed action plans, as well as school, wizards, elves, and dwarves, Evan is now very concerned about Siegel's cloning trials. The original plan was to be carried out on the longest day of the winter night, but I didn’t expect Siegel to suddenly call Evan, Count Todd and others in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am worried that forces will take destructive action, so start ahead. Earl, are you ready?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't the pastor of the Temple of War ready to be resurrected?" asked the count, frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He will arrive soon, not for how long. Do you need your family to accompany you in the process?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want my two sons to come over, they are all at home now, just send a messenger to run a trip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small Small requirements can still be promised. By this time, Evan also ordered the Star Fortress to enter the state of alert, except for the two sons of Count Todd and the priest of the Temple of War. No one else is allowed to approach the magical spaceship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
