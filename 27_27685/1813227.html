			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are crazy," the Dwarf Master opened his beard covering his lips and said with a sigh: "Or you are too smart, think that such a scam can make us You can climb to a higher level and get some information that we don't know, but that doesn't mean you can be our leader. I want to continue on my own path, not to mix with you. But I want to advise Others: Be careful with this smart guy, and lose your life in vain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf is very stubborn throughout the race, even as a mage. Intelligence, wisdom, and character are different concepts, and Siegel does not expect everyone to be able to communicate with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not lacking supporters, the wheelchair gnome thinks a little, the first one is willing to work with Siegel. "I was born with a disability. Without the support of my elders and the help of my partners, I couldn't even go out of the village, let alone have the opportunity to learn to become a mage. No friends can't move, so I am willing to give it a try. My truth The name is Cobak, referred to as Ke Ke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people nod to each other, it is a relationship of mutual help. Then Elf Anna joined in, but she chose to keep her pseudonym. "In fact, even if I say a name indiscriminately, you don't know the truth, unless you spend points to let the light god reveal the answer. I don't mind if I continue to use Anna's name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is only a small detail, no problem." Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Master took a lick of his mouth and said, "I don’t mean to be alone, I’ll see if you can What kind of tricks to play. Count me, but you can't help me to do anything, I'm just interested in this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Sieg Er answered, the worm Master spoke: "I am also one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s time is short, some things are not known, but it does not mean Others are as ignorant. "Bug, you spend more time in the School of Magic than anyone else. Now you have killed more than 20 students. If you threaten, you are the most dangerous of all. Walk with you. Just like Walk the same as the snake!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf Anna faced the murderer with a warning gesture until Siegel patted her shoulder. "In fact, everyone in the room has a strong strength. If you are not careful, you may become a cemetery. I am determined to change this situation, but if we can't unite everyone. How can we achieve the goal of working for the same goal? What? This is not a time to group or pull a group, but to share resources. Anyone can be a partner if they meet this premise.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Maximum companion, partner It’s still a long way off.” Elf Anna still has some peace of mind. But no longer raise objections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the half-dragon mage who was silent was also joined, and his mind was different from everyone else. Although it is claimed that this is not a gang, but fierce half-orcs, hazy worms and weird Siegel, the "most dangerous" of all three are brought together. If you don't join, who knows what will happen? Tragedy? In the end, only the dwarf and another surviving human mage did not choose to join. They preferred to maintain independence, so they wanted to leave after saying hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stopped them, and the two immediately took a defensive posture, and the wand and spell were ready to fire. "Don't be nervous. I just want to say one thing. Although you said you can't join, if you want to listen, you can do it any time. I am going to tell the big guy about the situation on the magic tower and count what everyone has. Things you need to know. If you have anything, you can ask them together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf stunned and looked at Siegel with incredible eyes . He hesitated, returned to the classroom, moved a chair and was not far from Siegel. Although not in the team, I can only sit alone in the periphery, but the sound he can hear is really no different from others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last. The only one who left the classroom was the human mage. He doesn't seem to want to have anything to do with Siegel, and he never interacts with people of other races. I don't know if this is his character or a simple strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, now let me talk about the situation upstairs." Siegel took out a piece of paper and began to depict the full picture of the magic tower. He said all his opinions and thoughts. What needs attention, how to avoid risks, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it is a better choice and more secure to be in your own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent more than an hour talking about his own stories, then waited quietly to see what other people have questions to ask. This new small group has not formed trust with each other, and everyone relies on ideals, habits and interests. After a period of silence and face-to-face confrontation, the Orc Master erected the index finger in front of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked a question." The Orc said: "How did you get the qualification to the top."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem has actually been generated in everyone's mind, but the half-orc with the supremacy of interests is the most direct question. Everyone erected their ears, perhaps through this question, they could really look at Siegel’s temperament, or they might get the chance to climb the summit by relying on the gourd painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and prepared for this situation. He called the lamp god and said to it: "You tell everyone why I can climb to the top?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the god of the lamp is mechanical and rigid , but very clear, not to deceive. “Because the Master, Mr. O'Brien Couronne, became the only remaining student, he was qualified to be at the top.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting everyone The puzzling eyes, Siegel further explained: "You know that the respective lamp gods can fit together into a big guy, because they are originally the same source. I dismantled my lamp god from its structure. A parasite-like magic spell was found, which was continuously transmitted through the spiritual connections between the gods. To remove this spell, you must separate the communication between the lights, so I did." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't expect anything to happen after that. My lamp god thought that other lights gods were sleeping. They are the last ones, so according to some kind The rules announced that I became the ultimate winner and gave me the qualification to go to the top.” Siegel looked at everyone and said: “There was something that you all saw. I left the room to see other lights. After that, my lamp god understands here Tampering, but I have no ability to correct it. It flew to the fourth floor and took me the black Iron Stone, which is the Stone of the Sage, and hoped that I would use the matter to confuse the chaos. In order to prevent the power of destruction from completely destroying the lights. God, I reconnected it to the other gods. The parasitic spell reappeared. It changed back to this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is finished, but The Orc and the Mage Master did not look at him, but looked at Elf Anna. The female elf blinked and nodded and said: "Unless he is a liar like God, what he said is true." Anna explained to Siegel: "My ability to use the teacher, use prophecy And the power of enchantment, judging a person's state, is it lying or disguising. If it is not such ability, neither of them will make me live so freely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Very good, since I already know. So what are you still doing here?" The murderer stood up and snorted. "You can do it, and I can do the same. You can't think of pushing your will over others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, Said to the worm wizard: "You use the insect swarm to construct your own body, but you don't understand the meaning of the real cluster. I just share the knowledge I have learned and mastered, and seek people who are willing to change the world together, change it. Going back to the original way, you can really learn without interference. How do you have the same qualifications as me? Can you climb to the top with your own strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would rather give it a try." After the murderer said this sentence, he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went straight back to his room and summoned the light god. Then he covered the lamp god with his own bug body. Start to swallow and modify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has their own stunts, and the Master is no exception. These bugs are an extension of his senses and can be operated in extremely small places and in multiple different locations. This is much faster than Siegel can only make one change at a time. But he was not in a time stagnation, so his points were deducted like running water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In less than half a minute, his score of more than 4,000 was consumed and continued to move toward the bottomless abyss of negative points. The murderer screamed and took all the worms back, and he was reluctant to give up such plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
