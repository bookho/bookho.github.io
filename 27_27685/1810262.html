			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lear clone in front of Siegel is completely devoid of Lear, or that he does not have any unique appearance at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use an ellipse to represent your face, then gently stroke a few arcs, a few fold lines, a few circles, and a mouth, even if it is a human face, Then the look of the Lear clone is not far from this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is hardly a "person". If it is called a human body, it may be more precise, or "semi-finished". Observed through psionic and perspective spells, this body has complete internal organs, bones and nerves are developed, and it looks like a strong guy, which may be suitable for a warrior over a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will the shards of the Mother Earth affect this clone?" Siegel thought and calculated for a long time, and could not rule out this possibility. Although the target of the cloning spell is Lehr's residual limb, the total mass of the Holy Land's shards that are put into it far exceeds the part of Lehr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is certain that this is certainly not a halfling body, so even if it has an impact, it is still mainly Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel, while experimenting and learning, from time to time to observe, finally let him discover a strange place. When he uses the detection magic on this body, he will see some very thin lines on the clone, emitting a very weak magical aura, and then gradually disappear. Siegel can be sure at a glance that these are not the lines brought by the cloning spells, and that these lines have a unique feel for the power of the elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he directly mixes the four elements in an aggregated way, overlaid onto the clone. This time the pattern became much clearer, and he only saw the weird things after watching it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which angle you look at, these patterns are like the traces of the force of time and space that are left in the body, and also in the same way as those traces, in a peculiar way. Attached to the body, there is no physical, no touch. Siegel's own pattern is not complete, and there is no use other than viewing. However, the pattern on the Leer clones constitutes a whole and can function as an element for storage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, the network formed by this set of patterns. The power of the element can be passed without any blockage. But the strange thing is that no matter what direction, strength, or order, the elements flow in the pattern, the elements can not create magical effects, and will not affect external spells, such as cloning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel guess. This network may be an aid to communicate a higher level of power: rules. In order to verify this, he brought Lehr's clones to the "Time and Spirit Tower" and went through the process of time and space with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long been familiar with the road, and the process of controlling the elements to oscillate time and space is no longer leaking, and can make extra hours of about two hours. But this time he is not trying to steal time. Instead, try to motivate the rules in the shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accelerate for two seconds, decelerate for two seconds, the flow of time changes from a calm lake to a wave of water, and Siegel is a boat floating above. Although the power of the rules is weak and fleeting, it can still cause abnormalities after frequent occurrences. The pattern on the Lear clones has responded, and some of the lines continue to glow, which in turn can affect the power of the shock, and the shape of this part of the pattern is most similar to the pattern of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case with Lear's clones, indicating that more than 90% of the patterns on my body may be safe and will not affect your health and ability to cast spells. The problem." Siegel copied all the patterns on the clones. Then write this on the side. "According to my guess, these lines are formed by the power of the rules. The pattern of the force of time rules should be similar to the pattern on my body. If there is a way to transform this pattern, can it adversely affect the time rule? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another conjecture is related to legendary spells. Like the magic tower of the Masters Association, although the core of the squad is the obsidian dagger, the source of its banned power is also it, but the squad itself can cover the entire planet, and it is also a legendary squad. Since it is a squad, there must be a graphical representation of the legendary spell. Siegel knows that the pattern of ordinary spells and higher spells uses different graphic elements, perhaps the patterns created by the turbulent force. It is the appearance of the legendary seed on the magical level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
