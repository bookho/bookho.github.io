			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put the arrow!" Mana shouted loudly on the wall: "The trebuchet! Heavy, don't stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs did not want to entangle with the Black Blood Castle, just want to quickly pass the length of the two-mile death channel. Bailong created a snow and ice slide for them, which was as smooth as a mirror. On the slide, no one except the white dragon can stand up, of course, they do not need to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, there is only one problem in front of Mana; is the firepower of Black Blood Castle strong enough? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put the arrow! Do your best to put the arrow!" The knight can't wait to grow eight arms and use four longbows. The range of the city walls is so large. In many places, special designs have been made to prevent enemy climbing, and a lot of space has been wasted. The archers were almost crowded together and struggling to pull the bowstrings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow is raining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc warriors hold various shields, try to curl up and slam down the slide. Arrow rain slammed on the shield, this has nothing to do with martial arts, only one is a lucky question. They curled up as much as possible, huddled under the bunker, reducing the risk of being hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the orcs can't fight back, the archer of Heim can shoot and harvest a lot, and the orc's body slides down the hill, with a long Long red blood. The warmer blood will be more, the ice will melt, and the white dragon will spit again, restoring the smoothness of the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the cars are aimed at the white dragon, shoot it with a steel arrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orc There are not many witch festivals, and it is impossible to protect the entire passage, so it can only be concentrated around Bailong. They had long been prepared to support the remote defensive shields, and the shackles that were shot over were biased, and some small wounds on the dragons were quickly restored under the treatment of the gods. White Dragon will also spit up the white frozen fog to cover the sight of the defenders. However, such a move made the orc witch festivals not see the surrounding situation, so that several heavy scorpions escaped the defensive net and hit the white dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no longer a spray of white dragons, honestly hiding attacks and repairing slides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continuously shooting. Let the rotation come up in advance!" Mana found the half-orc and said to him: "The wall is yours, I Go to the lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc screamed: "Stone! The jar, throw it down. Be sure to put the fire wall back again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bundles of arrows move up and will soon be used up, everyone is like crazy. The sound of the bowstrings passed the sound of the mountains, and the sound of the bows kept ringing. The cans are cut through the sky, lit, extinguished, re-ignited, and extinguished. Just like a child doing a boring game. In the dark night, I don’t know how many orcs passed, I don’t know how many deaths are on the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time no one is going to calculate the results, just thinking about archery and shooting again. Pulling the bowstrings for a long time can cause finger injuries. They wipe a handful of herbicide ointment jars that have a hemostatic effect, wrap them in bandages, and continue to shoot when the blood stops. The servants brought the onion broth up, both to get hungry and to replenish the water, and the soldiers were drinking from the bowl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour and one hour, uninterrupted filling and launching caused the trebuchet to begin to malfunction. Two of the six have been unusable and can only wait for the craftsman to take out the repairs. The speed of the stone bombs has slowed down, and the oil tanks are also used. The cable walls are mainly shot by archers to cause damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana found Siegel according to the instructions of the soldiers. He was walking back and forth at the bottom of a tower, looking around the walls where the cracks were broken after the break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Lord, how do you fight next?" Mana eagerly asked: "The orcs passed very fast, and we couldn't get the dragon." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I didn't think of the trick of sitting on the slide, and I didn't expect the death knight to really ignore the casualties. Your command is very good, I have nothing to add. ," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult. Can you please throw some fireballs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this has very obvious benefits. The orc's caster wants to attack the Black Blood Castle and it becomes unrealistic." Siegel stroked the wall with his hand, knocking around, and then said, "I was doing it well." The preparation of the spell confrontation, but now seems to save a lot of effort. Maybe the death knight also found this, so I feel that there is no need to attack the black blood castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You will continue to command. If the situation changes, I need support. I will appear." Siegel touched his chin and his eyes were always on the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana blinked and looked at Siegel’s back and guessed his thoughts. Is the Lord Lord ready to put more orcs in the past? Below the mountain there is a line of defense formed by the cavalry tribe cavalry, which can also kill the orcs. However, leaving the ban on the city wall, the orc's witchcraft can play a stronger role, and the results of the battle are not known. The more the Black Blood Castle is put, the greater the fighting pressure of the Jackdaw Tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking from the perspective of a mercenary, this is not a big deal, but as a knight, Mana believes that it is not yet time to begin to weaken the Jackdaw tribe. . Giant Kerry is in the castle, personally manipulating a brake, is on the rise. If he returns to the taste and thinks about the situation of his compatriots under the mountain, it is estimated that his face will not look good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you really want to do this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has been looking at the condition of the wall, smashing the cracks blocked with mud, and calculating the height of the room by the number of bricks. From time to time, he writes and paints on paper, all of which are symbols and numbers that Mana does not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight looked at it for a while, suddenly realized, suddenly called out: "The Lord, you have to tear down this tower!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s body trembled and looked back and sighed with a sigh of relief: “Scare me, how are you still here?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana licks her hair, some are embarrassed - the original lord was not prepared to make a conspiracy against his allies, he has been thinking of ways. "Sorry, I was excited for a while, and I didn't control the Tuen Mun. Do you want me to send some soldiers who will build a house? The walls they have repaired will naturally be removed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, let's call it." Siegel looked at the drawing on his hand and grinned. "I calculated it. I removed the tower and hoped to block the slide. Look at luck. This is The only way I think of it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Mana replied loudly and rushed out to call people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is to be done. Just do it. Siegel summoned earth elements in the castle to transform the walls with the soldiers. In order to avoid landslides before the end of the project, he used the three walls of the force field wall, the stone wall and the iron wall to support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tower is the highest place in the Black Blood Castle. When the Black Dragon dive down, it is "cut a knife" by its strong wings, forming a large gap. Later, simple repairs were made with bricks and stones. Siegel wants the tower to smash into the valley, but the gap is on the side, which will affect the angle of the trip, so it is necessary to "demolition and replenishment." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Siegel’s knowledge of architecture and engineering is good, and there is also a lot of experience in tunnel construction. Know how to support the weight and know how to make it collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the construction started, basically all the people were evacuated from the tower, leaving only four archers to shoot down at the highest point - a good paralyzed opponent In order to prevent the orcs from guessing in advance the action of Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is dark, it is a good time to show your strategy. The death knight was not idle. He sent an elite orc commando to climb the black-blooded castle along the cliffs of the walled mountains. Although he did not know how the Black Dragon and the Dragon Knight died, he knew that the opposite general was the enemy of Nike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lives of countless orcs on the slide temporarily satisfied the sinful swearing of the runes, just as the deaths of countless grievances weakened the intensity of the spell. The orcs who lie on the mountain wall encounter a lot less resistance. The walls of the city seem to have no idea of ​​not killing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of stability, the death knight still cut off the tongues of these orcs and tied their mouths with cloth, even if they died because of various "accidents" In the middle of the road, there will be no screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
