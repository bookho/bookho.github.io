			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dawn was clear, the three goblins were "freed", and Siegel piled their bodies together and burned them into ash. +◆+◆,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of the rule of the crystal wall, Siegel's spells need to be improved to adapt to the characteristics of the Earth's Goblin, so look for them from their memory. Not too much news. I only know that this place is a remote and poor place. It is snow all year round, and the warm snow season only accounts for one or two of the year. The three goblins were not good at all, but this did not make them sympathy or compassion, only increased their greed and bloodthirsty. In order to catch the big bear on the sled, they started with six people and only three people returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel became one of the goblins called "Taka", walking alone with a sled. The reason why he became him was because Taka was the last goblin to be cast, and the information he got from his mind was the most complete. Siegel learned the gnome, but couldn't imitate Taka's accent, so simply cast a change spell and put his tongue in a state of injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also found the scars of the bear claw attack on his face, the fleshy wounds of the eversion are no different from the real ones, even if the priest can't tell the difference here. . The fragmented face explains why the tongue breaks and cannot speak, and it also reduces the likelihood of being seen by an acquaintance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He packed up the things of the three goblins, and then drove the sled to the nearest market, hoping to get more information there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called market is not too big, according to the impression in the brain of the goblin, usually only over forty residents, mostly transit brokers. Logging, hunting, and mining will go there for sale, and then spend a lot of time there. After becoming impoverished, I went deep into the snowfield. Then the transfer merchant will ship the goods to the larger town. Then it is getting bigger and bigger. Until you enter the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is Siegel’s goal, and no matter what he wants, he can find the answer in the city. So what is the answer that he most wants to know about his trip? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he left, he asked himself again and again, what is the most important purpose of going deep into the "earth". After embarking on the snowfield, he rethought while he was on the road. The knife that passed through the throat gave him a head start, but it also made his thoughts clearer: Siegel wanted to know whether there was a possibility of resuming peace and cooperation between the two worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the basis for all follow-up actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this kind of thinking. He and the reindeer sleigh with the brown bear's body reached the town called "red feet." The surrounding goblins looked at the "Taka" and his reindeer sleigh, and the spoils behind it were even more eye-catching. They stroking the musket at the waist with their hands, and the atmosphere became heavy and condensed. However, Taka is coming straight to the “weighing station”, which is the delivery point here. The onlookers licked their lips and temporarily pressed the spur of the gun to communicate with each other: robbing the bear's body, it is better to directly steal the money that was sold by the bear corpse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reception of Siegel is a one-eyed goblin. He wraps himself in a thick gray wolf skin and wears a gray wolf head without a chin as a hat. On the head. He did not have the first time to see the bear's body. Instead, I looked at Taka with a one-eyed look and then saw if there were companions behind him. Then he reached out to the counter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Eye of Magic. Siegel had already seen something under the counter: a short-handled musket that could hold four bullets and a small life at a close distance. The one-eyed finger hadn't touched the handle, and Siegel had put the knife under his throat. The feeling of being colder than the snow outside makes the one-eyed trembling, then stretches out his hands and lifts them in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel opened his mouth and let the one-eyed look at his broken tongue, and then used a spare hand to grasp the face of a bear claw. He snorted and wrote the number six on the counter, then rubbed it hard and wrote the number one and pointed to himself. Then his knife was tightly held against the one-eyed one, and the meaning of it was self-evident: as the only one of the six dead escapers, he did not care about killing one more person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individually swallowed the throat, bought the brown bear for nine thousand dollars, and then bought the reindeer and sled for a thousand dollars. As a symbol of the reconciliation between the two parties, the one-eyed also gave the Taka of the six-packed musket and thirty bullets under the counter, and then attached a hang gun to the taek "good faith" gaze. Belt and ammunition clips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the memory of the goblin, Siegel came to the only bar in the town and prepared to spend the night with the goblin food. The burning stove is no different from its own world. The illuminating glass using lightning energy is very novel but understandable, because the city of Gore is full of elements that use the secret energy of the nucleus, and the effect is similar. The most attractive to Siegel's eyes is the "image crystal" of the goblin, which is what the goblin memory calls TV. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a group of goblins playing with exotic costumes who are using muskets to kill another group of goblins who turn in odd costumes, the screams of muskets and the broken sounds of goblin skulls. It is the soundtrack of the image. After a while, it was "advertising" and then "news." So one word after another has finally corresponded with the actual things, which is very helpful for Siegel to understand the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the news, he finally saw the news about the crystal wall channel. "Devil Stone" - the goblin is so called the crystal wall amethyst - under the attack of the super-super "nuclear bomb" of the fifty-star goblin king, it is still unscathed, so hard experimental targets are urging each big commander, To develop more ultra-super super nuclear bombs. I believe that if a big commander can break the demon stone, it means that he has the strongest nuclear power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also wants to know more news, but the news is over, and the two groups of disguised goblins kill each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't worry, stay away from this place and then do spying. Segal took his eyes off the TV and bought a dinner here for five yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potato, burnt black sausage, garlic and carrots. It seems to be something that can be eaten. Much better than I thought. He is like a hungry goblin. Big mouth swallowing food in front of you. When a beer with a bubble came up, he had already finished the whole meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he had abdominal pain, such as twisting, the stomach and intestines were corroded by toxins, and a lot of bleeding. So Siegel "had died again." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding goblins didn’t show any surprised expressions, just a faint cast and then continued to do their own thing. They should eat, drink, drink, laugh, and brag each other. Siegel closed his eyes and played a qualified dead body. What is wrong with it? He was very confused in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you didn’t learn some changes from the Williams on the stone boat. Siegel's projection really died twice, then returned to his body twice. William taught him how to change two sets of organs, a set of daily use, and a set to start after the first set of accidents. Siegel can't even have two sets of brains like William, but he has two copies of all the internal organs below the skull. So simply cutting the throat or toxins won't kill him, just start the spare components. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was dragged by the goblin boss and threw it into the basement of the hotel. A goblin with two yellow hairs on his head was waiting here. They put their hands together to take down Siegel's clothes and took away the weapons and wallets. After that, the slim Siegel was thrown into the garbage and will be combined with food residue into fertilizer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that greed and loneliness are the cause of this death. It’s not that you have dressed up a goblin in some way. After trying to understand this, he climbed out of the garbage. I took the snow on the floor and wiped it off. I stood back at the back door of the hotel and reached out and knocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What time is this time, not enough time for delivery?!" A goblin whispered and opened the back door. He saw a gnome of the goblin standing in front of him, a pair of golden eyes flashed a little, then lost consciousness, fell asleep behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stepped over and locked the door. He picked up a low stool from the door and used a force to slap the thick stool legs as short sticks and use them as weapons. After two steps, he threw away the short stick and replaced the weapon with the iron bar of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goblin boss is checking the harvest in the house, and the coins that have been found are neatly stacked, and it seems that the number has been counted. The six-unit gun is a good good thing. If you sell it or keep it, you may think about it later. A caravan's pass ticket is placed next to the coin, and the goblin boss prepares to take it back in a while. Based on his own relationship, this is a matter of getting used to, so he can make a small profit. "Two mane" was originally called Taka, he just wanted to use the name of the ticket, he wanted to directly take the ticket and did not want to pay for the redemption, so there was a dispute with the goblin boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
