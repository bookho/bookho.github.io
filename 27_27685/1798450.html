However, there is more than one road leading to the barrier of the crystal wall. There is no way to cover all the tunnel networks with only one water element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, or will you wait for me, will I tell the Firehammer Council about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think that would be useful?" Siegel asked: "At the moment I only find a way to clean the water. I am not sure that the dwarf's caster can do this. Federation Just stopped outside the door of Mora, but the Firehammer Council allowed the Master to enter in a large amount? I have been very unpopular when I came in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene I felt very annoyed, screaming at my beard and grinning with hatred. Siegel just wanted to comfort him. He saw the dwarf slap a slap and said excitedly: "Let's go to the dwarf sage, he is below!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Two people finally pushed into the crystal wall channel, the water element has become an illuminant, just like an apricot fire element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens after this thing? Is it a light lamp? Siegel thought about it, cast fossils in the cave as mud spells, dug a big pit, and let the water element get in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reclaimed the core of the elemental escort, and then buried the "mixed energy toxic dust" with dirt. I thought this was all right, but I didn't expect that the silk energy would escape from the soil and continue to pollute the surrounding air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s grin, this thing is not over yet? If you can't stop them by simply burying them, do you still use annihilation spells or throw them into the ruined black hole? The Miereng nuclear can use any substance as a source of energy, but its efficiency is too high, resulting in a very slow consumption. What if the risk of an elemental surge is generated if the combustion is forcibly accelerated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the dwarf saints?" Siegel had to cast a wall of force and temporarily pressed it over the buried land, all in one layer of protection. "Does this thing harm the dwarf saints?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly know, Siegel, so I will let Mora Evacuation.” The dwarf saint with apricot-colored light came out of the room of the signatoric “Crystal Channel”, and his appearance surprised Siegel and Elinette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hair and beard are lost. The entire cheek is like being melted and pulled down from the bones; the original reddish-brown pupil is now bright green, revealing a pathologically different look; the big, round nose is full of blister, and the damage is constantly Leave pus. Strong arms are like dehydrated dried vegetables. From the siege hammer to a fine gun. This is no longer like the dwarf saint, saying that the goblin saint has a letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy One raised his hand and took a picture of his own brain, then the light was generated and shrouded the whole body. It has regained its strong, mighty, and determined appearance. "Using divine power can keep me recovering, but I think I still have to show you the end of the impact of the energy of the earth. My essence is the Holy Power, but ** is the god of the dwarf, except as a container of divine power, and There is no difference between the normal dwarfs. This time without the help of the federation, all the dwarves of the entire Mora can become what I just had."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How long is the impact?” Siegel asked: “Is it from the earthquake? It’s only half a day, how is it so serious?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goblin attack began half a month ago, and it continued to attack the wall barrier, using an explosive weapon that has never been seen before." The dwarf saint said: "impact, light and heat. There was nothing wrong with it. I was able to block it all, but I didn't notice that they were doping these toxins in negative energy. My body was slowly corroded and the power dropped, so the aftermath of the explosion was transmitted from here."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Saint People, you are now considered a recovery yet? "Ailin Te most concerned about this issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Using divine power, I am no different from the power of the peak, and the earthquake will not be transmitted again. But I still can't stop the weird energy penetration. "The dwarf saint said: "I can only know that it is a force of similar elements, and in the two continents, it is recognized that there is a Xigel Master in the best grasp of the strength of the elements. So I made two preparations." Let Mora's lord begin to evacuate and let Elinte ask you to come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the dwarf saint is very complicated. Scratching the back of the head and said: "I am not. My own strength is limited. If you do not stop these toxins, you can only persist for about three years according to the current level, and then there is no power to recover. But the god of dwarfs can be shaped again. The saints are descending, and the position that takes over from me is infinite from this perspective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to make the saints is never unlimited. Siegel knows but does not reveal it. And the god of the dwarf will not spend unlimited power on this matter, and there are not many crystal walls or half-planes annihilated. The dwarves have died innumerable, and the gods of the dwarves have not rescued them all. After all, what he cares about is only a continuation of race, not the survival of all individuals. For the multiverse, a dwarf in a thunder wall world can only be a drop in the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you tell the dwarf now? The dwarf saint is deceiving you. He dragged the dwarf into the war with the confidence of victory. Now he has lost his chance and can only support it. Except for the mage who does not believe in any gods, others will certainly not think about the problem from this perspective, and the final result will only be disappointing. This kind of thing happened too many times in history, and no rationality can overcome sensibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But even if you are at the top of the mountain, can't stop this strange polluting energy dust? Hey, give it a simple name, called How is the dust?” Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's the name." The dwarf saint nodded. "I found this kind of dust and tried to filter it, but The harvest is very small. Because this energy is too strong, I am also somewhat negligent. I don’t understand the power of this kind of thing until the body continues to suffer cumulative damage.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Our Masters Association is willing to help study how to stop this threat of dust, but there are prerequisites." Siegel can help the dwarf Elin, but there is no good perception of the dwarf saint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two things about the goblin and the dust are not the private affairs between Elinette and me, but belong to the dwarves and the federation, the head of the Mora And Heim is at this level. So you need to establish mutual trust and communication channels between organizations. Don't always use the friendship between me and Elint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The dwarf sage looked at Siegel quite unexpectedly, and then looked at Elinte again. What the latter wants to say is that it is all about serving the interests of the dwarves, but his lips move. In the end, there was no opening. So the saint nodded: "This is no problem, the Firehammer Council immediately took over this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel went on to say: "I need to know how to pass the crystal The wall barrier, so you can go to the opposite side. After the Dwarf King meeting, Mora’s squad will delay the Federation to the Earth for various reasons. This is the end of the matter!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice suddenly increased. The tone has also become very strong: "You are the saint of the dwarf. I am now telling you clearly that I am fed up with the procrastination of the Fire Hammer Council, which is childish! To say it, I am still more I like the Mura of the past. At least it is straightforward to do things, but my old friend Elinette has not wanted to participate in the dwarf's parliament, otherwise I really want to give him a fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf sage just wanted to speak, and was blocked by Siegel: "Is you already forgotten my identity as a brave man, and I am also qualified to participate in the affairs of Mora. As a sergeant, my The right to speak should not be low? Let the group of uninspired dwarves of the Firehammer Council roll and find the dwarves with experience and ability to coordinate internal and external relations. As the current consumption, the dwarves will soon become lonely again!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, it is the life and death of the dwarf of Mora, and on the other hand, the great interest in controlling the wall channel. The saint measured it a bit, if it did not agree at this time. Siegel and the Federation will definitely turn around and will never have any connection with Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another crystal wall channel managed by the Star Kingdom, Elf and Masters Association is already accessible, and the Federation is not the only road of Mora. Therefore, the dwarf saints chose to give in and agreed to the requirements of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are all good fighters, but management skills are indeed lacking, I will consider." The Holy One nodded. "This time you wished, Siegel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of "**师" or "Prince lord" is not said, Siegel I understand that the dwarf saint is about to lose patience. Oh, it seems that from the bones, the dwarf can never change the stubbornness like a rock. Just like an elf, it will only grow like a big tree. The orcs expand like a flame, and the dwarf's knees and shoulders will never bend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
