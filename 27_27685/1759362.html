			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waited for a while, and the Southern Alliance’s messenger did not appear, which was also his expectation. Several young knights in veteran armor came up with white flags and claimed to be the knight of the Baron Felton Turner, asking to carry the owner's body back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure this corpse belongs to Felton?" Siegel snorted and pointed at the dry, shrinking dead body. "Look carefully, then tell me what you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people bowed their heads and approached the battlefield under the supervision of the Orcs. After a while, they looked at each other and shook their heads: "This is not our master. Baron Felton...not like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your master may have been replaced by this evil sorcerer." Since the battle with Knox has surfaced, he is no longer hiding: "You have to be careful with Knox, they There is a strong way of enchantment. As far as I know, the most perfect disguise needs to constantly acquire knowledge and memory from the original owner, so there is a very small possibility that your master is still alive."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavalier looked up and suddenly hoped in his eyes and asked in anxiously: "Where will he be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't know." Siegel smiled and said: "How do you usually find someone, how can you find it now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand, as long as there is a hope It’s worth it,” said the knight. “As for this body, we naturally won’t want it. May the wild dog eat it. . It's full of worms flesh "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;". And that is not safe, "Siegel raising his hand, a small fireball lit the corpse. The fire was very obvious on the battlefield, and the black smoke rose into the air. The magical flame quickly swallowed up the broken body, leaving only a pile of ashes on the duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Siegel ordered the earth element to drill back into the channel, all the way to close the work, and he returned to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southern Alliance did not have a single person who dared to move, and looked at the Lord of Heim City silently. There seems to be a fireball flying over them in front of them, and the arrogance of burning the dogs is also in the ear - how to fight tomorrow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers of the city of Mithre made a cheer and gave their young lords a look of admiration. As for the multi-person siege, no one naturally mentions it. The terrible sight of changing monsters has scared many people. How can you keep your hands on monsters? The coalition forces in the south have not expressed any objection. How can residents of the city of Cherokes care about this matter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol ran over and said in Siegel’s ear: "The Lord, the lady, please go to the study. The Knight of Mana is already waiting for you there. It seems that there are important things to report to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half of the good news, Siegel frowned. Can let Janet leave the bedroom and go to the study, there must be a serious situation. He stepped forward and pushed open the door to the study. The result is in addition to Janet and Mana. He also saw an unexpected person: Dwarf Elinette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stunned, but still embraced the dwarf passionately. "When did you arrive, there was no news at all," he said, "I am so happy to see you still healthy and full of strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Linde didn't have a happy expression. He licked his hand and said after clearing his throat: "Siegel, this time I brought bad news. The Mora clan clan conference issued a war mobilization order. Close the walled mountains, all the dwarves of the Mora will return immediately. Even the sentry on the plains will be temporarily abandoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What troubles do you encounter? "I don't need my help?" Siegel said: "I have recently made a new breakthrough in the elemental rune technology, and there must be something I can do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a good boy," Elint reluctantly smiled. "But this time I will disappoint you. The dwarves who help you defend the Striped Mountain Fortress must be removed. I am faster than the commander, but also You can only fight for up to two days for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Defensive spots Dwarf mountain? How is this going? "Siegel looked at Mana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a good cooperation.” Elinte explained: “Janet’s price is very good. If it’s not a war mobilization order. I want to organize some fighters to come here to exercise.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Siegel said: "These dwarf warriors are comparable to regular knights, and they are good at defense. They are more suitable to fight in the environment where the dwarf runes are strengthened. No wonder the whole front. There are no loopholes in defense. If they withdraw, they will be discovered by the enemy, and it is likely to trigger a full-scale attack. Our weaknesses will be exposed, and they will always find opportunities to capture the walls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what I am worried about." Elinte said: "In the name of the gem family, I organized a mercenary group for you at the top of Mora. There are two hundred, they should be able to arrive within four days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I dare not put them on the wall." Siegel shook his head: "The mercenaries who come for money will naturally sell me for money, will lead me and people. The safety of them is in their hands. It is better to believe that pirates only need money and not have to live. It is inevitable that they will be dissatisfied if they are placed in the field. It is likely to change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Irene has been indulging for a while, and he has no other ideas. If there were some of the militias that were taken by Heim, the Southern Allied Forces could not see it at all, but the dwarves were different. Siegel can't always find a child, put a straw pillow in their clothes to make a dwarf? Even if he can do it very much, he can't really send his children to the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel closes his eyes and thinks carefully about possible changes in the situation. If the Faranis sergeant faced this situation, what action would he take? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet suddenly had an idea and said to the two: "Maybe we can seek reinforcements from the Jackdaw tribe. Their cavalry may be able to solve the current predicament. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when she finished, Janet knew that the plan was difficult to achieve. Even if Siegel uses the phantom to make the best of his way, it is difficult to reach the Jackdaw tribe within two days, let alone lead the cavalry back. What they need to solve is an imminent problem, how to make up for the shortage of strength caused by the dwarf's departure in a day or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rock, are they going to go back?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lock?" Elinette’s beard was shaking, and he himself was not allowed to pay attention: “When the Westward Dwarf enters the Great Wilderness, Nominally, they have been expelled from the Mora. Although they are still in relationship with the original clan, they are not legally a dwarf of Mora. If I say it, whether they respond to the war mobilization order can be decided by the mood. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pondered, Locke should not go back. The closure of the Mora's Donkey is the last thing the Westward Dwarf wants to see. They also need access and a way to cross the walled mountains. If you go back, there will be no chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is good news at the end, at least someone can defend the passage of the retreat." Siegel tapped the table with his finger. An empty sound is heard. "To win the battle, there seems to be only one option: night attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the war mobilization order was officially sent to the dwarf, Heim's collar is still their employer, which means that Siegel can also direct them. The determination of the dwarf's obedience to the order is very well known, as long as the goal is chosen. With the right execution tactics, the dwarves will perform with great responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Siegel finished, he kept staring at the dwarf Elinette and wanted to know his thoughts. I don't know what kind of choice the old dwarf will make in the face of this situation. Will he hesitate and will not oppose Siegel’s plan. You know that these dwarves are going home after a day or two. Is it necessary to venture into the enemy line now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master is very worried, but Elint has not imagined tangled. After a little thought about it, he said: "The assault is a way to have no time, try to get big results to change the situation. Don't know if you have chosen the target?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "When everyone was busy paying attention to the duel, Raven Barron conducted detailed reconnaissance for me. The enemy's army had three weaknesses, the siege weapon camp, the granary, and the Dongyingmen." Siegel walked to the desk. Spread a blank sheet of paper and simply draw out the layout of the enemy camp: "In these three places, the granary is the most difficult and the guards are the most. The southern coalition forces also hoard a lot of sand and water, ready to deal with Fire. The engineering camp is more suitable for raids. The only problem is that they are often brightly lit at night. Many craftsmen are busy building equipment and sneak into the troops. It is easy to be discovered. As for the Dongyingmen, because of the weakness of the defense, it is weak. Passing through, you can send cavalry to harass the enemy's supply line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
