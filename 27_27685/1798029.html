			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan’s official ceremony was held on the longest day of the summer day, and its grand scale allowed the residents of the Star City to relish It’s been a few months. Aaron also attended the celebration with his sick body. Evan placed a chair in a slightly higher position next to the throne, and Aaron sat on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the base of the chair is higher than the official throne, but the height of the back is shorter than the throne. These meticulous designs are basically arranged by the Salk headmaster, and the consultants of the school city have also exerted a lot of power. In short, the ceremony was going very smoothly. Evan has already begun to train the Royal Guard and convene a new meeting of the lords to consolidate the rule of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigel is the most powerful lord of the New World and is also invited by this conference. However, he and Evan have a tacit understanding, do not have to attend such a meeting. Siegel sent his "sister" to the Star City, hoping she could serve as the representative of the territory to serve the king. This means that everyone knows well, and many people who don't understand the situation think that this is nothing but in vain, and those who understand the situation do not understand, but also like to bring their daughter to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Evan wants to get married immediately, according to the tradition and the suggestion of the Temple of the Morning, the wedding can only be held in the winter. This means that Little Aaron will be sluggish for a longer period of time - this is a very awkward process, no parents really have the heart to separate from their children for so long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the letter from the general manager Salk, I am afraid that this matter will still have twists and turns. Ai Mengxin is not the Master of the Master and the caster of the City, and her best friend, Naria, is no different from the time-staying spell. Even Evan changed his mind after seeing his son, and he was not willing to be separated from him for a second. So what to do, is there a process of pretend to be pregnant, which has become unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, this does not require Siegel to worry, Evan always thinks of a solution. Siegel, he has enough things to worry about. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation received a large amount of resources from the ruins of the Magic Tower of the Masters Association, which was originally caused by the Masters Association stealing the secret. The practice of the association is to steal, and the practice of the federation is to rob the fire. Anyway, it is not a bright move. It is not necessary for the Federation to continue playing the face of the association. The association also wisely remained silent. It is estimated that the Masters Association should not make such things until they figure out why the nuclear they are making will explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine the feelings of the people of the Masters Association, is there any regret? The Federation has compiled the process of dealing with the Masters Association in the last two years and found that since Siegel became a sergeant. The attitude of the association has changed. When Mier was able to leak the nuclear drawings, it turned sharply. It seems that the Masters Association on the one hand has to suppress the number of faculty members of the Federation, on the other hand, it also believes that there is a secret nuclear, so I feel that the Federation has little value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting the spells of the Knox Association, abandoning the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After figuring out this. The people of the Federation completely abandoned the illusion of the Masters Association and concentrated on their own path. While continuing to build the magical spaceship, they exercised their spellcasting ability and improved the level of spells. On the other hand, they increased their investment in the Magic Academy, hoping to have more Union Masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, at Heim’s collar, there are a thousand apprentice mages, and there are about 300 internship mage who can cast simple spells. They form a new class of the federation. . More than 90% of these people are residents of Heim, and Siegel often goes to the federation to teach, and they also have a natural closeness to Heim’s sergeant. foreseeable. Under such a subtle influence, even if the federation drove the magical spaceship away from the Heim collar, it could not erase the mark of Heim's collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a trick at all, it can only be called the historical trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the fear of the big prophet Lear’s spell, Siegel’s “circle” himself within the scope of the Peruvian nuclear, which makes his life The circle suddenly became smaller and it was active between the castle and the magical spacecraft all day long. He rarely enjoyed the days of running away from time to time, and arranged the rules of magical learning, the creation of magical items, the daily management of the lords, and the teaching of the federations. If you don't still exercise, I'm afraid it will be a blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only when Heim’s magical spaceship “Lucky Soss” was also built, it has the secret nuclear core that can be moved with it. He can safely leave the city of Miele. But there is a place where he can still go, that is the astral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizards of the entire federation, especially the faction chiefs, are doing this. This is not a selfless dedication, but a very clear purpose: only if the federation is strong, the interests of each mage can be guaranteed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstration that Siegel personally took the lead played a very important role. The astral projections bring more than just a spell to the federation. Each time you cast a star projection, you need to prepare a thousand gold coins of red zircon as a casting material. Although the price is not expensive, the production of this gem is not large, so it is best to make full use of it. Fortunately, the Astral Projection can bring the companions into the astral, and the level of the Siegel's spell control can make the 9 Masters swim together. Because it is in the astral world, it is the best place to experiment with various spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federation is too lacking in the division, so Siegel strives to train the division. In the astral world, he can avoid the destruction of the surrounding environment - the whole of the astrology is like a projection of thinking, can not be destroyed - to play time and space-like spells. Other mages can take this opportunity to realize their feelings in order to form their own sense of time and space as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite consuming, so only when you first enter the astral world, Siegel will do this first, and then slowly recover the spirit through meditation. After the experience of time and space fluctuations, everyone will start a separate experiment with their own. The chiefs of all factions cherish such opportunities very much. Who wouldn’t want to touch the edge of time and space as soon as possible and become a sergeant? Although everyone's understanding of spells and magic will be different, the experience gained in time and space shocks will not be faked, and everyone feels that their abilities have improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cherish every second in the astral time, they are building their own complete elemental spell model. And this time. Siegel will quietly "sit" and close his eyes and meditate. There are no fluctuations in the elements around him, and there are no creations of thinking projections. So... everyone thinks that he has to rest because of too much time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a model in which Siegel has been meditating and constructing a virtual cannon in his mind. Not all thoughts will immediately condense into entities. Only those whose details are complete and all aspects can be fully realized in the mind can be converted into entities by the astral. It is not easy to reproduce the things that are so complicated in the virtual artillery. It is necessary to take into account the harmony of the whole and the fine details. Siegel tried again and again, re-examining his invention little by little, more delicate than any artist. More accurate than any craftsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than a dozen trips to the astral projections, the chiefs of the factions finally saw Siegel change his stance and stand up in the stars. At his feet, there was a floating ground so that he could pedal the body, and then a huge long tube appeared on the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Astral Void Cannon - as it is called - has been a lot different from the first version, the biggest change is the use of miniature transmission arrays. When the projectile enters the electromagnetic acceleration track, it does not go straight out at the launch port, but instead hits a tiny portal and is then transferred to the orbital starting point. Thereby achieving repeated acceleration. This is equivalent to increasing the time and distance of acceleration, so the initial velocity of the projectile will increase significantly. The gas element is evacuated in the entire acceleration orbit, and there is no friction and heat in the projectile flying, and no sound is emitted. The silent runestone is equipped near the exit of the Void Cannon, which can effectively reduce the huge roar of the projectile when it flies out. Siegel didn't want to shake his ears when he opened fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing he is not sure about is how long the micro-transmission array can last. If there is no projectile passing through at high speed, this transmission array will run for a few days and nights, but it will eventually have a limit. Siegel discovered that the blind areas of the mage were the effects of the extremely high-speed objects entering the transmission matrix on the spell. Can't always accelerate forever? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the speed of elemental fluctuations is not unlimited, the portal is made up of elements. Its response speed always reaches its limit, causing the "too late" to deliver the projectile. If that speed is reached, the projectile will fly through the transmission array or be broken down directly at the muzzle. Or immediately explode? No relevant theory and research involved this piece, and Siegel felt that all three situations were possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For safety reasons, Siegel will turn off the transmission array within a few seconds after the device is running, and then gradually push up the limit. He aimed the Astral Void Gun in the direction of no one, and then applied several layers of protection. The faction chiefs have come together and looked at this thing curiously. They were sung by Siegel and ended their astrological journey ahead of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not afraid of leaking secrets, but in case of danger, they may not have time to protect. Siegel takes a deep breath and then uses his lightning spell to recharge the Void Gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
