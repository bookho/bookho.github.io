			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nerris is a sinister death, enshrined in the void, with an infinite hatred of "dead enemies" . Since there is no care of the gods, they are independent of the circulation system of each world, so there is no real death for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of time leaves a scar on their soul until they are dismembered and torn. This kind of pain will never end, so the Nexus family tried their best to strengthen their soul strength to avoid endless torture. They continue to condense their spirits, concentrate their active will, place them in the "empty ship", reduce the influence of the outside world; leave part of the soul that is enough to control the action, and continue to find solutions to the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concentrated will does not solve the problem, some souls choose to sleep in disappointment, and some become paranoid in the pursuit of hardship. In the process of continuous integration of generations, some souls have gained a dominant position and become the master. They can not only affect the body that performs the task outside, but also the similar kind in other "empty ships." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nass was originally a creature from all races, and there are still descendants of gods and monsters. At first, there was nothing in the sky, they used the original As a material material, the body creates a void ship that can be hidden and extended. They abandon the characteristics and leave only the commonality of the existence of the soul. But the void is still empty, the material will be less and less, and ultimately nothing will remain. Therefore, Nexus must find a way to plunder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the world was born and died, the protective shell that constitutes the rules is extremely unstable, and a large amount of material will be thrown. Into the void. The lord is able to locate these things and get them before the emptiness has annihilated them. Some fierce destruction processes can't escape even the gods and the kingdom of God, so Nexus discovered the existence of the shadows of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of destiny we carry can be used to repair a broken soul, and the obsessive part of life can also be used to provide energy. When these are When it is extracted, we only have the purest soul shell, which can be used to make up for the loss of the virtual ship in the void, and can make the most basic warrior. For Nikes, the shadow of the soul is everything. The basis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a road to development. Although narrow and rugged, it is already a way of life for Narath in the void. In order to find the "dead enemy" who originally banished them, Nexus constantly armed himself. Out of a road of using plasma as energy to inhibit the development of other elements. They have no fire, no ice, no sound, no soil and water, no plant growth and animal activity. They always create shadows and provide them with a constant source of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although Nexus is very undead, it is not the same." Monroe said: "Norse does not need negative energy, only electricity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel immediately asked: "What is the line of the cockroaches? Why is it that the general weapon is not effective on him?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menro looked at the wizard with amazement, and then thought of his long sword and suddenly realized: "You have a long made of unborn star." Swords can naturally overcome the protection of the void. The enchantment invented by Nicholas can resist the erosion of the void, and the general weapons are natural. The cold metal and the pure energy are hard to break through. Only the ** can be filled with vitality. Close, but the long sword in your hand is taken from an unexploded star, with the power to light up the universe, indestructible, and naturally not afraid of their protective enchantment. But how can an average person be an empty opponent, and how is it an opponent of the Nishis Warrior?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand in the universe It’s not just the only world I’m in. But if Nexus wants to destroy my world, cann’t the gods stop them?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course.” Monroe nodded: "The existence of the ruler is to counter the will of the world and drag them on the battlefield. The war of the kingdom of God is a war of attrition calculated in thousands of years, rarely happens, but for the sense of dominance is He has already mastered the game of war chess. He knows the battle line of the gods and always controls the scale of the battle. For Nexus, there is no need for the people in the world to die. He only needs to make a shadow of the soul. Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There can be a god, there is no shadow of the soul," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the world gods of natural elements, others are because of the desire of the people, so the gods will be born." Monroe said one word at a time. : "If you don't ask for anything when you die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he finally gradually connected the whole thread and understood the strategic purpose of the Knox Association. Although I don't know how much Casper Master knows about Nexus. But he must also make a shadow of the soul, or create a grievance. So they want to build a red-red minaret to create a magical array that makes people "very happy." Perhaps their powerful mind-controlling spell ability is also circulated from the Naras. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe making a shadow of obscurity involves very complicated means and methods, but this will undoubtedly have a devastating effect on the world. Knox and Neckar are actually the same. They are all messengers of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death is a necessary step for every mortal being, but death is not the end of the journey. Whether joining the Kingdom of God, rebirth, reincarnation or becoming the ancestor of the ancestors, the next trip will be opened, full of countless possibilities. But Ner's action is to interrupt it, to attribute it to death and nothingness, so that all souls suffer the same pain as them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to stop them?" Siegel asked with hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't say," Monroe dangled his head and smiled at Siegel: "Do you think you can stop such a huge thing? In front of the Sis, you are just a small stone, a stone that can be easily submerged by waves, and how can you stop the flood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am different from them," Siegel said to Monroe. "Nexus is a product of despair, but I was born with hope. If you have hope, you have change, you have motivation, you have the possibility of victory. Now, you should tell One thing, when does the trip in this room end, where is the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, since you want to know the bad news, then I am Tell you," Monroe said. "We are heading to the stagnation grave to welcome the newly awakened soldiers and take them to replace the body. When the door is opened, there will be three hundred bronze cymbals standing in front of you. Unarmed, under the dust of your star, but you can do it in three In the middle of killing the birth path?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you do, the outside world is also a tolerant. Three thousand, 30,000, 300,000 soldiers, As long as the situation requires, you will wake up. You will besiege your outsider." Monroe sighed and said with regret: "You will die after all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember You said that staying in the body is the most basic soul, not intellectual, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true." Monroe The answer: "So they will not stop killing. They will not be tired of war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then do you know how the patterns on them are formed?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, every throne housekeeper can take this knowledge, which is an important task for us to serve."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and turned himself into a sly look, then said to Monroe: "Then start disguising!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the soul shines brightly, and the shadow of Monroe stands up and shakes in the air. He has been dead for too long, and he has forgotten what is called excitement. "I have seen you!" Monroe said: "I thought there were two identical swords, but I didn't expect that the intruder was you! What kind of ability is this, why can it be between flesh and blood and the undead? Conversion?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is magic,” Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t lie to me!" Monroe shook his head. "How can magic be used in this environment? If it is not the energy of the plasma, you can even send it." The door can't be maintained. Not to mention the transformation. The energy of the element where you come from, this is definitely not magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth is, even if you can't understand It also actually exists.” Siegel said: “Now tell me how to form those lines.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You only need to sit on the throne and let me use electricity The pulp transforms your body like a sculpture.” Monroe let the throne open and made a gesture to Siegel. "For the living, this is an extremely painful process, but the dead spirit will not have this feeling. Compared to being besieged by countless fighters, you now have a chance to live - if you can get through this Field surgery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
