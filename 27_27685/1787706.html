			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body of the steel is not much stronger than the paper in front of the obsidian dagger. Siegel quickly unloaded all the parts and exposed the "thing inside" come out. Www/xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to call people, it’s more like a doll made of wax oil. Siegel still sees the structure of some muscle lines and skeletons, but all of their internal organs become a container and tube filled with viscous liquids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel broke open the skin and muscles, the mucus inside quickly became cloudy, then lost its original form and became a whole in the process of continuous fusion. Group of clay. Exposed to the air for ten minutes, there were only three groups of mud left in front of Siegel, and the smell of mud was emitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The servants who worshipped the vampires have become enchanted, and can’t ask anything. Hey... this taste is really unbearable," Yao En’s handkerchief With your nose, come to Siegel's side, "Anomen, you go with the child, he needs the comfort of the pastor. Jay, do you find anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I always feel that something is missing." Siegel frowned and tried to think about everything about the glue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mud-shaped monster is generally considered to have no mind, only the instinct needed for survival, that is, predation, avoidance, rest, etc. In the records of the Masters Association, only a handful of mud monsters exhibit certain intelligence, such as understanding the specific meanings represented by abstract symbols, making early responses and the ability to learn before certain events occur. But in any case, I have never heard of mud monsters that can wear armor like humans and make use of weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yao En, just said that Sol, the martial arts used by these three guys are the pace and tactics commonly used by the castle knights, right?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome nodded. "Yes, they are very standard. It’s just that the battle is not very good. The heavy armor makes them move a little slow."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So. How similar are their three actions?" Siegel asked, "Is the rhythm, rate, and coping style the same?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome frowned and licked his beard. He tried to think about it and said, "I think the three of them are to some extent...the same. They swing the front arm of the sword. The coordination of the body and the pace, how to maintain balance, etc. There is a problem. They seem to be a teacher, even more similar than that. Jay, do you have any thoughts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen Instilled in the elements of martial arts, I wonder if there will be muddy monsters that are infused with martial arts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomish points to the third brother of the earth "You are Say this is a shaped mud? Jay, even if you say that it is possible to inculcate martial arts, when the three of them enter the hotel, the reaction and the ability to talk to us later are more like wise people. Instead of mud. Can language and intelligence be instilled?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." Siegel sighed. He has instilled a lot of Hem's knights with language skills, knowing that the technique is just like a slap spell, and can only be based on the text, and can't produce wisdom. Combining this information, "I think the original template for these things should be human, and from the same human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you say that?" Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When they just opened the visor, they have very similar faces. In retrospect, it should be a face, due to the different chronological order of death, melting The degree is different. Only some differences are revealed. You know that after you cut it in half, you will grow into two skeletons. The troll can sometimes do this. I guess. Somehow, people pass The mud monster also has such ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A split into multiples?" The gnome spit on the ground. "It's disgusting, this is against the laws of nature!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel made a snap and said to Yao En, "You are right, all things that go against nature." All need to be against the means of nature, it can not be produced out of thin air." After that, he reached out and rummaged through the remaining stench of mud. He needs a lot of effort to pull open the viscous material, and the mud is gradually solidifying over time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-torture really found something. Siegel dug a hard core from the mud, not much bigger than the coin. Some kind of hard object like deep yellow amber. He looked at the gourd and found similar things from the other two mud groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel continually rummaging. Yao En picked up the amber from the handkerchief and looked at it with a magnifying glass. "This thing is like an onion. It is actually layer by layer. Each layer reacts differently to light. You can distinguish them with different colors of lenses. Jay, there are magic runes above, you should let Nali Let's take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly wait." Siegel thoroughly searched the mud for a while until they gradually turned into rock-like hard matter. , has lost the original mud characteristics. "I will deal with the taste first and then call her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the breeze is brought in, the taste will not be clean for a while. But Master Naria just frowned, and did not stumble because of the taste. "Yao En, Jie, what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical lines on the three amber stones are exactly the same, and Siegel is thinking about their use. After experiencing the elemental runes, the energy lens, and the secret energy nucleus, Siegel's accomplishments in the magical array are already deep, but this is not the reason for excluding Naria from the investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look," three people each have an amber, "I found out from the body of the Tin Man, can you tell me what it is for?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not good at making magic and magic items, only from the magical language and magic history." The female mage borrowed a magnifying glass from Yao En. Sitting in front of the inn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Federation Library, books that introduce language and history are very cheap, and books that record magical spells and magical arrays are much more expensive. This will be improved in the future, Siegel thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can only see some short magical array structures, such as repairing structures and ... shields?" Narya was somewhat uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a magical spelling spell." Siegel said after a while, "It turned out that this thing blocked my magical perception."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am particularly sensitive to magical fluctuations, and my eyes can always see magic Aura. But just not just a few vampires, including the three full body warriors, I have not been able to detect them in advance. Now there is a great possibility of the amber stone in their bodies."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, Mother Earth can point out Arnold's evil spirits on them, so don't worry. Jay." Narya said, "And these people are just on the way, It doesn't mean that it's related to our mission. Isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hope so." Siegel stood up and received the amber stone in his arms. Although he made up his mind, he must crack the influence of this kind of magic on the perception of magic. But on the surface, I have to make a relaxed look. "I don't want to stay more beside the stone that the stinky mud has turned into, and the vampires who burned the ash have nothing to check. Is it better to see the little boy we saved?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy was sitting on the chair in a cramped manner, and every time the inn’s door opened and closed, he gave him a glimpse of it, apparently not fully recovered from the shock. Arnold gave him a check on the chains on his hands and feet and applied a cool ointment. Those chains have long been solved by love and are randomly thrown on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The craft of the lock is the style of the castle blacksmith, generally used in the dungeons and other places, and the chain used by the hunter is completely different." Ai Meng touched the boy's Head. Put the light brown hair more chaotic. "Say, why are you caught?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Rijs, my home is in Kay Putrajaya, I went out of town to collect food. I first met the wild boar and was chased for a while. Then I didn’t know how to faint, and then I was taken by a pair of passing soldiers. The soldiers said that I was stealing in the land of the lord, but I I didn't do it. I think they just want to sell me.” Regis looked at Arnold, his eyes aimed at the sacred emblem of his mother on the chest, and then quickly removed “Thank you.” He kept on Repeat this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome holds a bowl of stewed rabbit and put it in front of him. In a gentle tone, "Do you want to eat something first? Do you need us to send you home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
