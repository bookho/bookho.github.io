			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people even drank three cups, and Janis continued: "After a month and a half, no ship came here, everything on the island was When I was evacuated, I had a sweet water well. I was fishing and catching shrimps. I saw the burning light on the Haiping line several times in the dark, I knew that the orc fleet was not far away, they were still on the route. I continued to plunder. I waited for a long time, and finally an elf Clipper saved me. But they were sunk in a place not far from the New World. I and the two elves held the barrel and floated back to the shore. I have no friends in Sham Shui Po. The friends I know have basically died in the sea and have to beg for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The orcs are so embarrassing!" Siegel gnashed his teeth. "This race only knows that looting for a living, building culture with murder and coercion. Why do they exist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only God can answer your question." Janis replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the fangs Janis stayed with Siegel and helped him with some chores. Siegel pays close attention to the influence of the orc fleet on the maritime transport between the two continents, so that Janis can help him inquire about this. The fangs have always had an amazing amount of alcohol, and they can talk about it. In this regard, Siegel has collected a lot of information. Among them, Siegel is most concerned about the situation of the Lucky Sos. The ship has been operating on the southern route and still has the name of luck, and continues to sail at sea intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other boats are not so lucky, and the impact of airline disruptions is growing. It has been a long time since I have not received the cloth and cotton of the Old World, and the winter is coming soon, which makes the civilians feel guilty. In addition, the prices of soybeans, olives, peppers and tobacco have skyrocketed, and some thin-selling businessmen have begun to feel inconvenienced. They gathered and asked the lord to come forward and solve the current problem as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deepwater City has always been wealthy, but there is a shortcoming - not enough ships. After the announcement of becoming a self-governing territory, the original warships of the stars have been withdrawn, so Deepwater City can only recruit pirates, or ask the elves to defend the port at high prices. The lords had nothing to do with the orc warships at sea, so they found the Mage Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has become an apprentice mage, and his rapid growth has also caught the attention of some mages. They investigated the background of Siegel and naturally discovered the title of the brave man he owned and his good relationship with the gem family of the dwarf kingdom. The federation is a very rational organization, they invited Siegel to become a member of the federation, put on a blue robe, and become a trainee mage. He only needs to provide a simple service to the Mage Federation every day, and he can check the primary magic materials in the library. Siegel agreed without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day when the Sham Shui Po lord came to the Masters Federation, Siegel was also here. He was summoned to serve the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a room on the west side of the Sanfeng Pagoda that is a conference room. A mahogany long table in the room, a dozen chairs, two fireplaces. There are very few decorations in the room, only a water meter is placed on the long table, and heavy wool curtains are hung beside the tall floor-to-ceiling windows, and nothing is left outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are windows, but they are rarely affected by the towers, so they look empty and cold. Usually there is very little cleaning, so there is a trace of musty smell in the air. Siegel doesn't like it very much, and always feels like a dungeon that has been closed for a long time. After he entered the conference room, he frowned, then opened his magic book, found the record of the "universal servant" spell, and began to recite the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of magic moves with his mind, and Siegelâ€™s current idea is to clean the room. He concentrates on the steady and continuous output of magical energy to maintain the effect of this spell. As the breeze blew, the musty smell of the room was blown away, the dust on the furniture was wiped clean, the tables and chairs were well organized, and the water timer was adjusted to the correct time. Then he found firewood and ignited the stove, and the meeting room looked a lot more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he stood at the door patiently, and his mind was still reminiscent of the feeling of magic. The same spell, different people will have a difference in effect, just as the same sword will be very different in different swordsmen. Everyone needs to form their own style in continuous practice, and integrate knowledge and strength. This process of learning and practice gave Siegel a great sense of accomplishment. He only felt that after learning the magic, many things became much simpler. If you are a versatile servant when you are a sailor, you don't have to work hard to wipe the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel opened the door for them, and the three men sat on their chairs and said nothing between them. At this time, the water clock reminded the time to come to three o'clock in the afternoon, it is the moment to agree to start the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a flash of light on the chair opposite the lords, and everyone blinked involuntarily. The three federation mages were directly transferred into the venue and sat firmly in the walnut chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the mage is in middle age, not tall, but his gray long hair is always floating in the air, especially eye-catching. There has never been a smile on his serious and determined face, so he always gives a sense of majesty, and he is always resolute and hard-working. All the apprentice mages were very afraid of him, and secretly gave the confession president's mage a nickname, called Alexander - "Lion King" - Pilsen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at his dancing hair in amazement, because he had never seen the chief mage before, and he naturally looked at it with a lot of curiosity. At this time, a lord said: "I am honored to be able to come to the Masters Association and discuss with the wise magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was shocked I have to rush back and retreat. This kind of meeting is not something he can participate in. But he has not been out of the gate, he was called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You stay, young people, listen on the side, and record the main points of the meeting," said one wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who spoke looks like he is in his sixties, his hair and beard are white, and his face is covered with wrinkles. Underneath the thick eyebrows are hidden silver-white eyes, like the stars in the sky, will suddenly shine at the right time. He curled up in a chair, like a tired and weak old man. His staff curled aside and seemed to be slipping from his fingertips and rolling to the ground. But no one dared to look down on him, because this is the strongest bachelor of the Federation, predicting the master of the lord Faranis-Cresto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice just fell, a few eyes brushed and looked at Siegel, everyone guessed the identity of the blue robe apprentice mage, and he was The status of things. The prophet master easily does not speak. Is it what signs he found from the river of time, and these signs are to be fulfilled in this young mage? The lords thought about it and decided to go back to the first time to investigate the apprentice, to win him and buy him. After all, the aristocrats of Deepwater City have sufficient resources to complete these investments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lion King" nodded and said: "Since the proposal of Lord Faranis, I am reconsidering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The lords are asking for it, and naturally will not trouble themselves on this issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel rushed to the ceremony and pulled a chair to the corner of the conference room to avoid affecting the conversation atmosphere of the participants. Instead of using an ink pen, he meditation on the "snap" spell and began recording on the characteristic parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deepwater City is now in great trouble and needs the help of the Masters Federation." The voices passed through the mask are exactly the same, and they can't be distinguished. Which lord is speaking. "The orcs attacked the sea and invaded us. It has already made Sham Shui Po miserable. We believe that it has now entered a state of war with the orcs. The lords agree that the approval of the Mage Federation is required in this matter, and the Federation is invited in good faith. Becoming our alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lion King" first looked at Ranis and found that the prophet master was closing his eyes and seemed to be dozing off - it was not Ready to make a comment. He turned to look at the other side, wearing a brown robe travel wizard William "collector" - Eric. This metamorphosis master likes to travel in the secular world and is more aware of the affairs than the researchers in the other Three Peaks. The "Lion King" first respects the words of the prophet master, because time often proves that his suggestion is the most correct choice. Second, he will listen to the opinions of the Williams and measure the seriousness of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williamâ€™s voice is hoarse, but everyone can still hear it clearly. He said: "The orc's pirate fleet is moving away from the coast. It is not the territory of Deepwater. When they land on the land, they are replenishing the pier at Circle Island, but there is no ownership there. It is still not the territory of Deepwater. Jurisprudentially, they did not invade Deepwater City. Therefore, according to the multi-party agreement after the last big river campaign, the Mage Federation could not automatically follow you and declare war with the orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The Battle of the River, that was many years ago," Alexander continued. "It is an undefeated battle. The future generations should be alert and learn the lesson. I am fighting on the battlefield with the knights of Deepwater City. I have always been unforgettable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
