			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Federation still live on the ground until the spacecraft has not been built. For everyday convenience, most of them choose to find a place to live near the library, or simply buy a piece of land to build their own home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This area is not far from the teaching area of ​​the Federation, where it is now crowded with apprentices. Since most of the people who come in and out are wearing the mage gown, they are dubbed the robe area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire 坩埚 is a pub run by a gnome, who happens to be the relative of Ding Bao·Turan. His business has been very good because he is very good at trying to figure out the minds of the Masters, having the ability to make foods that suit their tastes and to arrange a warm and comfortable environment. It is said that he once served the Masters of the Sanfeng Pagoda in Deepwater City, but no one in the Federation was impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginner's exchange salon is chosen to be held here, as before, to provide opportunities for novice apprentices to communicate. It was the day of the salon meeting, but the gnome stood at the door and blocked the young people who came with his little body and a blackboard that had been booked and not accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the two divisions of the federation are eating on the second floor, even the chiefs of each faction can only wait for tea on the first floor, who can Ordinary apprentices go in? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I finally got serious food!" William put fresh cheese cabbage in the leaves of lettuce, and then he will burn the red venison and white as jade. The lobster was thrown in the back and rolled up and held in both hands. His "other two" arms are also busy, carrying the fine red wine from the Old World and the cool Shield River ale of Heim's local specialty, ready to help swallow food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, he also made a tail that was sharp and beautiful, helping to cut the roast sheep on the shelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said nothing, and he tasted the soup opposite him. This dish is always eaten when he is a sailor, but he can rarely eat it at Heim. If not by the long-term portal of the federation. This sea-fed food is not likely to be so fresh on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William can be transformed into a variety of behemoths, and his food is not much different from the giant beast. Fortunately, the dishes are one after another, enough to fill his stomach. Baked bison legs with fresh squid sauce. A dove pie stuffed with carrots, bacon and mushrooms, and wild boar that has been smashed with pepper. There are also a variety of vegetables and fruits that can never be grown at the top of the Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food that can feed a dragon disappears into the stomach of William's stomach, just like disappearing into a black hole. Siegel waited until he finally put away the "superfluous" hands and feet and changed back to the normal human form. Only the change of the blueberry strength was left, and then he spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't know that you are a member of the federation, you think you have just escaped from the famine!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha! The dwarf is not hungry, but the food is too monotonous. The sausage I made with pork is about to spit, and the soup mixed with mushrooms and moss. The most terrible thing is The insects that live on the ground, although fat, are very fragrant, but the taste is too bad, just like chewing sawdust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now I finally got home, but I don’t have to suffer that kind of sin.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William threw blueberries in his mouth, chewed and swallowed, then shook Shaking his head: "Where is there? There is only a ruin in the Sanfeng Pagoda. A small team of wizards with their apprentices cleaned up and tried to find the surviving treasures." Now the Federation is still the original name and the people. But with the new charter and ideas, it is different from the past. Those who are on the floor can’t feel it, but I can feel it. Come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which one do you prefer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, you are really confident "William pushes the food aside." Look at Siegel on the eyes of the beast, and then marvel at it: "I have to admit that Faranis's vision is good. Siegel, as the youngest teacher in the history of the federation, how do you feel?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have asked me the same question, but there are some differences. He asked what it feels like being the youngest teacher in the history of the two continents. My answer and At that time, except that I felt more ignorant, there was no difference when I was not a teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, I will finally wait for you to come back. You are now the eldest division of the Federation!" Siegel laughed and looked at the changes on William's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No way!" William shook his head. "I saw the Federation Charter. It was a pit for me. I would be bothered by various things." I am a travel mage. I spend most of my time outside. How can I manage the affairs of the federation? And the headquarters of the federation is set up in the Heim collar. You are the lord. Who cares you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why would I ask my colleagues in the building to say that you continue to travel around and throw power to me, the twenty-four-year-old boy? And, What does the Masters Association think about this matter, will it be considered a split of the Federation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is staring at William’s eyes, four elements The light twirled in Siegel's pupil, and he said in a word: "You better not join the idea of ​​joining the Masters Association, and now the Union is extremely sensitive to this kind of thing."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't look down on my personality, I can't do that kind of thing." William taps with his finger Pounding the table, his nails left one after another pit on the hardwood desktop. Then he said: "I have a reason to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to hear the details."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William looked around, then closed his eyes and tried to inhale, then slowly spit out. "The magical array here is very strong, there is a strong elemental strength, I don't know if I can stop the peeping of others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage Chamber?" Geer said the name of a spell. William shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anti-Magic Field?" William still shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the barrier? I haven’t had time to learn the Rainbow Lightball. The Obstacle is the strongest isolation spell I have ever mastered."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William still shook his head: "I am afraid this is still not enough. I still hope that you have a rainbow ball."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Siegel frowned and thought about it for a while. I don't know if this is William's deception, or it really matters. Maybe he wants to see his magical ability. Is there enough qualification to become the chief * division of the federation? When he was thinking, William waited patiently. There is an intriguing smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You wait for me, I need to inform you first." Siegel took out his wand and pressed his throat. Then start talking. His voice was spread through every corner of Heim's collar with an energy-focusing lens, and everyone heard his notice reads(); <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will conduct a magical experiment. From now on, ban all transmission spells and similar abilities, prohibit all thought casting spells and abilities, prohibit any prophecy and parsing For spells and abilities, offenders will be directly fatally injured. It will be easy to know when the test starts and ends, just look at the top of the head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He said to William: "I can only achieve the similar effect of the rainbow light ball with the help of foreign objects, you judge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he stood up Come and walk to the front of the window. The lens is focused by energy. Like a whirlpool, he sucks the elemental power of the nucleus and forms a stable state of polymerization of four elements on the top of his head. A positive tetrahedron that is as solid as it grows up, makes a ray of light, and even the glory of the sun is easily covered up. Soon everyone can't look directly at this four kinds of radiant things, cover their eyes with their hands, or simply hide indoors. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret nuclear is almost cultivating this elemental polymer with the greatest strength, causing instability in the magic items that are using the energy channel. Apprentices have gone outside and used spells to protect their eyes while watching this magical spell. The colorful light has a huge amount of elements, and the power it generates makes the apprentices tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the spell of the Siegel Master? Was it just that he was talking? What spells did he cast? Strong power. If the explosion came out The whole secret city should be gone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Explosion, all day long, the explosion. The fool of the plastic system. You should pay attention to it. The perfect balance of the elements inside. I don't know how Siegel Court did it. Everyone understands that the means available can't be understood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
