			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf Locke walked in the forefront, holding the burning tomahawk. The red flame stained everything around with blood, and the rock in the mine showed a monster-like gesture, glaring at everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel behind him, his wand waving in his hand, commanding the elements of gas to patrol the mine. The sound of the wind rang continuously around, and there was still the sound of ore and rubbish being blown to the ground. This is the tunnel to be used as a pass, so the sooner the monster is led out, the better. Everyone would not be careful to sneak, and deliberately kicked down the various utensils left in the pit, making a clear noise, with the intention of screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They embarked on a broad staircase with the slope of the truck in the middle of the two steps. Railroad tracks were laid here, but they were dismantled as the pits were abandoned. They found traces of the monster walking on the ground, both the trajectory of the body dragging, and the deep footprints next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deepest part of the footprint penetrates the rock with a palm depth, and the blood spider uses eight such feet to support the body. According to Locke’s estimate, the blood here The spider has a height of four meters. If you stretch your legs, you can have a length of more than ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a blood spider's lair found here, and the hard-shoulder family fought a lot with them. They suffered heavy losses. They burned all the spider eggs they could find, but However, these monsters could not be completely eradicated, so there were always a few emerged from the pit. When the emerald was exhausted, the hard-core family simply removed the equipment, closed the exit, and closed the spider. I don't know if it has been over for so many years, there will be no blood spiders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel continues to receive returns from the gas elements, but none Find. He couldn't help but wonder: "It has been abandoned for hundreds of years. Can't they live for so long?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locke shook his head: "It's hard to say. Blood spider The vitality is very tenacious, as long as there is a little bit of food, it is possible to stick to it. Lord Siegel, have you seen blood spiders before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage shakes his head, So I can only listen to Locke. In addition to the eight long legs that can stand upside down on the ceiling, the blood spider has two small forelimbs protruding from the body, and the tip is a claw-like tip. Behind it is a swellable pouch that blood spiders will take to hunt. That is, the flesh of the prey is sucked into the pouch, both for storage and digestion. This is a terrible ambush animal, except that it can be perfectly combined with the surrounding environment. You can also confuse your prey with a special vocal organ. On top of their heads, there is a pair of tuning fork-like tentacles, surrounded by a loop of fluff. With this organ, it can analyze the sound and slowly learn the tone and tone. Then imitate it. Blood spiders don't use language, but they learn from their constant attempts to find the sound that best suits their prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the most common voice is the painful sorrow of the prey when they successfully hunted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a monster in a nightmare,” Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rocker nodded, thinking of everything that happened on the gully and the swamp. "Many creatures are superior to us in terms of body structure and ability, including strength, speed, endurance, and explosiveness. Some animals are good at camouflage, and some are overwhelming after being charged. Take blood spiders, they are huge, but faster than us. The dwarf is still fast. There is a thin airbag on the surface of the body. It seems that a puncture will break, but its toughness can prevent most ordinary weapons. If you encounter this creature for the first time, you will definitely be caught off guard by yourself. After the price, we can gradually find its weakness." Locke shook his axe and said: "Not afraid of cutting, not afraid of swearing, but afraid of cutting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about magic?” Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf nodded: "On the way to the last westbound, we were missing a magician like you. Rune spells are more focused on defense and construction, no fireballs like A spell like a sour arrow. In fact, what we want most at the time is an elf plastic master. It is convenient to lift a hand into a piece of flame. How convenient it is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Siegel remembered the wizard wizard who played against Master McGonagall. His ability to control the elements is amazing. Among all the mages, the power of the plasticist is the most intuitive. Whether it is to cast an ice storm on the battlefield in the field, or to burn a blazing flame on the wall, the Master of Plasticity is always the most watched person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many plasticists in the elves. This is a historical source. The earliest elf's magic is to learn from the dragon and to deal with the dragon, so it attaches great importance to the strength of several basic elements, especially the plastic energy spells that the dragon can use. Over time, the Master of Plastics became the most mainstream faction of the Elf Mage, and they developed a lot of spellcasting skills that outsiders could not master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel put a lot of energy into the spells of spells, and his plastic powers are also very strong, so there will be a flame hound, elemental rune guard and energy lens. If one-on-one confronts the Elf Plastics, Siegel has quite a few means to win, and will not shrink. But Siegel has oneself, and the Elf Master is not alone. If they insist on attacking Heim, Siegel can't fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only with the help of the elemental rune can you barely support for a while, leaving the landlord with some time to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did the dwarf have a war with the elves in history?" Siegel asked: "Can you tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lock thought about it, then shook his head: "Only in the very long time, the two races have fought, and the tragic ones I will not say. Later, we found that the two of us need something completely. Different, rocks and forests, lava and moonlight can all be taken. After that, there is no more fighting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Head, agree: "When the elf attacks, you only need to close the door. The guy with long ears will not go underground, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I understand your mood," Dwarf Locke was not angry at all. "We are more like the dwarves in the west than you. As long as there are still treasures in the ground, the dwarves don't care about the things on the ground. Closing the gates and digging down is like escaping the world. Maybe one day, the dwarves dig Too deep, but found that no treasure can be found anymore. Only the end of the end brought by the flames in the depths of the earth, and then disappeared silently from this world, will never appear again."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you have to tell the dwarf that the world is big, should be more active to join in. Expand outward?" Siegel frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are not militants, Siegel." Locke said: "We came to the walled mountains and could have controlled the entire area, but still at the foot of the mountain. The land has been given to humans. We have never invaded other people's fields, or besieged other people's castles. We just want to use the treasures of the west to attract the dwarves from the depths of the mountains, and more to communicate with the world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel faces with a smile, but the heart does not believe this. The elves can occupy the territory that originally belonged to mankind in a raid, and change the impression of elegance, stability, and peace-loving in the past, so the dwarves who also have a long history. Will it also have hidden faces? He began to understand that things would not always look so simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the dwarves want to close their doors, why don’t they allow anyone to climb over the walls? This problem has been brewing in the heart of Siegel for a while, but he was not cautious and did not propose it. The Westward Dwarf is now working closely with him. This channel is the bond that holds the two sides. Siegel relies on the passage to revitalize the current situation, and the dwarf needs Siegel to defend the east entrance of the passage. Some things are better to leave some space as a buffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red light of the battle axe and the milky white light of the Siegel wand illuminate the deep and long mine channel, but the colors of the two are still distinct. Humans and dwarves walk together in this mine, always guarding against blood spiders that may appear at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the wind element will pay off. They found some strange wreckage. The crowd turned a winding road and found many broken eggshells not far from the main passage. There is no life here, and the fragments of the eggshell are full of dust, and there is a dry corpse buried in it. These blood spiders have not been born, they are killed, and all the nutrients in the eggs are absorbed, leaving only the stillbirths that never have the chance to grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, they found similar locations in succession, each with three or five eggs, but all were broken and absorbed. Who made this kind of thing. Why? There is an ideology in Siegel's heart. He collected some of the wreckage of the blood spider and began to arrange the positioning method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used this spell to find the trolls and achieved good results. Siegel is familiar with the habits and characteristics of the trolls. But I don't know about blood spiders. Only after finding the wreckage of the blood spider can he use it as a casting material for effective positioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It takes more than half an hour to lay out this magical array, but believe me, this will save us a lot of time." Siegel convinced the dwarves and let them Help out. At his current level of casting, positioning is not a very difficult magical array. It is almost impossible to make mistakes when drawing. He only needs to find a flat open space, use the magic wand to outline the line, arrange the node with the rosin powder, and then place the blood spider's body in the center of the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
