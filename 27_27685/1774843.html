			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual summer solstice is an important holiday. This is the longest day of the year in white, a day of happiness and hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning is sunny with a breeze. Janet wore a new gold jewel headdress and held Isaac on the highest tower in the city of Mith. Rhett came here early to prepare a blessing ceremony for all the newborns in the territory last year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope they can bathe the sun that symbolizes life forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original work should be held by the pastor of the Morning Temple, but there is no such thing as a "sunshine waiter" within a hundred miles. Rhett is still not sure which god he is from, but he can do it as long as it is a good and life blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also stood here, on the one hand as a lord to participate in the ceremony, to pray for the residents of the territory, on the other hand as a father. He wore a complex emperor's breastplate, and changed his former style with a long white cloak inlaid with gold rims, a long sword at his waist, and a defensive staff held by his new apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony took place very quickly, and Rhett carefully kissed each newborn and gave them a blessing to enhance their physique and a spell to dispel the disease. The inhabitants of the territory are very fond of this statue and regard him as a trustworthy and TOEFL person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blessing ceremony, affected by divine power, all the children were quiet and there was no crying. Their parents are also solemn and devoted to prayer. Only the konjac can't afford to go down, twisting and twisting in the last row of the team, unable to find a suitable posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not meant to deliberately cause Reid’s attention - at least the main reason is not this. He has just replaced the new body parts, the height, the wingspan and the center of gravity are different from the past, and it is still the running-in period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel began experimenting with the Golem Maker on him, restarting the project that was delayed due to the war. The elemental Gothic parts shipped back from Dragon and Lion Cliff have been on hold for a long time and have now found use. Siegel changed the arm of Erdu and adjusted the iron shell that was always bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now like a hermit crab on the beach, a completely asymmetrical arm, a small body and a large shell. It seems that the aesthetic view of Konjac is not the same as that of human beings. Erdu feels that the strong arm is always better than the slender one. Even if it exceeds the length of the leg and length, it will be dragged to the ground. So it can only be held high in the air - like a giant sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was always one such arm in the whole ceremony to sway in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May all children grow up forever." Reid completed this solemn blessing ceremony with this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people first greeted Rhett, then saluted the lord and his wife and hurriedly left the tower. It was not until this time that the noise of the work was re-emerged in the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bellows, hammer, and loom are interwoven into a noisy sound. Mixed with the shouts and weapon hits from the school yard, the people’s heads rang loudly. However, the residents of Mire City have become accustomed to this voice. In the case of being besieged, such a voice makes them feel at ease and have motivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since knowing that the spirits are going south and starting to attack the elves' army, there is less and less news from the front. After all, businessmen, smugglers and farmers cannot guarantee their own safety when the spirit of grievance comes. Therefore, the intelligence channels established through them will be very unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has other ways to get information, the simplest is to observe the elf army outside the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves patrol every day on time, the ancient trees of war walked through the fields in a monotonous and repetitive pace, with a team of archers and rangers. However, in addition to the patrols, all other activities in the Elf camp have been greatly reduced - singing, tree planting, and practicing martial arts. Unless the elves have the habit of sleeping in the summer, there is only one explanation: they are transferred to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the number of orders against the Rune against Rune has soared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the only thing that really gets busy is the machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is getting hotter as the sun rises. Isaac, who had waited for his parents to talk, was finally impatient and began to cry out loud. Janet kissed her child's face and took him down to the castle. Siegel took the telescope out of the space bag and observed the camp of the distant elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror was originally used to observe the astrology, but the library of the federation was repaired underground and it lost its function. Although the mirror is worth a lot of money, it costs a thousand gold coins, but Siegel just said hello. Just took it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patiently counted, through clothing and weapons identification, today only saw three Ranger captains. After a week of statistics, there were a total of seven captains in the opposite camp. It means 350 elves and warriors. In general terms, there will be fifty casters, including pastors, mages, and druids. Ordinary elf residents are about twice as many as combatants, plus Leah's own escort has 30. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a sudden attack is launched, using the plasma to send the sputum, the army of the city of Mier can break through the opposite line of defense. Destroy the vast majority of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will make Heim famous, then? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only takes a day to prepare, the wizard's mage group will be delivered, and the city of Mith will be bombed. Although the walls here are reinforced with dwarf runes, they have a certain anti-magic ability, but there is no such defense as the Three Peaks. The city of Myrtle and the Heims will become a poem in the New World Elf War, leaving only the shadows that remain in people's memory - and the ruins of the black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it’s not the time to counterattack, and Heim’s collar shouldn’t be the first counterattack. The mercenaries have begun to attack the elves on the land of the southern lords, taking risks for the hand of a sage. So far, there have been few successes, and they have paid less than two hundred gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the Kentucky Knights are optimistic that the number will rise soon. Human beings are good at learning and adapting. A successful experience will soon have countless learners and imitators, and the elves are not as fast. How to distinguish the wizard caster, lead the war tree, how to divide the elf patrol, how to sneak into the camp, these can eventually be written into a detailed war guide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp in Leia is not in danger of being attacked. There is a defensive rigor, and it is only possible to attack her if she cooperates with the Master and dispatches large-scale troops. Collapse the telescope. Siegel sighed and felt very complicated. As the war progresses, it is ultimately necessary to face the master of Lia. Only God knows what will happen at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned around. Prepare to go to the underground workshop. The apprentice Maggot stood under the scorching sun and confronted with physical and natural forces. The large apprentice robes have long been soaked, and he is constantly wiping the sweat on his forehead with his sleeves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides coming to the library to request to become an apprentice, this is a very timid child. He is not very smart, but he is very obedient. Even to the point where the words are heard. On the one hand, Siegel is his mentor, and on the other hand, Siegel is his lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time you have to drink more water and then hide in the shadow." Siegel saw his nervousness and taught him: "You pass It’s a good thing to play a strong body. It’s a good thing to become a mage. You need to exercise your mind. Don’t be stupid.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;马The character nodded and then took a piece of parchment from his arms. This paper has been soaked in sweat and the text above is blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, he wants to take the paper back. But it is already late. Siegel took the past and opened it. Vaguely able to identify the above text, is a historical instrument written in the Dragon language about Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The word is well practiced, the content is OK, that is, the grammar of some sentences is wrong. The dragon language is the foundation, and more practice." Siegel patiently said to him: "The reel that is not waterproof in the future is sealed with a copper tube and then hung around the waist instead of in your arms. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, teacher "The young apprentice took the reel happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Siegel saw surprise in his eyes. Nervous and incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
