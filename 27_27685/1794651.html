			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the afternoon of the same day, it was not Siegel Squid himself who appeared on the stage of the contest, but his lamp god substitute. Fortunately, the day was only a semi-final, and the champion was not decided. There was no awards, so the lamp god did not show up. The true Heim lord, the Royal Count of the Star Kingdom, and the sergeant of the Federation have been staying in the study, thinking about ways to deal with the new situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter sent by Sir Bill from afar, by his own book, also used his plaque coat of arms - a beautiful robin. The jazz mentioned in the letter that His Majesty King Aaron had sent his will to him through the vassal, asking him to find some way to tell Evan "Prince" and hope to meet him. The safest place at the moment is the upcoming meeting of the dwarves. For the peace and tranquility of the starry kingdom, even if Aaron is dragging his body, he will personally board the stone boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jazz never thought about how long their contact with Evan could be concealed, especially when Evan appeared, lived and called the old department back to the starry kingdom from the New World. Given his relationship with Heim's leader, Siegel, this matter will sooner or later involve his head. He envisioned being able to be stripped of the title, even dying from "accidents" or being executed by the assassin, but never thought that Aaron would let him deliver such a heavy letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been managing his former wife’s territory since he married Marshal Ferran Biel, and he has managed everything in order. Keep moving forward. However, he is still not qualified to be selected by the dwarves to participate in meetings held on the stone boat, so he does not know why the meeting was held and its contents. But in any case, Aaron and Evan's meeting will directly affect the situation of the starry kingdom, and at the same time change the stalemate of the old continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Bill said that he would tell Evan about this in accordance with Aaron’s orders, but he had doubts about this meeting. I think I am a federation. The sergeant and the lord of Heim, the only mage lord in the world, should be eligible to participate in the dwarf meeting, so I entrusted me to take care of both of them.” Siegel read the letter five times to make sure that he did not ignore it. The hidden meaning, and then discussed with Janet: "Aaron, what is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can a power owner want, keep himself Power or gain more power." After Janet finished. I also shook my head. "Aaron has not claimed that Evan is a rebel party, so it is very likely that he wants to recruit him. Sir Bill does not use the name 'Prince Evan' in the letter, it is estimated that this is one of Aaron's strategies." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guessing other people’s minds and actions can be more of a headache than studying magic spells. Because of the separation of the sea, relying on the captain of the captain and the merchant. The news from the Old World is always very lagging, and its authenticity is hard to prove. After leaving the New World, Evan was also hidden. Only a few words were passed back, so Siegel could not judge the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can we do? The current situation is like nothing in the dark. It is also necessary to sail in the waters covered with reefs. Maybe The situation in the starry kingdom is more complicated than this. Sir Bill has let me slam into it.” Siegel glared at his forehead and felt that his blood vessels were suddenly jumping. He thought for a moment, suddenly looked up and said: "You said that I am leaving now, go to the starry kingdom to find Aaron to ask how? Evan is not easy to find, but the stars can not run, Aaron must be in the palace." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet shook his head and persuaded: "Don't say if you can see Aaron's majesty, let him confide to you after he sees you." Mantra. Do you have a certain degree of assurance that what he said in the palace is the true intention of his heart? How do you judge the true and false when you arrive, do you use magic for him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You said that I think of an important thing. The sorcerer of the school, especially the prophet Master Lear will already have..." Siegel thought, no need to have luck. "Lerta must know, so I have to take into account the idea of ​​the school. Even if they vowed to serve only, do not intervene, but they chose Aaron not long ago, so they will definitely prefer him on various occasions. In this respect, Evan is at a disadvantage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet took out a handkerchief and wiped the sweat from Siegel’s head, saying: "The meaning of Sir Bill Would you please balance the power of the caster around Evan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is this possibility, but the master never magic, how do I know that I am studying with the city? What is the difference in the power of the Master? I don't think he will suggest that I do things that he can't understand. Especially when it is full of danger." Siegel stood up and walked back and forth in the study, the Master's robe rubbed on the floor. , constantly making a loud voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about a thousand steps, Siegel stopped and patted his head and said with black hair: "I gave up. Anyway, I can't understand why Aaron did this. There is only one choice for today's plan. Go to Sir Bill and ask for it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you bring Sir Bill to the dwarf's meeting? If you can't come Decision. It’s useless to go to him.” Janet sighed: “I know that you like to be prepared and then act, but there will always be accidents, and it’s impossible to master them.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking carefully, the accident seems to always happen around Siegel. How many things can really be done according to his vision? If there is a true destiny in the world, then Siegel’s line of destiny must be in the hands of a god who does not like to play according to common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master thought about it and then admitted that Janet was right. He went to the table and read the letter from Sir Bill again, then summoned the flame to burn it. "A war where the enemy and friends are unknown, the battlefield, the weather and the terrain are uncertain, means great danger. In this case, there is no room for foresight. The only option left is to work hard to strengthen itself and break through all Possible obstacles!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny features nodded, knowing that Siegel finally thought about it. In some cases, the wise man's thinking is not the best solution, but the courage and self-confidence of the brave can always produce good results. In fact, there is a sentence in Janet's heart for a long time, but she will not say: no matter what Aaron and Evan want to do, Heim's collar is still in the New World, how far can the starry kingdom affect? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows this is a selfish idea, but she has to be very sensible. If it wasn't for the magic that took up a lot of time for Siegel, Heim's collar had the ability to annex the entire Southern Lords Alliance and form a new, real country. But where Siegel was a bit ambivalent, the small lords who had fallen were shouting and arguing outside the border all day. The Heim Ranger, equipped with a plasma crossbow, was able to defeat any lord's forces in the wild and suppress them into the castle. Siegel refers to the need to summon magic, you can occupy the castle one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heam has many knights and nobles who have such an idea, the count is not as good as the king. After the Elves War, Siegel completely stopped the expansion of the territory. Even the starting point fortress faced a vast and innocent land, and it was strictly prohibited to expand the area. This conservative approach is to make many people enjoy peace while also making others who are restless sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you going to prepare, calling the knights and the army to go to the starry kingdom at any time?" Janet is puzzled: "Can the transmission array cross the middle of the sea?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone has done it before, cross-continental transmission array, there is no reason not to reproduce." Siegel said: "The federation of the Federation and the Masters Association The law, the full set of drawings have been retained."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you fix it before the start of the meeting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "I have seen the drawing. It is impossible to have two years of effort. But I have another idea that can do this more easily." He calculated it on paper. Get up, then look up and say: "The cost of six or two thousand gold coins, up to 10% of the error, you can connect the two continents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Is this number?" Janet stood by Siegel, but she couldn't understand the formula her husband wrote on paper."At present, there are only more than 200,000 gold coins in the entire territory, but according to your meaning, a considerable amount of various materials and resources are reserved. The daily output of the Gushan Mine is increasing, and the workshops in the Rift Valley can never be satisfied. Like the behemoths, the limit of smelting and processing capacity is still not seen. If you can determine what materials are needed, maybe we can solve the remaining gold coin gap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There is no special amount of precious materials, 200,000 gold coins are enough to use. It is time to test the production capacity of Heim's collar. Whether it is the future weapon replacement or the Golem army, do you need to preview it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These things are not the cost of placing an order with the Federation, but are they made by ourselves?" Janet did not understand: "Siegel, what do you want?" What to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“With the ship relay that stops on the sea, connect the transmission arrays one by one until they board the old continent.” Siegel Said: "Fortunately, I am familiar with Two routes back to the mainland, know there are some islands can take advantage of, maybe the boat does not require much is enough "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
