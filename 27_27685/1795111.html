"Strolling" ** division. He hides his thoughts and thoughts deeply under this mask, and only shows the wrong impression to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which state is true? Or what appeared in that conversation was just another face of William's teacher? After all, he is known for his ability to deform, and his ability to control his body, body and muscles is unparalleled. Siegel chewed what others said, hoping to distinguish sweet water and dregs like sugar cane, but things were not as simple as he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days in Ximu Town, the dwarf of Mora’s Donkey came. As one of the organizers of the conference, Mora's squad sent a team of 60 people, and the mighty rushed from the Cape Avenue. They used a giant lizard to pull the car and arranged for the reloading soldiers to guard on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ximu Town is far from the top of Mora, but people here have heard of the dwarf's strength and scenery. They did not know that the dwarves suffered serious losses in the battle with the goblin world. They only knew that human beings were barely fighting in the battle with the elves, and the dwarves were still strong, so they came out to watch the dwarves. The huge lizards in the city wall mountains made them excited, and the elite soldiers armed with dwarf spears made them excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Siegel and William can see clearly: there are few dwarf elders in this team, the largest age level is only middle-aged, that is, more than two hundred Around the age. In the dwarf society, people of this age should be the main force of the warrior, but as an envoy is too young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their equipment is not the most sophisticated, not even able to have magical armor for everyone, weapons are also a lot of ordinary fines, not magic arms. But whether this is a real situation or just a representation, Siegel is not quite accurate. Given the current tense relationship between the Mola and the Heim, both are possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stopped outside the fence of Ximu Town, but the lizard knights did not come down. A red-bearded dwarf in the lead took out a horn wrapped in a red cloth from the bag behind him and slammed it on his mouth. The horn's voice is very loud, but the tone is extremely low. The strength of the dwarves is getting bigger and bigger. The sound of the horn is getting lower and lower, and then the human ear can't hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can feel the turbulence of the elements in the air, so know that the horn is still making sound. This kind of shock encountered no reaction on the ground, but when it was transmitted to the water, it caused resonance of the water element. The power of the waves and the sea is also coming in. Let this shock become stronger and spread farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the Haiping line uploaded another horn sound, a rhythmic change, just like talking. The dwarf at the top of Mora stopped the trumpet. Repack the horn with a red cloth and install it seriously. They walked around the gate of the town and walked to the cliff on the north side of Ximu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also heard the movement at the end of the sea, so he looked at the past. In the middle of the blue waters, an island-like behemoth is rising from the bottom of the water. "Damn dwarf! No wonder I can't find it. It turns out that the stone boat is under the water! We are completely misled by its name!" William sergeant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sinking doesn’t mean it has to float, Siegel thinks, but he doesn’t have to say it, he didn’t even think about it. is it possible? A stone boat that does not sink will always stay underwater, like a moving coral reef. It is now out of the water. You can also see corals, anemones, starfish and other creatures on the surface. A large amount of sea water flows along the uneven surface, and the clever fish seizes this last chance to escape by water. Siegel saw a shark trapped on a coral reef, dying hard, and the broken coral left countless bleeding wounds on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the struggling shark, Siegel saw four dwarves carrying a horn with a length of more than three meters, and a short body with a horn "Don't be heavy: There are no better adjectives to describe this dwarf, I believe that only such a body can blow this monster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sail in the stone boat, The speed of moving in the sea is not slow. As he approaches the shore, Siegel sees the dwarfs coming to the top of the land and starting to deal with the trapped marine life. They will most of the fish. They are thrown back into the sea. And pick up a channel with a pickaxe and a shovel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone boat does not ignore the ups and downs near the coastline, and it rushes over the reef and seabed all the way. The waves it picks up are not a big deal, and the nearly circular harbour in Ximu Town can block most of the surge. However, the shock of the island against the ground is not so easy to do, it is almost a small earthquake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The houses in Ximu Town are relatively strong in order to withstand the sea breeze, but the double-decker harbour built on the cliff is full of various cranes, which are shaking in the earthquake. Dangling. The weight on the boom is constantly moving. The people at the bottom of the harbor shouted: "Get away! Go out of danger!" The man who manipulated the boom was forced to squat up, hoping to get the goods away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the accident still happened. As the stone boat slammed into the New World, the entire town of Ximu swayed violently. A lot of unfixed things fell from the cliffs, not just the cargo on the boom, even the winch cranes began to fall. William twitched his arms and turned out two pairs of wings of different colors, flying at a very fast speed, rushing to the bottom of the harbour to protect the people there. Siegel also vacated and summoned a large group of small gas elements to swoop up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ** divisions joined forces, one hitting the falling object in the air, and the other supporting the enchantment underneath. The fall caused by the earthquake caused Ximu Town to lose a lot of goods, but did not lose life. Some bruises and fractures are inevitable. If you seek treatment from a doctor or pastor, you will not leave a disability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and William teamed up to repair the damaged facilities, at least to restore them to their usual state. They were grateful to the residents of the town for their heartfelt gratitude. The two men made some publicity for the Heim Collar and the Masters Federation. The name of the federation is very popular, but when it comes to Heim's collar, it has attracted a lot of controversy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rabbit harbor in the south has taken away a lot of business, and many sea boats are not here." They talked a lot: "I heard that the rabbits have made a big deal." Wealthy, we poor people can only suffer here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not go to Rabbit Harbor? With the rise of Heim’s business, there has been Very lacking." Siegel did not dare to say that he was the lord of Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a chance to earn money, but what about the family?" Someone replied: "People can go. But the land, throw it here?" Say: "Even if there is no land, it is not easy to live a whole family. Those young people who have not yet married can be jealous, but most people can't walk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; But an old man’s words are the most alert to Siegel. "I heard that the great count of Heim’s collar is building some magical wonders. It is said that the two old and new continents should be connected in series, and then they will not be transported by sea vessels. What can we do with these coolies and continue to have no work? There are at least ships that need us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked silently to the cliff and stared at the behemoth built by the dwarves on the sea. The words of the residents of Ximu Town are very reasonable, and people's lives cannot change so quickly. The serial transmission array is indeed a magical advancement. Will use a new force to change the Heim collar. But people's changes will not be as fast as spells. Is it destined to sacrifice the happy life of one generation or even two generations while rapidly promoting the construction of Heim's magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is different from the goblin weapon. War is divided into life and death. If you don't adapt as soon as possible, you will have nothing but a sad sigh. The serial transmission array is designed to allow Heim to have influence in the old continent, mainly on the starry kingdom, while demonstrating that the federation is ahead in terms of spell research. While harvesting huge benefits, we must also think about who has lost in this process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serial transmission matrix must be built, and its benefits far outweigh the disadvantages, but it does not mean that the existence of defects can be ignored. It is different from the transmission array of Miele City and Rabbit Ear Port – it replaces the land transportation that has no scale at all. The trans-sea transmission array affects the already flourishing and large-scale shipping. How many captains who are not working will be pirates. The transfer points in the middle of the ocean must not always face their invasion and destruction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to find ways to buffer the negative impact of this magic project on various industries in Heim, just like the tactical method of letting the knights in the territory study pure warfare in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Siegel, thinking about it, it’s time to get on the boat." William flew to his side and put away his wings and said. "If you encounter the dwarf of Mora, I will help you. You are not only the lord of Heim, or the sorcerer of our union! What about the dwarf king? What about Mora? It is part of the dwarf country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
