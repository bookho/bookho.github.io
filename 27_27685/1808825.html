			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are someone talking to yourself along the way? Siegel has no impression at all. As if he was a sly, he returned to his room in the magical spaceship and fell into a meditation in the lounge chair. In politics, he is not an opponent of Lear. Lear has the backing of the school city, like a spider with countless long legs, entrenched in the middle of a large net. Even if Siegel is a huge insect, it will be entangled in this network and lose its advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty scorpions give Siegel a strong learning ability, but the human heart can't learn, Siegel has no achievements in this respect. Planing the identity of the Master, the Lord, and the Cavaliers, Siegel is just an ordinary person who is less than 30 years old. How has he experienced thousands of years of Lear experience? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the starry kingdom, I don’t know how many traps are waiting for Siegel. As long as he is here for a day, not only him, Sir Bill, Giant Kerry, but also his own lords, each of which may be involved. Evan is not referring to the starting point fortress, who knows how the school is in the ear of the king's knees is how to start the fortress! Perhaps in the mind of the king, there is the ironclad proof that the Marquis of Siegel continues to expand his strength and try to be called Wang Jianguo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe in many people’s eyes, "what looks like" is more important than "what is actually." If Siegel did not hand over the production line of the musket, if it was not for the King of the Kings, he would create a magical spaceship, I am afraid the situation will be even more dangerous. Siegel gradually understood the core idea of ​​all Lear's policies, that is, "I can't see you better than me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Siegel could not help but smile. But if you have something good, you will have someone to mourn. If you don't get it, you will take this article. However, there is nothing that comes from plain, whether it is the secret nuclear or "five-six rush" design drawings and recipes, are all tempered. If you can't grab it, you can lie, if you can't lie, you can steal it if you can't steal it. If the anti-counterfeiting method is not designed in the Peruvian nuclear, the pirates will be proud and even show off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters Association has evolved to the present, just as late, just thinking about using its past achievements to steal new results. The two secret nuclear cores he copied were established in the name of two design research groups. I shamelessly take the labor of others as my own. Their purpose seems to be simple. "In order to better share the energy of the spell and increase the number of mages," "all mages must bring each other together. A common growth circle around the Masters Association." When they are required to abide by the agreement and fulfill their promise of support, they are excused for various reasons and practice a spell blockade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wants to understand that he wants to influence the kingdom of stars with political methods. The plan to fight for or to win the starry royal family and weaken the school city will not go on. There is nothing wrong with this idea, but his ability to perform in this area is insufficient. In the starry kingdom, he is in a dilemma. No matter whether it is going forward or backward, it seems that it is not right. For this reason, only this battlefield will be put on hold for a while, and the second front will be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal palace general manager Salk has gradually forgotten the threat of assassination and slowly resumed his normal daily life. However, he is still careful in designing his own way of action, never taking a fixed route or working repeatedly. When the Orc Mank found him, his face was astonished, but he still let go of the Marquis of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**The teacher stood on the berth of the magic spaceship, behind the thick coffin covered with thick canvas. "Salke. There is a tricky thing to teach you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must do my best." Salk's eyes turned and carefully Answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You already know about the count of Count Todd. The immortality and the restoration of youth have been realized. Inside a crystal coffin behind me is the clone of His Majesty the King, you Need to save it. Whether it is handed over to His Majesty the King or directly to the guard, it is your business, I no longer worry about it. Crystals should be protected from light, placed in a cool place, not damaged, nothing else. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorke still doesn't know that Siegel has had a fight with Evan, but he is very keenly aware that something is wrong. Siegel actually surrendered the king's clone. The reason is to give him instead of directly to the king. What do you mean by this? He felt that this was a hot potato, but he had to ask his head with a hard scalp: "Where is the Marquis, who is another crystal 。. How is the prince?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, the prince is too small, the clones will lack sufficient growth time." Siegel's lips gently tilted, and then said: "There is your clone. Saul, you are not worried about assassination, I Give you more life. You will take your own clones. It will be fine if you die once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other people didn't come to me to protect him." Siegel said: "I promised you, I will do it as much as possible. I can't be your bodyguard, you can't always follow me, so I use this clone. I am fulfilling my promise. This body is in the middle age, healthy, strong, flawless, and most importantly, this clone is your own, others can not use it, if you do not accept it, it is completely meaningless. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Marquis, I thank you, I don't know how to repay you." Salk took out his handkerchief and wiped his tears, saying: " Marquis, you let me do what, I will do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need you to do anything extra, take care of Evan." Pointing at the coffin: "The only thing you have about clones is you and I know, so how to arrange this is your business. Now understand why you are coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, Marquis, you can rest assured, I will arrange things well." Salk nodded Yes, and then I went up off the canvas looked know which one is their own, which is His Majesty the King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't worry if I don't ask for something." He shook his hand and said, "Are you leaving for a while?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that in your eyes, I am indeed a good predictor." Siegel sighed and nodded: "I am still in the starry kingdom, but only need Go and ask for something!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, what do you want, I will help you! If you dare not give me, I have a way to deal with it!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Sorke's sleeves, a pair of enthusiastic help, Siegel patted his shoulder and smiled and shook his head. He left something. With Snow Shell and the half-orc, he took off, then headed east and went straight to the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tongtian Tower is the headquarters of the Masters Association, the most powerful magical fortress on the entire continent. It is said that even God can't attack. Of course, this is only a legend. The sage Master always does not think that he can win over the gods 100%, but it also illustrates the power of the magic tower of the Tongtian Tower from one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous array is the attack rebound. The Federation’s Three Peaks Tower also had this array, but unfortunately in the Elven War, because the mana pool was drained, and then encountered elemental tides. The results didn't work much. Siegel learned from Wendy about the general situation of the attack rebound, whether it is a physical attack or a spell, whether it is high-level magic or legendary spells, all will bounce back under the influence of this battle. Siegel estimates that only the virtual bombs of the Xingsuo can play a role, and other electromagnetic weapons may not be able to achieve the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the attack rebound, the most famous of the Tongtian Tower is its space array. From a distance, the so-called Tongtian Tower is just a hexagonal spire with a height of 100 meters, but the closer it is to the tower, the higher she will be. If you look up at the entrance to the bottom of the tower, the tower is tens of thousands of meters high. Straight into the sky. This is the result of the role of space spells. The Tongtian Tower itself superimposes a lot of space spells, so that the tower itself can be large or small, close and far, and can be virtual. Unless you can hack the secret of this "Tongtian Space Array", it is a delusion to want to be close to the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is claimed to be impossible to be attacked, so when the last lord lord seeks refuge in it, even the king’s rebel army and the high-ranking priest of the morning temple There is no way. Here, people can't afford to attack completely, and Siegel naturally has no plans to forcibly break through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did imagine how to attack in his mind. It is not difficult to deal with the rebounding of the ruling. As long as a secret nucleus is allowed, the elemental surge is enough to destroy this squad. But then it is more troublesome: "Tongtian Space Array" can create enough buffer distance, so that the elemental surge will never touch the core of the array. The surge was the strongest at the beginning. However, as it expands outward, the elemental concentration will drop until it cannot sustain the surge. If the rebound matrix is ​​not at the outermost side, the space folding ability cannot be protected. It is possible that Mier can not even destroy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Void guns should be able to deal with space folding, and even space folding may increase the power of the void gun. However, this situation is too complicated. Siegel does not know the laws of space law, so he cannot "target". The Nether Cannon may detonate anywhere, perhaps in the middle of the target, and may not even hurt the fur. This kind of play is obviously not what Siegel hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can’t help but pass the Tianta Tower for the time being, but the Tianta Tower can’t help Sigel for the time being. More than forty Masters of the Masters Association, no one has the confidence to defeat Siegel. The gap between the original divisions is between a few cents, but Siegel’s “shamelessly” possesses the secret nuclear power as its backing, so that he is far superior to other sorcerers in both spell power and spelling endurance. The home court advantage is not worse than the Tongtian Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
