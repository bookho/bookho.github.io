			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representatives of the dragon did not board the boat before, but they have wings and would not find the moving island. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM has not returned to the surface of the water since it left Ximu Town, but it has only floated on the surface of the sea. Instead of relying on the wind, it does not rely on any paddling animals, but instead moves to its destination. Siegel was very curious about this matter. After studying for a long time, he finally discovered the secret of not sinking the stone boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the huge island, the dwarves used a large number of runestones, using their power c longitudinal water elements or earth elements to form a push to advance the stone boat. Water flow. This way, you can continue to provide power even if you dive underwater. In order to maintain the power of these runes and reduce their wear and tear, the dwarves also use the rune matrix method to transfer consumption. The consumables they use are opal and amethyst, so the island is "eat" and these two things have the power to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gets this information from the observation runes, but wants to know the principles of its control core is still insufficient. How to coordinate the work of tens of thousands of independent runesstones to promote the island in the direction of the designated, how to c the island to turn, dive and rise, Siegel wants to know. It is a pity that the dwarf does not allow him to enter the core area of ​​the stone boat, where guards are guarded, and the dwarf priests continue to patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you really want to go, I can teach you several deformation techniques." William bites the candy bar and comfortably puts his feet on the table. Reclining in the backrest of the chair. "It's not the ability to change into a mouse or a kitten, but it's smaller and less likely to be discovered. For example, a donkey or a mosquito."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's the kind of deformation that is sure to kill when you step on it?" Siegel shook his head. "I might as well pass the film world, it would be safer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of rune protections here..." William said that only half of it, when he saw the smile on Siegel's face, he understood: "Well, I know you are joking." Br />/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing on board that is completely unrestricted is the "deck" platform around the two stone castles on the island. It is hard to imagine that Siegel is a ship because he almost never feels the ups and downs of the waves. If you don't look at the surrounding scenery, you think it is a fixed island. The buzz around it is nothing but a tidal voice. Instead of sinking the stone boat and quickly sailing to the center of the ocean, Siegel uses the stars of the sky to determine where they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the day, Siegel sometimes flies off the island to capture the nearby marine fish. Do some simple barbecues yourself. The dwarf's food is too simple, nothing new except for a variety of roasting, only a variety of beer and ale is not bad. In addition to humans, the elves are also troubled. The dwarves prepared many fruits for the elves, but they were not well preserved. These reserves will soon be out of service. So in the end, the elf can only solve the problem of eating in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, Siegel caught a tuna with a weight of more than 50 kilograms and was working on the "deck". The most essential and fresh parts can be eaten raw, but most of them are processed by baking. Dragon tooth daggers are particularly useful at this time, after all, teeth are the greatest weapon designed specifically for cutting food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two small dots on the sea level that caught the attention of Siegel. Soon two small dots have a color, a gold and a green. After a while, you can see that they have huge wings and long tails. The two dragons came from the direction of the New World and quickly approached the stone boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf on the deck took a long mirror and watched it for a while, then issued an order for alert. The two stone forts suddenly turned into hedgehogs, and many of the arrows of the super heavy-duty brakes came out of the slippery dark trough and pointed to the sky. Several dwarf priests and runesmen with their staff came to the top of the castle. Start singing the song of rock in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two divisions, we are still not sure that the enemy is a friend, for safety, please ask the two to take shelter under the island." A dwarf captain walks Come over, very polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we may be able to help." William waved his hand, but his real purpose was to preserve the grilled tuna on the deck, even When the dwarf spoke, the eyes did not leave the baking table. "If the dragon attack does not sink the stone boat, you will be glad that there are two divisions on the deck. Is it, Siegel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no opinion "Siegel nodded. "One or two dragons don't pose too much threat to us. You are busy with you. We won't bother." He finished, ordered the invisible servant to carry the roasting table and walked over. The edge of the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William suddenly closed his eyes and began to recite the spell, his voice was low and soothing, and the gesture used by Siegel was unprecedented. This spell has been written for more than a minute, and it is a certain detective spell from the fluctuation of elements, and the distance traveled is quite far. After the spell was finished, William opened his eyes and smiled and said: "Relax the barbecue, the dragons are not malicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you using? Spell?” Siegel asked. “I only know that it is a kind of detection spell. Can you detect the dragon’s intentions in addition to the spells of goodness, evil, and dead spirit?” He glanced at it. The position of the dragon is then different: "There are still dozens of kilometers, how did you detect it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the one that binds the dragon curse Kind, can only be used for dragons, it is the edge ball in the curse." William mysterious smile: "The dragon's movement speed and threat are great, and their resistance to magic is very high, so detect the dragon position And judging their state is very necessary. I can teach you this spell, through which you can judge the mood of the dragon, they are calm, tired, hungry or angry, etc. Unless you are facing the dragon casting spells, otherwise this Innocent spells that they are not aware of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "The complete bondage spell you have there?" Seeing that William shook his head, Siegel was quite helpless: "Is there only a wizard association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The only sure source." William, regardless of whether he is hot or not, picks up a half-cooked fish and begins to swallow, swallowing three or two. "But the binding of the dragon curse is of great importance, and it is not something that all the teachers can refer to. My spell is still learned from Alexander. The use of the dragon spell is to bear the risk of fighting the dragon. There are only a few masters in the wizard association. Learning, the price they pay is that they can never leave the association's Tongtian Tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel understands. These people are the last line of defense to prevent the dragon from fighting the Masters Association again. No wonder that since the Dragon War, the dragons rarely attacked human towns. It will not appear in areas controlled by the Masters Association. It turns out that these people have always maintained deterrence. Most of the dragons have reached the western part of the New World, and the rest are still in the nest x all year round, just hunting out when they are hungry. Animals in the wilderness. Sometimes livestock will become a delicious meal for these dragons. But for thousands of years, there has been no news that the dragon has burned a castle and looted all the belongings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is considered to be the best peace agreement, and both the dragon and the human wizard carefully maintain the balance. I believe that if one day's power suddenly increases, will it break this balance? Or people at the time can handle new situations more rationally and peacefully. Do not know if their choice will be peace or war? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel couldn’t tell, he thought about it, and found that he didn’t know how to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is getting closer and closer, and then stops at about four miles from the stone boat and begins to hover. Soon the golden dragon informed his name and made a guarantee for the green dragon around him. "I am the dragon representative who participated in the Dwarf Kings Conference, not to attack you. Put your weapons away, there is no need to smash!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King waved Some of the guards were lifted, and the dwarves also let open the space on the deck. The two dragons rushed down. And become a human figure in midair. Siegel didn't know the appearance of Jinlong, but he knew the green dragon. Although the easywalker is no longer a mad image of dryness, weight loss, and lack of teeth, his two eyes have never changed. Whether it is on the grasslands of the north, on the battlefield with the Red Dragon or under the chairmanship of the contest. It was a pair of deep and sad eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King greeted him and extended his hand to Jin Long. "Welcome to the stone boat, the representative of the dragon. Why are you two people coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one dragon, not two people." Grabbing the dwarf's hand and gently rubbing it twice, he quickly pulled back. "My friend is here to find someone. If you send a message, you will go. Is the Siegel Squid Master from Heim? Is it here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The shaper shook his head. Came from the middle of the Golden Dragon and the dwarf: "You are busy, I have found the target."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the stone boat, all forms of fighting are forbidden This is the place for the dwarves. The rules of the dwarf!" Bingquan said loudly, the dwarf soldiers re-elected the weapons in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon simply did not pay attention to the voice of the dwarf, the pace of the shaper did not stop. Jinlong poked the shoulder of the Dwarf King and said, "Where is my room? It must be spacious enough to allow me to stretch out. If not, I will dig one from your floating island."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
