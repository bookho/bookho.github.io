			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deaf knights brought another problem: they couldn’t participate in the upcoming contest. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Moore’s reminder, Siegel remembered this. It’s been nearly half a year since he and Jenny’s specific contest, and I don’t know how it’s going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, you still have a lot of things you should do. The new year's spring ploughing, the magic ship of the Federation, the dockyard of the Rabbit Ear Harbor, the state of the Mora and the Elven Forest, the current situation of the Alexandria and William, the daily affairs and the situation of the southern lords, the cold The recent development of the Raven Tribe and the progress of the reconstruction of the Deepwater City. Over time, these things will gradually change, which will affect the development and security of Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is a simple matter to be a good lord? Siegel had simply thought that it was only the lord's reverie that it was only the lord's dream to just dig up the gold and let the residents plant the land well. The more you want to have a stable environment, the more you need to do your work before it happens. The more you want to lose, the more you have to make a hundredfold effort. Heim's extensive territory has become a leading territory in the New World, and there are more and more things to watch. As a sergeant, Siegel has a magical study that he can't afford, so now he has to make a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a way to throw a job to a group of women. Mana hasn’t grown up yet.” Siegel touched his chin and rested in the living room of the starting point fortress. Thinking about it. How can I have more time to study magic and not cause trouble in the territory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of the Star Kingdom is to establish a small pre-conference meeting, and daily affairs can be handled at this meeting. Only when it comes to aristocratic replacement, division of territories, large expenditures, and military mobilization, must the king decide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must" means that at other times, the king can do what he wants to do - if he can study magic, he can do it too. This approach is a good reminder for Siegel, and it may be possible to achieve this in Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to the city of Miele, he told Janet that he had thought of it, but she did not expect her to shake her head. "That is the system left for the king. There is no such thing as the lord. The law of the kingdom of the stars clearly requires that the lord must be responsible for the territorial affairs and cannot be transferred to others. Because of the fact that in the New World, you set up the lord to handle things, usually No one cares about it. But if you set up the lord's parliament, even if it is small, it can become a reason for the starry kingdom to deprive you of the power of the lord. Aaron will not do this in order to win over you; Evan is your good friend, nor This will be the reason, but this does not mean that Heim will not be in trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that it is troublesome. "Siegel grinned and said to his wife: "This time is hard for you. I remembered the matter of the contest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet Shaking his head helplessly, then said: "Do you still remember the things of the contest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still remember a lot of things, and you and Isaac Put it on the front." Siegel replied with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, your sentence made me happy a lot, I will spare you this time. There are two weeks of the contest, they are all arranged. Swordsmanship, archery, riding, and spell performances have been set up. Even if you are a suggestion made by the sergeant, the Federation’s people have not figured out how to safely conduct the Master’s competition, so they can only choose performance projects. It’s a friendliness to you. I look at their eyes and clearly suspect that you want to win a few more championships, so they only ask for a spell showdown.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't leave, what will be the champion?" Siegel picked up the wine glass next to him and sipped it. In Janet’s eyes*, he had to admit: “Well, I want to try to win a championship. Sir Bill won the championship at the hub of the Fort, and he said that it was the happiest thing in his life, so I also want to try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can do it while watching the show in the stands, while you participate in the competition anonymously, then you are free. Unfortunately, I have to attend. And I can't change my mind as I want, so I can't dress you up. If you find that the Helm leader in the stands is fake, it will be a scandal of the mainland."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold coins are not a big problem. The gold and silver piles that come back from the rabbit ear port every day are not used at all in the warehouse. It is good to spend it. Only the fine gold in the small warehouse has bottomed out, even if you have money, you can't buy it. This kind of mineral is very troublesome from mining to smelting. The quantity is rare, and you can buy it if you want to buy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smuggling from the Old World Did you get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This has been taken into consideration, smuggling the captain!" Janet blinked and replied: "Because of For a variety of reasons, many people are hoarding fine gold, the largest of which is the Masters Association. With the advice of the City City, which lord has fine gold, he is clear, and in terms of funds, the Masters Association has never been short of." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much do you buy, don't be stubborn, I can put the experiment out for a while." Siegel's eyes are full of pride that can't be concealed. Janet was keenly captured. So she whispered in a whisper: "Mr. Master, I don't know what you found this time? Can you tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Powerful, very dangerous things, but its power is indeed very big." Siegel shook his head: "Don't ask, wait for me to find a solution to how to test, and then all the unclear Let me talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you pay attention to safety," Janet swayed his hair and looked at Siegel with a fascinating affection. And said: "Next, do you want to go back to the lab or take a break?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can’t always be in the lab, and I should do my best. Is there anything I need to do recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should ask what can be done in the near future!" Janet rolled her eyes and said : "The trivial chores can be put aside first, there are a lot of knights on the territory, knights and free knights, and some mercenaries, want to marry The opportunity of the Wu Conference is outstanding. The mercenaries are not necessary to see, the Knights of the Knights should always show up below and meet them before the start of the conference." She looked at Siegel's expression and knew his mind, so she said, "Don't worry. "Up to half a day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, let's arrange it. Those people I can't name, don't make me ugly." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe a book called "The History of Important Family and People in the Mainland" can help you. I saw it in your study, this is a few books that have not been turned over at all. The books that have passed. Right. Where did the books of the "Yalong Maid" go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...", Siegel’s mouth twitched A few times, "most servants in the outer study can enter, maybe they took it. For literacy, it is a very popular reading, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Are they still?" Janet smiled softly. Then he patted the back of his hand before Siegel’s embarrassment, and then said, “Go and sort it out first, you look too sloppy, and your body bones are soft and collapsed. This is not the style of the majestic Heim’s collar. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and kissed Janet and went to take a bath. In addition to eliminating the fatigue of work for several months, he is also preparing for the recovery training of the body. He still can't get rid of the idea of ​​anonymous participation in the contest, even if it is not for the final champion - after all, he can't give himself a prize - he wants to see how his level is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master’s mind is all about this, and he didn’t notice Janet’s expression. She lowered her eyes behind Siegel and slowly stroked her belly, a sad look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took away the thick and heavy "History of Important Family and Characters in the Mainland." Although I will also look at it a few times, this thing is too much energy, no need to waste time. He summoned the Light God II to his side and let it begin to remember this big book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, except for the daily processing of the mercenary guild's accounting and scheduling information, you have nothing to do, remember this book." Siegel thinks that the idea that he wants to come out is wonderful: "When I need it, I can ask you directly with a communication technique. Why do you have to worry about your own brain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Master, I will be able to remember all the content in about two days, and I will be at your service." The Light God will answer yes and no. But it is impossible to reject the master's order with "no". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
