			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel descends to the center of the Tears of God, facing the position of the pupil. I want to read the book. ww. He picks up the lake with his hands, then recites the spell and drank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of magic enters his body along the lake, giving him the ability to breathe underwater. Siegel took out the defensive staff and summoned the five light spheres around themselves for illumination. At the same time, he took out the water element Rune Guardian and made it huge, that is, as a guard, it was also a mount, and he went to the bottom of the lake with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silverfish in the water saw the light ball and chased curiously. However, their degree is not the opponent of the dance ball, which is destined to be a futile exercise. And as Siegel continued to dive, the silverfish lost their interest and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the lake, there are not a few creatures except the silverfish, and even the larger fish are not. The food chain here looks very simple, and algae and silver fish form a dynamic balance. The mage's ear is only the vibration of the water and the rupture of the bubble, but it is silent. Where the dance light shines, the clear but empty lake is very lonely, giving a feeling of walking in the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tear lake is not too deep, even at the bottom of the lake, you can still see the slight light on the top of the lake. Siegel stood on a soft sand, where silvery fish's shins and spreading algae were visible. The place where he walked, saw a few otters, twisted his body and drilled to the bottom of the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel activates psionic vision and swings the defensive staff to cast spells. Underwater breathing can make his lungs work properly, but it does not mean that he can speak as normal on the ground. Siegel must carefully control the sound of the spell to match the fluctuations of the magical energy in order to build a normal spell together. Fortunately, this technology is not difficult, just focus on it. I want to see the book 1.╟<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first applied the detection magic, but looking at it, there is no magical light in sight. Then he began to use more complicated spells, using the object positioning technique to find the same material as the metal plate, but still nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of water patrol around, and the dance light sweeps across the lake, except for the sand. Siegel can't see anything of value. He leaned down and grabbed the soil with his hands. From the fingertips, it feels sticky and greasy. This is the condition that the layers of silverfish have changed the bottom of the lake for a long time. Siegel digs down hard, and as a result, this layer of thicker things is deeper than the lower arm, and it collapses while digging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took out another element of the Rune Guardian core. Summon earth elements. With this big chunk, the downward work is much simpler. The earth element sneaked into the bottom of the sand and began to look for unusual things around. After a while, it really appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It holds a metal plate in the hand, which is a bit smaller than the small round shield, which is engraved with dense text symbols in a very small font. Siegel ordered the earth element to continue to search. Search through the bottom of the lake, then let the water element bring yourself back to the shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebreathing to the fresh air makes him a lot more comfortable, but there are a lot of people around him who are watching the strangeness of wearing this clothes with curiosity. Master. When Siegel knocked on the staff, the water on his body and clothes was drained, and then he used it to return to the thick fog camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cracking the hard shell of the outer layer of the metal plate, removing the bodies of algae and shellfish, the text above is finally displayed completely and clearly in Siegel before. He only glanced at it and dropped the metal plate and licked his mouth. I want to read the book 1. I walked in the room with a surprised expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to calm down, because he knows that there is only a short distance from the language of cracking. The newly salvaged metal plate is to read this strange language. Instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to teach a language that is completely ignorant of oneself? In particular, it is impossible to communicate face to face, and can only rely on unilateral records - perhaps a book or a metal plate? Graphics can be associated with nouns, but this method is not insured because the world that another person knows may be completely different from the recorder, so the graphics are not necessarily generic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the metal plate thought of a method: using mathematics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first expresses the basic number with exactly the same circle, with a circle followed by a symbol representing the number 1, and two circles followed by a representation 2 The symbol, slowly expressing the numbers and numbers. Subsequently. The "1 = 1" and "3 = 3" things are repeated on the metal plate, letting people understand the concept of "equal to", and then the concept of "not equal", "greater than", and "less than". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it is still the concept of ambiguity. Including orientation, whole and part, etc. With the direction and the whole, you can bring out the nouns such as the sky and the earth, plus the "parts" and simple pictograms, which will have the sun, the moon, the mountains, and the current. In the end, "people" live in these environments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last part of the language is the verb. To see the book, with the help of the existing nouns and the concepts of "plus" and "minus", Siegel understands what is moving. What is change, who is the subject in the sentence to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very important step in deriving a language is to separate out the complete logical paragraph, which is the sentence. With the metal plate in front of him, Siegel knew the grammar of a language from scratch and knew the key to unlocking mysterious knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read the slate from beginning to end, and then deeply sighed. No matter what kind of race made this thing, they are greatly advanced in the study of the laws of the world. The Masters Association teaches the students to “see the elements through material”, and these people have already done “seeing the essence through phenomena”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Siegel wants to teach a child a language, the easiest and quickest way is to cast a spell into his mind and instill all the knowledge of the language. The slower method is like teaching a child, starting from the correspondence between objects and nouns, gradually forming a concept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never thought about this, starting a language from the concept of ambiguity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to read it again and again from the beginning to the end, except for a few nouns still can not understand the meaning, most of the other can understand. Then he went into the work of interpreting large metal plates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividing sentences, sorting out logical relationships, adding words that have already been understood, can form an article with a lot of blanks, and now only fill these blank. Now that you know that the entire metal plate is reserved for future generations, from the manufacturer's point of view, guess what they will say, and then try to do the "fill in the blank". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very novel experience for Siegel. Look at the script. ww.1 ┝ no spells, no occultism, no sacred power, just pure logic and thinking. While deeply admiring these mysterious people, he had a strange thought in his mind for the first time: If there is no magic in the world, there is no god of the holy. What will this world look like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is so dangerous and so tempting, it seems that Siegel will be introduced into the fallen abyss. Fortunately, the fluctuation of the magical power of the body made him wake up and did not fall into the magic barrier. Magic is an important part of his power. The element is the foundation of the world. I want to do so much! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Nata is under the mercy. With an absolute tacit interpretation of the "capture of power, martial arts and love", Siegel has pieced together most of the information - the rest can only be guessed if more information is found. He sat quietly at the desk, closed his eyes, and said nothing, like a statue of the same statue fell into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things recorded on the metal plate made him very scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The makers of sheet metal - call them "writers" - originally living in a happy environment, they use a strange magic, Use it to change the world. They know that they are on a beautiful planet, and every star in the sky is a fireball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They thought they could travel to the stars until a powerful sky storm surrounded them. Everything has been done, they can't escape the cage of this storm. The only result is death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are crazy, some are desperate, some are desperate and crazy. Only a few writers still have the last reason. They think that after the sky storm, the world will start a new cycle, and they will have the opportunity to get a new life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they tried their best to leave this piece of metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a writer who believes that there is still existence above the sky - Siegel thinks that he is talking about God - the storm is the punishment that God has lowered. Since God wants to eliminate them (using the concept of "equal to zero"), they will not leave any trace of civilization. So all the records must be done in the opposite way, picking those asymmetrical words (using the concept of "unequal left and right, not equal". The records are retained on the metal plate. This kind of metal plate was taken from the stars before the arrival of the sky storm, and even the sun could not melt. They found a way to change the substance, leaving the writer's last record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
