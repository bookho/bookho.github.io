			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This place is terrible." Siegel licked his stiff knees and picked up his hood to look at the current bacon town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are some worse places on the wasteland than you are, you just haven't seen it." Lin Ke spit a black spit on the ground, and stitched his teeth. The tobacco leaf slag is cleaned up together. "Do you think that every place is as comfortable as the stone village? It is my fifteen years of hard work. In the town of bacon, it is just a trading center. In addition to maintaining the order of buying and selling, Kaka will not bother to sort it out." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the eyes of the demon Raven, Siegel overlooked the city, when he only felt that it was messy, ugly, filthy, far away Gives a feeling of discomfort. The town mixes the black of the sludge, the yellowish green of the orcs, the purple of the blood, and the gray and white of the vomit, and combines them into this aesthetically unfriendly place. Now close by, the city's smell and noise are surrounded by a brain, Siegel only feel dizzy, just want to escape from this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still has something to do, here is his own choice, and he can’t turn back when he hasn’t entered the door. He checked his body again to make sure that every possible exposed skin was covered with clothes: gloves, wristbands, scarves, cloaks, hoods, and most importantly, a mask. Siegel used the same method of making the ring to create a fierce mask using silver, copper, tin and lead to cover his own human face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, he also wore the original witchcraft necklace, belt and ring, and a animal headband. As long as no one is licking his mask, he should not discover his true identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tears of the wilderness, it is easy to have the orcs to start with the witches. They are afraid of the magical power of the witch offerings, fear of being cursed, and even more afraid that no one will be treated after the injury. Therefore, Lin Ke took Siegel into the bacon town with a big swing. The orc sentry in front of the door did not dare to collect the money. He also ran over and squatted on the ground to kiss Siegel’s ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel managed to resist the urge to defend himself and let the orc’s mouth kiss his fingers. He said a few words of blessing and waved his hand to let the guards leave. The orcs listened to orders and happily searched other people who queued into the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs do not produce, they basically live by plunder. In fact, they also have farmland, fruit trees, livestock, and mines. But none of these animals who lived were all slaves, a large number of slaves. The slaves came from war, so the orcs did not fight; they also came from selling, so there will be so many orc slave ships in the sea. The slaves will also give birth to slaves, and the generations will work hard for the orcs. Whether it is the New World or the Old World, the scene of the orcs is such a scene, and the whole society is built on the life of slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the very beginning of life, slaves were assigned work based on the health of the newborn's limbs and the orchard's traits. The orcs tattooed on their foreheads, the grass was the farmer, the bones were the tamers, the axe was the coward, the shovel was the completion, the triangle was the handyman and the hard labor, and the ring was the ji girl. The half-orcs will not be tattooed for a while, and if they can fight, they can use their military power and loot to redeem themselves and get rid of slavery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets are in chaos, and there are beasts who are arguing, arranging and fighting. Look at the hilarious hysterical laughter and use the mud to throw the two orcs that are rolling in the mud. Several orc children laughed and used their language and partners to know what they were saying. Several innocent slaves were involved in the battlefield, and after a few seconds they were beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the time to intervene, it can only be done one thing at a time, and there is not enough power to do the work of intercepting intelligence and saving slaves. Siegel can only choose to close his eyes, pray for the slaves, and then continue on his own path. If you can make the orcs suffer a big loss, perhaps the slaves here are likely to get rid of the current predicament. Do people in the south of the Walled Mountain Range do not know the slavery here? In fact, everyone knows it well, but only because of various considerations - especially for the combat effectiveness of the orc army, has not been able to overthrow this system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel observed the surrounding situation while following Lin Ke to the town center. He tried not to pay attention to the slaves hanging on the gallows, but to remember the layout and function of the whole town. But the bodies are really eye-catching. Most of them are caught by the failure of the escape operation. They are peeled together with their families, dyed and hung in conspicuous places to warn other slaves. Sometimes there are no escapers for a long time, and the orcs will randomly pick up a slave and hang it after peeling. Therefore, as long as it is the site of the wrinkled warlord, the skinless body on the gallows will not be lacking. Siegel feels it for a moment. I don't know why. There seems to be no detectable magic enchantment, which means that magic can be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Here?” Siegel only saw a row of Datong shops that were counted as open-air, barely leaving the mud and sewage, and covered with double-layered straw mats filled with straw. The orcs put some wooden poles on the side of the bed and then supported the patched canvas roof. There is no wall here, and naturally there are no windows and doors. Each resident is next to another, without any hidden concept. Siegel also saw several orcs who were arguing in the broad daylight, and other orcs were used to it, and they would be convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no kitchen or restaurant here, everyone can only eat the food they bring, or let the slaves cook for cooking. The only thing that is sold is wine. There are grain wines and other grain wines, as well as wine wines such as red wine, as well as earth wines made with potatoes and mushrooms, and “mellow wines” made with blood. Their common feature is that they are blended with water and can clearly distinguish the inside. Whether it is well water or snow water, but it is still selling well, and the orcs are competing to buy, to water their own thirsty throat. Linke did not drink these things. He said that the wine was "poor and bad" and had no taste. He would share spruce tea with Siegel and squeeze a few drops of honey, which he called "the last enjoyment." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master looked at it here and always felt that something was wrong here. The entire bacon town is no more crowded than here. There are now more than twenty orcs gathered, and their slaves are twice as many. Don't say that you have cast a spell, you can't do it with a mask. Siegel looked at Lin Ke with a cautious look, but he couldn't see anything from his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without a secluded corner, can you calm down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only cowards Going to the edge of no one.” The chunky village chief said sincerely: “The so-called quiet place will continue to be cheaper, but it will be more annoying. You follow me, I know where it is best.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went straight to the center, where there was a small space. Many orcs look at it here, but they don't dare to be too close. Only the general-level beasts dare to use this best bed, others must be prepared to face the sword. If it is strong enough, it will naturally be able to win a place, and even get the favor of some generals. It is not impossible to be promoted to a captain. When Siegel came here, he could still see the blood in the mud, and there were fragments of teeth and internal organs in the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a witch sacrifice, your position is higher than that of a thousand captains. Some generals are not as good as you, so you can stay here. If anyone dares to make trouble, don't Polite, kill directly!" Lin Ke said: "The orcs actually don't understand anything, just understand what it means to kill! So, kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"kill "The word makes Siegel's mood contradictory. On the one hand, he has doubts, but on the other hand, he is also excited. In the war, this young man has been suppressing the killing intentions, especially the tragic slaves along the way, but also the killing of the evil orcs. He read a lot of new spells from the blood magician's spell book, although some of them are cruel and terrifying, but Siegel feels that it is not a must for the orc slave owner. Therefore, the bloody youth in his heart eagerly tried, and he shouted: "Who is not convinced?!" The rational thinking side that belongs to the Master is always reminding him to read, listen, and think. Even so, the murderous gaze is still shot from behind the mask, sweeping around the orcs around. The orcs are very sensitive to this atmosphere and subconsciously hide away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then what do we do, wait?" Siegel asked in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless you want to go to the slave market to change things." Linke put his butt into the bed and said: "There are sometimes beautiful girls selling, I I always wanted one. After all, watching the Orcs is really bad for the eyes - even though the black lights are the same when they are on fire. But, do you have money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nodded. ‘Gemstones, magic scrolls, dragon teeth, keels, I believe this is something that can be sold at a good price. The Master thought, but he didn't know if taking out these things would bring risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we can't go now." Linke shook his head and said, "Let's stay in this position for at least half a day until there is no challenger. You Believe me, after a while, there are guys who don’t open their eyes. You want intelligence, ok, you must be famous first, otherwise no one will trade with you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's good, I will wait and see." This sentence refers to the orcs around, but also to Lin Ke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sat cross-legged, closed his eyes and began to meditate. The Raven Demon stopped on his shoulder and was responsible for reconnaissance and preventing someone from attacking. This attitude makes the orcs unable to touch the mind. They are instinctively afraid of the witch festival, but not going to fight one is not in accordance with the rules. Several orcs cursed in their hearts, how could a witch festival come to the place of bacon town and occupy the position of the general? This has not been encountered before, what should I do? There is no administrative rule in the town of bacon, so only Kaka can decide what to do. Seeing that time is fading, someone has been unable to hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
