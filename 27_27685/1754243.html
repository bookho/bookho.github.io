			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "200,000 gold coins are a huge number, only high-level rare magic items can match it." Locke said: "One of our companions, Rune Master, the magician, and the dwarf Kono Klat brothers, made this material from the wild land, in order to let more people broaden their horizons and understand new knowledge. Now, I will hand this book to me. To you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a heavy book with an obsidian slate cover and a book page. Due to the different animals, the color of the pages is also different. The book was destroyed by swords and other sharp weapons. Some parts were burned by the fire and corroded by acid. The spine was still stained with black old blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cover of the book, a sentence written in dwarf text: "The world is very big, only ideas can be traversed."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reading this book, the knowledge inside will benefit you a lot, but it doesn't stop there." Locke said: "There are complex dwarf runes in the book that can help you exercise your mind and improve. The ability to withstand energy fluctuations. Whether it is a dwarf or a mage, you need enough concentration to control the spell energy. This book is 100 times more effective than any meditation incense, so it is extremely precious. If you need gold coins, learn The Master of the City will buy this for you at a price of around 200,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned and took this thick book. Put it aside, then say to the dwarf Locke: "Locke, your ambitions I understand, I have no opinion on the excavation of the city wall, but why not tell me earlier?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock smiled. "Actually, I hope you never knew." This matter. Before the excavation is completed, we are not sure whether this channel will be discovered by Mola, so I don't want to drag you into the water. But if you can say the number of 40,000 gold coins, then we can't run in the runes. The cost of the tower is over, and it will be discovered sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you decided to pull me into the water now?" Siegel snorted helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Locke's tone is very firm. Siegel is familiar with this tone, and I can often hear such a tone on Elinte. When the dwarf decides something and is prepared to practice it unswervingly, it is such a tone. At this time, it is not appropriate to have a conflict with the dwarf, even if the heart is angry, you must endure it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Heim’s collar. Siegel thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a request," he said to the dwarf: "If you agree, I will continue to support your excavation."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, Lord Siegel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The war is coming. No one can be alone. When Heim When the attack is attacked and your entrance to the passage is threatened, I hope that you can fight alongside me.” Siegel said: “You are the elite of the dwarf elite. They have faced various situations and have suffered from countless difficulties. Killing a bloody road. I want to rely on your ability. Protect my territory and win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves look at each other, they can only use their eyes communicate with. Siegel waited for a while, and Locke finally nodded. "We will not take the initiative, but the walls and passages are ours, we will be responsible for defense. If you have leisure, we can also tell you the experience of the battle. To be honest, your guards can't even patrol, really want There was a siege battle and it was impossible to hold the wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master reached out. Hold with the dwarf. He finally said: "Even if you will leave here one day and go to the other side of the cage, you are still a resident of my territory. Anything can come to me. I believe communication can solve most problems. - Never see this situation again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember, communicate." Locke shook hands and held Siegel's hand and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200,000 gold coins have become various rune materials, and it is impossible to sell them. Only the dwarves can make runes, can't you sell the things bought from Mora's to the Mora? The meditation book can't be sold, and it doesn't say that Siegel likes this book very much, and he reads it in his hands every day. It is said that potential buyers are either the Masters Association infiltrated by the Knox Association, or the school city or the Masters Association on the other side of the sea. It is not a good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has limited energy every day and does not have much time to invest in the manufacture of this medicine. But this just happens to be the reason why things are rare. The price of medicines is rising, but the total income has been raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His life began to become monotonous and regular, except that he took a day out of the week to fix the medicine, and he stayed in the castle on other days. Read books and design the structure of the Golem. In the afternoon he will learn magic and read books borrowed from the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among all the magic, Siegel is very concerned about the transmission of spells, such as any door spell he has mastered. However, any door can only be transmitted to the range of sight, and more advanced transfer can instantly move itself to where it has been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will greatly enhance his mobility and is a sign that he has become a strong master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of learning a transit spell is a bit higher than its previous spells. It is no longer a simple combination and application of elemental magic, but requires the mage to have a very clear understanding of the composition of space. If it is popular, the fireball spell is equivalent to a long sword, you only need to be able to wave it; the transfer technique needs to make a suitable long sword from start to finish according to the surrounding space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two thick books: "The Beginning of the Plane and Space Knowledge" and "Transmission Analysis", which contain the understanding of the past masters in their surrounding world. . It is not difficult to understand the texts listed above, but it is not so simple to understand the true meaning. A lot of knowledge is obscure and even contradictory, but what the whole book requires is to let the Master find balance in contradiction and build his own transmission spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day Siegel frowned and worked hard, but his spells were not stable enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be too tired, take a break." Janet leaned over and looked at the book in front of Siegel. "What is written on it?" Can you show me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp These two books borrowed from the library do not have a protective spell and do not need to be solved with the correct spell. Siegel blinked and stood up and gave his seat to his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet is just curious, like everyone else, there is a sense of magic for magical spells. She flipped the pages of the book and read them word by word from the above record. She tried to remember and understand, but soon she felt dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only feels that her heart beats faster, and her mind echoes with the rumbling sound, like the thunder in the distance. At the same time, Janet began to get cold, like a sign that she couldn't control her transformation. She quickly closed her eyes, rubbed her forehead, and took a deep breath to calm her mood. Thinking like flowing water, squatting; heart is like ice, clear and crystal clear. The magic statue Rhett told her this method to regulate emotions, reduce psychological pressure, and have a good effect on suppressing transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt that she had controlled the change, and she stood up and smiled: "It seems that I have not become a magistrate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked out the window, still thinking about the problem of transmission, and did not notice Janet’s change, just replied casually: "No, no, no, is there me?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you pay attention to rest, I am going to see if dinner is ready." Janet looked at Siegel's back and wiped her forehead with her hand. Sweat on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to prepare dinner, I have elf cookies here." Siegel just turned around and smiled at Janet: "You need to pay attention to rest." Don't force yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet showed a smile and slowly walked out of the study. Siegel looked at her steps and shook it, thinking it was the discomfort caused by pregnancy. It might be a good idea to use a water element to guard her as a wheelchair – Siegel’s mind turned this thought, but the idea was quickly overwhelmed by thoughts about teleportation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immersed in thinking always makes time go by very fast, when Siegel is awakened by the signal from the Raven, the sky has begun to become Dim. Another day passed, but he still could not find a way to control the transfer of space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
