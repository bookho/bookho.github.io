			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fireball, a spell worthy of praise, about how it changed the position of the Master on the battlefield, enough to write a thick research material. Since the invention was invented, almost all of the wizards have devoted their efforts to making improvements in various ways. Thus, the spell known as "most revision" has a range that is far beyond the bow and arrow, a simple trigger spell, powerful power and gorgeous effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the explosion appears sacred in an instant, the scattered flame carries the hot and deadly temperature, the huge roar is deafening, and declares to the world in the most intuitive form. What is the power of the Master. In the face of this power, the intensive cavalry team was hit hard. Many knights were thrown away from the saddle and fell to the ground. The horse screamed, the mane and tail were like ignited flags, and they ran behind them as they ran. Many knights' hair and clothes ignited flames and were being beaten with gloves. Several people chose to roll on the ground, but the horseshoes that were trampled around made them to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic scene has dispelled the morale of many people. Some knights have forgotten the battle and counterattack, just thinking about finding a place to hide. When Siegel saw it, he again summoned the fireball with his wand, and went far away to the knights who could ride on horseback. The second red fireball cut through the night sky, and with a loud bang, the sound of the chaos on the battlefield was overwhelmed. After this time, the remaining three knights can still sit on the horseback, and the others are fainting infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers saw the position of Siegel with the light of a fireball launch. They resisted the pain of the skin and the fire was rushing. The mounts under the arm made a heavy breathing sound, and they saw that the horse's mouth was full of blood. After the battle, these horses could not live. The knights endured the grief in their hearts and vowed to kill the abominable mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry rifle is steady in the air, and it must be steady when they participate in the contest. There are no flowers, cheers and beautiful ladies, only the most basic killing needs. Siegel would not stand stupidly and fight hard with the knights. He saw the half-orc, who had caught up with him, and shouted: "Come them out!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifle is not the other rifle full of honor. It is more than a dozen javelin and flying axe. Many throwing weapons didn't have many heads, but when they suddenly appeared in the sight of the Cavaliers in the dark, they still looked very awkward. The two knights were hit by armor with a chaotic weapon, and a stream of blood spouted. Take the weapon in your hands again. The last knight was shrunk behind the horse's neck, fortunately avoiding fatal injuries. The mage's figure is not far away, he wants to use the long gun to make the final aim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see exactly the same seven mages, which one is true? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a despicable mage! There is no sense of honor!" The Cavaliers roared, watching their own long shots hit the shadows in the air. Siegel pulled out the long sword at the waist. Slightly sideways, accurately stabbed the knight's side waist with a sword tip, inserted in the gap between the breastplate and the skirt. The stardust sword is extremely sharp, and Siegel has only a very slight sense of frustration. The remaining six shadows around him made the same movement, and it seemed like a seven-handed sword at the same time hit the knight. When the mage was also sheathed, the knight had fallen on the horse and was slowly advanced on the battlefield with his mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time William has recovered from the shock. He fell to the ground on the first fireball, and the fallen horse took most of the power of the second fireball for him. Although he was full of wounds caused by fire and falling, he could still bite his teeth and continue to fight. Quickly extinguishing the flames on his body, he first solved the long bow behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feathers are the most flammable parts of William's entire weapon. In the explosion of the fireball, all the flames were spotted. If you burn the polished rod completely, it might be better, but now the tail feathers of the pits will make the arrow rotate in the air. The mage who casts the fireball must be the lord of the city of Mire, even if it is difficult, try to try it. William’s heart rushed up. He was half-squatting on the ground, inserting the arrow on the horse’s body on the ground, and then taking the longbow to start aiming at the shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squinted and carefully observed the situation in the night. He saw his knight being stabbed in the belly and died on horseback. The illusory shadow, but based on the action of stabbing the sword, guessed the position of the real body. Although the sky is still dark. It was difficult to hit the target beyond a distance of more than 100 meters, but the William Knight prayed to the god of warriors and fired his own arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale red shield turned away from the feather arrow that shot at Siegel, and the Master’s counterattack came quickly and fiercely. Three small fuchsia balls were launched from the wand at lightning speed. In the air, a silent arc crossed and hit William. The Cavaliers felt that they were black in front of them and could no longer hold the weapons in their hands and fell into a coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green cloud is very light and does not affect the line of sight, but the strong smell is like being able to condense into substance. Just a light sip, the stinking cloud sucked in can cause severe pain in the stomach, as there are ten hedgehogs madly tapping in it. Most of the warriors can withstand the damage on the body, ignoring the wounds of the sword and the sword, but the pain of the internal organs is another matter. Under the stimulation of the stinking clouds, their faces were distorted, their faces were pale, and the sweat of the beans suddenly emerged from the forehead. One by one, the body is twisted, and the weapons in hand and the ability to fight together are unable to fall. Several people, like drunk, slanted out of the clouds, but still squatted on the ground and vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few physically strong fighters still have the ability to fight, but they are too few. The half-orcs gathered around and pointed at them with simple weapons. Even if they rush to the top, they will first be attacked by throwing weapons such as stoning, and they will face the threat of spears. Not far from there is a mage who looks at it, and the wand in his hand gives off a threatening light. Several fighters finally dropped the sword in their hands and raised their hands and said, "We surrender!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ropes in the mine, now they are sent use. The villagers who disarmed the cavalry’s weapons, armor and the battlefield were able to complete it. When Siegel saw that the situation was under control, it dispelled the smoke. According to the instructions of the captives, he knew that it was the leader of the team that was attacked by his own energy missiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William is dying, but still alive. Siegel knew that this was the murderer who killed the merchant on the road, a man who killed his killer in order to cover up his marching action. He stood quietly in front of William, his hand on the hilt, and many of the captives who were tied up stared at Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows that this battle with the Uther family is not over yet, and if there is a human being in the hands, it will gain advantages in many ways. So he crouched down and examined William's wound: the impact of the fireball and the energy missile smashed his ribs, and he couldn't see if he had a broken organ from the outside. It is meaningless to simply dress this wound, so Siegel took out a bottle of therapeutic agent and poured it on. Then he took William's sabre and put it with his own star dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wick, take him alone." Siegel said: "Check carefully whether he has weapons, don't let him run." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼克!" The half-orc came over with a chain, and he followed a village in the same place that collected the spoils, holding a large sack in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the soldiers escorted the prisoners to the city of Mire. The villagers are hiding. The mine may be a good choice. Remember to bring them enough food. And water. To prevent the Uther family from continuing to attack the mine unexpectedly, leaving the clever people to protect the villagers. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc laughed Laughing, stern answer: "哼克!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel summons the phantom, he will go to the next battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The southern part of Heim’s collar is a rift-filled area. There have been frequent earthquakes more than 70 years ago, and villages and farmland have been damaged. Many residents fell into the dark abyss in their sleep. After the earthquake, it became an unmanned land filled with gullies and rift valleys. I don't know why, even if there is no human interference, there is very little vegetation here. No trees can grow taller, and the gap between trees and saplings for decades is not large. Only the thatch in the field can survive in this place, sheltering a small number of burrowing animals such as snakes and mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few people will come to this Rift Valley area, but it does not mean that there is no one here. The Hugel family in the city of Vannes knows a few roads that can safely pass through the rift valley. They can take the army away from the dense woods of the south and send it directly to the hinterland near the city of Mire. After opening this route, Viscount Uther can attack Heim's collar from both directions and play the effect of double-handed attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still doesn't know that his left hook has failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drey Uther III is 55 years old and still maintains a healthy body and vigorous energy. Under his control, Herod has become one of the best in the South, with the best cavalry and archers. However, Hilo led the current development to a bottleneck and lacked the momentum to continue to rise. So when he heard that the new lord of Heim’s collar had discovered the gold mine, he could not help but admire this lucky guy. He had planned to marry him with his 18-year-old daughter and tied the gold mine territory to his chariot. The death of Kakarov and the wedding of Siegel dispelled his thoughts. He found that if he wanted to be the king of the South, there was only one way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
