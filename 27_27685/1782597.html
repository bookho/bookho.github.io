			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used other methods to come from the walls of the city, if Irene knows what kind of expression is it. Novels.. 】 "Since the Southern Lords coalition attacked Heim's collar, the dwarves announced the withdrawal of personnel and the closure of the country, and Siegel could no longer guess their next move." And after contact with the West Dwarf, Siegel gradually changed his own impression of the dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some respects, the dwarf is a good character with sincerity, boldness, and perseverance. At most, the impression that some dwarves are stubborn and dead-headed. People all over the world know that real dwarves value clan and value family, but few people realize that dwarves will distinguish themselves and outsiders because of this character, and even become quite selfish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Walled Mountains are the land of dwarves. They have been living under the hills. There are not many buildings outside the mountains. Everyone is used to this situation. As a result, the dwarf closed the mountain suddenly, and it was isolated from the sides of the mountain, which was unexpected to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Dio’s words, tribes like the bull rhinoceros can survive without trade with Mora, and it’s better to have a trading life. . What they are most difficult to adapt to is actually the gap caused by the decline in living standards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the help of elite weapons and other dwarven good things, we can hold this beautiful lake without running for water and grass. But who knows that the dwarf is still closed How long has the door been, everyone is worried about whether the good days are coming to an end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look for me." Siegel said: "Working from weapons to our sea The collar is not as good as the dwarf, and the number is certainly not as good as them, but at least it is worse than most people on the grassland. And we have magic weapons and magic armor sales, as well as special products from the mountains, like sea salt and sugar. These are good good things. Besides, your daughter is not about to marry Moore, you are a family in the future. Don't worry about the source terminal. Moore is the lord of the starting point, the title of the Viscount is not bad. It can be matched with the princess of the grassland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dio raised his eyes to see Siegel, wondering what other ideas were behind the other pair of black eyes. after awhile. He asked: "Princess? You want a lot, I am not a king. Then, you call the name of the castle the starting point. Do you want to continue to deepen and extend your territory to this grassland?"<br /><希 />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "I took that name, it is the starting point of adventure, not the starting point of the territory. What is the use of the occupation of grassland, is it necessary for my subordinates to live nomadic life? Innocent. Lack of strategic location, there is no way to defend with the castle, my people will be extremely uncomfortable. And I know that the grass is very tenacious. It is very laborious to change the environment of grazing and open up the cultivated land. My current territory is enough. Big, so you don't have to worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope you can remember and follow today's ideas." Dio let go of his heart, reach out and Siegel Hold together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s smile: “Yes, let’s not tell Moore beforehand, let him continue to work hard.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dio heard this and laughed. Then he said: "Tell you, in fact, my daughter is also worried, I have not eaten well in these two days. I asked for inquiries just now. Let me ask you about Moore's preparation. He also told me not to start with the outpost. The magician is in a rigid relationship. Although her mouth is very hard, she says that she will never be merciless, but I will definitely let Moore win when she sees her. Daughter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people chatted for a while, and the topic returned from the wedding to the local scenery and the dwarfs. When Siegel’s brains turned, he suddenly thought of one thing: “Dioo, if you don’t know the coming Master is me, what are you going to look for?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Dio slammed the thigh: "How do I forget this! You wait for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he Then he hurried back, carrying a piece of cloth wrapped in hard objects. It looks like a tablet. Siegel used a spell to clean out an empty table, and two people opened the parcel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brand new metal plate. There is no trace of rust on the surface. The silver-white boards are engraved with strange words, and there is no such thing as Siegel knows the language. The metal plate is square. The edges are very neat and there is no magical light. From the point of view, it may be part of what is taken from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure that this thing is buried in the mud, but there is no rust?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was not like this when it was just taken out, it was all moss and A layer of rocky shell. Knock off the surface and wash it again. This thing is like a new one, with no trace of scratches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Rubbing the slate by hand, I feel the surface is very smooth and flat, just like the sharp-edged sword. All the text nicks are the same depth, like the most accurate ruler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else is there in the cave?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our warriors dig down and found a large piece of such a board, like a floor tile, paved into a square, there must be..." He looked around Look, then to Siegelby: "There are about two sizes of my tent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The text above?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's this style, but it's not the same. We dig down and encounter a solid rock formation that can't go deep. This kind of board is very strong and it's not too bad." Dio Say: "The shaman of the wild god has seen it. He said that it gives him a feeling of horror, just like a grave. Because the grave is just below our camp, so I have a kind of worry."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I can try to understand the above text. I also need to go to that area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Interpreting text is a very laborious activity, and spells can't help too much in this respect. The text on the metal plate does not have anything in common with the lingua franca, the elf language, the dwarf language, and even the language of heaven and hell. Siegel can only crack it according to symbols or pictures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the strange things that Dio said from the deep pit to the underground cave. It's like a metal lid that snaps over a solid rock. If you want to go down, it's not difficult, and Siegel can do it with earth elements. Natural rocks and soil without magic reinforcement are like mud in front of earth elements, just need to be opened. But such simple and rude entry does not necessarily ensure safety, but there are thousands of residents on top of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the nicks were transcribed, Siegel returned to the camp. He saw that Moore was practicing with Evan with a blunt sword, and the young lord was not the opponent of His Majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shield is raised a bit, don't be so nervous." Evan said: "You are holding too tight, your shoulders will be stiff, your muscles will get tired, and you will use it." It's not flexible. And, don't close your eyes when you are blocking. You have already greeted with a shield, you don't need eyelids to defend, why do you want to close your eyes? Come again!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan's swordsmanship is very strange. It is not centered on the posture and pace as Siegel learned. It is a bracket with triangles, trapezoids and diamonds. There are fixed standards for advance and retreat, attack and defense, and dodge. . He is more free to do whatever he wants, and the action is like having an arc, like a wave, like a flowing water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only a few tricks, Evan can destroy Moore's balance and make his movements deform and burst. Just put the sword in a good position and let Moore hit it himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the use of your training? Moore’s opponent is not you." Siegel has a lot of scrolls filled with strange words. Far away shouted: "He only needs to defeat the martial arts on the grassland, you can't play!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan collects the sword and sees Siegel, pinching his nose: "Who said that I am not playing? I decided to help him and solve some of the opponents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are crazy Isn't this messing up?” Siegel pointed to Evan: “I tell you, don’t mess with this thing, it’s not a joke.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a clear distinction and will not add chaos. By relying on your magical weapons and equipment, he will definitely have no problem in entering the melee, and in the last multiplayer, there must be someone to help him, don't let him be besieged and bullied." Evan smiled and said: "I just told him how to beat me gracefully and reasonably, lest I lose too ugly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Mo Sweating face, as if he does not agree with this point. If Evan wants to lose to Moore on purpose, the two people only need to set up a move routine. I am afraid that Evan is still unable to live, and I want to find something interesting to do for myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
