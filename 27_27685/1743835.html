			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of re-boarding on the top of Mora is as good as the last time, and Siegel’s insistence has earned him more honor. The dwarves re-created a golden belt for him, and at the suggestion of Taklin, several essay masters personally engraved the enchantment. In addition to being able to give the Siegel dwarfs a tough body, it also adds toxin resistance, dark vision and elemental rune guards. A small instrument core and a rune array are engraved on the outside of the belt. Normally, Siegel can be provided with armor protection level like a chain armor. When the spell is chanted, it will immediately summon a faithful earth. Elemental guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was very satisfied with the belt, and also had an intuitive understanding of the technical level of the Dwarf Kingdom. Being able to proclaim the "most powerful kingdom" on this vast land of the New World is built on the leading forces in all aspects. He has strengthened his goal of coming to Mora: to build a closer relationship with the dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental rune guard is a very good start, and the Westward Dwarf finally promised to go to Heim’s collar to let the three families grow a sigh of relief. During the time of Mora, Siegel found stable weapons and sources of armor for his territory, found a magical material channel for experimentation, and negotiated the construction of a patrol tower in the north of Heim. Matters. Heim's "Shield River ale" also has a stable sales, the dwarves will also order gold equipment to the Zeeshan Gold Mine and its affiliated workshops, mostly used to run the basic parts of runes. If Heim has more goods, then Mora will give priority to cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both parties are very satisfied with this result, and the subsequent feast makes Siegel rarely drunk once. As the summer approached, Siegel finally gave a speech to Elinette because of the situation surrounding the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time the dwarf is not sad because he knows his friend is heading for a better future. He smiled and embraced Siegel and took out the sword of his family collection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should wear a decent weapon. The sword of the Dawn Knight is used on horseback, long and soft, not designed for the daily carrying of the lord. "He took out a bright steel sword with a hilt in his jewels." Brilliant. The fire shines on the sword and reflects the smooth and radiant light. The whole sword is integrated, and there is no trace of scars. It is undoubtedly a new one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eilen said: "This sword has a history of seven thousand years. It can be traced back to the era when human beings are still living in wild tribes." Elinte said To: "The god of that time is different from the present, more barbaric and straightforward. In addition to the patron saints of several races, other gods like devout and self-dedicated believers. Later, the new god, which is more benevolent The gods overthrew the rule of the old gods, and humans also rose up. They gradually formed what the world is like. In that era of war, our people created this sword and called it the dust of stars."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarf Elinette throws the sword and throws it to the ground, only to hear a soft sound, no more than the sound of tearing the mosquito net, the sword has already been half The blade is buried under the slate. In Siegel's astonished gaze, the dwarf strode over, holding the blade with both hands and pulling the sword out. Siegel exclaimed. Hurry up and take out the therapeutic agent. Elinette spread his palms, and the sword that cuts the stone did not leave him with any scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This sword can change the feel as you like, so any swordsman will feel comfortable. Its sharp tip is so sharp that it can easily penetrate all kinds of armor protection. Only Mithril and Jingjin can block it. However, when it was made, the sword was set too fast, and it was too late to open the blade. Therefore, besides the sword tip, it was actually a blunt sword." The dwarf said: "This sword is indestructible and will not contaminate any foreign objects. It also saves the maintenance effort. After we know this, we find that we can no longer process this sword. It can't be edged, can't be returned, even the dwarf runes are engraved. No, so it won't bring you the power of fire, lightning or ice, nor can it glow like other magical swords. We think the strength of this sword is the use of unknown materials. Even the most learned dwarves Can't guess the ingredients, let alone make the second one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am interested in such strange things." Siegel took the sword, Waving in front of you. As he moves, the long sword gradually changes its center of gravity and transforms into the most convenient state for Siegel. The squeak of the blade from the air is gradually getting smaller until it is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also swords into the sheath. Place the original sabre on the other side of the waist. "Now I can only get something from you, but I will surprise you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, I can see you grow up and I am the happiest. One of the things." Elinette waved and said goodbye to Siegel, who was full of rewards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood in the castle hall that had just been repaired on the first floor, and his face was very dark. "Show me the dagger," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet took the dagger from the box and handed it to Siegel. After ten days of precipitation, the original smear of the poison on the dagger has expired, emitting an indescribable smell. The material used to make the dagger is just ordinary steel, which is not difficult to buy in the blacksmith shop in the big city. However, it is very vicious to open three blood troughs on the dagger, which can enlarge the wound and can also be used to store poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s daggers: “Fazak, close the door.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run to close the door It’s the followers of Moore, the clever boy who shut himself out by the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the Assassin saying a greeting from Uther?" he asked. "Are you not mistaken?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, that's right." Janet thought she was trying to control her body. The neck that was shackled caused dizziness and was difficult to overcome, but she still heard this. "Is it because of the Freedom Knights?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was a sly battle!" Siegel stood up and slammed The dagger was thrown on the ground. "A person who learned swordsmanship and riding, who should have been a knight became a robber and a kidnapper. It is already the way to death. It is too cheap to fall to the horse! I should be beheaded or hanged on the tree. It’s like treating a pirate!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Janet and said to her: “You advise me to keep my life, exchange for ransom, treat the nobility They can, as a result, be assassinations. I really think that Lord Faranes is right. The lords of the South are some despicable villains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel You calm down, there may be conspiracy inside." Janet persuaded: "We can't judge the ghost of the Uther family according to the words of the assassin. This may also be framed."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak also nodded. I agree. "Although the biggest suspicion is now, they are not completely certain. Everything we can do now is speculation, and there is no evidence. Uther Lord is, after all, a relatively strong lord of the South, and he and his allies can The power to launch is far beyond us. We must be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel immediately asked: "How long can the castle be built?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It needs to be harvested in the fall." Fazak replied: "This is already a very fast speed. Without the help of the dwarves, a castle of this size At least next year will start to take shape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. Building a castle in three seasons, this speed can no longer be extravagant." Siegel said: "I need to build a castle defense as soon as possible. Heim has enough defenses against the inside and outside enemies. I need knights, mercenaries and my own eyeliner, and I can no longer let the assassin sneak into the camp." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will stand Handed down. "Feizha Ke replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at his white hair and tired one-eyed eyes, knowing that he could no longer continue to increase the burden to him. "Fazak, the most important thing for you now is to find a general manager for me, and then hand over the internal affairs of the territory, so that you can concentrate on intelligence analysis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Okay." The one-eyed old man’s shoulder shook a bit, but he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heim's collar is the home of all of us, not a stone castle." Siegel glared at Fitzak's shoulder. Said to him: "We have been killed from the orc city like Macabu, and have experienced the test of snow and fire. What are the threats of the aristocrats who basking in the sun in addition to conspiracy? Before the castle was established I will perform more of the duties of the lord, let the mage who likes to study the spells recuperate. When the castle is built, Heim has the armor, it is the moment when we attack."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understanding, adults," Fitzker said. "I will let the guards be careful and temporarily forbearance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it will make us look weak and cause more trouble." Er said: "Use the bounty to hire people. Check the assassin's employer, at least know who the dagger of the three blood trough belongs to, and then use a thousand gold coins to reward the embassy, ​​five hundred gold coins can provide the exact information and The person with the evidence. Before cutting off the hand holding the sword, I want to let the whole sword know the trembling first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
