			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpses that continue to emerge from the walls of the city wall have not stopped for a day, which makes the residents of Heim’s collar panic. ∷, and with the extension of time, the rot of the corpse is getting more and more powerful, no matter how hard the priests work, they can't get rid of the smell of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most affected is the hard stone village, although the half-beasts are physically strong, but still can not resist the inconvenience caused by stench. Except for the deep mines, the air outside all the caves was polluted, and the alchemy workshop was forced to stop operations to prevent the half-orcs from contracting the disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suspension of the alchemy workshop caused a serious impact on the economy of Heim, so Siegel had to set up a joint with the people of the Federation. The energy benchmarking channel from the city to the zebra mountain leads the endless energy of the nucleus to the vicinity of the village. Then Siegel ignited the air, burned the rancid and plague, and used the dwarf runestone to create an enchantment of the purified air in a crowded place, relying on the secret energy to provide elemental energy, which stabilized the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portable version of the flame furnace can also be used in the hard stone village, which is convenient for burning the body and purifying the water source. Also benefiting from the alchemy workshop, they found that they no longer have to worry about fuel in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another benefit is what Siegel did not expect, that is, the impact of the nuclear version of the higher creation enchantment on the production of the workshop. Originally this spell was used to help the students of the School of Magic internships, reducing the cost of learning alchemy and magic creation. One student had a whim and used the material created by this spell to help smelt gold and then succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the things created by higher creations cannot exist for a long time, compositions like various tests can exist for hours or even minutes. But it is free after all. The biggest consumption of gold was originally in the smelting step. The consumption of various alchemy materials has always been a big expense. Now there is the secret nuclear and advanced creation. The process of changing from ore to gold coins suddenly became very easy and cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you consider the increase in productivity, the real income of Territory Gold Mine is about three times that of the previous one," Alfred said with delight. This means that a full warehouse and a stronger military force mean that when the lord needs gold coins for magic experiments, he will not be eager to grab his hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is one of the best news I have heard." Siegel said: "You gather the craftsmen of the city of Mith, I have to ask them This method can not be promoted in other industries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfred's eyes widened, it seems like a devil like nod, then put each The craftsmen all came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence has never been so correct. But there is no truth in the world, so Siegel still has to worry about the constantly appearing bodies. For more than a week, more than 4,000 dwarfs have been "falling" along the river to the Heim collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the federation does not know how many dwarves are in the Walls, the widely accepted saying is about four million, so this time the dwarf’s casualties have Very heavy. The strange thing is that the death of these dwarves was all killed by small and small bullets, showing one hole after another in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an attack that has never been seen before, obviously more devastating than smashing arrows and bows - after all, consider the sophisticated performance of dwarf armor. If they can all be penetrated, the non-magical armor of other races has no hope of resisting." The most powerful voice in this regard is the chief Wendy of the protection department, and she rarely has a serious expression in front of Siegel: " Some dwarfs have fragments of armor in their wounds. But there are no metal fragments, only the belts used to tie the plate armor. This shows that the dwarf was wearing a body armor at the time. The projectile has the power to break the armor. According to this impact At this stage, the shields of the Masters and the spells of the Master's armor are hard to resist the damage of this weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there any way?" Said: "We can't ignore this threat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two kinds of ideas, one is to use the support of the secret nuclear core, through the production of reinforcement Version of the shield, to protect the effect; the other is to compare Use the drive away metal spell to deflect all the shots that have been shot and make them harmless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, his current status is currently The only sergeant has a great influence on many things. "I tend to use an enhanced version of the shield to cope with all kinds of situations. I have encountered monsters attacked by immune metal weapons. They rely on a rune system to dispel all the metal textures of the sword and the arrow. Weapon damage. Only woodwork and living things can be protected from this kind of protection. I happen to know how to make this pattern, but I want to become a ruler and spell that every wizard can master. This matter is also given to you, and we must guarantee the safety of the Master in all circumstances."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have also checked the pollutants in the river. In addition to a large number of colloidal corpses and body fluids, we have found another organism: goblin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, the dwarf is fighting at the same time with the rubber monster and the goblin? In the wall of the city wall?" Siegel frowned. "There are few goblin in the wall of the city wall, but the doghead is still not Less. Are they hiding in the mountains? I am more and more wondering what happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The union’s colleagues have no clue. But all agree that new threats have emerged." Wendy said: "As far as I know, there have been many mage proposals that will no longer increase investment in the college, but will put more resources on the defense. Maybe The Security Council will discuss this topic in a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with this idea, say a little selfishness, this proposal for my Heim collar It’s also a good thing.” Siegel held the defensive staff and knocked hard Face: "I have been thinking about it recently. You said that the dwarves who are best at ground combat have paid such a heavy price. What can the Federation use to stop the same threat? One of the most powerful mage towers can be compared to Mora Is it still sturdy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wendy shook her head. The wavy curly hair jumped. It exudes fragrance. "Even the Three Peaks Tower, under the siege of the elves, still inevitably fall; I have experienced the failure of the Red Fortress of the Hubburg, and the desperate failure is still fresh in my memory. The dwarf in the Walled Mountain Range is a forbidden rune. Miracle works, but the bodies of these dwarves are drifting out of that big array.” Herger’s eyes, with a confused look, said, “Do you have any thoughts, Siegel?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was thinking, when the local area is no longer safe, can you let the Master Tower fly?" Siegel’s eyes sparkled with excitement. Like the lake, the light reflects the autumn light. "Maybe without the shape of a tall tower, how about a big ship, enough to protect all the mage inside, and to defend and attack like a pirate ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This requires a strong spell, and even the Master must continue to cast a joint spell to maintain it in the sky. Or use the power of the gas plane, but then you need to open the door to the outside world, have you mastered the spell? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can make a secret nuclear, enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter I widened my eyes and rushed over. Siegel rushed to avoid. But the cheeks were still kissed hard. "Would you like to create a secret nuclear power for the federation? To achieve the federation magic spaceship? I can't believe it!" She jumped and danced like a child. "Mysterious nuclear energy can't make the ship fly? I think it can be. It can be!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty's kiss is very hot and still remains in Siegel's Face. If you don't hide fast, I am afraid it will be printed on your mouth. Is she intentional or unintentional? I am afraid both have it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are still convening the synagogues of the Federation to make the secret nuclear? I believe that you don't have to buy a copper plate, all the wizards will come!" Wendy was so excited that she shook her fists and her breathing became very short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time, the secret can not be stronger than the first, because I have to make some modifications." Sigirty, try to Make your expression serious. "This is not entirely for the safety of Heim's collar or my technology, but there are other considerations. You also know that my secret can combine many techniques, including the runes of the dwarves and the resistance of the scorpion. Plasma lines, these require special physique to perform. I don't want to be a non-replicable thing after my death, it is finally left to the Master. This time I will try a more common way. To realize the secret nuclear, but I estimate that the efficiency will drop, so we must reduce the energy output to avoid it exploding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are willing...oh me God!" Wendy held her forehead, and her body seemed to be unstable. She swallowed a sip of water and then gently asked in a nearly hoarse voice: "Siegel, have you really decided to share the technology of the secret nuclear? Are you crazy?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a fool, not a madman, Wendy, I am a sergeant." Siegel smiled and said confidently: "I believe that one day, you will find The secret nuclear weapon is like a fireball spell. It is a disaster for the Kobold, but it is a routine means for others. Besides, I have the best nuclear technology available at the moment. Any improvement in nuclear power can strengthen my nuclear power at the same time, so that I can always stay ahead. I also want to understand that if I can't always stay ahead, it can be a time problem to crack the core, but it is even harder. Control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
