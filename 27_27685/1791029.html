Since Siegel and Evan returned to the city of Mire, they spend more time each day to accompany their sons, to make him happy, and to infuse him with all sorts of knowledge – no matter if he can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim’s people are divided into two factions and have been trying to influence Isaac’s education. Some think that Isaac is best a knight, and his lively and active personality is also suitable for swords and swords, so he often wears exquisite and mighty armor in front of him, and uses wooden swords and fake horses as gifts. The other part believes that only becoming a mage can continue to control the consortium of the territory, at least not let them control the territory in turn, so they will perform tricks in front of him, and use his magical "magic" to attract his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees this in his eyes, accepts it, and never makes a biased answer. Janet once said that if you don't know what to do, the most important thing is how to avoid letting others know that you can't come up with ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle’s platform still retains the big tents at the meeting of the federation. Sometimes the mages will come here to recall how the federation was signed. The charter, and reborn on the ruins. Thick tents made of thick wool are not suitable for the summer heat, so in the summer, the Master of the Change Department also designed a constant temperature array around it, keeping it comfortable and pleasant. The dry wind in the autumn will make the sheepskin turn yellow. So here I transplanted a big tree. Cover it with the rain. Siegel’s near-water tower first got the moon. Always come with Isaac to play here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time belongs to their father and son, no one can bother to disturb, no one dares to bother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Siegel now has one more identity: Archmage. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Masters of the Federation can not believe this fact now, or more accurate, is emotionally reluctant to admit this fact. Siegel exerted space locks and eternal stagnation under the testimony of as many as fourteen Masters - of course he must not be able to help with the help of the Peruvian nuclear - but hòu naturally obtained the title of Archmage. As a newcomer who has been learning spells for less than five years, he has been unimpeded on the road to becoming a Master. There is no bottleneck in the bottleneck, which makes everyone puzzling. Everyone admired Siegel's understanding and the days of mantra creation. But this is not enough to explain the reasons for the enchanting speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel suspects that his nephew is one of the reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sweet pastry in the tent, and Siegel gave Isaac to the servant and Raven Barron. He still has an entire territory to look after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the platform of the castle, the most dà in the courtyard is a fountain. The base is made of marble polished with magic, and the seams are like a whole. In the center of the spring pool is a bronze squid that is sprayed toward itself with the tip of nine tentacles. The rounded head is very ridiculous. But the person who saw this fountain could never laugh, because the tip of the tentacles was not the water but the energy of the four elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy cycle of the four elements reciprocates in the fountain, and a little consumption can be supplemented at any time by the secret energy core, so the jet will not stop every day. The squid's body is full of magical runes, and there are only two spells on miàn: space locks and eternal stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel combines these two spells with an energy focusing lens. Transmitting protection for the entire castle and the surrounding area of ​​one kilometer. Eternal stagnation also replaces elemental placement and becomes a means of dealing with intruders. Eternal stagnation is safer. Better adaptability and stronger deterrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this statue is very eye-catching, Siegel prefers the vines that climb up the walls of the castle. Green plants show great vitality, even if the dwarf rune-reinforced brick walls do not prevent them from climbing. The city of Mire is too new. The only new ones are masonry, swords and magic. Now that there is a plant, there is life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission floor of Shaq’s Manor has been unraveled more than half a year ago, and the Elven Saint has left more than 20 possible locations, mostly far from the Old World. Due to the error of the transmission, every possible place represents a radius of a hundred miles, and it is far from the control of Siegel, so it can only rely on the power of the adventurer to search, which will be a long-term work. As for several possible locations in the New World, Siegel has seen it and found several secret supporters of the murder god, but no place is training liàn and healing centers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the improved portal, Heim can send soldiers to launch attacks anywhere. The ever-improving plasma is so unstoppable that the spells of the Confed Masters ensure the advantage of spells. After several raids, the murderous gods were severely weakened in the New World, or they have been suppressed after they have not risen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe feel the threat of evil spirits, perhaps not wanting to see the New World’s deserted faith, and the temples have accelerated the spread of faith in this land. . With the influx of many of the Mother of the Earth, the temple began to appear in all areas. Its simple beliefs—inclusiveness, bearing, and good harvest—have greatly increased the number of believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the southern lords, there are more temples in the morning, new hopes and better treatments and birth rates are the benefits that the morning temple can provide to people, but behind There should be no shadow of the support of the stars. Their temples are more magnificent than the mother of the earth, and it is easier to attract the attention of believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the kingdom of stars, Evan’s appearance in Heim’s collar has spread, and it has sensationalized the entire southern lord alliance. There are many political speculators. Every day there are flying pigeons or horse-riding messengers who send all kinds of news, express their loyalty, and are sincerely worried about the safety of the king. There are simple greetings, but there are also threats to Siegel not to accept the rebel party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel only wrote a letter to the last person, and wrote a word "Oh", but hòu sent a super-large element to send the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, after everyone confirmed that Evan had left the New World, Drew Uther’s letter was late and there was no mention of it. The things related to the Stars and Stars are just hope to strengthen trade between the two territories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the "meal money" that was taken away in Xi Ling City, Siegel could quite understand the difficulties of Uther Lord. I just don't know that Count Todd is still not in his territory. Since Uther’s lord still did not express a clear attitude, Siegel put the letter aside and ignored it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you don't know what to do with the outside, do your own thing. Siegel has been working hard to develop Heim's collar in accordance with Janet's advice. Any organization will have the most vitality in the new life, the new federation is exactly like this, and Heim's collar directly feels the benefits of the development of the federation. With the development of applied magic technology around the Peruvian nuclear, low-cost magic items have entered thousands of households. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest example is the immortal flame. The original production cost of the flame is 90 gold coins, the price in the store is 110 gold coins, only some specialized adventurers or scholars will buy. Now, the price of the eternal flame in the nuclear range of Heim's collar is only two gold coins, which is equivalent to the annual expenditure of the ordinary family on the oil lamp. Since the immortal flame never goes out and there is no fireworks, the purchase volume becomes very large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple golem is also the latest research product of the federation. It was originally intended to replace the invisible servant and do some simple servant work. Everyone knows that the Master's real yàn room is very dangerous. If you don't pay attention to it, you may be killed by wrong actions. In fact, this is the most important factor that causes the death of a Master apprentice. Unless there is a certain amount of knowledge, no one dares to be a servant to the Master. Until someone came up with a new theory: since the death of the servant is inevitable, the cost is made cheaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They created the simple golem, which has no fighting ability at all, but is able to identify the items and complete the work of taking, sorting, cleaning and delivering. And as long as the cost of around eight hundred gold coins. It is still expensive for ordinary people, but it can be considered a consumable for the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most important inventions are not the above, but the "energy channel benchmark." The most important research of the Federation's mage is the magical array of energy channels that Siegel provides to them. They try to increase the energy transfer limit so that the secret can be used to do bigger things. This research has not made much progress, but there is a by-product, which is the "energy channel benchmark", referred to as the "road mark". This is a kind of magical props with a columnar structure. The only function is to transfer the elemental ability of the secret energy core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
