Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a female mage who doesn’t know which world to come from, and tells all the students how to use illusion and charm to satisfy Your own lust. According to her theory, learning magic is to use, and if you work hard, you must have something to gain. As for those who are hurt by the influence of magic, they can only blame them for not having the means to deal with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a kind of argument that is strong and arrogant. If you are a fist, you must use it for a fight. If you hold a dagger, you must kill. If the previous lecturer wanted to turn the mages into believers of the gods, now the lecturer must turn them all into pure self-interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a theory, not only in the Master. Humanity and magical ability should be separated. Being a mage itself does not change one's personality and way of doing things. Even if it is a reunion, the place where Siegel manages is not without such a person. So he sat down and listened, neither capable nor thinking about changing such people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he said that he used the energy of 10% to listen to the above lectures, then he used 60% of his focus on preventing other students. The remaining 30% are thinking about a question: Where did the mage of these lectures come from, and whether they will be subject to some kind of law change like the lamp god, so they only talk less in knowledge, but they are trying to teach How do you behave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halfway through the lecture, there was an explosion outside the magic tower. You don't have to go out and see what happens. The eyes of the people moved back and forth between the Orc Master and the "Old Master". One hand was decisive and hot, and another means emerged endlessly. Everyone has secretly raised their vigilance against these people. From time to time, they check the state of their bodies and worry about being hurt by some magical effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lecturers are full of enthusiasm, the voice is high and powerful; the people who listen to the lesson are lacking in interest, and they are thinking about each other. I finally got to the class, and the person with the highest remaining points can go to the second floor. The last time was a worm master, this time it was Elf Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worm Master holds his arms around his eyes and keeps an eye on Elf Anna. He is wearing a mask. Although you can't see his expression, you shouldn't have any good looks when you want to come. Siegel saw the second floor of the stairs appear and went over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Master, you will be driven down!" Elf Master Anna reminded me. "I have tried, there is a strong field fist guard, and it hurts a bit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every mage has curiosity, want to know the second floor What is above, so going up the stairs is something that most people will try. The elf didn't say anything. That is to guard the stairs in addition to the force field fist, there are a number of magic spells. All those who are rushed out will lose the protection of defensive magic and become vulnerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people are ready, put their hands on the wand, and the spells are ready to go. As long as the old Master fell off the stairs, it would be the best chance of attack. As long as you take action, you can eliminate this negative person. It can be said that it is the most cost-effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthing did not think of this, but I understood it after seeing other people’s actions. She hurriedly stopped Siegel and used her eyes to signal the actions of other students. Warned him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to be impulsive, falling off the stairs can be life-threatening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Master Rarely opened, his voice was hoarse, and he was breathing with a sudden asthma-like sensation, but it was clearly introduced into the ears. "The elf slut, you stop what he does, let him go up! This old thing is not clear. If he insists on doing this, do you still need to spend points to block him?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf seems to have never heard the words of a half-orc, and is in front of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay. I can go up." Siegel nodded and thanked her. It is not easy to see the warm heart here. Others can not fall down the stone. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anna stalemate for a while, and finally sighed and let the road open. But she panned a few to the side. Blocking most people's attack angles limits their spell selection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply going to the second floor is not the whole purpose of Siegel. He wants to take this opportunity to observe everyone. Chanem entered here before him, and Siegel has never forgotten that it is still very important to find him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saint of the murder god is still very well hidden, or every mage here wants others to die, so it does not highlight Chanem’s Features come. Siegel's gaze swept back over the crowd and then stepped on the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people took out their wands and spent points on the opportunity to apply for an attack. However, they did not appear in the scene where the old Master fell down. Siegel steadily stepped onto the ladder and disappeared into the eyes of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second layer of the Magic Tower is the Spell Demo Room, where all magical spellcasting scenes are recorded with illusion. Although you can't feel any elemental fluctuations from illusion, you can only observe the action and effect of the spell, but here is the most comprehensive collection of spell data in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel came to the second level and produced the thoughts left behind. The spells here are too rich, but it takes a few months to view them if you watch them. If you add different races, styles, and spells in different situations, the content of this database is enough to exhaust Siegel's life to learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times the biggest obstacle that a wizard encounters is not impossible, but unexpected. With the extremely high savvy given by the nephew, Siegel is more open than the average person, so that he can learn and grow smoothly. Now in front of him is a collection of all wizard wisdom, he believes that as long as he stays here for a while, his spell power will be improved by leaps and bounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a chance in the future, and now you must restrain yourself. In fact, if there is no strong curiosity about the higher places, Siegel is not sure if he can stop going upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the stairs leading to the second floor need to be summoned to appear, and the subsequent steps are clearly stopped there. A silver-white lamp god stayed on the stairway and made a different eye in the center of his forehead. This eye is always open and forms a five-meter radius anti-magic force field around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stepped into this force field. The three-eyed light quickly took out two scimitars from behind, and the bright silver light emitted above was not a joke. Then the lamp god flipped a few flowers and worked with two hands, and the two-handed knife easily formed an airtight net in the air. Although there is no attack, the action of the lamp god still makes Siegel's hair stand upright. Through the dwarf battle skills and the training of the Cavaliers. Siegel quickly judged that the martial arts of this lamp god should be above himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am able to climb to the top, and now I have to pass through here." Siegel showed his neck tattoo to the lamp god. The three-eye lamp God is sure that the knife is upright, the eyebrows are closed, and the other two eyes are open. The anti-magic force field disappeared and the upward spiral staircase was let out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel picks up the stairs. Just seen by the lingering light of Elf Anna's eyes. How can he go to a higher level? There is doubt in the spirit of the elf, but it is because of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now I can basically tell who is who." The elf smiled and summoned his own lamp god, asking him to demonstrate all the spells related to time slowdown. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third layer of the Magic Tower is the full picture of the multi-world - or, to be precise, all the maps that the magic god knows. From here you can see the gate city at the top of the central endless peak and the 16 outer planes surrounding the endless peak. The outer plane is connected to the main material plane of numerous crystal walls through the astral, and then through the transition of the etheric boundary, it can go to the eighteen inner planes composed of four elements and positive and negative energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a complex and sophisticated world model, but there are large areas that are blank. Even the god of magic is too small compared to the whole world. His eyes and footprints are just the same size as a grain of sand on the beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place is worth a stay for Siegel. Through this picture, he can know Lear's understanding of the plural world, where he has been. Where is the place he completely does not know. Similar to Sigel's previous speculation, the outer plane of chaotic sea is where Leer has never set foot, where the power of chaos is fatal to the magic that requires order to combine. In addition, the gray wilderness and the endless abyss also have a lot of blanks, there are only some famous fortresses on the map, and there is nothing else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel turned his attention to the main material plane. Here he only saw a few crystal walls. All mages know that the number of crystal walls is almost infinite, but the isolation between them is very powerful. In addition to the traveler with special skills, even the gods or legendary wizards can easily wear the crystal wall. In addition, the divine power will be isolated by the crystal wall, so the god of magic, knowledge and prophecy will know a few crystal walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch the wall of the world of thunder walls with your hands. Siegel can see a map of the two continents. Over the eastern continent, there is a layer of clouds with stars, often with small eyes appearing from the clouds, to see what happens underneath. The clouds on the New World are much thinner, and there are few stars or eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is basically the same as what the holders of the ten-faced scorpion said. The god of magic and prophecy, covering the whole world with the power of prophecy. Everything that happened, everyone's mind and plan could not escape his control. Only after devouring the world of the writers and creating the New World, only the region is out of surveillance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky above Heim and the Mora and the New World to the west are completely blank and the most free place. The starry kingdom is wrapped up in the most covert, and the control is also the strongest. A bright magic tower stands on the map, which is exactly the Tower of the Masters Association. Siegel pulled the Tongtian Tower to his eyes with a little hand. The result is not the architectural structure of the tower, but a broad library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless bookshelves and countless books that extend from the foot to the end of the field of vision. Here is the temple of knowledge and priesthood, the ultimate embodiment of its power. All the knowledge and answers that Light God needs are here, so they all have a spiritual link to communicate with the third layer, and the information that Black Iron Stone can mobilize is also derived from this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to imagine how many things the god of knowledge needs to remember. Do you know whether the information is directly integrated with him or is it only stored in the Kingdom of God? This huge library was a little dizzy when it only looked at the two eyes. Anyone who is in front of a huge amount of information and wisdom will feel shocked. If it's attractive, it's more than the second-level spell demo, but it's also more time consuming. Extremely poor, even for several generations. Books here are not likely to be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel hurried back two steps, pulling the field of vision back to the state of the whole picture. The wall logo of the Thunder Wall world is gleaming, but the world of the goblin that is half-fused with it is dull. Some of the remaining crystal walls are brighter, some are darker, and Siegel thinks about the reason. The brightness of the crystal wall represents how much faith is provided to the fire. The brighter the world is, the more important it is to God – the more conspicuous it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you talk about this aspect alone, the racial gods know more about the world than the local gods such as the god of magic and the natural environment. The world of elves can generate the power of faith, so the number of crystal walls facing the elves is absolutely a huge number. Every world has different brightness, but I am afraid that only the brightest and darkest ones can attract the attention of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elves have said that this world is only a drop in the ocean for the elf god, and nothing can happen. Only when he saw the full picture of the multiverse in front of him, Siegel really understood the meaning of this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of the crystal wall that the magical gods extend to is completely the same for Siegel’s family and cannot be used as a foothold. The outer plane is vast and innocent, even if the magical god of the thriving wants to find someone inside it is very difficult. But the outer plane is not a good place to live. It is difficult to solve only one "ideal-oriented assimilation". This assimilation is even more powerful than the Knox’s sacred ritual. As long as you live on an outer plane, it will inevitably be affected. Even the magical creature of the rigid machine, if placed in the Chaos Sea, will become confused and lose self-control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole picture, the natural environment can live, there is no inclination, and there is only one place where the magic god has never set foot, that is, the door at the center of the outer domain city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out to the position of the gate city, and the relevant knowledge introduction was projected. As the heart of the outer world, there are countless portals leading to every corner of the world. Whether it is the outer plane, the inner plane, or even the main material world wrapped by the crystal wall, there are passages to pass. It's just a real problem, how to find the channel, how to open it and safely cross the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all materials. There is only one sentence that causes Siegel's interest: the gate city puts an end to all the divine power, the priesthood, and the fire of God. Although it has been weakened, the priest who uses divine power can still cast spells. But the electors, servants, and servants of the saints, gods, and gods can never enter the gate city. It is said that all attempts are terminated before they are completed, so the depraved power cannot be measured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously not normal. As the center of the outer domain. Every wizard who can summon angels and demons knows almost every door, and Siegel is no exception. He opened the door to the outside world and once dumped various products of Heim's collar to the merchants in the gate city. This method is not uncommon in the Masters Association or the Masters Association. There is no reason why the Magic Tower is not recorded here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspects that this layer has also been tampered with, and Lehr left a mantra similar to the one in the lamp god. Siegel thought of the black Ironstone, through which it was easy to find the spell of the gate of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, his suspicions were confirmed. Since the third world map has been modified, Siegel will no longer stay. He found the upward steps and showed off the barrier after showing the tattoo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth layer, where the lamp god took the black Ain stone, is the warehouse of magic items. There is only one copy of everything, but there is one for everything. A lamp god with six arms waited here. He started casting spells when he saw Siegel, and the devastating lightning jumped between his palms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was shocked and rushed to make a defensive move. The lightning that is shot from the fourth layer is actually the embodiment of the legendary spell. It is a regular force. The ordinary elemental defense spell can only prevent the shape of the destroyed lightning, and it can not really block. In a hurry, he couldn't use the "protective" seeds to build a barrier, so he chose to run away and go back to the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not stepped onto the steps, and everything is over. The six-armed lamp god hangs all the arms, and the power to destroy the lightning disappears. When Siegel saw his footsteps, he walked away in the room tentatively, and the lamp god did not mean to attack again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Work for you at any time, Master. What magic items do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Why did you use the power of lightning to try to attack me?” Siegel thought it would be better to ask this first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The follower lamp god stole the stone of the sage from this layer, so it should be destroyed. But you have the right to pass this layer, you can be here If you get magic items, the Stone of the Sage is no problem for you. Although there are contradictions in the order, the end result is acceptable, I lost the reason to attack you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Show me the material of the Sage Stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different sage stones in different worlds, but absolutely Most of them fail to reflect the meaning of the sage. The Stone of the Sage created by the gods of magic, knowledge, and prophecy is an artifact-level thing. It has a very simple function. It is a library that directly communicates knowledge and priesthood, and looks directly at the true essence without any influence or interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps in the minds of the magic gods, only the ability to shield the nature of the imaginary pass is qualified to become a sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp god is worried that the entire country of God has been tampered with, so he will go to the stone of the sage. It is itself an artifact, and its state is very solid, unless it has the same strength as the manufacturer to modify the artifact. However, the characteristics of the Sage Stone determine that it is more difficult to modify than the general artifact, and the magic god can only do this if he surpasses himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be better to ruin the Stone of the Sage directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can things get outside?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High artifacts are limited by world rules and can only be used here, no matter how you can't leave them. Second-class artifacts require 10,000 points, you can get exactly the same Replica. Other items need to be exchanged for points according to their different values.” Six-armed god looked at Siegel and frowned and said: “The practice of the servant lamp god caused contradictions, but he is still a magic school. Part of it. Since it was handed over to you by hand, you can have the Stone of the Sage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the best news of the day. Siegel wants to get a sergeant's staff from here, and then wear a sergeant's robes. However, only two items were made in the hand, and they could not be worn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this layer is to let the Master learn the manufacture of magic items, so all kinds of recipes and techniques are clearly displayed in front of them, but they cannot be used directly. . The staff and the robe are good, but the points needed are too high. Siegel is a "negative" and can't afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
