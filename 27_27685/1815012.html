			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the fruit of the final victory is not available in front of you, is it difficult?" Siegel said to Chanem: "Don’t worry, The power to destroy lightning cannot last forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Chanem panted and swayed his two broken arms, looking very Poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the magical fire of God has only one purpose, it is to create a new magical god. It wants to be inherited, and he will find a way." Sit down, about two meters away from Chanem, and play with a dagger. "There is another point. I don't think this is all of Leer's backhand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney's eyebrows picked, but finally did not ask. Siegel has helped him to the top, let him try first, and save him from the destruction of lightning. The next step is at the very least. As a saint of the gods, he also has his own pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;趁This opportunity, Siegel summoned the lamp god and asked him about this situation. Since it has returned to the source, the lamp god can answer the question according to the original design, and will not hide any facts. In fact, Siegel has only one problem, that is, how to securely obtain the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Related knowledge can be passed to you, but not all at once, but at the time you study. The faster you learn, the more points you have. Your advantage will be greater. The consumption of points is constantly accumulating until one second and one thousand points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The points earned from everyone are also retained No use, Siegel simply used it. "Be careful, if Lear still has a backhand, it should be there now. Everything depends on you." When he finished, he closed his eyes and entered meditation, trying to make himself learn more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! What do you mean, I don’t even have a hand!" Chanem snorted: "You really don't take me as an outsider, I But the Holy One of the murder god, the king of the Assassin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel outside the creatures, did not pay attention to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is right, when someone starts to learn the knowledge of God, Lear should appear, to rob the fire before someone succeeds, to restore the magic god Identity. Although Xunzi is very important, learning more knowledge is also to be a better god, not a lifetime of being trapped in the body of a mortal. When someone triggers this last resort, it means that he is very close to success. Lear loses all the retreats. He only restores the identity of the gods and avoids greater losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a place where there is sometimes a retrospective, it is impossible to believe that death exists, not to mention that the saints themselves can continue to be born again. Lear's body is not a saint, but his structure is designed to be a saint, so Siegel has reason to believe that there is a back hand in the magic tower, and Lier can be restored to the status of the saint at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy One cannot study the scorpion, which is the iron law that the gods maintain together. But if Lear is willing to restore the magical god, he will become a saint at the crucial moment. So Siegel chose to eliminate Lear's memory and not let him reborn with the knowledge of this life. What would it be like? Although Siegel is very curious, all his energy is used to learn the knowledge provided by the Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl’s body disappeared with the wind, then the Goblin Lear, the human Lear and the Elle Lear. This abnormality caused Chanem's attention, and he didn't need to remind him that Siegel knew that something would happen. Although it may consume more power, it is more important to have arms than disability at this time. He resisted the pain, made his own hands, and then stood up to the event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two obsidian daggers floated in front of him, and Chanem took a wry smile. "I have never been trusted like this. Siegel, I know that you are not a fool, so I really want to know, how big is your heart?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The stairs that radiated the light of the light came to the footsteps, and a body-building dragon man came up. The two wings behind it are gold and red. The black scales obscure the vital parts of the body. Later, the black long tail extends. The knees are bent backwards like a dragon, covered by blue and green scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is more than two meters tall, and it looks like a violent warrior, not a caster. The devil's deterrent is emitted from the almond-yellow pupil, and the fearful Longwei is involuntarily exuded. “Is it you want to be a fire?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is Leer? Lear?" The dragon squinted and looked at Siegel, who was meditating. He knew that the guy sitting on the ground was stealing the secret of being a god. Except for the protective spell on his body, the man could not guard against it. The magic god has imagined that those who can go to the last step should have opened all the burdens, including possible allies. He should be alone, brave, with a hint of recklessness and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one should stand in front of him to stop himself. "You are his guardian?" The dragons fanned their wings, and the wind was tumultuous, rolling up dust and gravel. "Let's leave, I will reward you with some of the fires and make you a true God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is indeed my purpose," said Shanem. "But I chose to believe him, not you, Lear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not Lear, but the name sounds good." Dragon said: "If you die, at least you know who killed you, little assassin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longren Lear pretended to charge forward, but cast any door Prepare to raid the crystal of fire. As long as it can restore the identity of the gods, everything else can be solved in a logical way. Chanem is not an idiot. As a god of murder, he is also familiar with arranging tactics and manipulating the situation. He changed into the shadow of the big group in the first time, and rolled up Siegel to the direction of the crystal. When the dragon Lear appeared in the sky above the sky, the two obsidian daggers had already waited early, and the open shadow enchantment also blocked his way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon screamed and applied a large split to the body, with the intention of destroying all protective spells and magic items. I have to say that the current Lear is the strongest, and it is completely the state when it has just retreated from the position of God. As a saint of the magical god, in addition to the legendary spell, all the spells are hand-in-hand, and it is very unfavorable to fight with him with magic. Fortunately, Chanem did not even think about the spell showdown. He took advantage of the sharp and sealed ability of the Obsidian Dagger, and began to fight with the Dragon Lire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no memory afterwards, the battle between Lear and Chanem is equivalent to re-emergence, and this time Channam has experience. The last battle lasted for half a day, and Chanem was confident that he could hold on for such a long time. But he soon found out that it was wrong. Dragon's spell is more violent, and in just a few minutes he has consumed the Holy Spirit needed to resurrect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Saint, you have too few rules, too weak. You will be killed by me within an hour, or earlier. Losing resilience in time. And the person you are trying to protect, he needs at least three hours to learn the key things, and that depends on his points enough." Lear said while playing: "You guys Destined to fail, instead of nothing, it is better to surrender and save my efforts. How do I divide you into a fire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three grids, I need enough Power forms the realm of the kingdom of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon spurted out the flame and speeded up the offensive, but Chanem stood up. Lear glanced at the split of the fire, and then nodded: "Three grids are OK, I have enough surplus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prophecy Also," said Shanem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think! The priesthood can't give you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least the saint-level The power of prophecy, can this be done?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two confronted each other for a few rounds, and Lear finally nodded and said, “Yes, I promise you this request. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney is a sigh of relief, a satisfying expression of satisfaction. He took a little effort, and Lear also retraced back half a step. At this moment, Chanem suddenly slammed and waved the obsidian scorpion to the dragon's neck. Lear hurriedly hid, but still paid the price of the wings, fell from the sky, and fell heavily on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You! You damn untrustworthy bastard!" he snarled, and used any door to escape the pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem did not dare to leave Siegel too far, he stopped after two steps. I only heard him exclaimed with excitement: "Good! Finally I lied to the individual, cool! The feeling of harmless people is too bad! Kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lear snorted, then smiled three times and then became a big laugh. "I am really awkward for you, but I am bothering you. What are you, lover?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
