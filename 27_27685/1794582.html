A dragon that ran to the human territory threatened a mage for no reason at all. Security, no matter from which point of view, we have the power to capture or kill it." This is the opinion from the federation. Siegel thinks this is very interesting: after the magic ship lifted off, they seemed to be eager to try the power of the ship. "Siegel sergeant, if you agree, please post a mission to the federation, we will capture this beast for you. The magic boat can also conduct air patrols to help defend the airspace of Heim."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you going to respond to us?" Wywood didn't seem to be conscious of the Confed Master. After sending the letter, he sat in the Siegel study. "In my opinion, the construction of the magic ship made some wizards have a feverish mind, lost calm thinking, and some overestimated their own strength. Although this letter is a combination of the views of the federation, please believe that if not for observation Which mages are more prone to radicalism and short-sightedness, this letter will not pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are factions everywhere, even in the thriving Mage Federation. Although William is a teacher all year round and claims that he does not care about the day-to-day affairs of the Federation, Siegel is still the only resident sergeant, but the Federation is slowly evolving into two factions. Some people hope to maintain the status quo, under the leadership of the Siegel sergeant, continue to study the follow-up development of the Miereng nuclear and train apprentices. Others want to leave the Heim collar with a magic ship, at least to a neutral location, so that the world does not think that the federation has become a private property of Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not wrong, but the former is more in line with the interests of Siegel. I believe that if it is not because the Three Peaks Tower cannot move, the Federation will also have such a situation in Deepwater City. Siegel did not expect to be able to tie the federation to Heim's collar for the rest of his life. It only took ten years for the federation to do its best to train a group of wizards for Heim, so that the college can continue to operate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He foresaw that a new era is coming, it is a world dominated by magical craftsmen, and alchemy, magic forging and advanced pharmacy will replace blacksmiths and bowsmiths to become combat power. The core of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel wants to ensure that the research and development direction of the federation is consistent with his ideas during this decade. This is a win-win situation for the Federation and Heim. Only some people focus on the biggest gains. Obviously both sides can get eight points of benefit, and they like this person more like their own, the other side of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you see who is it?" Siegel shook his head and said helplessly: "There are more than four months. Dwarf's meeting It will be held, and the news of the Goblin World will be known all over the world. Although it is now an open secret at the top of each organization, whoever knows more, whoever takes the lead. What is the current magic boat out? The meaning, in addition to the glory of the martial arts? And to patrol the sky over Heim. This is how the idea came up, it is ridiculous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand, this The situation will soon be curbed. In order for the federation to better re-establish the image in front of the world, it must now be united.” Verwood touched the wrinkles in his eyes, the time of connivance has passed, and the young mage should be allowed. They are either warned or suppressed. Academic debate does not mean that management is loose, especially during this critical period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel picked up the quill and began to write back. The content is very simple. First of all, I would like to thank the Federation for always paying attention to what happened to Heim. Then, very politely declined the proposal to catch the dragon and the magic boat patrol. He also asked about the derivation of the explosive formula, and the alchemists could find a lot of ways to cheaply produce it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wywood received the reply and first looked at it himself. “The formula is almost the same. The distance is completely copied and there are only ten days left. But the production cost is still a big problem. The method of the alchemy laboratory is three times more expensive than the blasting stone. No one can equip. I can't afford it." He smiled later: "But this is a good way to keep them busy. If people are busy, they won't have much extra thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so." Siegel stood up. This is the meaning of the passenger, and Wywood folded the letter and put it in the space bag. He said before leaving: "Siegel sergeant, are you no longer considering it? It is not the best choice for Williams to represent the Federation at the Dwarf Conference."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the long run, after all, the Federation and Heim can’t be integrated into one. That would either lead to the union’s split again, or it would make the Heim’s leader become the Deepwater City Masked Parliament. The situation. I can't guarantee that my descendants are all **, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hah, you are very polite. If you continue to talk about it, I will mistake you as my housekeeper." Siegel waved his hand and said: "I still think about the goblin first, they are more attractive to me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha. This joke..." Wywood shook his head with a smile and left his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contest was held. This time, there was no green dragon coming out of trouble, and the Griffin family quickly left the Heim collar. It is said that they all the way. East, take the boat back to the old mainland. As for their relationship with the Green Dragon, it is early or temporary coercion, and everyone has different opinions. Siegel has his own point of view: the green dragon is just an errand in the whole thing. When it leaves Heim’s collar, it is obvious that there is a task. Who is going to command it after the Green Dragon, and what kind of plan is there, this is the issue that the Master cares about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question can't be answered by anyone except the prophet master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every time there is a William sergeant who can send a message in advance, so no master of the prophecy will keep the federation at a disadvantage. It is predicted that the spell will never smile at Siegel, and he finds that he has nothing to do in this regard. Only by getting enough intelligence and preparing for it, the Master can exert the strongest strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only Siegel, Heim’s collar also needs to be prepared, and the warriors who show clever minds or excellent shooting ability at the contest are all Sieg. The focus of recruitment is targeted. Heim has a superior weapon such as the plasma crossfire, so the soldiers under Siegel pay more attention to the long-range attack ability. For the general lord, the knight's armor, weapons and mounts do not need to pay for him. Only the consumption of arrows and squats requires him to pay for his pockets, so the long-range strike is to throw gold coins on the battlefield. The cost of maintenance and service life of the bow is far less than that of metal weapons, so only a few wealthy lords will be equipped and stocked in large quantities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sooner or later, the muskets on the goblin will be transmitted to the world, affecting the history." Siegel is fully focused on the production progress of the explosive formula, this is The biggest obstacle to the promotion of firearms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golem Force also needs to change its strategy, and the powerful and powerful melee attacking Golem will be eliminated sooner or later. In front of the firearm, the bigger the volume, the easier it is to be hit. Even if the dwarf's excellent armor can't stop the musket, what reason can the magic image perform better? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Golem must be developed to be light and small. If it is the same size as a cat, it is the most ideal situation. In the face of weapons that are strong and weak, hidden and first-hand shooting ability is particularly important, and mobility is the second thing to consider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for what weapons to equip, Siegel has not thought about it. The strongest weapon in his hand is of course an electromagnetic gun. Once it is equipped on the magic image, it will soon attract the attention of others. It is a sure thing to be cracked. The goblin musket is the first choice, but it needs to wait for the formula of gunpowder. At present, it seems that either the remote attack method of Elemental Golem is used, or the crosshairs are still used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and decided to solve the miniaturization and mobility of the Golem first. The weapon selection can be put aside. In the production of the Golem, the level of the Masters Association is much higher than that of the Federation, and many books can be found from the Association. In the end, I finally couldn't get through this. The two divisions of the Federation had to meet with the Masters of the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one who will send a meeting to the dwarf. The news is strictly confidential and there is almost no possibility of being inquired. Although it is delayed, the meeting of the two mage organizations is inevitable. William has made it clear that he is not willing to mix this matter, so Siegel, despite his reluctance, can only match the missing spell spells and can only slap on the scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the federation has a board of directors, and the mages with voting rights come together to decide the policy. Even Siegel can't decide what the federation is doing, which is very different from what the Big Three can decide on everything. There is less influence, but Siegel can be no worse than setting a guideline and bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors tried to pass the bill of "the faculty who had been sent to the conference to handle the liaison with the association", but was sir by Siegel The identity was rejected by one vote. In the face of his proud smile, the heads of the factions had to face the fact that they had to come up with a practical plan, even if they needed to face a wizard association with a large prophet and thus lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of the arena is ringing again, and the afternoon game seems to be starting. Siegel stood up and decided to go on the stage of the battlefield to continue his thinking. He gradually adapted to stay focused on the noisy environment, while also paying attention to the situation in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
