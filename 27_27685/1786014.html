			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finalized Charter of the Federation removes the preamble and conclusion, a total of 19 chapters and 111 articles. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM's words have been carefully pondered and carefully adjusted, especially the curse Master Wywood has made a lot of changes to the content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to his words, even the devil who is good at calculation can't find loopholes in this charter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although other mages think he is somewhat exaggerated, his professional ability is generally recognized and recognized as a curse summoner who is proficient in allegiance. So the Charter is finalized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the 30th Union Masters at Heim, 20 members of the Federation who lived in the New World received news and made a special trip. They saw the secret nuclear and learned what happened on the day of the meeting through friends. Many people decided to end their wandering and stay together in Heim to build a new Mage Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So at the end of the day, a total of more than 50 mages signed the charter, and the new federation was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wywood hopes that Siegel can be the chief of the curse system, he said: "With a few spells such as the secret nuclear, you are qualified enough. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has his own plans. He couldn't be too distracted by the affairs of the federation, and he couldn't be caught by the tens of thousands of things that began to rebuild. He chose a very clever way to refuse: "Because the secret can be nuclear, I am already in the Security Council, there is no need to occupy a chief quota. Is it better to have a cursor with one more seat?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short mage Wiewood smiled and pointed to Siegel, and then took office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone unanimously decided not to build a Master Tower, but to build a magic school. Since Idis built the spell test site and the library early, it saved a lot of work. Siegel gave the Federation the camp area when the original elves attacked the city, including the area 30 meters underground and 100 meters in the air. Everyone laughed and said that Siegel was a careful and tricky mage, but when the lord reached out and asked the Federation for money. Everyone smiled and dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first thing to solve is the literacy problem." Wendy now has many reasons to look for Siegel, she is not tired. “There are too few children who are literate in Heim. How many qualified students can you provide as a lord?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel asks the Master from the perspective of the lord "We can liberate the labor of working in many fields. How many students will be there. You may find it difficult to find a noble child from me, but there are many lords in the South. Their children should be educated."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wendy's hands on the table, looking up at Siegel, only two seconds of confrontation will be defeated. "I don't want to make your territory benefit first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m telling the truth, not kidding you." Siegel said: Now that everyone has an almost unlimited supply of elements, just like the free mana pool, there are many things to do. Just take the lamp god, how many people can a lamp god replace?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have a curse like mentally retarded surgery?" Wendy said: "Do you use the lamp god to do farm work or use the lamp god to strike iron? Even if the secret can reduce the magic items. Is it not so wasteful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then tell me. A lamp god who does repeated work is more important, or a chance to make innovation. The mind is more important?” Siegel asked with his hands crossed his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said it makes sense, but I always feel that you have another picture." Wendy looked at the serious Siegel, but his heart was a little confused. So, by the opportunity of Evan Fred, he quickly said: "I will try according to your ideas, and will tell you when new discoveries are made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The female mage hurried away, leaving only a long-lasting fragrance. The butler, Alfred, is always straight, and the tall figure wanders around the castle. He held a few letters in his hand, a white envelope and a dark red seal. It is the endless enthusiasm and greetings between the lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler put the letter down and said: "The Lord Lord, Miss Wendy is very beautiful. But it is not the best candidate for the hostess."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But then, Little Isaac has only one person and will be very lonely." Alfred said: "He needs someone to accompany him, just like his father."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may bring life to your next life, so think about it." Siegel continued to transcribe the magic spell, and did not even lift his head. But Alfred clearly felt dangerous. Just like an invisible steel knife hanging in front of the throat, his sweat seems to feel the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isac likes Miss Capricorn. She can be regarded as the closest person to the young master." Alfred said: "Capricorn Miss Silke is not only beautiful, but also very good. Very easy-going, never a lot of things. And from a physical point of view, she should still be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Geer couldn't help it anymore, and he laughed out. He waved his hand and interrupted the housekeeper's words. "Don't make a random suggestion, Alfred, thank you for your concern, but you still don't mess with it. You know, whether it's Wendy or Capricorn, you can easily burn you to fly ash. Even You have escaped from their hands, and when Janet returns, you can't help but suffer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfred is very clear that there are things to say, some It is a taboo for Siegel. "I believe that after Mrs. Janet's return, she will understand my choice: it is a normal and common phenomenon for a Piaget lord to have two or three lovers in the starry kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel put down the pen and said: "You remind me of a sailor on the Sos. His theory is similar to yours. Alfred, I need to pay attention to a lot of things now, women are not ranked Forefront, unless you give me information about Janet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no news for this, the same is true for the black assassin. The reward for the investigation has been hung up. I have been out for a few months, and there has been no gain so far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Improve the reward," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There has been a reward of two thousand gold coins. If it is raised again, it will scare away many adventurers."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also make sense." The Master agreed: "Let Jennifer pick up the heads of the Chamber of Commerce and ask the news together. If there is an organization like a bounty killer, I need the first I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, I will do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Nodded, pick up the quill and continue to copy the spell. After the joint signature on the Charter of the Federation. The synagogues of the Federation communicated with Siegel in a more intimate manner, such as sharing spellbooks. He is translating a spell called "Advanced Creation" on his magic book, which is said to be able to make rare metals such as steel, precious stones, gold and silver, crystal stones and even fine gold and Mithril in a short time. But the value of the creation is higher. The shorter the duration of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is interested in this spell because he has a way to "cheat" the duration of the spell. There are also means to continuously provide elemental energy. In his vision, this spell, through improvement, should provide material for magic experiments. These materials can't leave the scope of the spell, not real material, but can save a lot of trial costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He copied it for a while and then looked up and found that Alfred did not leave, still standing in front of him, could not help but curiously asked: "You still have "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard some rumors. Because there is no real evidence, I don't know if I should say it." Aide's face appeared a distressed look. The eyes flashed, and it seems to be hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been standing for so long, or talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK! Aide cleared his throat: "There is a rumor in the territory that you are ready to train the Master class to replace the Cavaliers' status in Heim. There may be a second, third Master Lord, as you are now. This is true. Is this true?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Replace the knights?” Siegel shook his head: “It’s never power, but the power of the territory. Loyalty. I will not replace the knights who swear allegiance to me. I understand their fears, but if someone spreads rumors or loses confidence and loyalty to me, I will not move."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
