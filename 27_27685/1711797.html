			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't combine with Janet," Sir Bill said to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sir, why?" Siegel asked in a panic. After bringing Janet back to the camp, Sir Bill allowed Jeff Gold to keep the tent, just like the morning guards who guarded the prince's camp, and no one was allowed to enter or leave. Then Sir Bill took his shackles and came to the edge of the camp. No one was bothering here, and no one would eavesdrop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like Janet, she is the same to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you It’s just a young passion, not love, but I won’t use this reason to convince you.” Sir Bill shook his head and looked sincere. "She is a demon, this is the most fundamental reason. I will not know whether she is a noble lady or a beggar, I may care if she is a virgin before I know you, but I will not teach you to distinguish between love and The line of passion, these are the details. The only reason I stop you from being together is her lineage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood? Sir, I am not a The aristocratic origin is nothing but a wild child without a father or a mother. My hair is black, my eyes are black, no one is like this. Maybe only God knows what my bloodline is, is it still a Normal. Janet is a demon, yes, she told me this, but I am still willing to accept her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, little nephew, you You can hold her, you can hold her every day if you like, but you can't combine, you can't have children. Do you know why? You and the descendants of the demon are only devils! Listen, Siegel, I am a baron, I have a castle But I don't have children, I won't have them in the future - I have tried countless times. You are my child, Siegel-Bill, or you can call yourself Siegel-Squid-Bill, it doesn't matter. You will inherit me. The name and title, then passed to your child: a lovely child born to you by a suitable woman. This child should not be a demon, nor should there be a demon brother or sister. The lineage is too dangerous, and it can be transformed into evil at any time. Liars, killers, robbers, and then hanged, this is the end of the demon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Janet will not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be so confident, little nephew, how do you feel the same when I was young?!" Sir Bill Long Sighing, his face is a look that hates iron and not steel: "I believe in fairness and freedom, the glory on the battlefield is the greatest pursuit. Killing the enemy, saving the weak, turning the tide, being respected, how I believe This, until..." Jazz sighed Tooth, then said: "Until I killed the twelve orcs alone, saved the Elf friendly, and was sentenced to defy the military order, can no longer become a real knight. After that I will understand that there are only two things in the world. Important, land and descent. Martial arts, justice, kindness, and fairness are all for these two things. Children, you like Janet, OK, no problem. But you can't marry a demon, nor can you give birth to a demon child. You can't let the demons pollute the blood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is very sad, not for himself and Janet, but for Sir Bill. In his opinion, Sir Bill is a tough black mountain, standing on the vast land, the wind and the rain do not move. But Siegel is not, he is the sea. He was born in the sea, growing up in the sea, and the sea is all-inclusive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes a mountain is excluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, jazz, I love you very much, but I will not be Sir Siegel-Bill, I will always be a Siegel-Squid. Please You look for other heirs, so there is no risk of the blood of the demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill raised his hand high, but did not take it down, Instead, he kicked a kick at Siegel's ass. "Roll, I don't know how to make a good scorpion. Go get some wine for me, I am sad, I want to drink!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not go to get the wine, Bill The Jazz did not call him for this matter. He sat alone on the edge of the camp and quietly watched the snowy sky staring. He wants to calm down, just a little impulsive, it is not good for a wizard. But if there is anything wrong with him, he can’t say it. Siegel feels that he is helpless, and he has felt this way since the old captain died. Sometimes he will forget this, and sometimes he will regain his mind inadvertently. He knows that he is the only one in the world, a black-haired, dark-eyed lone star. "You are unique." The savvy person said that he is a madman; "my perfect bloodline", blood magic is shouting like this. He is wrong; "You can't let the demons pollute the blood." Sir Bill's words made him sad. If you let him know that there is a good show of blood transfusion in a tent not far from here, it is estimated that he will not be surprised again. The lineage seems to be the eternal theme of the New World and the Old World. Except for humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, and even dragons, this theme cannot be escaped. But the bloodline can be deceived. Siegel really wants to shout loudly. I will make a spell that falsifies all bloodlines. What can you prejudice like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What color will you dye? A voice asked him. Siegel heard that it was his own voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black will also be dyed? He asked in reverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black can contain all colors, but you can't. You are just a snowflake and can't fight the whole world. That voice said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can fly all the time and look down on the world. I am the eternal shadow of the brocade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? The voice finally asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic." Siegel said it. He felt that the power of magic in his blood was boiling, and an irrepressible impulse awakened from the depths of his soul. All the elements around the body are laughing and dancing cheerfully, celebrating the most important moment in the Master's life - magical awakening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has nothing to do with the blood, it is a recognition of the soul level. Siegel knew that this moment was very important and he was ready. He took out the dagger and pierced the index finger of his left hand. The wound was very shallow, with only a hint of blood, but as Siegel kept chanting, a very thick blood squeezed out of the wound. Before it dripped, it solidified and became an elliptical hard solid. Instead of trying out the wand, Siegel was very careful to prepare the casting materials, pure water, sand, gunpowder, iron and dried meat. Siegel placed the coagulated blood drop in the middle of these materials, and then used his mind to recite the spell and carefully manipulate the magic energy around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage can have his own magical pet, some say it is creation, some say it is a summon, but Siegel now thinks it is an identity, it is magic Energy recognition of the user. As the spell continues to strengthen, the materials that represent the four elements of the water and fire are combined at the physical level, transforming into new creatures with the blood of the caster as the core. This creature is born with the soul of the Master, can bring him a variety of spelling convenience, is an absolute loyal companion. Each wizard has its own magical pet, but not every wizard can gain magical power when the magic awakens. Awakening is very sudden. Some wizards can really embrace magic when they are old and weak, get a chance to wake up, and even some mages have not awakened in their lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is finished, a black raven stands in front of Siegel, with a lot of smart eyes. Siegel reached out and the Raven stopped in his palm, then spread his wings and twisted his body to let Siegel see clearly. Ravens are bigger and smarter than the common crows, and their tails are diamond-shaped—the crows are fan-shaped, so they are well distinguished. Serge's raven is more distinctive: although the raven is black, its feathers have a blue-violet metallic luster, and the feathers on the chin will stand up when it is screaming, which is very majestic. Its claws are very powerful, and curly nails are more like dragons than birds. Under the layers of feathers, Siegel also touched the rough scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strangest thing is the Raven’s cockroach, black and bright, with a reddish pattern on the edge. The raven gently bites Siegel's finger and let the owner know how powerful it is. Siegel came to the dining hall with his magic pet and found a walnut from the storage box. The raven screamed twice, crushing the walnuts with his claws, and foraging with sharp and strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will call you Barron in the future, may you fly in the sky forever." Siegel touched the Raven's supple feathers and let it fly into the sky. "Do my eyes look down on the land and keep the blacks pure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven Baron screams cheerfully, flapping his wings, by the wind Gliding in the air. Through his eyes, Siegel overlooks the walled mountains in a soaring state, and everything looks so small. The tower ruins of the fortress became short and small, and the passage of the dragon was turned into a thin line between the mountains. He saw Dr. Reese coming out of the tent under His Royal Highness, and Count Todd hugged him and hurried into the tent. He saw three people left the camp and headed down the hill, even if the snow on the road did not slow them down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the clouds, the leaps and snows, the raven flies higher and higher, but it does not work at all, as if the sky is his territory. To the south, the Jackdaw tribe on the prairie is moving, and the giant Kerry has brought out the most abundant land of water plants with men, women and children, and avoided the war. The bird is licking the wound and will one day return to the sky. The army of Deepwater City is like a few long snakes, slowly crossing the vast grasslands. Siegel saw the knight of the fresh clothes and the horses, and saw the flying flags, everyone seemed to have the confidence to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking back to the north, he crossed the walled mountains and saw the other side of the mountain. The orcs are gathering in the mountains, ten times as many as humans. They got weapons from the lava, excitedly hit each other, and the eyes were bloodthirsty. Further north, he saw a shining light, like blue crystal, surrounded by boundless white snow. The light moved slowly and firmly southward, over the frozen lakes and rivers, covering the forests and mountains, and moving towards the walled mountains. Siegel tried to open his eyes, but he still couldn't see what was in the light. He only felt the hot tears rushing out of his eyes and slipping down his cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
