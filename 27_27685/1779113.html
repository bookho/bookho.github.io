			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of Evan, who still didn’t know where he was, and then seeing the signature of His Majesty the King in the title book, Siegel suddenly felt embarrassed. Www*xshuotxt/com He does not have a deep-rooted pursuit of title and power like other lords. It is a good thing to become a count, but not enough to make him grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe magic can make him feel so excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Siegel begins to understand why the last Master of the Master will raise the flag. With the help of magic and rational thinking, the object of allegiance is clearly understood: the king is nothing but an ordinary human being, neither intelligence nor power is enough for the magician to worship. If the king has no strong personality charm, how can a mage listen to his orders? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like this meeting of the Southern Lords League, it was very rushed. As one of the three great lords, Siegel followed the Master of the City to Gaco Fort, and just took a break to enter the venue. I didn't even say hello to the other two big lords, Brown and Dray, which made Siegel feel that the whole meeting was just a cut. He collected the certificate of the title and leaned back on the chair, looking at the several school counselors standing in the room. I don't know which idiot came up with this idea? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The adults, the elves are now dispersed, it is a good time to break through, but this opportunity is fleeting." The old lord of Caso City Viscount Hult, his wrinkles are so deep that he can't even get his hair out. Everyone was quieted out of respect for his age and listened carefully. "Thank you for the recent victory of the squid squid lord, the elves began to re-recognize the power of the southern men, and they became scattered and concentrated. The elves in my territory are preparing to move the camp, don't know what other people are doing?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he said this, everyone realized that this is a common problem. If the elves are a soldier, the situation on each of the homes can be improved. But it is difficult to defeat the elves. Where do these elves gather power to attack? Whoever is the three lords is possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, now every lord should take the initiative to attack, and the elves have not yet joined forces. As much as possible to weaken their power." Viscount Uther said harshly: "Now if you don't attack, continue to hide in the castle. Then when the elf attacks the castle, no one will help you!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown also nodded and agreed: "The elves are not doing well now. According to reliable sources, the elf's casters suffered heavy casualties in Deepwater, including the Druid, the Mage, and the Moon Temple. Pastor. Moreover, the Masters Association has restrained the elves of the Old World and has lost the support of the New World elves. It’s harder to say that it’s harder than the longevity. But it’s no problem to have children. Let’s kill the male elves and then guide Let them know how to be the right way to truly rule the territory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence caused a big laugh, even Drey Uther’s mouth was pulled move. Siegel looked at the people in the meeting coldly. Did they form a coalition and they were so laughing before they came to Heim? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at these smiles, Siegel was so upset that he decided to resolve the lengthy meeting as soon as possible. He leaned forward and knocked on the table, waiting for everyone to pay attention to him. Then he said: "Although they are fighting each other, they can't be as arrogant as the bandits. Don't you know what plans are there for Dray adults?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel Masters The concern is that there must always be a coordination between us.” Viscount Uther said: “Everyone has seen it. With the help of the caster, everyone can avoid the elf’s sight and gather it with me. The castle is meeting. Although this situation cannot be carried out as a normal state, it can improve the level of communication between the various lords."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We (Dreusel used Our two words are vague, the small lords do not know which does not include Siegel. They have purchased some crystal balls that can be used for communication. It is easy to use. Just sprinkle with gold powder or pearl powder to the main crystal. Communication. How about Siegel, the main crystal placed in Heim?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head. He does not want to be the leader of the Southern Alliance. This crystal ball is like a red iron soldering iron, who is injured. If you encounter information for help. When I can't reach it, how can I order the rescue of the people next to me? in the end. It was another burst of exchange and exchange of interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason is the crystal ball communication magic itself. Crystal ball communication is developed on the basis of communication spells and is a very convenient means of communication. However, because the communication is very simple, the safety of the crystal ball is not good. In the war, the wizards created a number of spells that can be applied through the crystal ball system to influence the opposite person. Deliver false news, call a spy from a distance, or cast a spell that affects your mind. If you only take one communication ball, if you hold the core ball, you have to worry about this spell penetration all day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown also nodded, so Drey Uther was willing to take this matter down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing is to talk about the difficulties and the benefits. Siegel can only provide four thousand pieces of plasma per month. How do you distribute these? Who can better owe allegiance to the starry kingdom and gain the promotion of the title? Those who have surrendered or lost their masters in battle, how to distribute after the victory, who is responsible for "liberating" them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not say a word, just listened. No one wants a ghost fog swamp, it seems that in their eyes there is still a barren land. Perhaps it is known that the land in the north has been firmly anchored by Heim, so no lord is really stupid to compete with the Master of the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A school counselor walked to Siegel and gave him a mage ceremony, then bent down and whispered: "Mr. Master, De Earl wants to talk to you privately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, is he coming?" Siegel looked at Drey Uther, the latter Head, indicating that this is indeed true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel got up and retired, followed the consultant to the reception room behind the hall. Earl Todd's white shorts and shorts have been carefully modified to be neat and unobtrusive. He wore a comfortable black silk coat and straight breeches tied in the crocodile boots, which was much better than the last time. When the wizard came in, he was reading a thick book by the fire of the fireplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should look at this book, "The biography of Earl Edward of Dawn" is very inspiring." Count Todd put down the book, revealing a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to come to the New World." Siegel said: "Specially for the battle with the elves?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nature is not, at least not completely." Count Todd said. "After the King Aaron was enthroned, some old friends had to see it. The New World has just happened to have a war between the elves and the human race. So the situation in the country is stable, I will come over."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The idea of ​​this Southern Lords League is what you want to come out?" Siegel also walked to the fireplace, put a cushion on the sofa, and found a comfortable posture to sit down. . "I said that Dray and Brown didn't have such a big appeal, and they could make the lords obedient. But if you have a respected veteran aristocrat, you will make everything happen."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""My old bones can still move, naturally I want to sell old faces everywhere." Count Todd said: "I have not seen Heim Collar and Mire City, I don't know yours. What the army looks like, but I saw other southern lords, I am sure they are not your opponents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for compliments."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also a compliment?" Earl Todd snorted and said: "I really praise you for your means. The war has developed to the present, can't I still see? What role do you play in it? Why, do you want to build a territory across the New World?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Correct, it is just a connection between the sea and the walled mountains. It’s not across the New World.” Siegel held his arm, his mouth slightly upturned, and learned the count of Count Todd. The kiss said: "How, can't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As you like, nothing can be done." Count Todd said: "As long as you continue to loyal to the king, loyalty to the stars The royal family, the other things are not important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel converges with a smile, staring at Count Todd, silent for a while before saying: "Ai How is the text? Sir Bill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan is missing. This is not an excuse, we really don't know." Count Todd said: "Prince Aaron has issued a decree. Because Evan has not rebelled against the army, the domestic war is just a struggle between the eager lords, so I forgive Evan's guilt and hope that he can return as the prime minister." Star City, continue to serve the king. The last news we received from Evan was to challenge a master of swordsmanship near Star Lake. After that, he disappeared without a trace in the sight of all our spies."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for Sir Bill, now Viscount's identity and preparation to marry the Countess Ferrara Tomonte on the Autumn Harvest Day. The Countess does not have a biological child, so it is foreseeable that Bill will become the owner of the new Earl."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
