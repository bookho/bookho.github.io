			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Allen stood solemnly in front of the camp, the wind blew his starry cloak, and the snow fell on his golden armor. Behind him was the Count of Todd, and then several nobles with titles - the sword eagle, the riding girl and the fish jumping out of the water - were on either side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood opposite the prince and looked a little nervous. He has never seen the ceremonial ceremonies of the Knights, and the only knowledge is obtained from the essays, mostly exaggerated or romantic. He finished the strap of the breastplate and wiped the dust that did not exist by hand. He saw Janet staring at him in the crowd and smiling at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill as the knight's knight's mentor, leading Siegel to the front. Siegel had to kneel down on one knee and was dragged by the jazz. "Not yet." He said: "Listen to your instructions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very heroic, the starry royal family thank you for your efforts." The prince said : "Would you like to be a royal knight and continue to write your history with honor and heroism?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will be my honor, His Royal Highness Prince." Er answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Prince nodded, pulled out the sword, and put it on the ground with his hand on the hilt. "Your Majesty, Siegel-Squid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel landed on one knee and lowered his head to reveal the back neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel-Squid, born on the sea, walking under the stars, heroic and loyal, humble and upright. In the name of all the gods in the world To the king of the kingdom of the stars, the guardian of the free people, the power given to me by the king of Asta III of the star family, I, Aaron-Star, the successor and guardian of the throne, promoted you as a knight, and gave The baron of the new star, you can pass this title to your eldest son and then to your grandson. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, His Royal Highness "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Prince Aaron took the sword and touched Siegel's shoulders and back neck. His hands were a little trembling, leaving a shallow wound on Siegel's neck, and a few drops of blood leaked out. Sir Bill, who was close by, saw this scene and his brows were wrinkled. Being stabbed by a sword at the canonization ceremony is an ominous sign that symbolizes the blood and disaster between the ministers. Fortunately, other people are far away and have not seen it. The icy blade slipped across the skin, and Siegel's silk did not move, still squatting on the ground. He had thought that he was only a knight of the knight or jazz, and he never thought that he would enter the baron sequence. From now on, he can be regarded as a new aristocrat who is qualified to be the lord if he can get a seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get up, Baron Siegel." His Royal Highness put the sword back on the ground and reached out to raise Siegel. "What do you think about the title and territory in the future, you can report directly to the royal family. There is a noble office in Sham Shui Po, they will serve you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Count of Todd took a step forward and went on to say: "The Baron Siegel, you need to identify your badge and ring as soon as possible, I will give you a notarization and file, so that you have completed the entire process." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are some necessary procedures." His Royal Highness said with a smile. "Go busy, there will be a banquet in the evening to celebrate this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Prince Aaron turned and walked back to the camp, and quickly untied the cloak. The neckline, poured a glass of wine and drank. The bright red liquid slipped from the mouth into the abdomen, making him feel much better. I just need to replenish energy to fight this damn cold weather and not get drunk. As he thought about this, he poured another cup of himself, poured it into the warm fur cushion of the chair, and sipped it in a small mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My badge wants to use the squid's logo." Siegel pulled out a piece of paper with a clear black tentacle squid in ink. In the process of learning the magic array, all the wizards will gradually become good painters, especially for the grasp of lines and composition, more precise and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Too many tentacles, it can be placed on the flag, it is too difficult to make a ring." Earl squinted and carefully looked at the picture. "I suggest that when you make a banner, add some stars to the squid, so that you can show that you belong to the King of the Star King Knight; then add a shield to represent the guardian knight, to defend the royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The count looked straight at Siegel's eyes and touched his mustache. He smiled and said: "Although your baron title can only be passed down for three generations, you are still very young and have a lot of room for growth. As long as you continue to work for the royal family, it is possible to make a higher rank or a permanent hereditary. The New World is full of opportunities everywhere, and it is a good time to make meritorious deeds. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded: "Okay, Earl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think of the half-orcs in the Walls?" Suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think they are very poor." Siegel answered without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor? The peasant who did not receive the harvest in the event of a natural disaster was called poor, and the guy who did not go to the land was called to be self-sufficient." The count screamed and called to follow. Let him go to the baggage and find a file wrapped in a blue sleeve. The thin followers took the short legs and quickly found the documents and handed them to the count. However, Count Todd raised his hand and asked the entourage to hand the document directly to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the command of the kingdom of the stars, calling the half-orcs as lifelong militia, and allowing them to enter the human territory of the lord of the stars, living with civilians. Every militia You can bring four of his half-orc family to the town. This will take too long, the body of the prince's body needs healing, and can't continue to delay in the harsh places of the city wall. Can you accomplish this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl, I am very happy to share the worry for the royal family, but I have no territory and cannot arrange the life of a half-orc."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd nodded, spread a piece of paper and wrote on it with a white quill: "Jazz is good, you are a compassionate person. I will give you a Command, allowing your half-human beast to gain 40% of the spoils for the battle between the royal family and the human being, as a daily life. Baron Siegel, as long as you bring the half-human beast, then the local lords, especially Southern pioneers Will be very happy to shelter these Orcs, you say you "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"? I think it should be so, "Siegel only nodded down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd wrote the instrument, stamped his own ring and seal, and later used the private seal of His Royal Highness Prince as a circumstantial evidence. He asked Siegel to collect the two documents. If you don't understand, you can ask Baron Bill. "You should talk more and continue to maintain a good relationship." Earl Todd taught him: "The nobles must support each other, especially the new nobility, and they should watch each other. You can develop in the New World as well as return to the stars. Kingdom. You two young are not big, martial arts is good, and they are very good. You may soon have a territory through marriage, and you will improve your position. How do you need me to introduce it to you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Siegel never considered the issue of marriage, in fact, mainly because he was completely unable to adapt to the change of status. Baron, and the Baroness? Siegel thought about these two titles and suddenly felt that everything was unreal. Earl Todd still looked at him and waited for his answer, so Siegel rushed to deal with it: "Sir Bill is my mentor. He is not married yet. I don't think about it now. Thanks to the Earl for concern." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also." The count did not say anything more: "I will remember this thing, you should first do the coat of arms and the ring."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be completed immediately." Siegel is not an ordinary knight, he is still a mage. The familiarity of the finger holding the black wand dispels the strangeness brought by the title of "Baron". The excitement of magical energy flowing through the blood vessels is more real than that of the canon. Under his spell, the squid pattern on the paper seems to be alive, the ink flowing in the background, forming a shield with a rounded tip; the head of the squid becomes bigger than the original, leaving space for three Six-pointed star, counted as a tribute to the starry royal family. Then Siegel took out five silver coins, placed them in a scorpion and melted them with a magical flame, and then used a shaping spell to make them into a ring. With the subtle changes in the spell, Siegel can precisely control the shape of the ring. Count Todd said yes, the twenty tentacles of the squid are indeed difficult to reflect on the ring, so Siegel only painted nine legs. This kind of means makes the count also amazing. "My consultant has never had such a spell. He can only fix the broken mirror, nothing more." The count said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the flag and the ring were registered, and the count of Todd wrote the reason and process of the seal, and used the seal to prove it. This document also requires the prince to print with His Royal Highness and witnessed by several Jazz present. However, these trivial things do not require the count to personally go out, he called to follow, let him go errands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
