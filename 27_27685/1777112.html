			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc’s action to cross the Walled Mountain Range was blocked and it was too late to reach Deepwater City. The newsletter from Casper's division was also interrupted by the obstruction of the Elf ruling. The death knight did not know the battle ahead and could only continually mobilize the orc's army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the width of the channel is not large, it is impossible to invest too much force at a time, so the orcs have a number of advantages but they cannot play. As the name suggests, Black Blood Castle became the meat grinder in the walled mountains, and the blood of the orcs was all squeezed out and turned into a black mark left on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the number of orc deaths continues to increase, it brings new problems to the death knight. The power of the grievances will be weakened after being possessed and causing death. Now, although the black channel is formed, this feature is still there. The blood above the channel melts the ice, and the soul of the orc warrior satisfies the needs of the grievances. The only passage that can cross the walls of the city is gradually disappearing, and the chances of the orcs are becoming less and less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they have more than 100,000 troops gathered in the northern part of the Walled Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Blood Castle also began to feel the pressure, mainly from the logistics. With the consumption of arrows, shots and various long-range weapons, the defense is getting more and more difficult. Fortunately, Siegel never thought about defending, and did not force to destroy all the orcs. Therefore, Mana issued an order requesting the soldiers on the wall to improve the hit rate and not allow the arrows to be fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravans that came from Heim finally arrived, and they brought in weapons and ammunition purchased from the castle along the way. Many lords also sent knights and archers, hoping to join in the action against the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them all go down the mountain and act with the cavalry of the Jackdaw tribe." Siegel arranged: "Attention to control the number of orcs passed, maintain the current The situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight nodded. Because of the huge geographical advantage, Heim’s casualties are not big, and the results won are amazing. She asked Siegel inexplicably: "If the Black Blood Castle defends like this every time, how can the orcs enter the walls of the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is the first time the dwarves used their forbidden squadrons, and the orcs were caught off guard. The original walled mountains were so vast, there were many paths, canyons, and cave passages that we didn't know. That was the secret way for the orcs to enter the main choice." Siegel said: "The Black Blood Castle just defends a return route that can carry the spoils. It has never been prepared to guard the orc's offensive line. There is no northern sentry tower. There are no roadblocks and horses. Most of those hidden passages are unable to transport trucks, so they can only go under the Black Blood Castle. Over time, the castle's lord knows that the loot will slow down the orcs and let the orcs become a living target."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you thought about this already? Lord lord?" Mana looked at Siegel with a gaze. "You expect the victory of the Black Blood Castle." ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't think so specific." The Master told the truth, "I speculate that the orcs may attack, but I don't know where they will come from. So before we were in the jackdaw When I was in the tribe, I asked Tokley to help. His cavalry scouted the walls of the city and found this passage, so I only let you come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the walled mountains, the orcs have other ways to cross the walled mountains, which is by boat." Siegel continued: "Makabu has a large number of ships, and the shipyard can continue to produce new shipments." The warships, fortunately, all burned down during the last orc war, and have not formed scale since then. As far as I know, the sea trade routes have been very calm in the past two years. The orc’s piracy activities have dropped significantly, which is related to this. I estimate that It is not bad to transport one or two thousand orc troops from the sea to Deepwater City. This number of elves can eat it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know the deep water city How is the situation.” Mana laughs. He laughs: "I hope masked lords were able to stick with it." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Siegel was very strange, why ask Mana hope masked lords of winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's help him keep the orcs in the north, lest the orcs rob their beautiful cities, shouldn't they pay?" The knight said: "Even if you plan to go The inventory of the Black Blood Castle itself, this time we also use a lot of supplies, especially the plasma, which are all gold coins! Although the defensive orcs are a glorious and just cause. If there is no income, no The more you fight, the poorer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the lords of the Lord still have to enter the northern part of the city wall? Mana has heard of the orcs' towns, knowing that robbery, slave trade and smuggling have accumulated a lot of wealth for the orcs, but to the north is the orc's territory. Losing the land will inevitably increase many casualties. She wants to discourage. But she thought that Siegel was never a dizzy person, and would not let his soldiers die in vain. How could he not think of these situations? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the mercenaries finally got from Heim to the Black Blood Castle, Mana finally understood Siegel’s thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the Black Blood Castle shocked these mercenaries, and the remains of the Black Dragon made them extremely shocked. The dragon symbolizes wealth, courage, strength and great danger. It is the biggest dream of mercenaries and adventurers. “Being a Dragon Slayer” is a dream that everyone who has embarked on an adventure journey has. Only a handful of people have the opportunity to see the dragon of death, and there is very little to taste the taste of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All orc equipment is piled up on the mountain road, if you want, you will take it all." Siegel said to them: "I need you to send bows and arrows." Hand, participate in the black blood castle change, ammunition, I will pay for the employment, and pay the bonus according to the number of kills."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, Do the soldiers have the money?” A mercenary leader asked: “I am only worried about the problem of cooperation, so don’t create any contradictions.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very smart person Siegel smiled and looked at him: "Don't worry. The only thing you need to care about is that your wallet doesn't drum up at the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaders are smiling Laugh, don't believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle was deadlocked for a few days, and the orcs gradually found the trick, and the chances of passing the Black Blood Castle increased greatly. At this time, Mana issued an order and suddenly increased the intensity of the offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow is like the rain, the orcs see the situation is not good, and shrink back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This gives the people down the mountain the time to solve the orcs that passed before." The Knights explained when reporting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the lord and watched him stand on the tower and watched the situation with a telescope. Although Siegel did not participate in the battle of archery in the city, Manu knew that he was one of the most tired people. Every day, Siegel thinks about the possible actions of the enemy and uses magic around the castle of Black Blood to prevent it. Mana couldn't understand the spells, but after knowing that the enemy had never attacked, the enemy never succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although every day when the soldiers are seen, the lord is happy, always with a triumphant smile. But Mana knows that when there are no other people, grace often climbs his brow. Many times, Siegel will look south for a long time and stare at the end of the horizon. It is the direction of Deepwater City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, the orc suddenly increased the intensity of the attack, crazy - the scene can only be described as the word crazy - rushed down the mountain. They don't seem to care about casualties at all, and there is only endless fanaticism in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrows, stones, fires, deaths can't stop them, all orcs seem to be violent. They rush from the hillside like a torrent, and they won't stop even if they step on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archers in the castle don’t need to aim at all, just shoot down as quickly as possible. The orcs in the violent violent seem to be not afraid of hurting, and there is no feeling in one or two arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knight stood on a high place and looked down at the Black Blood Castle without saying a word. Siegel quietly confronted it on the tower, and the black eyes greeted the light red soul fire. Bai Long’s body has recovered, and under the stimulation of blood and suffocation, he has always wanted to participate in the battle, and therefore he has not stopped. The death knight patted the mount and calmed him down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has been waiting for his opponent to make a move and want to know what else will be there. More dragons? giant? Wraith? He is ready to meet the challenge, but after waiting for a long time, the orcs are still charging and there is no change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the death knight is shaking in the soul, and there is a word in the mouth. The news from the Knox Association was influenced by the Elf Law, and it could not be transmitted by magic spells. The cavalry of the Jackdaw tribe was attacked on the prairie, so the death knight completely lost contact with Deepwater City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
