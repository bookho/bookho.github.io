			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death of the green-footed snake, the thunderstorm is getting smaller, and Janet is helping with the brawny--in fact, the giant basically did everything himself-- Move Siegel and Jarrell to a clean place. The poet was also injured, but most of them were skin injuries caused by burns and impacts caused by electric shock. Although they looked very miserable, they also healed quickly. After he wakes up, he can still remember his own work, lamenting his ‘destroyed appearance’ and translating the language of the giant for everyone. After Siegel's poisoning, his wounds recovered quickly, but it also made him even hungry. Involuntarily, Siegel's eyes aimed at the green-footed snake that fell in the mud, and the eyes radiated blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, the brawny is described to his people: a "civilized person" from the South, like the pure man of our northern land, was torn The flesh of the monster, then ate it. It seems that after eating the snake python, this guy is no longer afraid of the toxins left in the green-footed snake. On the contrary, he eats more. If it wasn't for me to start fast enough, I would really be hungry. Fortunately, I still remember important things and didn't eat the heart of the snake. In short, we captured the spoils together and shared them together, so we became good brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident gave Jarrell a new feeling for his employer - fear. But for Janet, how big and colorful Siegel looks interesting. She squatted on the steps of the tower, holding her chin in her hands, and focused on watching the big and small men laughing in the rain and eating the body of the green-footed snake. They are hard to understand each other's language, but the blood of the same enemy on their hands makes them quickly become friends, and friends always understand the minds of friends. For a moment, Janet also wanted to run over to join the dinner, but she was afraid that she would not be like a lady, would affect her image in the heart of Siegel, so hesitated. In general, she sat quietly on the side, thinking happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Siegel." The young mage said in his not-so-speaking Northland savage language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Kerry-chenko, I have a brother, so I am also called Kerry." The giant waved his arm and his fist was pinched. In a firm tone, he said: "One day I will beat my brother and let him know that I am good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three listeners can hardly imagine big What kind of respect is Kerry, who can defeat the younger brother who is as strong as the Frost Giant. ‘Maybe that is the head Titan? There was a whimsy in Siegel’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the translation of the troubadour, several people finally figured out why Kerry had to fight with a green snake. "I need the heart and venom of the green-footed snake, and dedicate it to the sorcerer of the stalking nest, so that it can be used for divination. You also have the power to capture this prey, you can go to the wizard together. He knows a lot of knowledge, but also It is very magical to communicate with the soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are not many opportunities to see the wizard." The poet quickly explained: "In the field of the savage, the wizard They are all psychic with powerful powers. They are the spiritual core of a tribe. They usually show up very rarely, and those spirits will help them not be found by outsiders. Wizards rarely let savage errands, but these erotic errands are always You can see the wizard. You know, the nomads in the north are using the power of the whole family to support the wizards, so they have good things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can use What exchanges?” Siegel asked him, then shook his head. “We just went to see it. After all, as you said, it’s a very rare thing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air after the thunderstorm is exceptionally fresh, Personal brief rest we set together. Siegel sat on the back because of a leg injury, which is just as high as the big Kerry. The horses of several of them were very scared of Kerry, and they snorted nervously, and the horses kept squatting and escaping, always hiding away from the side of the giant. Only Sigler's Treknerma was born with the blood of the horse, and the instinct to obey the command defeated the fear. It hung his head quietly, walked beside the giant, and sneered at the other mounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry once learned some "Southern dialects", but usually used very little, so it is stuttering. However, he still tells about the situation of respected wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard never tells his name, but this does not prevent you from calling him directly with the word "sorcerer". About twenty years ago he came to the edge of the cliff, then turned the grass into a thorn, turning the shrub into a dead tree. On a moonless night, these twisted trees make up the nest, which is now the litter nest. The people in the tribe were very curious, and the patriarch once went to see with some soldiers to make sure that it was the home of the evil Wuling. The wizards there helped him, pointing out a rich land for the tribe, avoiding natural disasters and growing food. From then on, the wizard blessed the good weather and let the rain catch us. From time to time, let us help him capture some monsters in exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going along this voice, you can reach the litter nest," Kerry said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, he took the lead and walked to the front of the team. His huge body is like the collision angle of a ship, breaking the dense fog from it and taking out a route. Siegel followed behind him, paying attention to the changes in the land under his feet. He found that the soil here turned black, and there were many beetles and boring drills to drill. Sometimes the horseshoes stepped on and squeezed out the thick sludge. They are gradually going uphill, and it can be seen that the front is higher than behind. But when Siegel looked back and wanted to remember the way behind him, he found that the terrain seemed to be deceiving them, and they became downhill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of various creatures running in the fog, some are hooves, some are claws, and there are snorings like snakes crawling. There is also the sound of flapping wings in the air. Listening to the static should be a huge eagle. However, these animals did not scream, only from time to time came from awkward, guiding Kerry to change direction, and kept walking through the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This environment made everyone nervous, and several times Siegel involuntarily put his hand on the handle, and once even pulled out the scimitar Intercepted. At that moment, the wolverine became more rushing and louder, just as it happened suddenly at Siegel's neck. Siegel immediately woke up, and he understood that there must be wizards around the wizard watching them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the thick fog, nothing can be seen, so it is difficult to perceive the passage of time. Suddenly, the dense fog left them, like the sea that would quickly move away from the tsunami—they still gathered in the distance, turning into a gray wall that went straight to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the gray wall, there is a twisted tree in the place where the moonlight and the stars are sprinkled. The trees have no leaves, and the branches that open to them are the crowns of them. Numerous dry vines entangle each other, like a group of snakes that sleep in the nest in the winter, forming its bark and trunk. There is a tree hole near the root of the tree, where the wizard's residence is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white wolf stands next to a tree hole and squats like a sentinel. It has a red eye and a yellow one. It looks straight at Kerry and his party. Its throat is dull and low, and the warning is not to act rashly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel feels uneasy, he feels a strange itching, as if there is a wet and sticky shackle in the middle of his hair, along the neck Slowly climb up later. Siegel wiped out a hand and found that his hand was just his own sweat. He vaguely heard the soft laughter from around, not like a human being, more like the voice of an animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry walks in the front, holding a bag that is still bleeding, inside is the heart and poisonous glands of the green-footed snake - and some along the way Unknown viscera coming out. He is like a victorious general, more precisely, like a child who wants to boast of success in front of his parents, walking swaggerly. Until he walked over to the white wolf, then he went to salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin of the white wolf writhed, swelled, and then became human. A leaf wrapped in a fishing net made a robe, and the body was dirty and messy. The unkempt man looked at Kerry with his head. He reached out and his nails were black and long, like the claws of an animal. Kerry put the oozing bag on his hand and smiled and said, "I did a good job?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Easy!" Surprised in my heart. Wilderness is easy to see, and they are said to be ever-changing, each with a strong mana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard opened the bag, first put the eagle hook nose into it and smacked it, then widened his eyes and groaned. Siegel once worried that the wizard's nose would be red, and the eyeball would not get out of the eyelids. The man licked his mouth and uttered a sentence from the few remaining yellow teeth: "Yes, this is the thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard hangs the bag On the waist, it sways outside the net and the leaves, twisting as the action twists. He looked at Kerry, as if he suddenly realized: "Yes, you have to ask me something! What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My brother is missing, I want Find his whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still have a brother?" The wizard squatted for a while, then said: "There is a brother who is so miserable that he will always be beaten. I have to give him a black pot, a black pot and a gray pot. The annoying brother never regrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My brother often yells at me, but he will Tell me in advance, never sneak attack," Kerry replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
