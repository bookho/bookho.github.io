			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a female giant named Nata, the kind of power, I have seen her hand destroyed the wall of the pub. www *xshuotxt/com" The half-length man pinched his handkerchief and said, "When the commander of Moore defends the starting point, he often fights with her, and even fights all night, he always looks very tired."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the halflings speak earnestly and sincerely, Siegel listens to the details and always feels that the story is full of weird feelings. He put his arms on the table, blocked the corners of his mouth that he was about to laugh, and let the halfling continue to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The female giant did not appear in the recent period, but the atmosphere at the starting point was very tense. I heard that if you don’t hand over the commander of Moll, the barbarism on the prairie The man is about to destroy the outpost." The halfling was anxious to cry out and said quickly: "Now the foreman is preparing for the fortification to prevent the enemy from attacking. The food and weapons are hoarding, and there is a big battle! Lord, you, Be sure to save Commander Moore, he is a good man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said to the halfling Lille: "I will go to the starting point Look at what happened there. You should go to rest first, I have to do some preparation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halfling was taken down and arranged to eat in the servant's room. Things, sleep. Siegel thought for a moment and went to the one-eyed veteran Fazak himself and asked if there was any news about his grandson Moore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man has entered a semi-retired state, and his daily life is carried by the servant in the castle, looking for a quiet, sheltered and sunny place to sleep. Everyone respects this old man very much. When he sees him, he will take a light footstep and pass it cautiously. However, Siegel knows that Fazak’s hearing is very sharp, that is, a cat can be distinguished from a distance. This is the vigilance of long-term espionage practice, so it is better to go straight ahead. So that the old man can feel at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mor is going to get married?" Fazak was obviously the first to hear about it, but he said it was not impossible. "Morna's child has sent me a letter, but he said that a woman is pursuing him. I advise him to be cautious. After all, the identity of the starting outpost is more attractive than the word Moore, and never be used. I know the child. If you don't agree with me, he can't secretly get married."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just that there is nothing important about Secret City recently. I will go to the starting point for the outpost.” Siegel said: “Would you like to go see it together? If you follow me, it will be much more comfortable on the road.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a troublesome lord.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall-mountain tunnels are not very capable, so the team going to the starting point is unlikely to be large. Siegel and Fitzak, plus more than 30 knights, are enough. Mana continued to act as the lord, and the main work was on the autumn harvest. The Masters of the Federation will have to wait a few months to complete the mapping of the squad. During this time, Wendy has been quieter and no longer entangles Siegel. But there seems to be other plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before departure, Siegel found Evan and asked if he wanted to go to the west of the Walled Mountain Range. Evan didn't have two words. He happily patted Siegel's shoulder and accepted the invitation. So on the fourth day after the halfling was discovered from the barrel, the group rode on the raft and began to walk through the city wall tunnel for a long-awaited journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; riding a donkey is also a helpless move. Hem’s war horse is tall and can only be led in the passage, and it will slow down the speed of advancement. Only a low-headed scorpion is the main capacity in the passage. They are stupid and not afraid of a completely closed tunnel environment. Thanks to these animals, the City Wall Mountain Tunnel can increase the capacity on the ropeway line to meet the needs of the two parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most comfortable journey is not Siegel. It is Fitzak. He lay on the floating disc summoned by the wizard, and there was no bumps along the way, smooth as if lying on his big bed. He is also dressed in a cloak, regardless of the surrounding environment, the cloak adjusts the temperature and humidity, so the following is always the most comfortable environment. The old man laughed and laughed along the way, and the halflings always formed a sharp contrast because of the eagerness and crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no floating disc, Siegel summons the phantom. By compressing the power of magic, he makes the phantom's body smaller. But grow a pair of legs, like a lizard with a horse's head. Just able to carry his weight. With guards leading the way, Siegel doesn't have to worry about marching. Concentrate on the crystal stone in your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a natural crystal." Siegel said: "I have concentrated some small crystal stones found in Deepwater City. They use spells to make them blend and grow, and they become what they are now. In fact, the value of this crystal is not so high. However, it is very suitable to use the magical array of components."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have such a skill, why not make more pieces, sell for money?" Evan strange Asked: "Is it much better than collecting taxes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you selling to?" Siegel laughed. "The Master knows that this is a mantra in his hand; ordinary people will be discouraged when they see this price. But there may be rich merchants to buy it, but when he gives the crystal to the craftsman, the craftsman will tell him the crystal. The secret. In the end, I will not become a fake to sell fakes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is also said that this kind of thing is not very honorable." Grinning, watching Siegel continue to engrave strange lines on the crystal: "What kind of magical array is Heim building in the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will Tell me the magical array of Star City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I not?" Avon said: "There are seven layers of magic in Wangcheng, one for each of the three walls. On the floor, the palace has three floors, and there is a secret room in the palace. The first layer of magic is to suppress the harsh climate, and the transmission cannot cross the second magical array, and the third wall can block the entry of the undead and the demon. Inside the palace there are magic effects to avoid detection, avoid curses, detect toxicity and disease. There are still some messy protection spells. However, since the completion of the project, no one can force the Fantasy of the Star City to work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I won't tell you How to close the magic array - only the king who is enthroned has this ability, I know and can't do it now." Evan smiled and said to Siegel: "Can you tell me about your magical array now?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Keeping curiosity is a virtue," Siegel said, "You will always know."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this is what I call the Master's stink." Evan said to Fazak, who was smiling on the mat: "Is it always bad to be in the dark?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord of the Lord is also for security reasons, the believers of the murder god are good at lurking and spying, have to be as careful as possible," Fitzk explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to say that. The black people are probably not in the New World." Evan sat on his back but still could maintain balance, dangling Dangling can't fall. He said: "The New World has just finished playing. Everyone wants peace. It is very difficult for the murder god to stir up trouble. The starry kingdom is like a big oil tank. Basically, if you don’t understand this, I I will not take refuge, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded after hearing this: "I have the same speculation, but the problem is that these black people How is it going to and from the two continents? The murder god is not the elf god. He has always been contemptuous of magic. Even if the power is inexplicably growing, it will not suddenly give it a spell knowledge, so it is hard to imagine him building a similar transmission array. A class of things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only the ship left." Evan said: "I can all ship to the New World without being discovered. What is the difficulty of a group of black people? After the orc war, there are smugglers and pirates everywhere in the sea. It is not difficult to hide the whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know This is not an easy task." Siegel temporarily stopped the engraver in his hand. Said: "There is no good way at the moment. Even if I order the knights to go door-to-door and search, they have a way to get away with it. It is difficult to see his beliefs from the appearance of a person - unless it is the kind of shaman who needs tattoos. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father once said that the sword can only open a person's head, but can't dig what is inside," Evan said. "So the father will cooperate with the morning temple to let them manage the spiritual world, and we will focus on the stomach. The stomach is filled with food. The mind is no longer chaotic, the whole kingdom is settled."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Star Kingdom can have a history of more than 3,000 years, and it depends on this system. However, for some time, the Masters mastered the idea. As a result, the rebellion of the Master Lord led to the destruction of half of the kingdom. The Temple of Dawn is a good partner, although sometimes their ability is weaker, but these people are at least never evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the territory expands and residents' lives become more stable, demands for faith and magic also begin to emerge. Only two or three pastors and physicians can't satisfy everyone's needs. Although the construction of the temple will separate the income of some of the territories, it can indeed improve the living standards of the residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
