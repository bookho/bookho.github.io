			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel came to the basement of the city of Mith, deeper than where food and gold coins were stored. There is an empty room with a vaulted ceiling that directs the weight above to the surrounding walls, and numerous runes keep the structure strong enough to avoid collapse. The center of the room is the base of the rune column, but it does not have any special ability, more like the specification of the entire building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rune column exudes a shimmer, and Siegel uses this amount of light to begin to characterize the elemental array. The materials he uses are all refined special medicines, the cheapest of which is mercury per ten grams of gold. In order to be able to withstand greater elemental fluctuations, Siegel spent a lot of money on these things. His "deposits" at the top of Mora have all been used up, and the treasury of the city of Myrtle has almost bottomed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin line drawn by Mithril acts as a line of rune, connected to a large jewel engraving the rune. Since the loss of elemental arrays has not been solved perfectly, Siegel has designed mercury to withstand losses. Mercury will flow along a specific route, absorbing fluctuations in elements that would be unfavorable to the law. You only need to replenish mercury at regular intervals, so you don't have to replace the high-value rune gems and Mithril thin lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day Siegel can make progress, and the entire Rune Array is getting closer and closer. Janet thought of helping down, but Siegel said there were too many toxic substances here that were bad for the fetus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet calculated that every day Siegel can use nearly 5,000 gold coins, and it is only 50 days after it is finally completed. This vast project itself costs more than the city of Miele - after all, the dwarves of the castle built their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the entire rune array works, it can support a very large element warrior, or four large any kind of element warrior. There are two cores of control, and Janet’s hands are used to summon elemental warriors. The other is to collect the power of the elements attracted by the array, but it is impossible to condense the elements of the elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the snack of Capricorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleeping dragon girl was once again "abducted" by Siegel, and the new elemental rune matrix is ​​a perfect resting environment for her. In the city of Mier, she specially prepared a room for her to get to the sun and not to be noisy. However, Capricorn is not satisfied with this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you let me go to sleep in the squad? The power of the elements there is obviously stronger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Will you invite someone to rest in your treasure heap?" Siegel asked her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no." Capricorn shook his head. The silver fluffy hair swayed. Then she thought about it and said with a sigh: "But if it is you, I should agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is glad that he and the dragon girl The relationship is now well developed, but he remains awake. Remember to call Capricorn to protect this fortress. If she is snoring deep underground, the castle collapses and she is not expected to come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a flowing magical array below. If you go, it is likely to destroy the effect of the law." Siegel explained to her, "After all, you are not Master, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There will be magic!” Capricorn licked. Long Wei unknowingly emanate. There was a group of frightened cats screaming in the castle, and several even jumped out of the window and fled in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stared at Capricorn until she was embarrassed to take away Longwei, but admittedly: "Okay, I know: I There is no magic, and it is really possible to break the law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the squad or core is broken, I can’t really build it. Two, so you really can't go on. And you have to remember that the coverage of the array is very large. You can receive the energy of the element passed to the core in the five miles around the city of Mire." Although this is the truth, But Siegel still concealed something that he didn't want the dragon girl to know. "Furally, my wife is pregnant. You don't let Longwei in the castle. It is not good to scare the child. But if I hear that you are getting angry with me, I will close the circle and let yourself Back to the bitter time in the cold cave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If something is bothering you. If you are not happy, you will go to Janet to solve it." Siegel said: "The more you save energy, the faster you grow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be embarrassed!" Capricorn took over the core of the squad - a thick, long gemstone scepter, looking for places everywhere. But the robes she changed did not have pockets. And this can't be shackled with the scepter. After she tried a lot of places, she could only choose to hold it by hand. When Siegel saw her stupidity, she untied the long strap wrapped around her wrist and temporarily gave her a belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are some books in my study, you can go and see if you have nothing to do with the customs of the mainland." Siegel finally said: "Although you want It's a power to build up. But if the brain doesn't grow, it's impossible to cast the strongest magic, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss smashed, then smiled Say: "Thank you, you are a good person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, at about noon, the late Siegel will enjoy the breakfast prepared by Janet. The ear is attached to the wife's belly and listened carefully. It seems that this child is growing slower than the average person. It seems that there is no change in the time of more than two months. It is said that it takes about 18 weeks to hear the baby's heartbeat faintly. Now, besides seeing a vague soul light spot in the vision, nothing can be felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must take care of yourself." Siegel said: "Fazak is loyal, but he is old and some things are not well taken care of. Compared to your territory, the territory is just an unimportant thing. Don't worry too much about it. Go find the Capricorn, although her age is five or six times larger than the two, but in the world. Still a ignorant little girl. As long as she is still in the city of Mire, I don't have to worry about your safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lords of the South..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them go to trouble." Siegel said: "When necessary, William Uther can be released, provided that he compensates the widow and child of the slain businessman. A lot of money. If Hilo is willing, we can also provide them with weapons and equipment. After all, our basement is almost full."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After you leave, can the wall of the Ore Avenue be built?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get started." Siegel Say: "After incorporating the holy mountain peaks and the striped mountains into the city wall, control the ore avenue. But don't interrupt the commercial road for the time being, and you don't have to collect the road tax. There is no need to over-stimulate the southern lords."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently kisses where his child grows and then kisses his wife. Originally planned to start at noon, but he sat down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a burning flame in the fireplace. The winter sun is still cold but still bright. It shines through the window of the lounge and is sprinkled on the blanket. He sat in a soft bench and looked at his wife quietly. Because of pregnancy, she is more likely to be tired than usual, and she can't afford to sleep at noon. Siegel looked at her quiet and comfortable look, everything was perfect. A few kittens sneaked in and squatted in the fire of the fireplace, and took a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows that if he doesn’t leave, he won’t want to leave when Janet wakes up. Taking a deep breath, he stood up and helped Janet cover the quilt, then suddenly disappeared into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that he wants to leave is not kept secret, but wherever he goes, no one knows when he returns. He was not prepared to bring any entourage to the north, even if he and Mana strongly demanded no consent. Mystery still needs someone to handle the daily security work, and it is impossible to pin all hopes on the final dragon insurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak came to the stable to send him, and Siegel did not know how long he had waited, but it seems that he has not been idle. The old man has been swearing Moore, about all the things that need attention at the road. Although Moore has listened to more than a dozen times, he still has to harden his scalp again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't send it, you can go back quickly. The cold in winter is very hurtful." Siegel crossed a black horse and let Moore follow Behind yourself. "We are gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They first marched west, along the path of fences and shrubs. From Mier City to the Zebra Mountain Gold Mine, there are already many residents on this road. Several new buildings are under construction, and Moore says it is a hotel and a pub. Due to the large number of businessmen coming and going, the original tavern in Mirucheng has long been overwhelmed, and naturally someone will want to establish a new one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
