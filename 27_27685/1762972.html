			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is not behind the bushes, and the day is about to pass. The two knights are already close to the Morritt wasteland and have clearly felt the difference here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is known as the wasteland is mainly affected by the poor soil, no matter what kind of planting, there is no good harvest. Only one of the ten seeds can germinate, and only one of the ten seedlings can grow up. The peasants here have worked hard all year, and the food they laid is not enough for rations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather here is always very humid, so the locals have learned to grow mushrooms to make ends meet. Residents of the Morit Wilderness have acquired decaying trees from other places, using special secrets to produce large and thick mushrooms. Not only do vegetables, but also sell to passers-by merchants to change some money, buy food and living utensils. Gradually, all the living things here began to eat mushrooms, and it is said that the pigs here are eating this grown up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to previous news, Master McGonagall lived in the Morit Wilderness, where people often see her buying a lot of mushrooms. However, this information is already three years ago, and now no one knows exactly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid the road, Siegel and Moore searched the village along the road to prepare for the situation. As they are close to the east side of the New World, far from the spread of Heim’s battlefield, the rule of the lord is still firm, the robbers are rarely seen, and the villagers are still friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What have you smelled?" Moore sucked his nose and suddenly said, "There is a smell of dead fish here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his shoulders and Raven Baron flew forward. Passing through the trees and approaching the village, the taste is stronger. Baron made two screams and said that he had found a strange. When Siegel concentrated his spirit, he observed it with the eyes of the magic pet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fishing village, located on the shore of a reed lake. The invasion of the ghost fog swamp transformed the original clear water into a mud, but it was still able to see the fish swimming in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the lakeshore, a row of thorn-shaped fences, there is no movement in the village of low-rise thatched houses. On the road in the middle of the village, a long-row arrangement was set up, all made up of newly felled trees, and some used nails. Some use a straw strap. The corpse, which has long been in an adult shape, is hung upside down on the torture stand, with its feet tied by straw ropes and large stones tied to the wrists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body has long been rotted, and hundreds of flies are licking. The Raven screamed. The flies flew all together and fled like black smoke. The body was driven by this force, gently swaying in the air, as if to break free. The stones hanging from their wrists rubbed on the ground, and the sound of brushing and brushing was clearly audible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Moore cover their mouth and nose. Entering the village, they frowned at the bodies, one after another, with seventy-eight. They have been dead for a long time, and their bodies are so bad that they can’t see their faces and can only be distinguished from their bodies. There are old and young, there are men and women, who is doing such a ferocious thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bulletin board on the roadside, and a notice above seems to answer this question. The notice was issued by the governor of Morritt, Prince Planton. "All the evils who abandon goodness and believe in evil spirits will be punished. Those who shelter the devil should be purified." At the same time, there is another notice next to it, "To all pedestrians, due to the influence of ghosts and swamps, Mo The Ritter area is no longer safe. Please don't leave the road and immediately go to Morritt Castle to buy amulets to protect your peace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, there are devils and Evil God?” Moore removed his gaze from the body and asked him on the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only feel the breath of the dead spirit. The grievances around me are deep." Siegel looked at a long row of bodies hanging on the armor, filled with hearts. doubt. “The ghost fog swamp area has always been prone to undead, such as cockroaches, zombies and ghouls. Why are these corpses all unchanged?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol said: Maybe the priests of Pran asked the pastor to do the purification. Avoid this situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, and he did not see the traces of the purification ceremony. The hanging body had empty eyes and only the mouth of the teeth, staring at Siegel and making silent shouts. There are no wounds caused by swords and spears on their bodies. If the dead are falling, they are not tied with stones. These people are tied up by living and step by step to death in despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the lake next to the village made a screaming sound, it seemed to be the paddle of the paddle, and it was like someone swimming on the water. Moore took out the sword nervously, and the metal reflected the radiant light in the light of the seventy-eight torches. "Who! Come out!" he yelled, and then the sound of the water disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has already reached the Morritt wasteland, the meaning of disguise is not great. Siegel waved his hand, and the wind blew away the mist in front of him, revealing the vast lake. In the reeds, a circle of circles floated away, but did not see any movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a fish, it won’t have such a big sound, and it won’t be so perfect. Siegel opened the sight of the lake, but still did not find clues. The lake is quiet, the reeds gently sway with the breeze, everything is calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they heard the sound of the plop, and turned around and saw that the rope on the armor was blown and the body fell. Moll gently sneered at himself and then turned back, and found a figure in the middle of the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing in a grassy green dress, standing quietly on the water, the blond hair covered the face and hangs down to the waist. She doesn't move, she doesn't talk, she just stands there quietly. Morming knew that he couldn't see clearly, but he was very sure that the woman was staring at him with her red eyes after her hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand was placed on his shoulder, and Siegel patted his attendant gently. "Don't be nervous, it's a kind of spiritual, undead creature. It can feel your fear and grow up. It may eventually become a banshee. If it doesn't happen, I am strange."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you destroy it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not impossible, but it will be very troublesome." Geer explained: "If Rhett is much better here, the pastor's excess power is the best way to deal with the spirit. But you can rest assured that if it dares to approach, use the most stupid way I can let it disappear. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not very dangerous to stay here, there is..." Morton lived, there are no villagers here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the sorcerer becomes a banshee, there is almost no ability to move, and at most, the fear of the body is flying over you, but there are limits. Because of this, she is called the spirit. The guy is far from the shore, and my spells rarely have such a large range. I want to deal with it only by boat. But how do I look like It's a trap. The ghost fog swamp invades the lake here, and my detection spells can't go too far before reaching the limit, so there are too many places to set. Moore, the real undead is not like zombies, their Intelligence is very strong and always be cautious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially after seeing Nikes, Siegel has a deeper understanding of this sentence in the book. Experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people stopped at the lakeside, and the spirits found that they could neither scare them nor cause the possibility of fighting, and they slowly sank into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go to Viscount Plan and tell him that there are undead creatures here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Morrit Castle is situated on a bare hill, constructed of large black stone bricks. The castle is huge and wide, but no one has ever attacked it. The wasteland is too barren, with nothing but mushrooms and pigs raised with mushrooms. Therefore, the city owners here are too lazy to repair, and many places are almost decaying and dying. There are three tall towers in the castle. Now only one of them is inhabited, and the other two have long been converted into storage rooms - which are full of mushrooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black mist brought by Ghost Fog is very well matched with the style of the whole castle, so it always looks wet and muddy, no matter what color people wear here. The clothes will eventually become dirty clothes stained with gray soil. The Schonton family's crest is a tree that grows vigorously. The golden leaves are spread over the red trunk, and the background of the flag should be green. But now everything is polluted into black, and the trees are like mushrooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard at the door leaned against the spear and was sleeping, and the horse roused them with the sound of a nose jet. Siegel sat on the saddle and looked down at the guards, posing with a majestic momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard's hand clasped the spear tightly, because the force, the blue veins bulged. He took a half step back with vigilance and then asked: "The two adults, there are... What can I do for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
