			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the collapse of the house came from inside the wall, accompanied by the horror of the horse screaming and the dog. Someone hysterically shouted: "Hurry up! Devil! Devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then another house collapsed, it must be a chicken coop. Siegel was able to clearly distinguish the sound of the flock of wings and screaming. He clenched his staff, finished the spell in the blink of an eye, and flew up the wall with any door,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the courtyard, the magic statue Rhett and a gray-white cognac devil are fighting . The same size and strength of two people. But the bones are more flexible and jump around the courtyard like an assassin. The statue of Reid is thick and thick, although he is not afraid of the damage of the bones and devils, but he can't hold the opponents and fight like a warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window belonging to the master bedroom fell on the ground, the blue velvet curtains swayed in the wind, and there were some deep scratches around the window sill, it seemed to fight It started from there. The guards of the castle have just arrived, some of them have heavy shackles in their hands, and the other part uses tower shields and short swords. There are two knights who have also come up with a plasma smashing, which seems to be preparing for "devil slayer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder shouted: "Don't shoot, I come!" He put his hands together, and a beam of light descended from the sky, accurately hitting the bones. The sacred power burns the skin of the bones, and the black scars spread down the shoulders. The shackles formed by a holy force were wrapped around the bones and tried to fix it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Pastor, as the guard of the castle, we have the duty to kill the invading devil." The guard said: "I believe that our weapons, even the dragon can not stand. The damage of the magic 。矢."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't shoot!" Reid insisted: "This devil must catch it!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too dangerous, Mr. Pastor, we are responsible for the safety of the lord's family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones roared and the body continued to grow bigger . He cuts the St. Chain with his sharp claws and slams the ground to break free. Rhett prayed loudly and called for the help of all good gods. However, it is more difficult to kill than to kill. He has a weak mana and a left-handed right, and he quickly falls into a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! You put the weapon away, I will subdue it." Siegel shouted. A flash of transmission to the face of the bones. The ugly devil saw the wizard and became even more mad, breaking the three holy chains in succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards and knights quickly pointed the long-range weapon into the air to avoid accidentally injuring the lord. Guards equipped with tower shields and short swords want to run over to assist. It was also stopped by Siegel. He placed the defensive staff on the chest of the bones and the other hand made a complicated gesture. The power of magic surges from the body, jumping out of the fingertips, and a "fixed" word emerges in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones screamed like a muddy. The activities of the whole body are greatly resisted, and the powerful force cannot be made at all. Coupled with the sacred chain of Ryder Ryder, the bones and devils have two strong spells in the body, and they are stiff and can't move like a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is not over yet, Siegel doesn't want any bones, he wants Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly moved closer to the bones, resisted the stench of the smell, and continued to focus on the spell. The bones and devils only have two eyes that can still turn, staring at the gradually approaching mage. From the two ugly eyelids. Revealing the look of threats, fears, timidity and pleading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel put two fingers on the forehead of the bone demon and chanted the curse. Whether it is thought control or modification of memory, as long as he can enter the devil's mind, he uses it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's in the devil's mind? Siegel only felt that he was trapped by endless destruction, and there was constant arrogance, greed, fury and jealousy. A variety of negative emotions are like the ocean, like a storm. Siegel struggled hard in it, hoping to find a part that belongs to Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His thinking is moving forward, but in the courtyard of the city of Mith, his body and the body of the bones are motionless. The loyal soldiers are carefully approached, but they are blocked by Reid. "The Lord Lord is casting spells. Don't bother him, lest the spells fail and hurt him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please be quiet, boy, please be quiet." Reid whispered: "This is not a question when the Lord's command is questioned, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness of the bones There are huge waves, and here it is the master of everything. Ability to mobilize all power. He wanted to wrap the invading mage with sea water filled with evil thoughts and drag him into the dark, dark sea. Then let the fearful sea monster, the lonely darkness and the pressure of despair kill him and assimilate his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Siegel is obviously not the kind of person who is helpless and has no power. His spell protects him, and Knox's improved mind-controlling spell is his weapon, a powerful radiance that radiates from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ocean of consciousness is illuminated by him, and the raging waves and frenzied storms are simply inaccessible to the Master, and can only be surrendered within the scope of the light. Listen to orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is looking around, looking for clues from the repetitive and monotonous surroundings, wanting to see what belongs to Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he discovered a shallow island reef, most of which was already submerged in the sea, leaving only a beach less than a foot square. If it is a storm, the sea of ​​evil thoughts will be drowned, and Janet’s thoughts will never be seen. Only under the suppression of Siegel's magical energy, when the surrounding sea water is calm, there will be such a little bit of beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three bright pearls on the beach, which is Janet’s most precious memory. One is Siegel, one is Mire City and the other belongs to Isaac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood on the beach, holding his head up and his hands reaching the sky. He recited the words of the spell aloud, guiding the power of magic from the center of the black scorpio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet, I want to help you, you have to help me too." Siegel’s voice echoed in this muddy sea. "Listen to my call, wake up from a nightmare, don't be controlled by the power of the blood, don't be invaded by the devil. Wake up and wake up from the dream that the devil has woven for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the call repeats over and over again, ringing in every corner of the sea. Under the sea, the devil is screaming wildly, trying to regain control of his own mind. The singer's spells suppress it, and the magical power of the cockroach seems endless. The devil feels the threat, and wants to understand the truth in the fury: If this time it completely controls Janet, it is impossible to escape the spell of the mage in front of him, and being destroyed is its only ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil but not stupid, crazy but patient. The devil knows that it can be hidden in the deepest part of the sea of ​​consciousness. Here is the darkness that cannot be illuminated. Here is the abyss where the sound cannot be transmitted. As long as it avoids the light on the island, it can continue to lurk and look for the next opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones actively retreated, so the sea gradually receded and the beach area grew larger and larger until the entire coastline was revealed. The jewels of memory and the shells of feelings appear new, the wind is calm and the water is flat. Janet finally responded to Siegel’s call and said with a weak voice: “Siegel, where are you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Good rest, I will save You are." Siegel’s voice was full of comfort, but his eyes were full of sorrow, and he looked helplessly at the depths of the sea. He felt the place where the devil was hidden, and he knew how to erase the memory, but the place where it was hidden was too deep, beyond the reach of all spells that controlled emotions and consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't enter such a deep place without hurting Janet's soul, using brute force will have more than ninety-nine may damage Janet's Soul, let her be a walking dead. Compared to the power of the devil, Janet’s soul is too weak. If she is a powerful caster, or a pastor of the Temple of Dawn, it would be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, and his idea was too wishful. How can the priest of the Temple of Dawn be easily possessed by the devil under the protection of divine power? Moreover, it is too late to say anything, even if Janet immediately begins to learn spells, while she strengthens her soul power, the power of the devil will strengthen together and even develop faster. In the end, there is no other possibility than to become a more powerful devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A touch of sunlight rose from the sea level, which means Janet is waking up. Siegel left a kiss on the beach and then retired from the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the bones are all tired and tired, and they are slowly closing. Siegel swings his hand toward Ryder, and the priest unlocks the holy force chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
