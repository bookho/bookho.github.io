			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago, Janet said to Siegel that in the face of the caster, the defense of the simple castle is in vain. A brick wall without runes, a room without a circle of protection is convenient for spell offenders everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet is not a caster, she just starts from her own deformability and infers this conclusion, but the actual situation is actually more than her inference exaggeration. Siegel prepared two things, one is the silent runestone used by the dwarf, and the other is the killer he summoned from the wind element plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no fixed forms of killers, they are big and small, and they vary widely. The mages later named it unified as an invisible latent monster. This is an elemental creature, and there is no concept of good or evil in itself. As long as they pay the right rewards, they are subject to the summoner's orders to complete some special tasks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good sapphire as a reward, invisible lurking said that he is very happy to serve the Master. It can only make a squeaky voice, speak in the language, but understand Siegel's lingua franca. The mage asks the invisible lurking monster to destroy the evil enemies in the castle according to the instructions of the raven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Siegel tied the silent rune stone to the Raven, and let the two flying killers enter the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the name implies, invisible latent monsters will remain invisible forever, even if it launches an attack or is attacked. If it wants to tell someone where they are, it will reveal the outline of the cloud. If you do not take the initiative to show up, even if you use invisible or invisible, you can only see a cloud of blurred gas, which is easy to be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While possessing powerful stealth capabilities, the stealth lurking tracking ability is extremely high. As long as there is air, it can extend the senses and gain a lot of intelligence. This terrible killer is extremely difficult to guard against, especially for those who have no ability to cast spells or defend against invisible means, and they will not be aware of where the attack came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible latent monsters, after discovering the target, can release the rapid and strong rotation of the wind, use the unexpected blow to quickly gain the advantage, and then develop fast and continuous in the following time. attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it can be invisible, the wind brought up during the attack will cause obvious whistling. Cause the attention of others. The Raven's silent runestone is to cope with this situation to make up for this loophole. Siegel watched them leave, then connected to Barron's vision and began to command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle of Ampa is very large. There are so many rooms separated, enough for everyone to stay. The robbers chose to disperse their favorite rooms, which gave them the opportunity to break through. Coupled with the lethargy caused by drunkenness, the "Knights" slept like dead pigs, and the snoring echoed in the passage of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one. Invisible lurking monsters use wind pressure to cut to the unguarded neck, causing the same effect as the giant sword dagger. Sometimes, except for the attackers who are still sleeping, they are cut off their heads, and even the beds under them are often cut into two sections. Runestone gives a faint light, no more than a candle, but absorbs all the sounds, perfectly covering up the actions of the killers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One room after another, entering from a window or fireplace, leaving from the door. Soon, the buzz in the castle gradually disappeared. The servants who have been tired for a day can finally rest well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloody smell spreads from the castle and mixes with the stench from the hall. Several servants who passed through the passage took a nose and found the smell, but decided not to gossip. They left with a candlestick, but they did not know that the hidden lurking monsters were on top of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the enemies pointed by the Raven are the targets of the attack. The hidden lurking monsters are not addicted to killing, too lazy to spend effort on others. The servant only felt itchy behind his neck and seemed to have a cold air blowing. They quickly looked back, but only saw the empty silent passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black raven is a black god of death, flying silently through the castle. Every robber in the hall who brags about his "performance" is firmly remembered by Siegel. They are paying for their atrocities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dick Knight has not fallen asleep at this time, he is excited to wait for the dawn. When Baron flew into his room from the window, he was just seen by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hell is this! He panicked back and looked at the long sword standing against the wall. As long as there is a weapon in hand, there is a desperate opportunity, so he stumbles and straightens his arm and ran over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind rushed. He only felt that he was pushed backwards. The invisible lurking blame waved his arm and smashed his head. Blood runs along the body of the killer, forming a slender trace in the air. The raven flapped his wings and flew down to the next room, invisible lurking bloody lines, and followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn of the next day was a little cold, and the mist came from the north in the morning, soaking everything wet. The Ghost Fog is still trying to expand outward, and is still trying to do it. However, it is too far south, and the fog has no chance to stagnate into a solid, and it is dispelled by the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scream in the castle, and the servants who had found the singularity ran out until they put themselves in the sun to gradually calm down. Since the gates of the castle were not opened, the people outside did not know what was going on inside, but they could only guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the servant inside will soon open the door of the castle, and the whole town will know the destruction of the robber knight. Siegel knew that when he arrived, he told Moore to pack up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the inn ran over, grabbed Siegel, pointed at him with a finger, and said with a trembling voice: "You can't go, Dick will come right away." He will take my daughter away. You promise to take care of this matter, if you lose your faith, you will be punished by the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dick will not come "Siegel patted his hand and said to him: "He has been punished and will not pose a threat to your daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, I don't believe you," the man said. "You have been in the inn, you haven't gone anywhere, you haven't done anything! Are you kidding me? My axe? My machete?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sighs a few words, uses the power of the spell to calm the person down, and then opens his hand. "Remember what you said: I have been at the inn, nothing to do with everything that happened, it is the gods who have punished the evil and helped you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Moore walked over and said that everything is ready and can go on the road. Siegel comforted the owner of the inn and asked him to go to the castle to see it. However, he repeatedly reminded that there is no need to say that he has been here because he has more important tasks to complete, and leaking his whereabouts is dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until this time, the owner of the pub was still dubious, but finally regained hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the villages rushed to the direction of the castle, then shouted the excitement of "dead, all dead". All the robbers were beheaded overnight, and the servants were unscathed. More than forty robbers, more than forty rooms, no one has issued an alarm, even the high-strength assassin in the story does not have such ability. Only one of them knows the ins and outs of things, but he secretly swears to the god of warriors in his heart, never revealing a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The townspeople first comforted each other and talked about this wonder. Then they came back and thought of the reserves in the castle. There are bread, apples, flour, lots of sausages and ale, and the wealth of the Anpa family. The eyes of the villagers became red, and they rushed in and began to plunder on the bloody red ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some old weaknesses can't be reached, they can only watch. The owner of the inn tried to persuade the villagers, but the strength was weak. He turned back to the inn and prayed with the daughter to the god of war, hoping that the gods could forgive the greed of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaos in the castle became a riot, not knowing who opened the head, and soon became a weapon. The sword of the dead knight was smashed and handed over to those who had almost no martial arts. They will neither block nor close their hands. When the first person is hacked, the situation becomes more and more out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Siegel has long been away from this place, he and Moore are riding in the forest, hoofs linger in the ear. Young waiters know what their lord adults must do, most of them are related to spells, and they will not ask. They marched along the shoreline of the Pentium Creek, far behind the Anpa family's castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the way to the east, the villages along the way suffered from different levels of looting, a large number of houses were destroyed by fire, and farmland became a scorched earth. Do these robbers don’t know how to converge? Is it necessary to push everyone on the road to destruction? Is Ampa dead and the conscience died? Siegel is very distressed and really can't understand the thinking of these robbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
