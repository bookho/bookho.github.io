			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the North is easy for Siegel. Even if he did not go to the north in person, and gave up the power of the god of prophecy, he could not directly cast his gaze directly, and he could not use the teleportation, but he could board the star, fly over the mountain and the earth, one or two. It takes time to reach the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Siegel decided to wait, at least to find some clues about his cloned saints. There are not many opportunities to study the rule barrier, and even the relevant information in the memory of the god of knowledge is very scarce. Siegel can only judge according to the existing situation, that the barrier set by all the main gods of a crystal wall, combined with the crystal wall itself, is almost the same as the rule of a world's crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a valuable research opportunity to justify the analysis of almost all the rules. Whether it is Siegel himself or part of the god of knowledge, there is no such opportunity. He finally decided to postpone the action for a month, first straighten out the things that Heim took, and promoted the magic crystal core as an important product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a god of magic, Siegel has almost no endless spell-casting ability, and he does not need the secret nuclear weapon as a strategic means to protect himself. It is. The method of building the secret nuclear core has been handed over to the federation, and he now leaves the production of the core of the nuclear element polymer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless I have experienced the same research, it is difficult to create an elemental polymer out of thin air." Siegel solemnly said to Janet: "So be sure to keep at least one secret nuclear core, use it as a seed to reproduce with the spar, so that it will be used in a continuous core."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why do you tell me this, do you want to go out?" Janet frowned. "After becoming God, you must live longer than us. Why don't these things be handled by yourself? I am not a mage." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You misunderstood, I did not say to leave." Siegel shook his head: "I have not been in Heim for a long time, do not understand the current situation." I have made it clear to you about nuclear matters. You are here to find people who can handle specific matters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mysterious nuclear can be said to be the sea The most important thing about the collar, no other product is more valuable than this. You know, as long as the secret Nuclear energy is also in the hands of the squid family, ...... "Janet said half, paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about, can you guarantee that the family will last forever?" Siegel shook his head: "With me, I can be much better than Mier. Even if it is." It’s the best technology, and there is always the possibility of being imitated and learned. I know that you have some reluctance in your heart, but you can check that you have too much energy involved, and you can’t guarantee that the descendants of Isaac and Isaac always have* *The teacher appears!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have become a magic god, can you bring the federation into it? Although it is usually very close, it is worse than vowing the knight "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pondered for a while and finally shook his head: "The mage's vitality lies in research and suspicion, and the organization of the mage is managed under the family. It's not a good idea. Maybe I will continue to pay attention to Heim's collar in a short time, but then I will let it go to Isaac. I won't always be personally involved. Can he hold back the federation? But a group of independent from the Masters Association The organization established by the people, the roots are still unruly. Time I can't always go back and clean up the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That said, after Heim's collar is not getting weaker?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only after thoroughly solving the problem of the storm wall, will there be a Heim collar. Siegel knew very well which one was the decisive factor. "Like this, I have another way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s approach is to build his own temple. Originally, he did not want to do this, mainly because he had not received a response from his childhood prayers, so he was not caught in these things. This temple will not be the kind of place to answer the doubts of life and to relieve depression. It will have the characteristics of "Siegel". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The headquarters of the temple is placed in the city of Miru, and the things related to the secret nuclear and the magic spar are handed over to the temple to operate. In the future, you only need to divide the money. The power of the priest of the temple comes from me, which is more than the swearing knight's binding force. Unless my post-people provoke anger and anger, even the magical temple is not willing to save, otherwise Can guarantee wealth and peace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have any experience in this area, but according to the experience of my predecessors, when I built the temple, there will be a pastor who is inspired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Since the final decision was made, Siegel immediately proceeded. The guards of the city of Myrtle acted first, and together with the hired laborers in the town, came to the west of the city. The rune wall passage that was established that year was still standing here, and the westward dwarf passed through the walled mountains from here and disappeared into the wilderness. The wall passage in the Elven War was not attacked. Coupled with the universal establishment of the transmission array, the meaning of the wall has disappeared and it has now become a pure sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michel City attracts a large number of people, but not everyone can find the right job. The efficiency of work driven by infinite energy and infinite creation has led to a significant drop in the demand for labor in each workshop. In the countryside, farmland can still accommodate a large population, but the city has no way to give enough jobs for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This balance takes a long time to build, before the lessor, Isaac (at the mother’s suggestion), who is temporarily unable to find a job Provide basic food for one year. Although Heim’s collar is rich, but he is unable to solve all the problems of all people forever, many people choose to come to the Rune City Wall to find a place to escape from the wind and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel ordered the soldiers to drive away all the people in the Rune Wall and let the workers clear out an open space. "Wick, do this work in three hours, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do the Lord, the resistance, treat?" The Orc is straight. Standing in front of Siegel, with a strong and serious expression. After Siegel left the former kingdom of the Starry Kingdom, the Orc was returned to Heim, while he was responsible for the management of the Guards and was responsible for training the recruits. He has become a family, and the land is handed over to his wife, but he still stays with the soldiers in the city of Mith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel listens to Janet, the first thing that half-orc wants to go back to the territory is to propose to use all the savings to apply for the transfer between the two sides. Array. It happened that at that time, the young lord Isaac decided to strengthen the connection with Heim's various subdivisions, and to build a group of transmissions, but also saved the gold of the half-orcs. When he was in the city of Mithril during the day, he used his transmission array to return to his wife at night, and he did not delay his efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are people who are led by Heim, telling them that they must leave, otherwise there will be danger of crushing. I will tear down the entire rune wall to build a temple. Don't accidentally hurt them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow!" Mike stood up and acted more standard than the court guards of the Starry Kingdom, which surprised Siegel. He carefully observed that the soldiers of the shackles had eyes and eyes, and he came out with a mold. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers rushed into the runes of the city, the rifle on the ground with a rhythmic tapping, waking everyone out of their sleep. Currently in Heim's collar, the long shot is a ritual equipment, and the real threatening weapon is the musket behind the soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this going to do? Are there robbers or fugitives hiding in us?" The awakened crowds have been talking, and some smart people have begun to pack valuables. Items, ready to hedge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone listens, the Lord's adult has orders, and immediately leaves his own things from the Rune Wall. It is about to be demolished and is not allowed to affect the construction work. Start work!" The commander's big voice kept echoing, and went to the next place after several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are we sleeping? Isn't this going to be a shower?" Some people are puzzled, and some people stand up and ask: "Is there any?" Arrange our new residence? You can't drive us away like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only answer to his commander is: "You only have two hours. Immediately leave the wall of the Lord's Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people understand, immediately start packing and stay away from these soldiers. The current situation is clear, and the sooner you go, the more likely you are to find a new place to live. They live in the Rune City Wall, but after all, they are not their residence. Now that the owner of the house has come, what is the reason to stay here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not order the use of force to drive away, and the soldiers led by Heim did not dare to point the sharp end of the spear at people. Even some people who are too excited rushed up. It’s just that you use your lance to hit your ankles and come down one by one. It seems that Zucker’s level of training is getting higher and higher, and it is very rare for the army to ban it. If this tradition can be maintained, then the Cavaliers will slowly disappear, and at least the strength of the army will not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
