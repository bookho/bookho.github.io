			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the door of the alien spell and more than thirty spells, Siegel was sent back to the secret by Lynch. city. Capricorn stayed with her father and did not choose to come back with Siegel. Therefore, after this trip was completed, Siegel was re-emerged in front of everyone with the complex feeling of loss and embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michel City is still the same, the people of the Federation are busy refilling the mana pool, and this has not caused much impact for more than a month. Raven Barron played with Isaac every day, so everyone thought that Siegel would not be in danger. But only the mage himself knows that the raven can no longer be counted as his own favorite, and it has gone out independently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one day I really have something, maybe it’s also good... Siegel is a little sad, but he knows it’s been left by the dragon girl. influences. How to say that she finally got what she wanted, she should be happy for her. Although she is not usually common, she still feels at ease when she knows that she is around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean up the mood, Siegel returned to his family, surrounded his wife's enthusiasm and the child's laughter. For them, they must become stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door spell of the alien world can directly connect the two worlds, allowing the spells transmitted by the real body, and it is also one of the spells that Lear is strictly guarded against. . When Siegel returned to the city of Mire, Lehr learned the existence of this magical reel of the door of the outside world through prophecy. "Hundred-faced scorpion must not leave this world! Now there are no masters in the scorpion. If they are acquired by other gods in the world, they will be lost forever." He regretted that he gave up all the power of the gods. In fact, he was even more powerful by the power of the magic god. It's easy to stop the effect of a spell. Just like some worlds, the gods ordered the prohibition of time to suspend the above spells, which directly blocked the possibility of relying on the spell to become a god directly (see the history of the forgotten country, the 12th level of Casas). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But going directly to the city of Mystery will bring back the hundred-faced scorpion, and he has no confidence to win. Masters within the scope of the nuclear energy can call elemental energy, which is almost equivalent to endless spelling endurance. As long as the state of the stalemate of the spell is formed, the mage who does not have the nuclear support of the secret will inevitably fail. The only way to defeat Siegel is to destroy him directly at a speed that is not too fast, and he will not be given the opportunity to call him. But Siegel is also a sorcerer, and the difficulty of wanting to kill is too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille has tried several times with Siegel. Improve his evaluation again and again. This young man has great potential and is capable of exerting his or her potential. If you always evaluate with the past, you will definitely suffer a big loss, but there is no way to correctly predict his current strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most trouble for Lear is actually the ability of Siegel to hide things. Since the face of Siegel, it has disappeared from the scope of prophecy. I can't find it. Lear used a legendary level of power but got a vague clue: the hundred-faced scorpion is still in the thunder wall world. If it wasn't for him to study all kinds of scorpions all the year round, he was already familiar with this thing, and even this clue could not be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident reveals a lot of intelligence, and Siegel either uses artifact-level things or masters legendary spells. Otherwise it is impossible to hide the hundred-faced scorpion so deeply. Lear even thought of a possibility, that is, Siegel has a scorpion, and one of the scorpions' ability is to hide. Such assumptions can explain many problems, such as the rapid rise of Siegel, his superb understanding of spells, and the whereabouts of other scorpions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee wants to think more likely, and ultimately "Siegel is the holder of the nephew, and has more than one nephew" as a fact. He adjusted his layout, and he found out how many stuns he had walked out. Especially after Evan became the king of the stars, the previous prophetic clues were reshuffled, and the strategy should be re-adjusted at that time. The suppression federation and Siegel were the guidelines set before the reshuffle, and now this line of destiny has moved towards an uncontrollable future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The door to the outside world. Where did he find this spell?" How could Lear not find the source of this spell, a gray dense fog blocking His detection. Once as a magical god, he can see the power of the rules of the kingdom from the fog. Which god is involved in this matter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the present, there is only a multi-pronged approach that pulls Siegel out of the environment of the Peruvian nuclear. Lear annihilated the candle with his hand and placed himself in complete darkness. This environment is suitable for brewing tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, he picked up the quill and spread out the letter paper, "Shasha" written on it. Language is like the wind, and the wind is a murmur of conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised "Lucky Sos" design was finalized, and regardless of the final result, Siegel decided not to waste energy. He split the design into thousands of copies, handed out some non-repetitive work to the federation, and the rest was the sole responsibility of the maker's golem. He hopes that he will be before the completion of the Sos. Ability to learn the spells of the gates of the opposite world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learning difficulty of the door of the outer world is a hundred times more than the transmission technique, which involves a lot of plane knowledge. It’s hard to really master this spell with just one scroll, and it must be supplemented with a lot of information. Lynch took this into consideration, so he included a lot of manuals and guides for traveling in Siegel. How to locate in the multiverse, how to distinguish between the astral, etheric, and phlegm-separated areas, how to find and evade the semi-planet. On the basis of this knowledge, how to cast spells, how to avoid the barriers of the outside world to penetrate the two worlds without hindrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barrier is a very important part of the spell. It can be said that the difficulty of the door of the alien spell is more than 70%. Only by understanding the characteristics of the opposite world can we make a targeted barrier. There used to be a wizard who opened the door to the outside world without a barrier and connected directly to the Heaven Mountain, which he thought was safe. The power of holiness rushed out, and the range of the door of the door of the opposite world was changed into a holy place. All the souls were smashed by the positive energy of the shackles, becoming the devout heavenly evangelists, and then through the outside world. The door goes to heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words: they are all dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the barrier of the door of the outer world, Siegel also began to contact the barrier of the wall channel. The barrier between the walls is much more troublesome, mainly due to the rule of confrontation. The Earth of the Goblin has no true God, so the Divine Power Barrier is the best choice. In addition, Siegel has other ideas. No one will cast magic on the opposite side, especially sending magic. If you can arrange a layer of the array on the channel and send the original things back together, the other party seems to have nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea was handed over to Verwood of the curse system for verification, as a subject of the federation. Wendy, Wywood, and Simonton have all gone through the astral projections to the Earth. They have taken back a lot of books and materials in different ways and put them together in the "Earth Knowledge" area. There is now a group of wizards who study these materials and learn the thoughts and tactics of Goblin to prepare for future battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s three guards vowed that the knight also joined this kind of study, and they continually cast aside on the tactical thoughts of the goblin, thinking that this is simply brutal and uncivilized. Inferior mean means. "We won't lose our worth, but we must never take it lightly. If the noble knightly spirit loses to the rogue tactics, the only explanation is that the Cavaliers are not alert enough, cautious, and not smart enough."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of things to prepare for the war. Siegel knows that he can't do everything, only to do his best to fight in the field he is best at. He spent the entire three months mastering the door to the outside world and left the spell with a copy of the spell, which was stored in the library of the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Siegel, this is an important moment, and the door to the outside world opens the way for him and his people to safely evacuate. If the war is unfavorable, using the door of the outside world to go to other planes has a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told Janet this thing, but she did not expect that she would refuse: "You can't send us away, and then face the enemy yourself. This is very unfair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goblin's crystal wall channel is at the top of the Mora, too close to here. Once the Mola is lost, The goblin weapon can razed Heim to the ground in a few hours.” Siegel tried to persuade: “Even if it is secret, it can’t last long. I can’t keep up with it at that time. Come back and show you the door to the outside world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Once we leave, all of Heim will know that this will cause a lot of trouble." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "No. I let the god of lights become yours, and you can show up from time to time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to be very thoughtful!" Janet still shook her head firmly: "I don't leave the castle, if you want to give me safety, then don't Failure. If you are defeated, I can also know here. There is no lord to go out, the lord's wife and heirs are the first to escape. It is an ominous sign, indicating that the lord will inevitably fail to die. Please let me pray for you at home. Well, this is the only thing I can do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it's not safe, Janet, don't you be too strong?" Siegel brows They are all wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
