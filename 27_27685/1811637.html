			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know in the cave. After a few days, Siegel was finally ready. He painted complex magic patterns on the ground and top walls of the cave, and used the "magic crystal" instead of the gem as a spell node. Chanem curiously observed the magic crystal nucleus, saw the energy stored in the element, estimated its elemental concentration, and then surprised to find that it was far more than any energy gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's take a look, don't mess, one less will affect the effect of the entire magic array." Siegel sees the corner of his eye Chanem’s movements, his mind understood his thoughts, and said: “Every one is precious, not so easy to make up.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did you find the gemstone crystal? How have I never seen it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not in this world." Siegel misled him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not only the magician who uses high elemental concentrations, but many warriors and assassins can also play its role. High elemental concentrations can reduce the body's fatigue and enhance the ability of spell-like abilities. Snake lizard breath, blue-footed dragon snake lightning, etc. can also become stronger with the help of magic crystal nucleus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem quickly calculated that using the magic crystal nucleus could even improve the effect of destroying the cut and attaching it to the magic defense array. Penetration ability. He looked at Siegel's endless means, guessing what kind of cards he had and trying to improve his estimate of his strength. He secretly glad that Siegel did not bring the secret nuclear and magic spaceships around, otherwise the difficulty of defeating him will continue to increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array was arranged for three days, and then Siegel summoned Elemental Guardian protection and fell to sleep. Chanem appreciated the mage's efficiency while observing the entire squad. He understands why Siegel needs rest now. If he is, he will also recharge his batteries before applying complex large spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Siegel woke up, he had a good meal and armed his stomach with the secret food of the city, which was kept in the space bag, and then The sun is basking outside the cave to relax the body muscles. This is back to prepare for casting. Chanem has no more intolerance. At this time, he can't say anything. He can only follow him like a waiter. Maybe learning magic is also a good choice. Chanem has such an idea. He began to plan the next move. Especially how to deal with Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, Siegel also combs the next possible situation in his mind, and prepares himself as much as possible. Then he began to oscillate the power of the elements and let the entire magic array work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic array is not a positioning array. It is used by others. What is really used for positioning has always been the ring of the ring worn by his hand. Through the study of the fire, Siegel has mastered some of the characteristics of the fire, so that he can use his own understanding to describe such things. The Lord of the Rings magnified his understanding and began looking for additional fires in the entire crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the god of clay, the wall of the thunder wall also hides the flames of two low-level gods, but that is not the goal of Siegel. He is firmly staring at a faint energy response, a weaker signal than the Holy One. There is a wave in this signal that familiarizes Siegel, which is the fluctuation of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blocking out other results, Siegel concentrates and locks his attention. Through a thousand miles. The power of the octagonal scorpion contained in the Lord of the Rings began to exert its effects, gradually blending with the rules of the hidden fire. In this process, Siegel only needs to stay focused and continue to advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kungfu pays off, with the help of the power of the octagonal scorpion, Siegel finally unveiled the veil that enveloped the outer layer of this weak force. He saw a thirteen forked divine flower, although a little less than the expected fourteen forks, but did not affect his determination that this is the power of the god of magic and knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quiet, remembers the place, and then puts his energy into the magic array. This is a summoning circle. It also has the effect of hiding and deceiving. When the mission progresses to this stage, it is actually threatened by Chanem. In order to save lives and achieve the desired goals, there are some things that need to be prepared. And can't be found by Chanem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law is full of high concentration of elemental power in order to confuse the audience, and the volatility of a stock that diverge outwards is disturbing his perception. Siegel swayed in time and space, stole for a while to complete the summoning and hiding, and Chanet was not found at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you be sure?" Chanem asked without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing is believing. I don’t want to waste time with you." Siegel crouched down and began to clean up the magic crystal nucleus on the ground, cleaning up the magical array. . It was not useful for Chanem to know that he was in a hurry, but he had to wait slowly. Fortunately, Siegel quickly completed the preparations for the departure, opened the transmission, and directly torn the space barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a northern port called Blackwater Bay, trapped in bad weather and threats from orcs, the starry kingdom stops here, but has kept this stronghold. The Heishui River flows from the northwest, engulfs the black soil of the frozen soil swamps and deep forests, and meets the black reefs in the sea, inspiring numerous waves and raising the tough northern man. The people here face the orcs on the land and the Naga on the sea. They are also well versed in land warfare and water warfare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the New World has emerged, and the whole world’s eyes are on the West, so this area in the northeast corner of the East Continent has become a forgotten corner. A large number of ships and crew left, resulting in a decline in the number of young people in the port. When the orcs came in, the only old castles with a long history were preserved, and the determination to fight for the end for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black waters of the bay are turbulent and turbid. The orc's warships are moving forward with full tide, and the enhanced horns are extremely embarrassing. With the wind, the full-loaded ship aimed at the steel water gate of Blackwater Port. If it could be broken there, the orcs could open a passage and rush into the castle from the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a battle drum, the rumbling warfare crosses the sea, and the sound of shouting is deafening. But the moment before the battleship hit the steel water gate, everything suddenly quieted down. Then there was a huge roar of earaches and tight teeth. Some people near the water gate screamed, rubbing their ears with blood, and fell on the wall from the onions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge crack on the steel water gate, but the door was still there and could still block the ship afterwards. The rushing ship was blown into pieces by a huge impact, leaving only the keel inserted into the door like a javelin. The orcs are not discouraged, they have more rushing ships; the human garrison of the starry kingdom has no time to smug, and there are countless difficulties in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Chanem stand on a cliff on the west side of the castle, looking far away from the city besieged by the orcs. "What are you doing here? Don't you find something in the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. At this distance, he can already use the magic ring to feel the existence of magic and prophecy, just below the Blackwater Port. He did not expect that he would actually come to a battlefield, and the transmission was almost affected by the orc priest's spell, throwing two people into the void. However, with superb control, Siegel still reached his destination, and the orc priest mistakenly thought that the means of interfering with transmission was effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not an ordinary orc army. I have seen the five priest flags, each representing an orc priest." Chanem is using his nose. Sniffing in the air, I don't know how he distinguishes information from countless blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, are you sure here? Why is the saint of the orc god also in this place?" Chanem turned abruptly, glaring at Siegel Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have asked me dozens of times, I will tell you again, it is indeed here - I can say this to you with such confidence. People, there is only one in the world." Siegel looked at Channheim: "You are not the saint of the murder god, can a battle scare you?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deaths I have seen are more than the ones you have seen. Killing has never worried me." Chanem took a deep breath and slowly spit it out, then "But the orc's saint is indeed a headache. It is a madman who has no brain at all and only acts on impulse. When he appears here, the black water port will inevitably be attacked. A looting is inevitable. Everything will be destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at a few binoculars, Siegel felt a little strange: "When are you concerned about the harbor? The human inhabitants are coming? Is the murder god not treated equally for all races?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are not "Zanem said: "Seeing the situation in front of you, your character will definitely intervene. As a teacher, you do have the ability to change the situation, but this will be exposed. The Lear guy must have been Concerned about the situation here, as soon as you appear, he will understand. Do you think I am worried about the lives of these people? I am just considering the success of the mission!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
