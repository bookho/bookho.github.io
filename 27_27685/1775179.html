			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf ** teacher Ricapa passed away after the transfer, Capricorn really relaxed, gradually changed back to the "original shape", a face relaxed and happy Look like. She checked her hands and feet and decided to change her claws back into white and shiny fingers. Then she said to Siegel with her head: "Oh, hate the ghosts. The mission is completed, I am going to find Janet sister to play." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Capricorn." Siegel said very solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon girl waved her hand and said that she didn’t care. Then she jumped down the tower and drawn an arc in a fluttering manner. The hands flew into the courtyard opposite the skirt. window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virtual shadow of Edith is still there, when he is surrounded by no one, he said: "I will go to the elves during this time, you don't have to worry that they will come. Mystery City harasses you. The Master's Defence Staff is a symbol of identity. You are the focus of the association's casters and will not let the elves deceive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The original staff still has this meaning." Siegel smiled. "You can say it earlier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis said: " If the holder does not encounter the rude oppression of other casters, he will never know this information. Regarding the spells of the common association, the wizard association will cooperate with the elves conditionally, and you better stay out of it. If the elf asks, You said that you provided the basic information and did not participate in the later research." The half-elf's expression is very serious and solemn, it seems that this matter is very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the association has already made plans, but I don’t know if it’s going to be more common, or to kill more elves. This kind of interest is not obtained, and the risk is big, it is still better to touch, so Siegel nodded and promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom disappeared, and only Siegel was left on the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned back and found himself wrong. Maggot remained in a state of shock, stiffly lying on his back to the stairs down the tower, like an ice statue. His eyes have been staring at the sun, but his eyelids have not been able to fit, and he has become red and swollen. Tears are full of faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah! Forgot your poor child!" Siegel rushed forward and cast a spell to dispel magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggot’s eyes are already blurred, nothing can be seen clearly, only the light and dark can be distinguished. He knows that the mentor is there. So even if the pain does not dare to yell. After drinking the therapeutic potion, the burning pain gradually disappeared, but the vision was still unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A day off, go downstairs and ask the servant to send you back." Siegel patted his shoulder and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of the wizard wizard unleashed the doubts in Siegel’s heart. The red light curtain on the horizon may only be the result of the red minaret opening the array. Although it is different from Knox, but Siegel still admire their progress in spells and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the Wraith and the Magical Array will contain the power of the Elf Spellcaster, so now is a good opportunity to strike against their regular units. If the Banshan Commercial Road and the City Wall Mountain Tunnel are the first steps, then the time for the second step is now reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak and Janis came to the front of Siegel, and they looked at each other with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, can you start the action?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, through the secret The channel starts to ship from east to west.” Siegel said: “Remember. From east to west, from south to north, pay attention to controlling the quantity. Let the elves go to their heads!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing they are talking about is the complete set of plasma. This kind of weapon has obvious killing effect on the war tree, and it can also make the human shooter recover some disadvantages when facing the elf ranger and the warrior. If you cooperate with the cavalry, it will change the current situation of war to a certain extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this weapon also has shortcomings, and spells such as protective arrows and wind walls have a great impact on it. In order to save costs, Sui Ya can only be regarded as a refined alchemy instrument, not a magic weapon of real significance (ammunic 匣 is a magical equipment), so the effect is very poor when penetrating the magic barrier. In addition to surprises, the weapon can only be fully utilized when it is not protected by the spellcaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pay attention to the order and quantity of shipments. It is to make people think that these things are produced by the Masters Federation, but if there are rumors that these are manufactured by Heim, they do not have to be corrected, but they are not admitted." Er Dao said: "We are the big gold lords in the South after all, so it is natural to buy some on the plain side, but be careful to be sure that others have a record."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fitzak hearted the gods. Janis smiled and claped: "These elves can be awkward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can take advantage of this opportunity. Just pick up those businessmen." "Siegel thinks farther: "The hub of the town, the town of Ximu, the city of deep water. After the end of the war, these places need a long period of rest to recover. It is the time when the caravans and chambers of commerce re-divided the power. Although there are many, gold cannot be eaten as a meal, and it depends on business to become something of real value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I try my best." Janis said: "Most of the businessmen are very smart. I almost vaguely know the source of the smuggled goods, but there is no break. I will try to find those who have good reputation and build a stronger relationship."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fazak, the ghosts and swamps of the wilderness continue to go, send people to the east of the original swamp, find the right place." Siegel said: "The original coastline may be There is a port suitable for unloading, but the relationship cannot be straight because of the swamp. Entering the west to the mainland, only to the north along the coastline, the result is to the vicinity of Ximu Town, which has increased the cost without any reason. It is because of this that the prosperity of Ximu Town has disappeared. Now the swamp disappears, Ximu Town, Hubburg to the Mo Pulling the cloak of the cloak avenues in a row, there is no way to pass. If we can find such a place by the sea, with the power of the elemental rune guard, we may not have our own port."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak laughed silently, his eyes narrowed into a seam. Janis thought for a while before he understood it, and then shocked his mouth. It turned out that this was Siegel’s plan to use this war to build a huge territory, connecting the sea and the walled mountains from east to west, and then jumping out of the city wall through the mountain tunnel. With the advantages of magic, economy, equipment and soldiers, Siegel will control this narrow area, whether it is north or south, can gradually expand into a strong territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you follow the area. This has long been a range that the Baron title can control. Even the veteran duke of the starry kingdom, few people can have such a territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak and Janis are thrilled, this is a great opportunity! Heim took the five lords out, but only Moore had the field - the other people's territory was temporarily occupied by the elves. But in the near future. There will be a large amount of land and castles to be sealed. Even those who do not have combat power such as Fitzk and Janis may become masters of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elf must be defeated! We will win!" said Janis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knox is the same, must be defeated!" Fitzak knows more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and understood the reasons for their excitement. "I want to accomplish the final goal. There are still steps 3 and 4. So don't be too happy, or be careful to complete the task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem!" Two people knocked on the chest with their fists and promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, let's go, let Mana and Mike come." Siegel will put the magic key of the plasma storage room. Give it to Fazak and let them back. He doesn't worry about anything too specific, and he can do it well. As a lord, he can't handle everything personally, and he must focus on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game is placed by the elves, and when they come up, they occupy the right place and the right place. Siegel is so entangled. Dragging the chess pieces outside the board, and disguising yourself as an elf alliance, stealing the advantages of the land. Whether this is a conspiracy or a conspiracy, the board can only be adjusted, and the final victory still needs to be really killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf is very strong, so be weak and let Knox see the hope of winning. Only when they are hard-hitting, forces like Siegel have a chance to live. The gray clouds and the red light of the sky have already appeared, and the common meeting has already made the elves suffer a big loss. Although Ricapa seems to be very urgent, I believe that the elves will definitely find a way to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am an elf..." Siegel fingers crossed. Supporting the chin, sinking. "The elves are well equipped, martial arts are strong, and the casters account for a high proportion, but their total population is not high, in other words, they can't afford to die. They won't take the most cost-consuming nail-raising tactics. They can only choose to do their best. The key battle of the first battle. There is only one place in the whole continent worthy of their shot, it is the deep water city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
