"Go and take a break first, no matter what you have to wait. If you don't listen well, I still have to tell you that it is very difficult to clean up the charges for Janet."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said to the jazz: "I understand, I will work hard. But now there is a problem, where can I take a break?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me." Sir Bill led the way in front and took everyone to the corner of the castle. There was a sentry tower, and one of the guarded rooms was still empty. Although there is no window to block the cold wind, there is a huge iron brazier in the center of the house, and there is a large bag of charcoal in the corner. Ignition and heating is a breeze for Master Siegel, so the room is quickly filled with comfortable heat. Standing on the edge of the brazier to warm your hands, drying clothes that have been wet because of climbing snow mountains, you can also take off your boots and bake them. Janet felt warm and woke up from a coma. Her long eyelashes shook slightly and looked up to speak to Siegel. However, the Master touched the girl's forehead and said, "You rest first, I won't go, everything will wait until you wake up and say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, He casts a spell and lets the power of sleep envelope the kitten. Sir Bill took the sleeping bag from the warehouse, so Siegel gently plunged Janet into it. He made sure that people in his sleep would not wake up easily, and then asked the jazz about the passing of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Cooper Pastor concealed the situation." Siegel immediately grasped the point when he heard the whole thing. "He wants things to go in the direction of the Temple of the Morning, but it is not the direction of justice. The information obtained by using God to detect lies is often inconsistent with the facts, which is why the Master rarely uses this spell. So I am not worried about the trial. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill said: "If it happened after you met Janet, I am not too worried. But how do you know that Janet is meeting you?" What have I done before? She can change countless shapes. If I am a spy head, I will never let go of such a power. You are now a baron, young and powerful. It is easy to find a woman, so don’t be dragged down by her. You know that this has nothing to do with Janet's magical lineage, just rational thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wants to laugh, but he knows this is too rude. "Thank you for your advice. Sir, I will take good care of it. I have no intention of playing against the royal family now. I will cooperate with them if the situation is right, but only if Janet must be here."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are thinking about her." Sir Bill snorted. To express your opinion. He thought about it and thought that the boy who grew up should decide the matter himself, and he should accept the lesson himself, so he would not persuade him. "Have a good rest. There are so many things happening on this day. I have to go to the count to see. If there is any situation, I still have to talk to the Earl and the Prince, after all, the Temple of the Morning Temple must respect the opinions of the royal family and the spokesperson. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he got up and left, and took the giant Kerry together. After the original owner of the Black Blood Castle became a prisoner, Kerry was here for the first time. The contempt and deception that had been received were gone, and the welcoming welcoming of Sir Bill was also welcome. Kerry wanted to get benefits for his Jackdaw tribe, and he just took the opportunity to ask Sir Bill to help him communicate and see if he could find something good from the castle warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room left Siegel and Janet, but they were motionless like sculptures. The red flame in the iron pot burned all the time, casting two still shadows on the wall. Siegel guards Janet's sleep. The mind is counting the checks and balances between the morning sun, the stars and the three towers. The sun rose to the top of the tower, then slowly fell, and finally came in from the window in the west, just to cast the light on Janet's face. The kitten's eyelids shook and woke up with a nervous expression. After seeing Siegel, he let go of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know you will appear and save me." Janet said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just wandered around for a big lap to come back to find you, but I rushed back in time." Siegel replied: "You have suffered." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am just..." Janet bit her lip, but said without hesitation: "I am only paying for the past." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next. Janet tells about her becoming a spy, and Siegel listens quietly to the side. She did not talk about the bleak days before training, but he could imagine how miserable it was to be a discriminating demon. "After becoming a sergeant's spy, I slowly mastered the ability to control the transformation. This is a good day. I can wear beautiful clothes and eat fine food like the nobility. If I want, hook your fingers. There will be a long list of knights fighting for me to serve me. I clearly understand that those are illusions based on deception, so there is no sense of security, but I can only lie like that. Then I started to promise The Commonwealth will serve because they become the actual controllers of the guild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet, do you believe that I will help you, no matter where you are?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe. But I am afraid that you will get into trouble and put yourself in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help you even if you don't tell me, isn't it? More information will avoid more trouble." Siegel smiled and encouraged her to say, "As long as you still believe me, Even if I am across the world, I will come to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember, even across the world." Jenny nodded: "Then I will Tell you about the world of Knox Association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet’s news is not comprehensive, but for Siegel It is very useful, especially if the joint will be merged into the Masters Federation, then the conflict between Siegel and them will be resolved sooner or later. According to Janet, the Commonwealth accepts instructions from a "Red Master" who has never seen anyone. The specific work is arranged by two divisions. The matters involved in dealing with the outside world are all led by Casper, but Janet does not know who is responsible for the name of the actor who is responsible for it. "She" has always remained very mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have a plan in the New World, specifically what can't be found, but the land in a specific location is all populated." Janet said. "They systematically acquired ownership of these places on the New World. I also helped them find the mistakes and omissions on the hub of the Fortress. Maybe they have already started, and the Viscount Priest will soon lose the land and the castle. That was the first time I met you, I turned into a boy. It’s called a little finger, do you still have an impression?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nod Laughing and said: "Don't be a boy again, or a girl is more beautiful." He held out his hands and held Janet's cheek. Gently squeezed. She finally said that she believed that Siegel could understand and forgive this matter, and Siegel was more understanding and gratified. "And, tell me everything, about all the information of the Knox Association. Don't hide. I am somewhat hostile to them, knowing more to be targeted."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling warmth and encouragement from the squid, Janet continued to talk. In the end, she talked about the lurking around the prophet, Lear. "So Knox will know that when the prince is coming to the New World, there is an important box of prophecy that can only be opened in the New World. Count Todd I am afraid I recognized that I am coming, so I asked this question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet," Siegel sighed, "Give me everything." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time. Janet didn't say anything, just resting quietly on Siegel's shoulders until Tianyang fell. At this time, the two people's stomachs made a squeaky voice. It seems that the simple feelings are not enough to overcome the physiological needs. The two men smiled and stood up and supported each other, moving their hands and feet, and then walked down the tower in tandem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most nobles have already finished eating before dark, so you can avoid "excessive" cold damage. There aren't many things left in the cafeteria, but you can still have two bowls of stew. Siegel carefully examined the ingredients in the soup and cast a few spells. Then I gave it to Janet. This made the kitten very nervous, and she kept looking around, as if the killer was hidden behind the pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer did not appear, and an uninvited guest came over. Pastor Cooper seems to have waited for Siegel. Or at least scheduled for monitoring. Who knows how many pairs in this castle belong to the eyes of the morning church? The priest was wearing a loose white silk gown in the evening and carrying an incense burner in his hand, so he walked all the way, accompanied by a strong fragrance. Pastor Cooper walked straight to Siegel and smiled. The tone of speech was hard to deny: "Can I sit here and talk to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Janet nervously stretched out. Going in the direction of Siegel. The mage took a sip of soup and poured the rest to the kitten. "You have suffered recently, and it is good to eat more." He wiped his mouth and cast a spell to clean the traces on his clothes, then reached out to tell Cooper Pastor: "Please sit down, Mr. Pastor."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s great to see you get together again." Pastor Cooper swept the stool and sat down slowly. When he spoke, the smile seemed very sincere. "But I have to admit that when you appeared, it really scared us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was in a hurry. Siegel replied: "But I will compensate for the money that smashed the door. But I never thought about who I should pay. The Viscount Braver-Slink is now in the dungeon of his castle, give him Gold coins are useless. I don't know if he will be willing to convert gold coins into meat and spirits, at least to help him through the long time - if you can get the permission of the paladin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Siegel nodded seriously. "I used to do the wrong thing. Whether it is the old captain or Sir Bill, I will get a lesson immediately. This will help my growth. You see, in this kind of Under the supervision, can I not become a mage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admire this." Pastor Cooper said: "As far as I know The last person who had both the Master and the Jazz title was still more than two hundred years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man caused a rebellion and then hid In the tower of the Masters Association, I was imprisoned. Siegel knows this. "It's a pity that neither the jazz nor the mage is a matter of the jurisdiction of the Temple of Dawn. So, if you have anything to say, let's just say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I mean, everything must be considered for the safety of His Royal Highness, isn't it? Black Blood Castle is not a long-lasting place after all. And the New World has only a long-distance transmission of the law, only the Masters Federation. What do you have for this thing? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that most of your energy was spent on trial." Siegel said: "In fact, I can help you save some Energy. As long as half an hour, I can help you to hear the results that are completely different from the last time. What do you think of this proposal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Oh, don't bother, as long as Janet is still under your management. Why should we go beyond the power? Then, can you guarantee her behavior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Can." Siegel replied categorically: "What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless God has a will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That. You are busy with yours, and the transmission of the statute is not in my possession." Siegel said: "I can only tell you, act as soon as possible, and don't make any more mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, then I will leave." Pastor Perg got up and gave a gesture of blessing to Siegel, then slowly walked away. Janet didn't take his eyes back until he left, turning to look at Siegel: "So, I'm fine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage nodded: "For the time being, it's okay. As for the Count of Todd, I have a way to deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really amazing." Janet praised: "That But the bishop of the bishop, you have been persuaded in a few words. I have only seen such an imposing manner from several great aristocrats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Shaking his head, the tone eased, more in line with his current age: "Although you praise me. But I also have self-knowledge. Less than a year ago, I was still an ordinary sailor. How can I really have any momentum now? I only However, because of the situation, the identity of the clerk is cheaper. You think, if the Mage Federation sends a Master who is proficient in transmission to help, then the Temple of Dawn tells him what you are the devil? Even after the Prince left here, How about they restarting the trial? My spell ability is not enough. Resist those pastors, at least not yet. The safest time is actually now, before the Mage Federation opens the transmission array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will leave at this time. You can come up, there is a way to go. Your spells plus my easy-to-capacity. No matter whether it is an orc or a human being, you will not find it." Janet said, "Let's go through the original plan and go to the Knox Association to find out." How about the treasure?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and said: “It’s not difficult to leave here. But I can’t take everyone away: Kerry, Evan Sir Bill, these people who helped me or helped you. I am sure that Evan and Sir Bill will not leave, how can I throw them down? Whether it is from the threat of nearby orcs, or because they left because of our departure Being angered, this is what I don't want to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet pouted and frowned. Hands patted on the inside of the thigh, but I couldn't think of any good ideas. She is used to acting alone, and all ways of thinking are also in this direction, so I can't think of what Sigel is worried about. But she is not angry, because Siegel can care about others, naturally will care more about Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was thinking this way, her hand suddenly came with severe pain, from the fingertips of her left hand to the wrists, like being grilled in a brazier. . Muscles, nerves, and bones all lost control. Janet screamed, her arms stretched straight under the table, and her head slammed into the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
