			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While launching the offensive in Deepwater City, the elves did not forget to use spells to pass information to other units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ximu Town, Hubburg, these two places with red mage towers, immediately after knowing what happened in Deepwater City, began to organize the siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was still hiding among the refugees at this time and could not find a way to leave. After he left, the Red Magic Tower opened the detection circle and shrouded the entire city. If Siegel uses teleportation, then he will be discovered, and all the disguise and painstaking effort will be wasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Janet is here, she can use the thieves' camouflage and stealth to find the loopholes of the guard patrol out of the city, but Siegel does not have such technical ability. He stumbled and walked along the city wall, covering the eyes of the four observations with a tattered straw hat that was handcuffed to avoid doubt. He saw the guards of the defending city running, more people coming out of the barracks, panicking and wearing armor, and then holding weapons - mostly spears and iron shields - gathered in the playground. The chief of the Tuen Mun Gate is training and yelling at the slow-moving recruits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only if you seem to have strength, you can have power! So give me a straight chest and raise your head!" The officer's spit star sprayed in front of a thin recruit. On the face, he seems to be crying. "Get your weapons, the elf's body is not strong, just hang a hole and die - it is better than the orcs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not The law tells them the truth: how difficult it is to hit the elf. These soldiers were sent to the wall and were responsible for protecting the comrades who could shoot arrows with their shields. "Hold up the shield!" the officer of the big slammed the door and shouted: "Until you die, you can let go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldierâ€™s move made the people see it, everyone asked each other "Is the enemy going to attack?" Some people are praying, some are trying to hide, and some are already numb. At this time, the alarm bell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old war tree took a long leg and walked in front of the Elf battlefield. Beside them are all kinds of beasts - this is the druid and their animal partners. The falcon flies in the sky, and the defense of the city wall is unobstructed; the tiger crouched on the old tree, sheltered the arrow rain that may be faced by the canopy, and prepared to hit the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the ancient tree is the Elf Master, who both use their own spells to avoid accidents on the battlefield. They formed a joint team of 20 people. Responsible for hitting the wall with long-range spells. Or destroy the obstacles or destroy the defenders above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Master is the pastor of the Temple of the Moon. They wore beautiful breastplates, holding the holy emblem in one hand and the long sword in one hand. Through the spells, they learned the lessons of Deepwater City. Made the corresponding preparations. The priests screamed the name of God and brought confidence and strength to all the soldiers. And if anyone is injured, their location can be guaranteed to provide timely treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that is the Elf Warrior and Ranger. They are both proficient in both remote and melee techniques, but with different focuses. The Elf Warrior uses a long sword and a crescent moon shield that is edged. In addition to the threat of the right-handed blade, they can also use the left-handed Crescent Shield as the second weapon. Look for opportunities to cut your opponent's thighs and throat. The Ranger uses the longbow, both for alertness and for providing long-range strike capability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defenders of Chengtou looked nervous in the hearts of huge ancient trees, but long-term training kept them in their posts. The Qila lord of the hub has always had contradictions with the elves, so he has been training the soldiers, especially how to deal with the elves. Although he is no longer there, the trained officers were still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The trees are coming, put the brazier on!" Sir Stephens, known as the "Taiwanese Ear", is in charge of the city's command. He had received the command of Lord Chila and sneaked into the Elven Forest, but the discovered Elf Ranger shot two ears. Because he couldn't hear anything, he spoke louder and louder. I can hear it through half a castle. The work of the wall conductor is very suitable for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out his long sword and let the swaying anti-light shine on every soldier's face. "All give me the spirit. The elf has no siege weapons except the tree. So I dare to attack the hub. Prepare the fire oil and turn the slinger!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to keep the whole team from getting out of touch, the trees are moving at a slow pace, and as a result they are the best targets. The winch of the trebuchet makes a squeaking noise, and the slamming tank with the cotton thread is already in the slinger basket. As Sir Stephens slammed the sword down, the slinger craftsman hammered the organ with a sledgehammer and the winch was disengaged. The power of savings broke out in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Druid immediately summoned the water element to start the fire. The fire protection capabilities of war trees have also withstood the test. The fire was quickly controlled, and the elves' trees continued to move long legs without urgency and shorten the distance from the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hub is not discouraged, the trebuchet continues to work, and the sound of shouting, whistling and winking is mixed. The fire cans exploded everywhere, and the burning fire was one by one. Connected to a red fire wall on the battlefield. The ancient trees of war have finally slowed down, not because they are injured, but because they need to extinguish the fire, so that the comrades around can continue to follow up. If the team is out of touch, it is neither safe nor loses most of its combat effectiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down from the wall, the scene seemed very spectacular, the elf was suppressed, and the speed slowed down. But the experienced warrior generals found that the situation was not good: except for some beasts that were hit by cupping, the elves themselves did not lose much in the offense. In this way, does the elf come to the city almost in perfect condition? The city wall will face direct attacks. Can it rely on bows and arrows to fight against huge war trees? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of combat opportunity elf will not give. Their mages stopped by brushing and raised their wands together. Between the fireballs, like a wave, the sea is flying towards the wall, the red fire light illuminates everything, and the guardian officer has to shout: "Your Majesty! Hurry up and avoid!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for the roaring bang and the hot temperature, but after a while the two did not happen. He opened his eyes and remained in a lying position, slowly raising his head and seeing an unforgettable scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tower of the Tower of the Fortress began to operate, and the white light of one another came out from the top of the red tower, accurately hitting the fireball flying over. The originally condensed fire elemental power dissipates under the action of light and turns into free heat in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw this scene and recognized that it was the light that formed the magic spell. Under the blessing of the power of the magic tower, the range of the magic is removed and the effect is better. Whether it is fireball, lightning or sour arrow, it may be countered by this magic, broken down into the most basic elemental energy, unable to achieve the original effect of the spell. In the end, there are only a few fish that can reach the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few sieges and defending wars in which the Master participates, especially in the last hundred years, only the Great River Battle Masters Federation fights the orcs, the magic knot of the Three Peaks Tower The only time the defending of Deepwater City. As for Heim's collar, the two "one-day wars" that Siegel participated in can only be regarded as a single mage's caster performance, and it is far from being a spell war. It cannot be added to statistics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the war of magic confrontation, the role of the Master Tower is extremely important. The original design of the Magic Tower is for defense, on the one hand to protect the Master inside, and on the other hand to guard the castle. Second is a limited offense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the school city, there is also a separation from the Masters Association, that is, when the temple has not yet entered the core of the human imperial power, each big lord relies on the Master Tower. To assist the defense. In order to be a great lord and survive the war of the Lord, mankind devoted a great deal of energy to the role of the Master Tower in the war. Many practical magic arrays were created at that time, such as the magic ray array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other races rarely build magic towers. The elf has always regarded magic as part of art, singing it, modifying it, but progressing slowly in magical architecture. The dwarves lacked the Master, but their rune techniques made up for this shortcoming, and even the traveler William was defeated before the door of the fine gold rune of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As humans donâ€™t understand the magic tree of the elves, the elves know very little about the Human Master Tower. Elf Master constantly changes spells, but the elemental energy that comes from the air, whether it is ice, acid, lightning or flame, is hard to get close to the city wall. Even if there are one or two fish that slip through the net, it can't affect the strong hub. Human trebuchets are still in operation, and some slingers have risked cutting the length of the cotton on the smoldering tanks, causing them to explode in the air. The fire and rain have fallen, and the coverage has suddenly increased. The elf forces began to appear damaged, so the druids and war ancient trees were separated from the front line, and suddenly began to accelerate, leaving the mage and pastor busy to extinguish the surrounding flames and treat those injured comrades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the Elf Warrior and Ranger rushed out from the back and rushed to the front with the cover of the war tree. Since the power of the spell will be disturbed by the magic tower, then only the weapon in your hand. The elf is still strong enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me all the best!" Sir Stephensâ€™s voice began to reverberate on the wall, more than the footsteps of the war tree and the screams of the beasts. Clear. "Itâ€™s time to fight hard! Remember that behind you is the hub, where your parents, wives and children live! The elves trample on the farmland, destroy the crops, and now want to trample your family! They are If you don't give us a way to live, the only way to survive is to kill them! We have more people, and the two are made by us. We can't live without it! The lord is not only ready to bounty, but also to kill the enemy. The most warriors in the castle prepared a room for his family, safe and comfortable. If you want to reward, use the elf's head to change!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
