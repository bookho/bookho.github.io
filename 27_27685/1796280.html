			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the father died, I didn't meet my brother well." Aaron stood in the lounge chair and said with a sigh of relief: "I am sick." I was either drunk, and I was really unbearable when I was there. Later, because of various things, I couldn’t find a suitable opportunity to meet. Once I thought I could not hold the meeting of the Dwarf King, but it seems that I am still lucky. Yes, I can finally get what I want today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan looked at Aaron and shook his head. "You look very miserable, brother. I It's hard to imagine what kind of gesture you put on the crown, put on the Chinese costume, and sit on the throne. Tell me, dear brother, in the history of the starry kingdom, did you have a brother who was king and his brother was driven out of the palace? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, brother, and more than once. Although you are good at swordsmanship, you are slightly less interested in reading." Aaron blinked. Lazily shrugged. "But I also know that those people's end, without exception, were overthrown by the loyal ministers who supported the brothers, or died in the dungeons, or were thrown away under the wall. What do you want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan squinted at the school town, Lear, and then smiled and said to Aaron: "You have a good history teacher, but the study is not useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I think I have learned very well." Aaron said: "I know a lot of things, such as your current place of residence is Silver Spring City, on the east side of the castle. On the third floor, there is a large window with a view of the sunrise and a rear window that can enjoy the sunset. Your fireplace is filled with good pine wood, because you like to hear the sound of cricket. Every afternoon you You will practice the sword at the lake. When you return to the room, you will drink a glass of juice mixed with apples and pears. Count Conte puts his two daughters in your house, and you let them go to wash. Clothes. Viscount Burton may have misunderstood, his handsome, handsome brother Do you want to be your bodyguard? You really didn't leave a face, excuses to interrupt his nose. I admire you in this respect, but I am good at other things: you have many friends, but many of them are My friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan once again examines Lear's face, this time there is no smile. "Thank you for your concern for my life, my brother. Unfortunately, I care too little about you. You are jealous. I don't even know when you stop drinking, but also remind me after my friend meets."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel is a lord with merit, you are lucky to have such a friend, but he is not my enemy. Many times it is impossible to distinguish so clearly. Unless... Aaron paused and said, "Brother, are these two enemies now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan didn't hesitate, shook his head:" No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is great!" Aaron smiled, and the pale color on his face faded. The blush climbed up slightly. "As long as it is not an enemy, you don't have to meet with a knife, but you can sit down and talk! Brother, do you want to see the kingdom of the stars in the torment of war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not the meaning of me alone." Avon pointed to the surrounding and said to Aaron: "Look, learn the city, the temple, the court, the guard, all obey your orders, from your sick The sound from the body can be more powerful than my sword. It is not you, but me, who is chased by the assassin and escapes the stars in the night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assassin There is such a thing?” Aaron frowned. “I have not made such an order.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan waved his hand. I interrupted Aaron’s words: "I was very sad at first, I thought it was your order. But now I have seen more people, and gradually understand what people mean when they are interested, so I am willing to believe that it is not what you mean. But then again, there is still a big question about whether you think that the friends you can bring with you are really friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron listened With this, I smiled and nodded. This action made him suddenly cough up, caressing his chest and coughing hard. No one can think of a weak person who has such a great strength that he can shake his whole body. Let’s make a sound of it. The morning priest Aurora threw the mace to the guard, and then hurried forward to gently touch Aaron's back. He had words in his mouth, and his fingers pressed regularly, and Aaron was relieved. The cough gradually stabilized and became a rapid breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora stood up straight, returned to his original position, and then returned to the mace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan thought of the father's will that he had discovered unexpectedly, that is, the instrument sparked his own thoughts. When he calms down, he will think, if he doesn't know anything, isn't everything good? Aaron became a king, he was a free swordsman, or could be a "royal master", and not as romantic as it is? It is not that the will to remove his illegitimate child brings it all, and ambition is the most fundamental reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cannot be called ambition - ambition is a step from childhood to reality - this is ambition. The ambition that has been recognized, the ambition of becoming a king, and the ambition to achieve what he has never dreamed of. Aaron was preparing to become a king from an early age, but he only had swordsmanship and sudden ambitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed with tears in his eyes and shook his head: "You are well prepared, better than me," he choked and said: "What am I?" Nothing is prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron showed a bright smile of victory: "So, are you ready now?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, time solidified. Leer saw a completely different future from this episode, a possibility he had never seen before. The big net that the fate weaves is ready to come back again at this moment, and the river of time will flow in a new way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of destiny is the most unspeakable force in the world. It is the only force that can only be dissipated from the soul and entangles the soul to influence time and space. When the devastating storm occurs, all the power of destiny will be forced out, as fuel burns, like the shadow of the dead. All the original possibilities will be attributed to the destruction, and what is lost is the power of destiny. Nikes dominates the use of the soul of the soul to collect this power, used to form their own destiny in the void, so that the possibility of survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world alone, the destruction of the storm is prevented, the power of destiny appears, and the power that all gods can observe and play. Lehr cast a legendary spell. Based on his powerful mana and vast knowledge, he built a complex spell model in the anti-magic field. He has to twist time and space at the same time, he has to replace the current one with a future that he foresees and can control. If it is in the god of the original magic god, this is just a work that can be done with the mind. Now in the mortal world. He must rely on legendary spells to reluctantly reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell is called Replacement Reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this room, there is another person who can already feel the fluctuation of time. Siegel only felt that the skin was itchy, and the scene changed. He saw countless rooms, each with Aaron and Evan, but the others were different. He saw some in the room. Evan jumped up and killed Aaron; in some rooms, Aaron raised his finger and stuck the dagger into the back of Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still some rooms, although there is no bloody conflict, but the two are not happy, the starry kingdom is still a situation of dispute between the two factions. Among the countless real possibilities, only one person has not changed at all. No matter what the future, he stands still in the room like a zombie. Just like a spectator who is free from fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That person is Siegel himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lir’s voice is like the music of the church, full of arrogance, full of irresistible power. The shocks provoked by time and space blew his hair, and the magical energy filled his eyes made his eyes bright like the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element swiftly passed by Siegel and then concentrated in front of Lear, under his control into two transparent silver chains. One of the chains flew to Aaron and got into his chest; the other flew to another reality, Aaron, the Aaron who raised his finger. The chains gradually merged and the two Aarons slowly approached. The one that lifted his finger became clearer and brighter, and the reality began to become dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! I don't think about it!" Siegel yelled. Lear glanced at him. There was a disdainful smile on his face. What is the shock that can enter time and space, how many people in this world have the power to change their destiny? He is not a god. He does not even know what the kingdom of God is. How can he know the truth of multiple reality and distortion of reality? In addition to shouting a few dice. He can't move even a single hair. And when the spell ends, reality is the truth, and he can't remember what has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Siegel raised his arm and pointed his finger at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
