			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our opponents will be Knox Association." Siegel said: "They are now part of the Mage Federation, a lot Powerful casters. Their allies include grievances that can be possessed - this you have seen in the Black Blood Fortress, and there may be a powerful death knight."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death Knight?" Kerry's eyebrows immediately erected, slamming the table with his fist, and a crack of cold chilling from the table. "Is it the red dragon that burned the tribe of my tribe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Siegel said: "I am cracking on the edge of the territory." The valley encountered something similar, and later found the association between Knox and the death knight in the red magic tower of the hub. Kerry, the enemy is very powerful, and must not be taken lightly."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Siegel told the Giant about his struggle with the Death Knight. The weird magic runes made his armor indestructible, so far only wood, some spells and star dust can cause damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if there is a chance to launch a formation, use an archer to launch an endless attack, or use a catapult to strike, I believe that the death knight's armor can not withstand. The Knox Association can drive the grievances. This creature is especially suitable for the battlefield of chaos. The more people there are, the better they are. If you want to restrain the possession of the other person, you need enough the theft user. As long as you are prepared, whether it is a pastor who believes in the gods, a priest who worships the three spirits, or a druid who advocates nature, it can suppress the spirit of grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Knox Association’s Master will shoot and use the powerful elemental magical power to suppress the opponent’s elite caster. Therefore, from the battlefield structure, Knox will be more reasonable, the power that can be used is more powerful, and they will not see their shortcomings for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cloud of war is over our head, but it is not too imminent for the North." Siegel said to Kerry: "I estimate Knock The Commonwealth will first deal with the elves, or first hold the Masters Union in their hands. If they complete these two things, then in addition to the dwarves who have the Mora, all other souls who advocate freedom will be enslaved." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry stood up. Clenched his fists and cursed and said: "Go to fuck! A group of pretentious ghosts, I will let them pay the price! Siegel, Leah, don't be afraid. Our jackdaw tribe will definitely be with this evil bastard. Fight to the end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s okay to go to fuck, but you can’t die in vain.” Siegel also stood up and patted the giant’s shoulder, right He said: "I have been studying how to offset the enemy's advantage. If we can safely guard against the grievances, then we can take advantage of the number. Even the Master. In the face of the army, only Escape, unable to fight back and win. I believe that all races in the New World will not be willing to be ruled by organizations like the Knox Association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't he pay attention to him? First, engage him once?" Kerry pinched his fist, and the ice continued to emerge from the back of his hand, and then was crushed into pieces. He pointed to the East and said to Siegel: "As long as you ride for fifteen days, you can reach Deepwater City. Let's catch a few Knox mages, take a meal, and bring it back. By then. What do you want? How to study the research!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves cover their mouths and laugh, and Siegel laughs. "Good brothers, there will be such an opportunity. But not now. Now we must make all the preparations, as much as possible to accumulate strength, and wait for the day when the mainland is suddenly changing. Advise them on friends and allies who can win. But if the Knox Association did not take the shot, we can't take the initiative to attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Kerry asked: "Look at him is not pleasing to the eye, 揍Doesn't he have a meal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless you sneak a slap on him, don't let anyone know." Siegel said: "Although it's hard, But as a mage, it is not something that can't be done. But you think, there is no sense of accomplishment in sneaking. Instead of spending that time, it is better to sharpen our knives and then squat on their stomachs!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you are right." Kerry pinched his chin. Imagine the picture of the blade stirring in the enemy's belly. "As long as I can report the killing of the father, how do you say, how do you do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to the north to find allies, a special The power of the user. I have a hunch that if there is his help, everything will be much smoother. Besides, I want to study your land, it can suppress the role of magic, it is very amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Kerry took Siegel together on the hill and asked for the sacrifice of the tribe in the triangle tower. When the mage saw the situation, as he said, the blessings from the three spirits were not affected. It is still possible to operate Siegel in this area and continuously test the wizard's spells and dwarf runes, and try to use blood magic and promise. The spell of the Commonwealth of the Commonwealth found that as long as the spell effect leaves itself, it will not function properly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a big strategic advantage." Siegel said: "In this land, Knox's bald heads will be difficult to move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! I said that this is the land of blessings of the Three Spirits! You really found us a good place." Kerry stood on the hill. Clench your fists in front of you: "The tribes of the grasslands will gather together in this holy place to form a force that no one in the north can ignore. We will drive away all evil and let good people live a happy life."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also my wish!" Siegel said: "But don't forget, Knox will still be very strong, their threats are constantly approaching. In addition to preparing for the battle, you have to leave a path for your own people. If there is another dragon coming, what do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Kerry smiled and said to Siegel: "I have already thought of these. At our feet, there are continuous tunnels and fire tunnels, and there are women who can transfer." The passage. Fighting is a matter for our men, women and children can no longer be hurt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have this preparation, I am relieved." Er said: "I originally wanted to help you dig the channel, but now it seems that most of the power of magic has been suppressed. Besides being an incompetent soldier, I can't help too much. I will be at you. Stay here for ten days, measure the range of the prairie holy land, do a few related spell tests, and wait for my attendant by the way. Poor Moore was sent back to the city by me, and has not arrived yet."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to worry about this thing, I will let the brethren move. Send the cavalry to the grassland to help you find the attendant." Kerry said: "Come on, good brother, distinguished The elf lady, let us grasp the opportunity. First enjoy the unique food of the next jackdaw tribe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went back to the long house again, at this time the dishes have been Re-prepared, the wine is also brought out, just waiting for the guests to enjoy. Although they are under the danger of the Knox Association, they can still take a moment to squat at this moment. Enjoy the enthusiasm of your friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel eats very quickly, Kerry has just eaten and is not very hungry, and a lot of meat is obviously not the appetite of the elf. The servants withdrew their meals, leaving only the fine wine and dried fruit. Giant Kerry wants to use fruit to entertain the elves, but the fruit on the grasslands is rare. There is no in his menu, only the Black Wolf Princess saves some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misera pulled a plate of apples and pomegranates out of the back room and shared them with the elves. The little prince of the Jackdaw tribe is now sleeping well, so his mother can hear the most accurate news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said, when will Knox’s gang show his true face?" Mesera asked: "Is there any way for the Masters of the Masters to recognize?" Clear their true colors?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have thought about this problem." Siegel originally took out the pipe and thought of the children in the back room. The note smiled and the pipe was closed. This move undoubtedly increased the child's goodwill, at least for Siegel to win an Apple share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the current point of view, the Masters Union is difficult to be said." Siegel continued: "There is no actual evidence in my hands, everything is It’s my opinion and speculation. It’s hard to say that lion Alexander and collector William. Without the support of both of them, it’s impossible to defeat Casper’s division at this stage.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I will write a letter to alert them to prevent enemies from getting inside." Siegel finally said: "I have been thinking about how to word, in case this letter falls into Nok. The Union will give Heim a tie to threaten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missella nodded, she has more sensitive political thinking than Giant Kerry. It was quickly concluded from the conversations of several people. She said to Siegel: "Mr. Master, if the Knox Association started their evil plan, what do our Jackdaw tribes need to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is to fight evil!" The giant patted his thigh and said with a smile: "I can't miss the battle to help my brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
