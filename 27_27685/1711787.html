			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has read a lot of miscellaneous books, but all of them are short-lived and not deep, so it is difficult for him to synthesize all the clues. He wants to use the knowledge of architecture and dungeons to judge the design ideas here. He wants to find the secrets of the dwarf city from the historical records. He wants to infer the working principle of the cave from the rune language. He has a lot of ideas, but he doesn't have enough knowledge to accumulate. This anxiety has always afflicted him, making him more uncomfortable than others. Fortunately, Janet has been with him and comforted him, which has left him with enough patience. The dream is not as good as action. He said to himself that he can find any clues and be better than the pile of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told his plan to Sir Bill, and then used the prestige of the Jazz, and at the same time proceeded to allocate supplies according to the positive quota of work, and finally let the mercenaries lift The ass on the side of the brazier left the camp to patrol and bring back the news of the surrounding terrain. Based on the information returned from the feedback, Siegel added his own observations, and after five days, he plotted a map about the trend of mountains and rivers within 15 miles. Subsequently, Siegel went into the cave several times to explore and think day and night. He finally got the inspiration for the first snow fall in the fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This terrain map I have seen." Siegel said to Janet: "I have read a book "Jia Kun Travel Notes", there is a place The record is very similar to this. I didn't think of it at first, but when the black clouds were pressed in the first two days, I suddenly had an idea - if there was no landslide here, what would it be like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out the topographic map and sketched out the new lines on several cliffs, then explained: "Remember these two days I took you to various places to investigate? Itâ€™s all destroyed by landslides. When you refill these places, you will find that the hole is exactly the deepest and narrowest part of the surrounding mountains. The cliff where the Black Blood Castle is located is the entrance to the canyon, after one after another. The curved, fierce passage will just reach the camp. You can't remember the ladder left on the cliff? There is a road leading to the shelter of the high place. People in the past can concentrate their firepower here and form a net attack from all sides. !"<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the attack? It is already a city. If the enemy arrives here, the defense has already fallen." Janet asked inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon, here is used to attack the dragon." Siegel said excitedly: "The dwarf came to the walled mountains, but the dragon has already arrived. To conquer the mountains and want to build the Mola, there must be a lot of battles here. No one except the dwarves has a record of that period, but I believe this is one of the battlefields." Siegel pulled Janet Hand, take her outside the house, pointing to the only remaining building here: "The round roof is very rare in dwarf buildings, but it is very effective for avoiding dragons. The different columns here are not decorations, but interference. The obstacles that the dragons plundered. Although I still don't understand what they used to lure the dragon and how to prevent the dragon from leaving, it is indeed a fortress to kill the dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, here is the trap to kill the dragon, but what is the use of this?" Janet asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Jia Kun's Travels" mentioned - the book was stolen, so I don't have it at hand, but I mostly remember it in my head. The book mentions the treasure house of the dragon's land, which stores the golden bottle of the dragon's blood essence. The owner of the book always wants to get the treasure, but several magic blocks him. When he thinks about how to crack, His life has also reached its limit. If this is the place mentioned in the travel notes, then I have a way to find the entrance and find the prince - whether he is still alive or not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I believe in you, Siegel." Janet raised her toes and left a soft kiss on his face: "What do you need now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I need to prepare a spell ritual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jia Kun's Travels" records several spell rituals, including bloody key and broken lock. Siegel memorized these two spells long ago, but he has not been able to fully perform it - even if he received the training of magic, he could barely do it. Some of the material of the ritual could not be found around, so Siegel can only reduce the power and scope of the spell repeatedly, and replace some materials with his own blood. The use of blood is not a sorcerer, because the magic of each magician is ultimately transmitted through the blood vessels to the body, and blood is the best energy medium. But few Masters can be as strong as Siegel, let alone the corresponding resilience. Siegel spent two days depicting the magical array, making the surrounding of the cave entrance colorful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has come to see the strange things that Sir Bill has come up with, pointing around and pointing. Mercenaries know the Masters Association of Deepwater City, but most of them have never seen magic. The nobles are better. They know the City, the Masters Association and the Masters Association. They know the power and limits of magic. Some big families also have consultants. But for them, magic is also a rare thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
