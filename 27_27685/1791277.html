Every small part, every line of magical array and every powder of alchemy material needs to be carefully calculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical components that can't be run are nothing, the danger is that those running with faults. Attacking the master's madness, the blasting lamp god is more deadly than other failed structures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s comparable to the danger, but it’s an excellent income. Well-made ghosts are the helpers that the wizard can rely on. They don't fatigue, complain, and remain loyal. They will block the enemy according to the command of the mage, and use their own body to make up for the shortcomings of the mage in the melee, to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualified Golem can be turned into a good warrior and a terrible monster, but only the best Master can understand, and follow the instructions to make the structure. Can't get the best results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best results need to be integrated into the art. The elves have long seen this, so they called their mage organization an art institute. Being able to combine your own feelings and express them in a magical array with a sense of beauty to achieve a harmonious effect, then it is possible to make the best of the creatures. And this requires a person who is talented and brave in experimenting, and can continue to accumulate knowledge and technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is full of ideas, and there are countless possibilities in front of them, each one is wonderful, making it difficult to choose. He knows that he must learn to do subtraction at this time and must find out the direction of concentration. He has read the relevant records, and many of the wizards have encountered similar situations, some of which try to be perfect. But even the gods can't be perfect, let alone mortals? Some people only face a failed experiment, and a small number of people have been devastated by their self-confidence and have not recovered for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capacity, savvy, and self-control are all indispensable and must be balanced. Siegel worked patiently in the lab and made plans for it, one by one. Ten days have passed. The light blue body of the lamp god was slowly formed, and the core of the oil lamp shape was finally completed, and now it is time to make a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to apply the technology of the secret nuclear to the lamp god?" Siegel temporarily put down his hand and left the test bed. Came to the rest of the bench. The servant of the Golem puts him on the tea at the right time and takes a long oak pipe. Apprentices are not so intimate, and even less likely to be in the laboratory forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret nuclear can make the lamp god's ability to cast a very strong, like a never-ending mantra, so that it can be better destroyed The enemy or protect yourself. But Siegel is not allowed to simplify the version of the secret can check the impact of the lamp god. Excessive elemental levels may directly turn the light god into a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, this was the case. The power of magic was too strong, and the structure of the spell replaced the structure of matter, thus making the magic "live". In fact, Siegel also saw this scene with his own eyes, just when the ghost fog swamp elves launched the tide of elements. The activated spell and elemental power occupy the body of Master McGonagall, let him lose his consciousness and become a monster like a beast. If Mier can be turned into an activated spell monster, it is definitely a disaster in the history of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Steps are still slower, it’s better to do experiments with other things." Siegel ate a few snacks and helped with the condensed tea. . Then rub your cheeks and go back to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very familiar with this feeling, in the past often involuntarily immersed in it, forgetting the passage of time outside. Although this is the case now, he asks the servant to remind him to rest every once in a while, especially not to delay the time with Isaac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Siegel made up his mind, the progress is getting faster. When the servant Golem once again greeted him, the lamp god completed the body building, and only the final assembly was left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant does not speak, it extends four fingers. Standing in front of Siegel. "Today is the fourth?" Siegel scratched his head and breathed a sigh of relief. On the fourth day of each month, he needs to deal with the territories in the Chamber of Deputies, meet the elders of various villages and towns, and dispute on the referee's territory. The identity of the mage made him live in a simple way. As a lord, he needs to appear frequently in front of the people. Therefore, Janet made a suggestion. When the referee disputed, he allowed the residents of Heim to stand by and let them have a chance to contact and know the sergeant Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time he did this, he was still very nervous. After getting used to it, he was fine. The lord's judgment of the law is the highest expression of his power, but he is not required to make judgments on the spot. Siegel quickly mastered this trick, which allowed some things to be handed over to Mana. She is both the lord and one of Siegel's most trusted people, and her abilities have gradually developed to deal with these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today's things are a bit unusual. He saw two people dressed like farmers who used a stretcher to carry a dead person to the Chamber. They were very silent, and they could not see the expression on their faces because they lowered their heads. Their pace was slow and coordinated, and there was no sound when they walked barefoot on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana is sitting next to Siegel, sharing a table, but the chair is slightly shorter than the lord. She also found that the situation was different, and she looked at the guards next to her. So immediately there were soldiers armed with spears and shields in front of the civilians, with vigilant eyes on the two people carrying the stretcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl, we are not assassins, please don't drive us down. We are the adventurers who are living in Heim, and dressing up like this is a bad thing. We only ask for the unfortunate experience of being in the companion." The speaker picked up the bloody linen and showed the body in front of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deceased has a strong body, but is wounded by a scar through the chin to the navel. His body was cut open, flesh and blood rolled outward, and the internal organs burned into coke. If there is anything to describe this tragic picture, it is that he was blown up from the inside out by a fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder two people can easily lift the body. The onlookers made a repressed cry, and some people began to weep in horror. "A terrible wound," they said. Several villagers covered their children's eyes with their hands, but they could not leave because the doors of the Chamber were closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Atelier Bell, my father is Marsas Bell, the wheel of the scales city, the Lord, we are in your territory I was attacked, just in the southern part of the Ghost Fog, when we were looking for Gram grass, and by the way, we investigated the rumors of the Kobolds nearby." The man said: "A wizard of the Federation appeared and asked us to sell the grass. We don't want to After wasting a few days of hard work, he refused him. Then Donner, who carried the geranium, was killed by the wizard with a spell, and the body became like this. The wizard disappeared after getting the thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of spells does he use to describe it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We only see It’s a strong flash.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows that there are two spells that can make a similar scar, but they don’t have a strong flash. And the mage who attacks the team in the wild will leave two live mouths? This is not common sense, unless the wizard is not afraid of any subsequent pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is the flash, is that mage your companion? And how do you know that it is a synagogue of the federation?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The flash comes from the Master, who wears the Master's Gown of the Federation, just as I saw the Union Groom's Gown near the City of Mith."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want me to do to help you catch the mage?" Siegel held his chin in his hands and stared at them and said, "A mage who can cause this kind of wound must know how to It's easy, so even if you provide his profile information, it doesn't make sense. And the synagogue gown of the federation is easy to imitate, which can't be used as evidence. And who do you expect to investigate this case? The wizard's mage? As the accused They can't participate..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel paused for a moment, and he probably understood who would be the behind-the-scenes pusher for this matter. If you want to find out this and give the people of the territory a convincing explanation, then you must find a mage who is not a federation to investigate this matter. Unless Siegel personally goes, it is only the release of the reward mission, let the adventurers do the work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New World has a number of casters in addition to the resident mages of the Federation. They traveled adventures, most of which were outside members of the federation, but a small part was still surrounded by the Masters Association. This is a good opportunity to push the Masters Association to the front of everyone and use this body to announce its power in the New World - by the way, the shoes of the Federation will be dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s even more likely that there is a hope that the Federation will have a conflict with the association and that a small thorn is in the heart of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
