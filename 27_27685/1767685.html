			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Void Ship, Siegel collected a lot of Yan Soo Crystal, and converted it into a plasma of energy. He can also come to him. In addition, there are a lot of things in the space bag, and there are also some items on the ship. In particular, some of the odd-shaped, exuding components of mysterious power, Siegel brought them back when they were magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These items are not recognized for their utility, but the konjac can slowly combine them. If you ask the principles and functions of these two things, it can't tell why. Fortunately, he was born to be a repairman, very familiar with mechanical equipment, and made a simple assembly line based on the gourd painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is going to attach a storage method and destroy the sound wave spell on the 弩. Fortunately, he does not need to cast the two spells in full, just need some of them. Use the spell of the storage method to lock the plasma, and use the structure of the sound spell to strengthen the utility of the tuning fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removing a spell like this is a necessary step to become a sorcerer. Only then can you gain an in-depth understanding of the nature of magical power. Many wizards are able to form their own style of casting, because they focus on the recombination of the spells, and the difference in the talent of the Master is mainly reflected in this aspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like refining the pieces in the score and turning them back into new ones. Everyone knows the method, but the difference in the songs made is very large. Some are beautiful, some are powerful, others are like noise and difficult to get into the ear. Siegel is a powerful style, and he always chooses the simplest and most direct way to recombine a spell. The new magic array thus formed is much smaller and the cost of manufacturing is greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two look at Siegel on the sheepskin roll, the two big eyes are constantly flashing. He assessed the size of the circle and kept reminding Siegel that it was "smaller and smaller."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can understand the minimization of Nexus The array technology and deep engraving do not have to be so troublesome. Siegel squats on the desk and modifies his magical array over and over again, making the most of every space and minimizing the size of the squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On a squat, how much area can you draw. How fine can the lines be?" Siegel smashed the konjac and handed his own goose pen Give him: "You give me a rough look, I have a goal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two to pick up the pen and draw a slender on the paper rectangle. Then refer to Siegel. The size of the rectangle is similar to the area occupied by the middle finger of the index finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible?" Siegel frowned: "I have to subtract at least 20% of the size."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it difficult?" Two tones don't have much concept for the magic array. He only knows casting and assembly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said to the konjac: "This array is necessary to maintain the stability of the plasma. It is necessary before the launch. The rogue will be seriously injured. The sound wave spell is used to excite. Without this, this arrow is like a waste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it turned out to be good. It’s complicated.” The konjac said so, the expression on his face is indifferent. "Don't forget that you are a cylindrical body, and you can roll up this design."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel slaps his head, I am really confused. If you roll it up, the formation of a three-dimensional array can bring a benefit. If the similar spell structures are close together and can be borrowed from each other after improvement, you may be able to save some patterns. Siegel re-disrupted the entire spell. Bring the highly relevant parts closer together and put the most repetitive magic structure in the best position. Again and again, calculations and attempts are repeated over and over again. Siegel, like the most obscure miser, tries to squeeze out the efficiency of every inch of space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The konjac installs its own assembly line on the side, slowly combining the mechanical parts of the drive. The mechanical arm and the tooth part made by the blacksmith are not qualified, and the requirements of the mechanical environment are not met at all. However, the konjac can be corrected by itself, and the high hardness of the dwarf is used to improve the precision of the part. Fortunately, Siegel gave him a lot of things on the Void, and many of them can greatly reduce the workload of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He works while sipping a song, and the slender mechanical arm moves quickly. Just then he heard a "beep" behind his back. Siegel pinched the quill and stood up from the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have done my best and reduced the space by half and half, but it is still not enough. Do you have to use a large bow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big bow has Why can't it be, the bigger the power, the stronger it will be, the more it looks, the more handsome it will be?" Two beating his arms on his head, his excitement was a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" The size of the crossbow is enlarged, which means that the material of the chord needs to be redone, otherwise it is difficult to achieve sufficient injection speed; It becomes heavier than before and needs more leverage to make people pull; the increase in overall weight means more training and lower hit rate.” Siegel pointed out the problem one by one, but the most crucial one is this: "Only the ammunition is good. If the bow is replaced, the elf will immediately know that these things for the war tree are made by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf will definitely find Come to the door and destroy the Heim collar. Erdu also understood the problems. He kept shaking and comforting Siegel. "Don't worry, if you don't, you will give up some of the spell effects, or move the spells to other places."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These two effects are no longer reduced." Siegel stood up, and the hand was naturally placed on the hilt of the dust of the stars. "How can the mantra move, what happens after it is opened..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head and looked at the direction of his hand. Since the habit has already formed, his palm touches the hilt and does not feel strange. The sharp entanglement of the Mage Federation has been integrated with the dust of the stars, and it has been immersed in perspiration and blood stains, but it still provides the power of magic enhancement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intensification of weapons does not have to be applied to the weapon itself, scabbards, wraps are viable options. Since there is not enough space in the company, why not create a layer of "sword sheath" for them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel had an embarrassing idea and immediately started designing. Make a box to store the 弩 vector, you can load three hairs at a time, it only needs to be able to fit most of the 弩 bow, it is best to buckle on the 弩 bow. Most crossbows need to be tightened first and then placed in the groove. Siegel can make an upper magazine that can just get stuck in the body, let the 弩 自动 automatically fall into the groove, and then the 匣 匣 匣 匣 匣 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After launching, 弩 能 can fly for a maximum of a few seconds, in such a short period of time. The previous added magic effect will not be invalid immediately, and the plasma will not splash in flight. As for hitting the enemy, stability and instability have no practical significance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also allows the magazine to be reused, saving the cost of making magic arrays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should have thought of it!" Siegel drew three designs. Think this approach is feasible. The upper magazine not only solves the problem of the position of the magic array, but also gives Siegel the opportunity to engrave other arrays on the sac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a number of bombs and plasmas that are sold to others, but they are left to be used by others in the magical array." When the inspiration emerged, Siegel moved fast. He was almost in one go, and determined the design of all the parts of the company. A brain was handed over to the two toots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some parts also need to be made by you personally, especially the part of the magical array. At present, we lack the fine gold, can only use hard steel, wear very quickly, So you have to engrave more parts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There should be a small piece of fine gold in the storeroom, it has been useless to buy it, this time it will be handed over to you. "Siegel said: "What are you missing in addition to fine gold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think of it at the moment." Checklists and design drawings are over and over. "I probably won't be successful once, you can't train me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This I know, you work hard." Siegel's red hair Eyes. I only feel that my body and mind are extremely tired. He sat in a chair and could sleep if he closed his eyes for less than two minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven’t closed your eyes for five days," said the konjac, who didn’t have anything at all: "Your flesh and blood can't compare with me. Go to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel noticed the passage of time. He tried to prop up his body and finally returned to the bedroom. Janet is accompanying Isaac to catch the ball. She sees the eyes of Siegel and immediately understands her husband's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
