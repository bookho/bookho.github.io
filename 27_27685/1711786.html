I saw the injury, the neck and the chest and the heart and lungs can be seen, even if there is a pastor around, there is nothing to do, but only to die. But one The lamp god flew, and sent a small bottle of pharmacy that didn’t know what it was made, saying that it could heal the wound. We don’t know how it learned about it, and at first it didn’t trust it, but it’s hanging on the line. Only a dead horse can be a living horse doctor. After one night, His Royal Highness is miraculously re-lived and can continue to command the team to advance. The Earl adults have not revealed what the lamp god said, but the team is indeed there. After the night, I turned all the way to the north."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Light God? It's hard to imagine. Later? Where is Your Highness now?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s in that cave, but it’s been a long time since it’s been lost.” Sir Bill pointed to the collapsed half of the hole and said, “You are on the date. I also heard it at the meeting. The first wave of people who went in to explore the road died of plague, but the prince of the prince still led the team. The Earl, the eight guards and the Sanming court mages were accompanied, and they never came out again. And the mercenaries sent people to look for nothing, I did not get into the cave several times, tied the rope around the waist, but soon went to the bottom of the hole, only the original way back. I guess there may be spells or other magical Something, but no one knows where His Highness has gone there, and now what is the situation. So I can only wait here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, all Is the man trapped here because of the actions of His Royal Highness Prince?" Siegel scratched his head and had no way of dealing with the current situation. "He is a prince, not an ordinary adventurer. When he comes to the Walled Mountains, he is looking for treasures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Your Highness has a mission, I am Known from the Earl - forgive the Orcs and give them the status of a free man. The Star Kingdom requires both labor and strong soldiers, and this paper will bring great benefits."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I saw that the Orcs are still afraid of steel, they can only hide in the mountains and barely live. The orc army has assembled and ravaged at sea. Deepwater City uses the nomads on the grassland while They are also called savages. The next race war in the New World is on the verge of being on the verge of a slap in the face, but the prince is looking for treasure here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right." Sir Bill Keep his head up, but closed his eyes. "But the little nephew, remember the Knight's code? Obedience is the first. Do you think I should advise him or even stop him?" Sir Bill sighed. "I tried, but many times things are not So, you can't expect your lord to be a perfect person, and he can't do everything at the same time, only after there. Siegel, do you think the half-orcs are very poor?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said frankly: "If you don't help them any more, so that they can hope for life, I think the Orcs will soon become as low as the Goblin. They are frightened, frightened by civilization, and are about to retreat into their originality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, you are still young, and you have experienced things. Less, half-orcs are not as fragile as you think. To know how vast the world is, how many people need help? Even if they are goblins, orcs, even if they are evil, do you need help? You need to know some of them. People, really should be brave Help yourself. There is a half-orc village not far from the outpost. I sent it to the free mercenary guards. If there are half-orcs who can ask for help, let them come over and I will give them food. Let them start from the battle to follow, no longer discriminate against them. But in the first half of the month, no half-orc contacted us. Later, I went to the village, there were two half-orcs with disabilities, I gave them Going to the food, let them bring words to the people in the village, saying that I am willing to help the half-orcs here to gain civilian status. From then on, they can go out of the mountains, or go to farming, or go to work, but still no one answers."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also passed the village and gave them food, but they just thanked." Siegel remembered the few orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, for me, it’s no different to go to save the half-orcs first to find the baby. It’s the duty. Even though there is a kingdom in the temple, you need to learn how to Governance, led by countless subjects waiting for him, but here..." He hesitated and said: "But we can't shape the world according to our own ideas. We are just mortals, not gods. We are not detached from life and death, We are just **fans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else can we do?" Siegel asked: "Can only wait for the king to appear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
