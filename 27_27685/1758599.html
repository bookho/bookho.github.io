			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust on the battlefield is flying, and the impact is spread out in all directions. If it is a natural mist, it will definitely be blown away, and only the fog wall made up of magic will barely support it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton concentrates on all spirits, tries to reverse the deformed spells, reunites the magic mud, and continues to distort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a ghost, how does this Hem’s mage use the ability of Nexus? Stable plasma, huge impact, Felton consciously will not admit mistakes, so I was very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one way to determine if it is the messenger of the swearing-spiritual spell. Felton quickly determined his goal of deformation. His spells became very unstable due to the damage, but he focused on deformation with sturdy control, determined to succeed this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wouldn’t let him do it, holding a long sword and rushing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distorted limb becomes a huge tentacle, rolling up the long sword on the ground, resisting. Siegel used only three swords to pick up the other's weapons, and used a magic wand to shoot a day to bright light. The radiance contains the burning that Felton hates, deeply penetrated into the body. The damage done is not great, but there is a constant glowing core of the spell in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell core can appeal to the spell rays used by Siegel, acting like a target. Even in the fierce battle, the Master Lord can aim at it without spending too much thought. God knows what spell he will use next time? Is it a burning ray belonging to a human mage, or is it the light of death from Ninth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton slammed his arms and spit out a long series of spells, and the power from the outside world responded to his call. He became a weird piece of meat. The four short, thick, spider-like legs that protruded from the sides of the body crouched on the ground. It has a spider on its head. There are eight turbid compound eyes. Around the mouth of a crack like a flower. Four constantly waving, elastic tentacles are twitching like provocations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its body is slimy, covered with a jelly-like gel on the surface, like a brain dug out of the skull. At the front of the torso and behind the neck, there are also two slender, mucus-like tentacles, and the other eyes grow on the top of the antennae. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this stuff!" Siegel smelled a disgusting smell, and the stomach was uncomfortable and almost vomited. He has a slightly stature, and he looks at the monster in front of him and guesses what it has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't look like a monster with strong melee ability. Although the open mouth is covered with small, sharp tines that can easily shred the flesh of the prey, it has one of the most deadly drawbacks: there is no neck that can flexibly. It is like a fat bulldog, but it supports the body by spider legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster has no prominent spikes on it, nor does it see a tubular-like structure, unlike the ability to remotely launch acupuncture. It is not like seeing the saclike structure, nor is it like spraying acid and flame. Then this monster should have a good spell power, but what is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton’s compound eyes trembled, aiming at Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the light and the flint, Siegel guessed the other's approximate ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster body trembles slightly. The tentacles sway like a willow, and there is no spell action at all. Then I saw a picture with complicated colors and twisted lines appearing in the air, attracting Siegel's sight and falling involuntarily. He only felt that his body was tired, his thoughts were tired, and his soul was equally tired. The powerful hypnotic pattern slowed Siegel's movements, causing his eyelids to gradually hang down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petal-like mouth was wide open, and a pale yellow-colored ball of light flew to Siegel and got into his body. All magic shields did not respond, allowing the spell to take effect. However, Siegel did not move and seemed to be still in the process of falling asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton's compound eye emits a bright yellow color, constantly using the power of mind control. Open your heart, let go of your heart, tell me the secrets in your mind - Felton continues to hypnotize Siegel, intending to enter his mind. There is the elemental rune knowledge that he dreams of, the technique of elemental clustering, and even the secret of opening up the strength of the singularity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton continued to dig deeper, constantly strengthening the power of the spell and moving forward. Many mages have experienced mental defense training, know how to hide their secrets, even if there is no spell to protect the spirit, they can respond with a strong will. But this kind of protection has limits, just like magic runes, there is always an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This common sense has hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel judges that the enemy's ability should be biased toward the mind to control the abilities, and immediately defend against the new. He knows the spells of the Knox Association, although not as skilled as they are, but they have a full understanding of the characteristics of their spells. In addition, he studied the knowledge of the runes of Ness, and found some commonalities between the two, and also the origin of the spiritual spells of the witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the gnome skills of the gnome to deceive Felton in a targeted manner, letting him think his spell hit the target. The practical situation is to let these spells run on the runway that can never be focused. For spells such as hypnotized graphics, Siegel can only rely on his own will to resist, but as long as Felton's spiritual tentacles try to get into his mind, they will be caught by pre-arranged traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton’s compound eyes sparkle, he has fallen into the trap of self-deception. In his eyes, Siegel has been hypnotized and unable to resist his spell invasion. His mind probe has found the target and started to feed back the information collected. What I have found is useless murmurs. It seems that there are still some spells and sinister shadows. These are like useless knowledge of the outer layer to protect the core behind. Just continue to dig and continue to dig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel releases the hand hidden in the sleeve. Put down the runestone. He has created several rune cores for deception. As long as you add the element summoning array, you can become a temporary element rune core. But plus mental trap spells and illusions can be. He looked up. Pat your cheeks, ease the sleepiness of being hypnotized, and then slowly walk to the monster, the other side is unaware. Maybe he will have some dangerous perceptions, but he will think that it is a counterattack from the other's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wrestling with Runestone and lacks reaction to the outside world. Siegel finally freed his hand and could cast his own spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a scroll, which was handed to him by the half-elf mage from the library. Originally planned to learn on the basis of learning transfer. "Dimensional anchor" can prevent most of the trans-space transmission ability, prevent the enemy from using the ability of space jump to escape, and play an important role in capturing the alien creatures. He only has this one, and he hasn't had the chance to record it in the spell book, but he believes that the library must have spare time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell is to be as soft as possible, not to be alert to the other party in the near future. Siegel carefully controlled the spell, using the markers left by the ray to apply the spell to Felton's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the spider's head trembled, but did not wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of the Master is eager to kill him with a sword. But this is not a private contest, but a territorial war. He must take this into consideration. How to maximize the use of resources on hand, to win the victory of the war and not just the victory of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in the face of this ever-changing monster, it is difficult to win with only one long sword. There are too many monster features that will bring countless changes to the battle. He must be forced to change him back to the human form, or the familiar form of Siegel, to be able to really find weaknesses and destroy him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel began to recite the spell, using the power of the elemental absorption matrix to mobilize the gas element. A gust of wind blew away the dense fog around, and the battlefield finally emerged in front of the soldiers of both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches tried to spur the spells, but the fog that gathered them was not enough to obscure the line of sight. The lords of the southern lords screamed and stunned, and they were all stunned by the ugly and distorted monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dream! What is it!" A lord was so short of breath, only that he was about to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I saw the Siegel Baron, but where is Felton?" The knights looked at each other, one of them was sharper and shouted at the battlefield. "Look! There is Felton's long sword. Is it that he has suffered unexpectedly and was eaten by monsters?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Cruel! Too cruel! "Brown Baron screamed: "To drive such a evil? The evil monster, his soul must be more ugly, distorted, dark! This lord must be removed, can not leave the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
