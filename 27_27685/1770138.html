			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the elf retreats, the guards of Hubburg are taking a break and preparing for the next round of offense.しwxs They put out the burning flames, stepped up the reinforcement of the remaining smoldering oil storage facilities, took care of the wounded soldiers, and buried the bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the threat of the elves from the ancient trees to the wall, Sir Stephens thought of an idea. He looked at the position where the ancient war trees stood when they attacked the city wall, letting the men digging trenches there and pouring the fire oil. At the same time he asked the castle trebuchet to adjust the angle, remove the gravel, and replace it with a jar filled with lime powder. The next time the elves approached, the jars could be blocked by the war trees, and the lime powder could still float. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the elf fire prevention work is done well, then the water spray begins. I sprinkle the place where the lime is sprinkled with the pipe that originally sprayed the simmering oil, hopefully this will surprise the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the castle has been burning hot asphalt from now on, in response to the siege war that may occur at any time. In this way, how long can the fuel last? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go in and get rid of the old tree that was killed!" He ordered: "Send it to the back, cut it off as firewood!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers happily opened the gates of the city and sent the ropes to let the refugees who wanted to work and earn a meal eat the bodies. At this time, Siegel was mixed into the city, and when he didn't pay attention, he showed invisibility and left without a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the hub for a few kilometers, he used teleportation to return to the city of Mith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the hub, the Heim collar has become a rare land, and the spirits of the besieged city have relaxed their vigilance and are not very reasonable for those who pick the crops out of the city. As long as you see the elf, you can evade and hide. The elf ranger, who has always been known for his sharp eyes, will turn a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. One or two people can do this, but if they are in groups or pull a car, the elves will still drive. The arrows they shot were still accurate and fast, and several people were injured and returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s already very lucky not to shoot you." Fitzak said after the news: "Don’t mess with the elves, they are still outside the city. The world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents of Heim’s collar have figured out the temper of the elf. Like the hard-working ants, they constantly carry things left by the villages outside the city. Vegetables, food and some animals that had not been taken away earlier were moved into the city of Mire. Although the threat of the siege has not been lifted, everyone is not as nervous as it was at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Siegel returned to the castle, it happened that Fitzk and Janet were discussing things. Seeing how they look happy, Siegel is also relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Lord. Good news." Fitzkack smiled and his eyes narrowed into a slit. “The starting point of the outpost was completed. The Morna kid took the cavalry and surrounded more than 300 yak. ​​Now the fortress is turning into a cow ring, but this can solve many food problems.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet also agreed: "The best news is not this. Moore is very progressive. He is not in a hurry to kill cattle and meat, but to cooperate with the dwarf brought by Ding Bao. Feeding the cows for milk. After a while, they continue to supply cheese with energy sources. This is much more stable than meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder Fazak Happy, he is happy for the performance of his grandson. Siegel also felt that Moore’s approach was a proper action for a lord, but there are still some places to pay attention to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that Mier City began to buy his cheese, first deducted from the arrears, counted as his first income." Siegel fee Zach said: "He has made a pen-free sale. Things are cheaper to sell, don't let me suffer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak's smile in his eyes The meaning is more obvious, because Siegel’s words are affirming Moore’s ability to be the lord. Wait until all the arrears have been paid off. Moore will become the official lord, which is the true meaning behind the owed. Because of this, Fazak only wants to lower the price of cheese, don't be greedy at such a critical moment, and lose the future of becoming a lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, remind Moore. It’s important to find a source of food, but the first one is still building an outpost. Find out what's going on around you." To the one-eyed old man said: "The establishment of a good relationship with the barbarian is still the first, only with their help. The starting point fortress can develop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought about it and said to them: "I used to contact a barbarian named Dio in the western grassland through Irene's relationship. He replaced all the treasures he had acquired into food, daily necessities, and building materials. And good weapons. There aren't many foods, and the range of household items is too big. I really don't know what they are missing. The building materials are very cumbersome. It is better to take some good weapons as gifts and let the scouts carry them with you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, there are quite a few in the warehouse!" Fitzk said: "All sent by the Southern Alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it." Siegel knocked on the table. "Tell Moore, let him steadily. I will go to him some time, on the one hand, look at the situation at the starting point, and On the one hand, I also look at what other potentials there are in the western grasslands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenette blinked and suddenly said: "Siegel, the dwarves left Moore provided all the necessary items for the dwarves according to your instructions. It was the blessing of the dwarves. They left Moore with a map west of the Walled Mountain Range as a symbol of friendship between the West Dwarf and the Heim Collar. The map was sent back to you, and I will give it to you later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I knew that there would be such a day, Siegel regretted the departure of the dwarf. Those dwarves are well-informed, united, and very competitive. If they can stay in Heim, they will be a big help. However, they have their own ideals, and they will never stop the pursuit of the pursuit. It will be meaningless to stay strong. Siegel silently blessed them in his heart, and Heim took the rest of the way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any other news?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jenice got through a few smuggling paths, we can already ship goods to the Uther family and Brown Lester territory, and then pass them out Diffusion.” Fitzak reported: “In order to reduce the risk of being discovered, it is best to reduce the size. One wagon is the best choice at a time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The four-wheeled carriage can transport a lot of things." Siegel said: "We are not rich, so the two-wheeled carriage is better. Does Janis say that the southern lords are missing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Food, especially food that can fill the stomach of the refugees." Fazak sighed and said to Siegel: "There are not many of these things, most of them are still being In the village controlled by the elves, you can't get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whatever you give, start with the yak." Siegel said: "But things can't White, send real money, then see if you can change to what other secret city needs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Janet was puzzled and asked: "We have iron ore and weapons shops, and now we have a source of meat. As for magic materials, after a while, the purchases are already full of warehouses. What do we need?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People!" Siegel said: "The elves surround the Heim collar. How many people should we have here? I want to send people to the starting point. However, I am afraid that the elves will find that the population is reduced and there is suspicion. It is easy to find people from our family. If we can do it, the situation will be different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Janet shook his head and said to Siegel: "It may be difficult to operate this thing. And it is not the best time to start the outpost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, the lady said yes," Fitzk said: "The war of the elf is likely to last for a long time, and in the case of smuggling meat, it is still longer than the original. Not to mention the risk of being leaked by the elves, the refugees will always have, it is not worth using Gold and silver to change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not selling people, this is not to buy refugees with money, but to save people." Siegel said: "Gnomes The cheese workshops, as well as the cannery workshops that are about to start, require manpower. I can arrange for the Heim people who know the roots to do these places. Who will fill the gap after the departure of the Heims? There are a lot of refugees outside and can't find a safe place to live. They are dying. Isn't it a good thing that we receive them? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak nodded, Janet did not speak. After a moment of silence, Janet reached out and hugged Siegel: "You That's right, we should do this, but I think we must control the scale. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed old man also said: "The Lord, I will carry out your request, but please do not accept too many people." In fact, Heim’s collar has just reached the point of being hungry and not completely out of the threat of hunger. Only after the winter, after cultivating the land near the outpost, can it gradually improve. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
