			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparkle of light illuminates the sky as bright as white, and the most intense drum rhythm is played. Siegel forced and smashed Lear's defensive array with three elements, and now it is time to harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Prophet has no protective spells and can only resist with defensive talisman. However, under the indiscriminate bombing of Siegel, the power of the talisman seems to be a drop in the bucket, even if the force field barrier can not last five seconds. What's more, the threat comes not only from the lightning above the head, but also from the ever-spreading ice and the rock and ice ridges that are squeezed by the ground motion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that Lear is going to lose, he has lost his first hand." The gnome slammed his fist and said with excitement: "This is a long time." The elemental magic can be used like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, you just understand it, you can't use it." The dwarf shook his head and retorted. He is good at using the power of runes to control earth elements, moving rocks, tunneling, etc., but wants to form a "revitalized land" like Siegel does, and there is a far-reaching gap. In addition to the power of the elements that can be mobilized is far from enough, the skills are really hard. These things seem simple, but they hide a lot of secrets that are unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to ask Siegel how he did it." The gnome looked at Siegel, who was manipulating Thundercloud, and his eyes were envious. "I knew that he was so powerful, I asked him earlier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't talk, things have changed." Half-long people frowned. The wings and tail are closed up, trying to make yourself look less conspicuous. His senses are much more acute than the other two, and he has discovered changes on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also stopped his hand and took out the vial of medicine from the belt. Using the wild cast mode can create a grand scene, but it can also cause serious consumption. In addition to physical energy, the first thing he wants to recover is the body's keen perception of the elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille supports a transparent ball of light that isolates the invasion of lightning and ice. The surface of the photosphere is filled with complex words, and most of the symbols are not from the mortal. Even Siegel, who has mastered the Tianjie language, can only see a very small part of it. It is clear that Lear does not have the power of the Holy One, but this light ball exudes the atmosphere of the Holy Power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was this light ball that blocked Siegel’s offense and won time for Lehr. Siegel tentatively used elemental spells and found that the results were minimal. Whether it was an acid ball or a flame arrow, it was like a broken egg on a rock, and it didn't get any effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lear seems to be unable to attack, and the light ball also isolates his power. In this "egg shell", Lear slowly completed his original protective spells and made targeted adjustments based on changes in the situation on the field. He is not in a hurry, and he is obviously very confident in the defense ability of the light ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not idle, throwing a few of the elements on the ground and using earth elements to control the rest of the earth and bury them . While doing this, he said to the three people in front of the magic tower: "Hey, you can hide quickly, I can't take care of you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic The tower is temporarily closed, we can't get in. If we have the chance, we will hide in, don't worry about us!" The gnome said quickly, he knows how serious the problem is when he is fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille used a few reels to quickly fill up his protective spells. He unlocked the ball of light and came to a distance of ten meters from Siegel. "You have smashed the place here, and all the hard-working flowers and plants are dead. However, those guys can't get into the magic tower's door. This is good news."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not a match. If Lear tried to marry him with three inhuman wizards, it would only reveal more flaws. As long as Siegel maintains the determination and ability to grasp these flaws, he will be able to kill Lear and protect three people. Hostages and war situations are always a complex relationship that entangles each other. If either party retreats a little, it will lose its chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, actually don’t talk, do you need to be so careful?" Lear smiled and said to Siegel: "Obviously the sacred murderer does not In this overturned square, and the magic tower door does not open, it means that he can't get out of the hidden tower. The warm-up is over, let us dew the real skills!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no longer a simple repetition of launching a four-pulse arrow, but rather a wider, more flexible way to cast spells. Blindness, deafness, nausea, dizziness, petrification, paralysis, nausea, shock, tremors, fear, guilt, confusion, and energy absorption. The two mages changed their designs and masked their tactics. Next, defend while defending. What kind of spell power can be resisted by the protective spell on the body. Will this resistance expose the structure of the protection system? The gestures and spells of the other party are true or false. Will he change his choice midway? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No splendid light and shadow, no explosions and roars, only invisible magical fluctuations between the two. The two are like building a dam with a tree branch, and the magic spells stacked on each other must be balanced, otherwise they will soon be washed away by the flood. The person who fails to balance the balance will naturally bear the brunt of it, facing the magical energy that two people have combined to build. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a huge crossbar is not plugged in, only the fine, small branches can do this. Both of them are rushing to seize the most favorable position, giving the more difficult spells to each other, and using simple, stable and efficient spells. Their foreheads are sweaty, and the difficulty of doing this is comparable to playing in the five-dimensional world. If Siegel does not possess the overall and subtle analytical skills given by the nephew, he may have long since lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He progressed while learning, and slowly began to have some experience. Although it is not enough to make up for the gap in experience for a while, as long as it lasts for a long time, it can maintain a stable position. He also does not want to block all the spells that have accumulated, and if necessary, will also remove some non-fatal spells. His own protective spells are not furnishings, and a certain degree of disadvantage is acceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear is a little worried. He watched as Siegel continued to improve and witnessed the growth of this opponent. "Damn scorpion, actually gave him such a high savvy! Continue to develop like this, he will definitely surpass me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When abandoning power, column There is a limit to the power saved, otherwise it will not be abandoned. Although this limit is sufficient for the saint-level battle, Siegel may not stop at the Holy One. Others are not clear, but as the god of knowledge, Lear understands very well that legendary spells and the sacred body are very likely to ignite the original fire. This fire is very weak, even fleeting, but at that moment, Siegel will have the opportunity to exert the power beyond the limits, the irresistible rule power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear has no choice but to get the winners and losers as soon as possible. He suddenly screamed and slammed back three steps. In the place where he was originally standing, there was a fully armed Lear, which continued to superimpose magic spells. The new **** avatar began to recite another spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change surprised Siegel’s heart, and the spells in his hand were wrong. Distracting Skills Most Masters will learn, and Siegel has the ability to be distracted, but it has never been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't separate yourself and have the same ability to cast spells." Siegel calmed himself down and calmly deal with sudden situations. There will be many changes in this kind of war situation. If you panic every time, the battle will be doomed to failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ler’s quit the spell, and three magic missiles flew over to Siegel. The young sergeant is smirking, and this spell will be completely blocked when it hits the shield. No effect will happen. Not to mention three, even if it is 10,000? He continued to pile up spells on the cursed dam and continued to learn and progress in the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the shield flashed a bit, blocking two of the three missiles. The rest of the man slammed into Siegel's body, and the mage's robe on his chest left a burning mark. The power of a single magic missile is like a punch by an ordinary person, which is nothing for Siegel's strong knight body. But this is the first time that Lear has penetrated Siegel's protection, the active and actual damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big prophet hangs a smile on his mouth, and his hands are still in his hands. He doesn't expect to rely on this avatar to win, but he can also force Siegel's one or two cards and slowly gain an advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation is not good, how to become a second hit, I have to help!" The gnome is about to cast a spell, but was pulled by a half dragon : "Are you crazy, actually dare to blend into the field, it will cause a chain reaction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What spell field? Clearly calm!" The gnome Ke Ke is puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
