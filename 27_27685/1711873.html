			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after Janet left, Siegel accidentally felt the fluctuations caused by the magic spell, and the position was outside the door of his residence. He concentrated his spirit and distinguished the characteristics of the transmission from the fluctuations. In Deepwater City, only the registered mages of the Federation can cast spells, especially for any type of spell. I don't know which Master is visiting the door? Siegel took the wand and walked out before Mrs. Dip had not opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the door is an acquaintance, the Axe Master of the Federation. He still touched his eyebrows with his right hand and took a mage ceremony. "Siegel Master, Master Faranese once again summons you, please be sure to rush."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no problem, I will leave immediately." Siegel Head, he understands that the moment of appointment is coming, and the bachelor will come to the end of his life. He snorted Mrs. Dip and asked everyone to continue to prepare according to the original plan, without deliberately waiting for him. After that, he asked Master Akti to display the transfer and bring himself into the Three Peaks Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the last time, a group of young apprentice mages gathered in the open space outside the Sanfeng Pagoda, and they were asking questions around a formal mage. Originally such behaviors occurred in the discussion salon or the discussion tower of the Knowledge Tower, and never appeared on an open outdoor venue. Regardless of privacy or security, such behavior will affect other mages. Siegel felt a bit strange until he noticed that the mage who had lectured had no hair, and there was a faint vortex tattoo on the bare, shiny head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knox Commonwealth's Witch...Mage," Siegel frowned, not thinking that they had been integrated into the federation so quickly. . For them, Siegel has always been wary, for fear that they will influence their thinking and memory. Fortunately, all the Knox co-consulters who have conflicted with him have already died. The mysterious alchemist of Macabu is not aware of the true appearance of Siegel and should not bring any subsequent troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now they are responsible for the apprentice salon?" Siegel asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, how can this be." Akzi smiled and shook his head: "From the basic apprentices, it is the pleasure of all wizards to discover the genius of the genius. How can it be made?" These newcomers stepped in. But for apprentices who have already been screened, they can teach them. It also saves the time and energy of others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Shaking his head, no one will listen to this even if he expresses his opinion. He glanced at the sleeves and, under the leadership of Akzi, found the master of Faranis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the master looks good, he is enjoying the hookah. Talk to Lion King Alexander. Siegel stood respectfully and stood outside the door, but saw the bachelor's bachelor beckoning and let him walk in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, you know Alexander," Ba Xueshi swayed both palms. Like a child, he said in a joke: "It is the Lion King..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen two sergeants." Siegel respectfully salutes , has always maintained a good demeanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a good thing to talk to you." Faranis said with a smile: "We are going to build a new library with a magic lab. In Deepwater City." If you want to expand the Federation's laborers, the effect will not be good. You don't have a territory, give us a piece and build a new laboratory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is really good news." Siegel said sincerely: "I haven't seen it in the territory yet, and I don't know the terrain. But I can guarantee the location of the new territory of the federation."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alexander will be responsible for this matter, including engineering materials. After William returns, let him help establish the connection between the two places, either with a pigeon or with a pigeon. Ravens, so that information can be passed to each other in time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry, teacher." said Alexander **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I didn't actually teach you a spell, it's not your teacher." Bo Xueshi put a hookah and waved his wand from A bundle of reels was called on his bookshelf. "Okay, take these things and leave, I have something to say to Siegel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion stood up and the two fingers in the right hand were about to be lifted up. Master of the Master. It suddenly fell down. He leaned down and hugged the bachelor, but he was afraid that his strength would hurt the vulnerable body of the old man. At the urging of Faranis, the Alexander sergeant took the reel and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you don't suddenly cough up a fireball, it's the same," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H. I will tell a joke, this is a kind of progress." Faranis stalked the body and gently rubbed his head with his hand. The black hair on the floor then said: "Be smart, know that people are happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can do this before, maybe the old captain will feel better when he walks. A lot. Siegel thought this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good boy, say good business." Bo Xueshi stopped smiling and said: "I only have three days to live, when the fourth day dawn When a beam of sunshine comes, I will die. This prophecy is probably the pinnacle of my life's prophetic spells. Nothing has been so clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sorry." Siegel said: "I am very sad to hear this news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far!" Bo Xuejun smiled and said: "You have What can be apologetic, but you didn’t kill me. Besides, there is nothing to be sad. I have seen it in my spells. After death, I can cross the wall of the storm, reach the St. Bai Library, and sit in the god of knowledge. Next to it. My questions can be answered, my research will never stop. I am very satisfied with this end. If I am not worried about the preconditions for destroying the prophecy, I even want to die now!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can call me, there must be something." Siegel’s mind is very clear Asked in a mild tone: "What do I need to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The bachelor replied: "If you give the things to do, Not as good as I sent Alexander errands directly, it is convenient and easy to use. I told you to come, just to take up your three days. During this time, you can only stay here honestly, listen to me to speak to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood up and walked back and forth in the room. After a while, he stood at the window and stared out. Due to the protection of the spell, you can't see the scenery of Deepwater City from here, only the darkness that is as deep as the starless night sky. He thought for a while, then looked back and looked at Master Faranis and said, "My friends won't have anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will not Thinking about where you have been in these three days, there will be no other things.” Bo Xueshi replied: “You can think of it very well here, and it is worthy of praise to care about your companion. But you can rest assured that I am not trying to trap you. Let you stay. If you want to leave, I won't stop you. There are many possibilities in the future, but none of them hurts you. Because to some extent, I still depend on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been holding the Knicks together Heart, don't trust them, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, nothing to admit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know that after I die, Casper will be promoted to a master and become one of the giants of the Three Peaks Tower?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mage shook his head, and he had no ability to peep into the future, and naturally he couldn’t know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a concern, Alexander is smart enough, but his character is too straight. William is too impetuous and cynical. Caspar is a deep-hearted, and capable mana. It is also very strong and a powerful character. Although his strength status can be mastered, the future of the Federation has become confusing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So I am going to build a new meeting place on my territory?” Siegel asked: “This is what you said last time, the Masters Association to save books and knowledge?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have not forgotten the promise, very good." Bo Xueshi nodded: "Several mage who is equally worried about me will complete this matter, you only need to provide land and control on the open side The situation is ok. Hey, a mage lord hasn't seen it for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and nodded. "I will facilitate the Masters Federation and beware of the actions of the Federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, I can talk to you about the next thing. "The Faranis sergeant said very seriously to Siegel: "In these three days, I will not call you any spells, and things related to mystery. I will tell you what a master must master: Territory management."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
