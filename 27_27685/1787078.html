			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I left this horse here. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM" Evan called the owner of the house and said to him: "Give it enough feed Let it rest and rehabilitate. I will come back to take it away, and then give you a gold coin, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villager quickly waved his hand, lest he should take it Work: "Adult, I will not raise a horse, will ... will die..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is someone to help, your village still raises Don't live a horse?" Avon listened to Siegel saying that there might be a beastly person in the village. He had to continue to carry the diamond on the road, but Siegel strongly refused to delay the team trip. Evan's scratching his head is indeed not a way to ride a horse, so the diamond must be safely left here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the more than ten miles north of the village, there are more than 70 wolves. You can find someone to deal with. When you mink or eat meat, Take a good look at your brain, who killed these beasts. If I came back, my horse didn't stay here well, I wouldn't listen to any excuses and reasons. Do you understand that?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ming...understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then greeted him like an old friend, Pat the owner of the farmhouse and look for diamonds to explain some things. Yao En helped the glasses and came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't want to get into trouble in this place, but if we find us in trouble, it is something we are happy to solve." He has been smiling and his tone is very gentle. "There are a lot of beasts around your village. You should hire a bounty to hire an adventurer or report it to the lord for cleaning. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, you are right." The owner of the farmhouse bent down to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six men and nine horses left the village where the beasts lived and continued on the journey. They drilled out of the hills, through a forest dominated by tall maple trees, and through two villages that made maple sugar for their livelihood. Two days later came to the core hinterland of the southern lord, the West Ling City of Viscount Uther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a castle with a history of nearly two hundred years. It was built after six generations of Uther. It is clear that the layers of buildings of different ages can be seen. It is situated on a solid stone island in the middle of the river, with four long stone bridges connecting the castle to the river banks on both sides. There are many holes, big or small, under each stone bridge. Due to the rapid currents and numerous vortexes, it is very dangerous to ferry here. Only through the long bridge can you get close to the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each stone bridge can only pass a four-wheeled carriage, plus at most one pedestrian to avoid. The narrow road makes it impossible for the attacking party to carry out the troops, which makes the West Ling City very safe. Drey Uther III inherited a large number of sieges from his grandfather and father, and has already set the ruler according to the orientation of the bridge, ready for precise attacks. So the army without the southern lords wants to attack this place. Previous attempts have failed without exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Uther family has enough strength to equip a cavalry unit because of weak defensive pressures and the wealth that pass taxes bring to them. It is a pity that this unit suffered a major blow in Heim’s territory and is still recovering from the temperament and temporarily used for patrol and investigation. Because Heim’s collar controls the trade routes between the north and the south and the east and west, it is difficult to get a lot of horses to buy. One of the ways the Uther family tried to find a solution was to have a good relationship with the kingdom of the stars and hired a school mage as a consultant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and his party will cross the bridge from here and continue their journey to the south. But when they arrived, they found things as simple as they didn't think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roadblock was placed on the bridge. A solid and sturdy log frame on the fork-shaped tripod stopped the way. At the same time, six soldiers with long squats and carrying slings stood before and after the roadblock. They wore leather jackets bearing the Uther family's emblem—that is, four long squats on a blue circle—with a metal helmet that was also painted blue in the head. One of them took the banner of the Uther family and leaned on the railing of the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for the ranks of the caravans. Being checked. The unchecked businessman complained that the businessman being inspected whispered: it was the tax officer of Xi Ling City who was responsible for the work, and the three followers of his men. They wore warm sheepskin coats and rabbit ears with pheasant tail feathers to cover their ears. A pair of good-flip gloves were holding charcoal pencils and writing and drawing on the notebook. The businessman’s eyes stared at the record book, for fear of writing too many numbers on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you a knight?" asked the soldier before the roadblock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, the Cavaliers are a big gap from us." Evan smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at you is not like a businessman. So you can't pass." The soldier took out a round beetroot from his arms and put it on his mouth. One bite. "Unless you have a pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What pass? Why did Lord Drey Uther stop the road?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cavaliers are being held in the castle. In order to prevent the counterfeiters and the untouchables from disturbing the order of the game, only the knights and the merchants and farmers who deliver the goods can enter. Of course. Even if you are a businessman, you must also transport the necessary games. Things, such as eating and drinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is simply stupid to die." Evan returned to the team and said to others: "Holding the Cavaliers Should more people see it to show fairness and strength, what is the meaning of closing it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel turned to ask Yao En: "Except here Besides, where else can I cross the river?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ferry should be found upstream or downstream for two days, but can you cross the river and see the current flow? Situation. It takes the same time to get back to the right path after crossing the river.” The glasses were wiped and gave a look to Arnold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor took the horse and walked over, letting his holy emblem shine in the sun. "I don't know if the humble servant of the Mother Earth and his friends can cross the river from here? We will pray for the game and leave immediately, without disturbing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers who wanted tough and refused to shake the sacred emblem, took off the iron cap and scratched their hair, then said: "I said no, just check the knight certificate or pass. You are like this. If you get the situation, you should go to our ten commander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The soldier drew an arc with his finger. "You should fish under the bridge and let the sun shine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anomen came to the bridge after the ceremony . The group saw the ten commander at the river. He had a dagger more than the average soldier and hung on the belt with a twist. The ten commander is staring at the fish float in the river, and his concentration is more gentle than watching the child's mother. His iron hat is set aside. There are three fat fish that have been caught before, and the tail is swinging from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan Zhang wants to speak. Meng Meng was blocked by his mouth. The latter whispered: "It is annoying to disturb the angler. Do you want to cross the river?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan sucked his nose and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yao En gave Naria a look, and the female mage gently slid off the horse and grabbed a powder from the casting kit. Does she still have a wand? Siegel felt a little strange. But just take this opportunity to see her ability to cast spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is quite satisfactory. One is a useless vibrato. I am afraid that the follower has the elf dialect, but it does not affect the magic effect. Naria uses the magic of mankind. Let the ten commanders have a good impression on everyone and are willing to help. But the spells have never been so simple, but need other means to cooperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Naria’s gesture, everyone will take the horse farther away, leaving the impulsive love and the steady Yao En guards – Evan feels The river was bored and left myself - the remaining three people waited quietly until the tenth captain had a new harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good skills!" Narya said: "I didn't expect anyone on the River Faust to catch big fish with a fishing rod."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This compliment clearly received good results, and the ten husbands returned happily: "That is nature, this is my secret. It is not a soldier, my ability is also I can live a happy life with two silver coins every day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is a small problem. How do you cook these fat fish here? "Naria squinted and asked: "I didn't see the right pot nearby, and roasting with fire seems to ruin this delicious food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
