			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the new summer has gradually approached, and the best season of the year begins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is used to the rhythm of this weird war: although it was "besieged" by the elves, the city of Myrtle has never been hungry and feared, from the wall The meat and cheese that came from the west side of the mountain range made it safe to spend the whole winter and spring. There are unfinished work in the castle, blacksmiths, potters, carpenters and masons are always missing. As long as you have the right hands and feet to work, you can earn a good savings during the winter break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment when the original may not be answered, the big home did not have a warm winter in the war. The local residents of Heim’s territory don’t have much feeling, because there is no lord in this place before Siegel, they can cut wood and heat at will. But for those refugees from other places, the life of the city of Miele is unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land belongs to the lord, and trees and trees are counted. Even the dead branches that fall on the ground must be purchased from the lord before they can be used. Collecting some animal manure for burning can still be dealt with on weekdays, but in winter, heating has always been a huge expense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Miele, even if you don’t have a fire, the room is not cold. They know that it all comes from the magical Master Lord, and it is his magic that produces such a magical effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realized the benefits and generated trust, then they are not so repulsive to the golem walking in the castle, and the magician gradually surpassed the pastor as One of the choices of residents for the future development of their children. On the first day of the early summer, there was a daring child, Margot Smith, the son of the blacksmith, who came to the Federation's spell test site, hoping to become an apprentice. His magical talents are not high, and he may be able to display fireballs for the rest of his life, but it is Hem’s first apprentice apprentice, so he was taken down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis wants Siegel to personally teach the apprentice. "You are now a formal mage of the Federation. It is your responsibility to bring an apprentice. And this person is from Heim, and you teach him the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel looked at the dark fog that covered his body. When he went there, he would become a squat area, and the surrounding creatures would die. So he said: "There is nothing wrong with teaching apprentices. But you have to wait until the curse has disappeared. I am now like a personal poison, and ordinary people will die when they touch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It’s also a coincidence that his voice has just fallen and the curse has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dense fog of negative energy is still there. But it is no longer a source of continuous cross-space strikes to complement. Both wizards stunned and were somewhat uncomfortable with the sudden change. Then Idis waved his hand and mobilized the magical array of the underground library to dispel the negative energy and curse that had troubled Siegel for months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong evil spirits have finally disappeared, and the half-elf is still somewhat uncomfortable. Undead is evil. This is already a deep-rooted concept, so when he sees that there is no evil spirit in front of him, the first reaction is illusion, and the second reaction is that he has some kind of magic effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s chanting spells have “changed” himself back. His body is a little weak, his muscles are not much strength, and he has a strong feeling of **. But in any case, he lived again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will definitely teach this Maggot Smith," Siegel said with a smile to Idis: "He is lucky to bring me." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I don't object. But as a federation, there are certain rules for teaching apprentices. You can't misunderstand your children." Diss said: "But I still want to remind you that the curse of your body has disappeared. Do you know what it means?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Putting a smile off, his face became severe: "There has been no news that Sham Shui Po was breached. That is to say, the Federation itself has no problem. It is only Casper who has voluntarily closed the curse. He knows that I am not dead, maybe I will take other measures, so I have to be careful. On the other hand, Knox will have some new actions. The first turning point of the war should come."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you are the first turning point?" Idiss said with a deep smile. Siegel pretended to be incomprehensible because he would not admit that he had provoked the confrontation between the elves and the federation. Half-elves may have guesses, inferences, but no evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that you will be very busy during this time." Idis said: "Although you are a lord, but more important is the Master. Whether it is the Federation or the Masters Association, I hope to see a new star." "#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that I can reach the expectations of my predecessors," Siegel said: "The more you learn, the more you know. I am now You need to have the opportunity to practice what you have learned. The current war is a good time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis wrinkled and said: “You are now Are you ready to send troops? I am afraid that the timing is not yet mature. Whether it is an elf or a union, you are not currently able to compete. Even if you unite the power of the entire southern lord, there is no possibility."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but only now I can start to prepare for the opportunity of the future." Siegel said to Edith: "Thank you for your help and teaching during this time, I am in the library." Benefited a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also Here are new ideas, we are learning together, no one owes anyone.” The half-elves are very polite and said: “I have received the message from the elf friends, and the preparation for the reincarnation can begin. When can Janet be able to Ready?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will tell her personally, after all, it’s going to die once, and the new body will bring a lot of new problems. But I think everything will There is a good result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope so too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Edith left and left the underground library. His body has not fully recovered, so he can only rely on the defensive staff while walking, reducing the pressure on the muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-stepping on the ground, the warm sun shines on the skin, the breeze blows over the hair, like a kiss of a lover; the gray castle wall is covered with green Sprawling plants, several late flowers are still bright; the air is filled with anger, which is the smell of soil, smoke, crowds and livestock, is the taste of life. It has been a long time without such feelings, just like returning to the world again from the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked through the city gate, the guards saluted him, and the trucks that were entering the city rushed to the side. People have kneel down on one knee to show respect. "That is the Lord of the Lord." They whispered, and the people who heard the news quickly squatted, but quietly looked up and wanted to see the lord's appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel swings his hand. Signal everyone up and then speed up the pace. He saw Rhett in the courtyard of the castle, and the Golem was presiding over the wedding, blessing the young farmer and the shepherd girl. He saw that Siegel restored the human body and nodded to him. But still focused on hosting the wedding work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle is very busy, especially at the door of the warehouse. As the starting point of the Mid-Levels Commercial Road, the city of Miele deals with the entry and exit of bulk goods, the value of registration, and the distribution of transportation, but more importantly, tax collection. Only the caravans that have paid taxes in the city of Mith, with the letter of proof, can successfully pass through each castle - otherwise the inspections that only go in and out will waste a lot of time. The city of Myrtle will regularly pay for these castles, or pay with gold coins, but most castle owners like physical things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, they have gold coins. There are no other channels to buy things now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another business route is a smuggling channel that is densely covered throughout the South, quietly transporting supplies under the eyes of the elves. After all, the South is the land of mankind, and the elves have only occupied less than half a year. The southern countries, which are densely populated with river networks, trails and shortcuts, are ideal for smuggling activities. Whether it is the lord of the castle or the original wealthy merchants and nobles, they desperately need all kinds of materials and are worthy of spending gold coins. Every day's income will make Janis, who is responsible for the smuggling route, laugh at the big teeth - his first thing every morning is to pick up dentures from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Mier City mainly collected gold coins, but then began to shift to precious metals, precious stones and formed armor weapons. These things can be used to make magical equipment. After all, runestone, plasma arrows, ammunition, and newly developed magic breastplates require a lot of material. No one in the city of Mier is able to accurately count the total amount of wealth owned, but Fazak no longer has to worry about how to find gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel passed through the lively courtyard, and the guards of the castle opened the door for him. Pick up the stairs. He found Janet under the guidance of Raven Barron and then hugged her in her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are not talking, greedily breathing the breath of the other person, enjoying the feeling of having each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
