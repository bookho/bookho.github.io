			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first, Mana didn't seem to hear it, so Siegel coughed twice and caught her attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Lord Lord, recently the sound on the wall is too big, the ears are a little incompetent." The female knight said quickly. “What did you say?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We are going to go to Deepwater City.” Siegel said: “The timing is almost the same.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The orc here?" Mana just patted her head and asked her to pat her head. Recently, I have been commanding the battle continuously, and the rest is not good, but it is not the reason why the mind is stupid. The threat of the orcs is now basically lifted, and there is no need to leave many soldiers to defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black channel made by Wraith gradually loses its effectiveness under the scrub of orc life, and faults appear in many places. The ban on runes takes up a big advantage, and there are always enemies who are trying to pass the Rockfall. The Walled Mountain Range is like alive, and it begins to clear the "scorpion" that crawls on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the defense of the Black Blood Castle has become very easy and even started to become boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now some orcs are holding shields made of slate every day, or trying to pass the Black Blood Castle with their own martial arts, but their number does not pose any threat. Maybe in a few days, even the odd orcs will not have it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you leave a few hundred troops, guard against the enemy’s sneak attack, and the Warriors of the Jackdaw tribe, then this road should be innocent. . "The Lord of the Lord, lead the whole staff to leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and handed Mana a cup of Ningshen tea, then said: "Black Blood Castle Defence should be handed over to the Jackdaw tribe as much as possible, leaving a responsible, contact with the mercenary, and let the human touch reach the north of the wall as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There is a bitter cold place, is there any benefit?" Mana is a person who has been to the north of the Walled Mountain Range, knowing the harsh environment and the hustle and bustle of the people. “Is there a mine? Or a rare material?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There are slaves to be rescued, but when it comes to mercenaries, it’s only necessary to say that there are slave traders left. The money." Siegel licked the forehead, the aftermath of the elemental surge has not been completely eliminated, his head is still buzzing. Only when you drink Ningshen tea will you feel more comfortable. "You also know that those who buy and sell slaves are still very rich, aren't they?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, in truth, I am your slave pair. "?" Mana smiled. The empty cup was handed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time, I didn't expect to find a female shooter with the ability to lead. Otherwise, I really should have more money. I heard it, you are very valuable, so You'd better not go north of the Walled Mountain Range, but there is slavery.” Siegel said: “Return most of the bows to the head of Heim. Leave the cavalry and the caravan. The cavalry follows us to Deepwater. The caravan stayed and prepared to ship the goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goods?" Mana stunned: "Don't you say that the Black Blood Castle has nothing to do? How? Still returning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Giant Kerry will send him to the trophy of Deepwater City, which has 40% of Heim's collar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Siegel left the room and went back to rest, leaving only the female knight who had a big mouth and kept amazed expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day after leaving the Black Blood Castle, the rain was heavy, the flag was wet, and the robes were soaked. A strong wind blew from the east, and it brought a chill in the summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs are dying. The blocking battle of the Black Blood Castle ended with the victory of Heim. Why did this battle happen, why was it to be brought by Heim, and they were not aware of the ordinary soldiers, but they did not care. Look at the bodies of the orcs who are mountainous, they are proud of themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, after returning to the city of Miele, there is also a reward from the Lord of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the thought of this, the wind and rain have little effect on the mood, the knights comforted the horses and followed Sigel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But which lord can act like a siegel on the grassland? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see the red squid flag on the red bottom, the knight of the jackdaw tribe will take the initiative to show your identity. Passionately as a guide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have won in Deepwater City." The people of the Jackdaw tribe will say: "Khan Wang led us to defeat the elves and black-hearted businessmen!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By asking the frontline about the specific situation, Siegel finally reorganized what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Kerry led the 20,000-kilometer grassland tribes to the deepwater city, but it was convenient to stop at a few tens of miles from the city. He personally came to the city with the Guard Warriors and Scouts, and observed the Pearl of the New World, which has been in the war for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield can be basically divided into three parts. The servant of the masked lord firmly defends the east side of Deepwater City, where there are noble areas, upper towns and harbors. . With a large accumulation of Shoucheng weapons and supply channels from the sea. They barely blocked the siege team with the war tree as the core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the main direction of the elf is never here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf’s camp was set up in the south of Deepwater City, and the Master and Druids continued to launch elemental magical attacks on the defensive hood of the Three Peaks Tower. They did not seek to break this shield, but just dragged it. When both methodomists have strong defense spell protection, the so-called spell battle is a saw and consume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only elemental surge that can break through the Three Peaks Tower. There are heavy soldiers gathered here, patrolling day and night, in order to avoid the "Mage Federation" sneak attack. At the same time, in order to prevent the members of the federation from escaping, the elemental surge array also took up the task of blocking the transmission and other spells. The elves defend at the same time in the offensive game. If it is not a spell, this wonder is rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Three Peaks Tower, as the other side, has been under tremendous pressure. The mage inside can't fight, and he is not willing to go away, but the defense can't be prevented. All kinds of emotions are brewed in three towers. According to the people of the Jackdaw tribe, those mages were just cowards, and until the end they did not dare to rush out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiant element of the element illuminates the entire world, replacing the sun in the sky for a moment, becoming the only illuminator in the world. An instant collapse in the Three Peaks Tower triggered a small earthquake. Then there was a blast of explosions everywhere in the city. The flashes of various colors seemed to be the fireworks of the festival, as well as the meteors in the sky. The whole city was suddenly pierced into the key, and suddenly lost its ability to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the elves attacked the Three Peaks Tower and they thought they had won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But near Deepwater City. There is an unaffected team: Jackdaw. The jackdaw is the god bird who sings on the body and sings victory. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to Siegel’s plasma smashing to Kerry, all the smog and self-ignition, the Prairie tribe still maintains full combat capability. The giant Kerry Ling flashed a light and decisively led the entire army to charge. Such as the wolves generally kill the city of deep water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first rushed to the camp where the elves were outside the city. The nomadic cavalry is divided into ten teams, like ten sharp knives, directly cut into the elf body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elemental Surge treats all magical effects, casters, and magical items equally, with only a few exceptions. For example, artifacts such as ice and ice guns are unscathed. The sprite's caster also hid in a specially designed circle beforehand, avoiding the destruction effect of the surge. But the surge has just ended. The energy of the surrounding elements is not stable. Casting a spell still takes a lot of risk. If you don't pay attention, you will inhale too much energy, which will lead to death beyond the body's tolerance. In the same way, all magic items are safe if they are not used. Once they are picked up, they may cause an explosion at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf can only fight with the ordinary weapons and the cavalry of the Jackdaw tribe, and there is no spell support from the Master, the Priest, and the Druid. The situation in the Druid is better. They can still be transformed. The pastor has no problem with the heavy armor. Only the wizard wizards are the most pitiful. You can only pick up the longbow that you haven't used for a long time and do some remote support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they face the saury of the Jackdaw tribe, like the intensive saber of the leaves in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
