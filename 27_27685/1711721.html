			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ximu Town is located on Wangdong Cliff and is divided into upper and lower floors. Most of the hotels, coaching stations and houses are on the upper level of the cliff top, while the harbour is naturally at the bottom of the cliff. There are cascades of stairs and staggered cranes between the two districts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a seaport city, the streets of Ximu Town have always been bustling with people. People talked loudly, laughed and laughed, and exchanged goods from the old and new continents here. Everyone has something to do: the coolies are crawling up and down the goods, the merchants exchange information to discuss the price, and the smugglers look at them. The gangsters use their eyesight to judge who is a fat sheep and who can't. In the corner of the port, I don’t know who’s body is lying in the drain, the whole body is being foraged by a group of mice. People don't care about these things. They think that "if no one reports the case, then he is not worthy of being cared for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk here on the crowded pub street, It is often seen that two or three patrol guards are dressed in bright yellow leather armor, equipped with short sticks and small wooden shields. These people are patrols of Ximu Town, organized by the Federation of Merchants to maintain the legal business order here, and they are called “squirrels” by the residents here. If there are pirate attacks or robbers appearing here, there will be another group of people who will fight for the battle under the driving of gold coins, that is, "mercenaries." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business people don’t like mercenaries because they always like to rob fires and raise prices; residents don’t like mercenaries because they always make troubles, bullying and fearing "Weasels" don't like mercenaries because they are always vulgar and violent, and even the pub owners don't like mercenaries, especially when they are drunk. It is estimated that the only mercenaries in the whole town have a good impression, but even this is because the mercenaries are too strong and have a discount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the stew at the Storm Night Inn, Siegel has no good impression of Ximu Town. Every time he arrives by boat, he will follow the old captain to the pub, eat a large pot of stew here, drink a half drunk, then squat back to the boat - this time the old captain will always Accompany him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the hotel is called Timothy. He used to be a mercenary and a seaman. Later, he used the earned money to open the hotel in Ximu Town. He and the old captain are familiar with each other and are said to have gone out to sea, but that must be the thing before the lucky Sos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel owner will prepare a large pot of stew every day to serve the guests. The stew is made from large pieces of meat, liver, various fresh vegetables, and apples and pears. They are all things that cannot be found at sea. The beds here are soft and comfortable, and there are several hammock rooms with fireplaces. Despite the expensive fees, the seafarers who are big and big still like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, in addition to the two drunken drunks in the store, only one guest of Siegel. Timothy, with a red, shiny distiller's nose, smeared his hand on the oily apron on his chest, and placed a pot of freshly prepared hodgepodge in front of the young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black hair kid, why didn't you see your jazz master? Are you on vacation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I can rest today. Sir Bill has his own things to deal with." Siegel stuffed his mouth with a spoon and used to practice too much. He was always hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slowly eat, don't lie, no one is robbing you." The boss asked the errand child to bring a large can of ale and hand it to Siegel. Seoul. “Is life on land still adapted? Are there any dangers?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Everything is fine, I have learned a lot.” Er smiled and replied: "I have a dividend for the first time, a total of 5 gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can put it, don't tell others. I do When the mercenary was hiding the money, it was safe to retire and opened such a hotel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This hotel is the best!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a big man who believes," the boss replied with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drunken customer’s voice screamed in the belly and was heard by the keen boss. He is too familiar with such people, knowing that it is the sound that they need to empty their stomach when they wake up. The boss took a big step, holding a customer's collar in one hand, and threw the two guys on the road outside the door before they vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who can think of those noble knights who are not as powerful as mercenaries?” The trader argued with consistently savvy words. “I knew that it would be better to spend some gold coins for a group of people to die.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chamber of Commerce can then lower the price of vegetables and show a good heart?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, dear Timothy Uncle, the price that goes up can be earned from the customer. What loss do you have? The seafarers are willing to spend money, and they are not good at arithmetic, they don’t care, they don’t care if you have collected a few copper plates or It’s two silver coins.” The merchant smashed the hand and took out the cabbage from the basket: “You see, although the price has gone up, it’s still fresh.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel quickly finished eating a large pot of stew and felt more comfortable. It’s not a good day to sleep outside, but there’s nothing to complain about to make money. This time, he was a small earner with Sir Bill’s annihilation of the Kobold’s robbers. In addition to selling the long stick with the ball of light, Siegel had a total of six gold coins. The jazz told him that one of them was for eating and drinking, and the other five dividends allowed him to buy some suitable equipment at will. Siegel felt that he was very rich, so he put a silver coin under the pot as the cost of the stew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will worry about you with contempt and weapons. You can buy something else." Sir Bill told him before breaking up: "Little sister, think about you." What have you done, what can you afford and which ones have to be prepared? Let's meet at the Storm Night Inn three days later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;西格I touched the backpack and there was plenty of room to hold things. After all, I only stuffed a few books. These books are all spoils, from the backpack of the caster. These things can't sell any money. After all, the weapons store owner has no interest in books, so they are left to Siegel. Using the keys found in handsome bald boots, he opened the only book that was locked. It was a spell book filled with obscure symbols and weird words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old captain once told him that the pirates would use secret language to deliver messages, such as which cargo ships are worth starting, and where are their headings. Siegel estimates that the book is also written in a secret language. He will read these books in his free time, then try to unlock the secret words and play games. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old captain told him many things, "the treasures of the West, the secrets of the world" and the like. But there are still too many unknowns hidden around Siegel, including his life. Every time I see my face in the basin or bronze mirror, the natural black hair and pupil, what kind of parents can give birth to this kind of child? Siegel has never seen it, and has never even heard of similar facial features. The old captain pushed everything to God, which did explain a lot of things, but God never doubted Siegel. Only the twentieth scorpion kept reminding Siegel of this problem. After coming to Ximu Town, he discovered the change of the scorpion, and the color of the number one changed. When Siegel touched his fingers, he had a strange feeling and realized his own physical changes - spell resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this ability that allows him not to fall under the thief's spells, but also to quickly respond to the ability to fight. However, Siegel also understands that such resistance is not a panacea, recovery requires a painful process and consumes a lot of physical strength - still only continue to improve the quality of the body in order to survive better. The old captain once said that many races are inherently resistant to spells, such as dwarves, elves (the old captain remembers the wrong, the elf is the spell affinity), and he also said that all gods are not afraid of spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is very happy that he can have this kind of resistance, and finally there is more than one ability to protect himself, nothing bad. He is also thinking that there are so many faces in the scorpion, can he still get any magical power? The only pity is that he does not know how this power is motivated. It is perhaps one of the triggering conditions to guess the situation of life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s adventurous life does not mean that he likes to die. So you have to prepare a variety of items before each action. He dare not like the protagonist in the story, dare to jump off the cliff or go to the dragon's lair without any preparation - he still wants to live, and does not want to become a poetry in the population of the poetry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a grocery store not far from the storm night, you can buy a variety of things. When he was a seaman, Siegel often visited here and bought things like ropes, fishing rods and hammocks. Now that he has become a knight, he is still coming in for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Push the wooden fence door and touch the crisp ringtone. The grocery store was full of things, from the floor to the roof, armor, weapons, various containers, tools and wine bottles mixed together, and some were covered with dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, welcome you, the squid's child!" The gnome vigorously embraced Siegel and said: "You grow taller and become stronger. I really envy your black hair, if I have it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Ding Bao-Turan, I have something to look at here, and buy some sundries by the way."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...oh! I am so sad!" The gnome opened his mouth and looked insulted: "We are so familiar, you actually called me the full name! Oh... It’s too far away, too strange! My chest hurts!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that your nickname called 陂 duck has something to call? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love to listen, and will give you a discount for this." The gnome twisted and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, duck, show me this jewel." Siegel said weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gemstone was finally valued at 20 gold coins, which is a common trophy for the team and needs to wait until the jazz comes back to distribute. Another jewel is at the Jazz, and Siegel thinks the Jazz will find another way to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need a rope with a hook, a new flint, a torch and a canvas. If you have a fishing net here, give me a strong one. The kind of tuna."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, you have to go out to sea? I heard that you have lived on land. Didn’t the Soss have already left? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time is for netizens, not for catching fish." Siegel replied: "I met the enemy, but my martial arts is still only In general, I can only think of other methods. I have been pondering these days. If there is a strong fishing net, I will put the enemy inside and cover it easily!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good idea, I wish you success." The gnome clap his hands, put down the fishing net at hand, and turned to walk deep into the house. What Sigel wants is actually a net, a thing that gladiators and barbarians like to use. Ordinary fishing nets can't help but violently tear, and it's hard to control the enemy. The net is specially prepared for catching slaves or hunting large quadruped creatures. The price is much more expensive than fishing nets - but the ducks won't say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you need for the squid's child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no idea. "Siegel clap his hands, he has already sorted out the half-packages, always thinking about his own weight." "Do you have any introduction?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you wear your own armor?" The gnome said, "Always have a layer of protection."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the simplest thick cloth also needs 8 gold coins, I can't afford it." Siegel replied: "Sir is very caring for me, and will not let me go to the battlefield for the time being. So I just need to be smart, don't get the attention of the enemy, it's safe. Besides, I have never seen other knights in Ximu Town to be able to wear armor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "That's because they don't have a gnome friend called 陂 duck. Remember, don't tell others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the grocery store owner squats black Sending young people, he took him to the warehouse behind the store, where things piled up like mountains, and several other gnomes were sorting out these things and registering them. These people saw Siegel coming in, raised his head and waved to say hello to him: "You must be the child of the squid, it looks weird and interesting, welcome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The scorpion duck pointed at a pile of worn armor, which contained leather armor, leather armor, chain armor and scales. All of them were returned from the battlefield. The damage was serious, and the size and style were varied. The gnome explained that there are many such broken armor in the spoils brought back by the adventurers, but they can't sell a few dollars. If you simply treat these things as scrap iron to the blacksmith shop, the price is very low, and it is not enough to bring back the cost. Grocery shops add value to recover these items, picking out useful parts and detachable parts, leaving only the pure metal scraps thrown into the blacksmith shop to maximize value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recycling is a question at the university." The gnome shook his fingers proudly. "I can rely on this secret to earn money!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you want to give me a discount?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
