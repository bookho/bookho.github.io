			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning when a sun was covered by clouds, the army led by Heim, including a thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry, set foot on the Mid-Levels Road. Go to the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second group of soldiers who have set off in recent days. The guns of the soldiers squint under the pale yellow morning light and sway with the neat pace. . Siegel watched them go and watched them around with vigilance. Fortunately, the time when the Falcon appeared, the elf could not see this direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East of the Elf Camp has also attacked the Anonymous Resistance Organization, which has drawn their attention. But for the sake of safety, the team still has to keep the maximum possible quiet. Every forty people or so, there is a soldier responsible for holding the silent runestone, as far as possible to eliminate the voice of the march. Runestone is placed on a device similar to the elemental scepter, and energy can be supplied by the energy focusing lens array within the Heim collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood in an arrow tower on the outer wall and observed the elf camp with a telescope through the shooting hole. Those keen creatures seem to be unaware of what happened in the city of Mith. They are still caring for plants, maintaining weapons or praying, exactly the same as every day before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the Elf Lia, and went to the shooting range to practice archery in the morning. This is not right! Siegel wants to tell her. As a general, you should try to beat your opponent, try your best to find the enemy's weaknesses, and fight mercilessly. Rather than holding the advantage, I think I can wait until the victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White feather arrows accurately hit the bullseye, just like the previous six arrows - Leah relies on such things to relax. She understands Siegel's character. Since he has not surrendered, he will certainly act. The city of Miele always has the voice of training. The falcons of the Druids have been scouted. Those knights used to defend the city and the attack can also achieve the results, but they will eventually be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of runestones has risen recently, and his energy must be completely occupied by these things? According to the priest of the moon god, Siegel's runes have reached the level of production of elite craftsmen, and the quality is stable and fast. Although a lot of gems were paid for this. But it is still worthwhile to be able to tie the hands and feet of a mage lord and benefit the elves on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea knows that this peaceful situation will not last long, and the decisive battle in Deepwater City is about to start. When Knox joins the cancer, when it needs to be removed, the largest human city in the New World will be occupied by the elves. After the Three Peaks Tower. It will be the hub of the town and the town of Ximu, it will be the Heim collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she planned to secretly visit Siegel after the victory of the Battle of Deepwater City, persuaded him to surrender and leave the New World in a decent way. He wants to learn magic. The Masters Association is a better place. As for the funds needed for learning, how much he can take away, the elves will not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When thinking about this, the arrow in the hand is finally shot - every day is the first nine hits, the tenth off the target. "If all hits, there is no room for improvement." She smiled and explained to the elf next to her, then ended her warm-up and walked to the Temple of the Moon, and she prayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Siegel has adjusted the direction of the telescope and looked at his army. Sir Mana personally led the army. The sergeant and the half-orc Deva brothers rode side by side. They wore gray-white magic breastplates, and the helmets were deliberately not polished, reducing the risk of being discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs took up more than half of the number of people in Heim’s army, and never trained during the day, so the elves did not know their true number. Their natural strength and physical fitness are superior to human beings. Together with enough food and rigorous training, they have long been able to exert their potential. In the telescope, they are tall and handsome, and the thick body hair is full of strong muscles, and the robes are full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsequent cavalry is basically human - the horse does not like the atmosphere of the half-orcs. It is very difficult to train, only a few orcs will have a docile mount. It is still unknown how much the cavalry can play in the north. The main purpose of Siegel is to let them learn from the cavalry of the Jackdaw tribe, and to be responsible for investigation and cover on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cover the march. Banshan Commercial Road suspended all cargo transportation a week ago and cleared the road. Siegel’s messenger visited all the castle lords and handed a personal letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim is going to support the battle in Deepwater City, and Siegel is going to do the duty of a blocked baron. The good relationship allowed the lords to agree to Heim’s request and allow his troops to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will stay in the city of Mire and continue to paralyze the spirit of the elves." He explained this to Mana and Zucker. "You set out first, set up a camp, inquire about intelligence, and contact the Jackdaw tribe as soon as possible to act together. Their goal is deep water city, and you have another mission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't go to Deepwater City?" asked Keke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go, but first of all to ensure the safety of the road." Siegel said: "There is a wrath of the south, forcing the forbidden knot of the walled mountain range. In the world, you have to scout the situation there. There will be a second time for the first time. Think about who is in the north of the mountain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana The arrangement of Siegel was already known in the Jackdaw Tribe. After the orcs’ victory in the last battle, there was no reason not to plunder when the Deepwater City was weak. Through the Dragon Knights, the Knox Association can also mobilize this huge army. Siegel concluded that in the case of a bad situation, the Commonwealth would probably lead the orcs to the walls of the city, borrow their power to deal with the elves, and turn the two races into a tribal war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wants to get the final victory, it must stop this happening. Therefore, Deepwater City is going to go, but first of all, we must ensure that the city walls are not out of condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the dwarf’s forbidden rune enchantment still covers most of the mountains, and there are not many places where the orcs can pass. Siegel and Kerry’s soldiers should be able to build defensive positions and use terrain to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing with these people who set off today, Heim’s army mobilized a total of 5,000 troops, compared with elves and orcs, but they are not eye-catching, but they The level of training is very high. Unlike other lords, the peasant soldiers only took up the weapons at the beginning of the war. These people who were led by Heim were trained according to the standards of the gram, and in some respects were higher than the requirements of the Cavaliers. They are very focused on practicing two kinds of equipment: spears and bows, and familiar with the use of shields and armor. Zuck did not require them to master all kinds of weapons like the knights, and even the use of long swords has not been taught, but puts harsh demands on the spears and bows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope these will help them through this war. Siegel thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mercenaries and caravans will bring equipment to help you build fortifications, so your goal is to find out the situation of the walls and orcs as soon as possible." He patted the shoulders of Zucker and said to him: "The half-orcs on the other side of the mountain. If you can still contact, let them also participate. There are still many places in Heim's collar to place them, and the ghosts and swamps are fertile. Very."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers marched silently, like the torrent of steel. When the sun dispels the morning fog and finally illuminates the world. The army led by Heim has disappeared into the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to leave with them, Siegel put away the telescope and touched the raven's feathers. During this time of being trapped in the city of Mire, Baron’s lack of activity has become fat. Although the feathers of the whole body are still bright, but the hand can be pressed to feel the soft body. The raven made an unsatisfied roar, but did not resist. It has long learned to speak, but never used it in front of Siegel. The two lives are one, and the language communication is too slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember the mercenary leaders I saw the day before yesterday?" Siegel said to the devil: "I don't know what Janis has found." What kind of person is it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim’s collar has only two years of establishment time, and it can only be considered a newborn in the New World. Although he has won in several wars, he has gained a reputation. But it has never been a place that mercenaries like. There are half-orcs, gnomes and many wandering half-elves, which are considered a barbaric and chaotic place. The lord is so young, only twenty years old, only the experience of seafarers and mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a mercenary leader, either embarrassed or smart, not just martial arts prestige. They tested him in their own way. Lu Bo of the Golden Blades only sent his second deputy to come and claimed that nothing was involved, but just listened to the excitement; although the big fat man of the Rock Sheep Brigade, Rogfo, talked and laughed, but always used others. He said that he did not mention anything useful; Mei Mo, the female head of the cloak team, tried to seduce Siegel during the meeting. And hinted that the beautiful female swordsman around her can join the game together; the strong man Luo Qiong nodded and promised, has been constantly loyal, like the pioneer of Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is very calm and polite, but also has the majesty of the lord. Two large fire elements came in. The door of the hall was slammed shut. In addition to the slight sunlight coming in through the windows, only the dazzling red flame of the fire element is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
