			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I left here, the village had just experienced the war, and the orcs ransacked here and established a camp. Later, the mountain cavalry destroyed the orcs here, but did not wait for the residents to return to their homes, and they were attacked by grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They arrived at noon, and they could look around with a cold chill. The field in the square circle has long been a scorched earth, and the house has only the remains of burnt black. The white snow can't cover the black that symbolizes the ruin, and can only cover the bodies of livestock that have long been rotten and only bone fragments are left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol kicks the horse and walks to the front of the team. "There is nothing moving here, no one has been here for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked up at the mountain. "Is it not a black blood castle that has not recovered?" , still empty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this question can only be known after going up the mountain. When Prince Aaron was evacuated, he took away the Viscount Broomer-Slinker, but after arriving in Deepwater City, there was no more information about him. At the time, Siegel accepted the title of the Knights of Deepwater City and was avoiding contact with the prince and his party, so he did not ask the Viscount of the slinker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if you want to come to the Starry Kingdom, you will not let this person who tries to kidnap the prince, and he will probably take him to the sea to return home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrians began to ride up the road and finally saw traces of creatures in the mountains. Some half-orcs who did not know where they came from occupied this good place to cover the wind. They built the house with the wood found in the ruins and the stone from the local, and the pieces of rags that were patched together made the roof. When they heard the sound of the hooves, they had already hid, leaving only the fire that was too late to extinguish, a can of hot soup with steam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor jumped off the horse and walked into the temporary camp with a long sword. "The bird is stewed inside, it may be a crow, and the other is grass roots and sweet rods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give them a small packet of salt, then Keep on the road,” Siegel said. “We know at least one good news. It has not been occupied by the orcs.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are orcs here, these Residents will certainly be caught as slaves. There is no possibility of living in a shack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Blood Castle is now home to crows and lynxes, and they look at the three climbers with a sly look. A yellow and gray, the Bobcats, about the size of a hound, tried to attack them from a height. As a result, Elijah was nailed to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of the Bobcats stunned the crow. They fluttered and screamed. Their feathers are connected into black clouds, as if the resentment reunited to the zenith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people are not interested in the current situation of Black Blood Castle, and turn to the horse's head to go deep into the mountains. They walked through the narrow valley and walked for two days and finally turned into the dwarf's prison dragon city. Here as always. There is no change, but the white snow pile makes this place solemn and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am looking for an old friend." Siegel said: "There will be no danger, you are waiting for me outside."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elf Lia nodded, she gathered the horses to one place, and then used the ranger's magic to appease these tired animals. Moore untied the baggage and used a long sword to open the wooden fence left by the camp. He has to make a lot of fire and prepare dinner for the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boiled lamb and roast rabbits with fennel and onions, these ingredients are taken out of the space bag as fresh as they are, and there are bright red apples and Oranges can be given to the elves. Moore burned the fire while carefully warming the food. Siegel still didn't come out until the night was deep and the stars were filled with the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms. Lia, the Lord Lord will not have anything to do?" Moore asked with some concern. "This time he has to face the Golem again. Is it a danger if the Golem like Dragon Lion Cliff is not dangerous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, he has "Lian smiles and comforts the young waiter Moore: "Siegel's greatest strength lies in his ability to judge dangerously and react instantly. I remember that when practicing martial arts, he could not complete the pace of the elves many times. Seeing that you will lose your defense, but you can always regain balance and turn the tide at a critical moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Later, he destroyed the Freedom Knights and built the exquisite and beautiful city of Mire. When the army led by Hilo started the war, he was surprisingly successful, and he won the victory without paying any casualties. It took only one year. Our Heim collar has been able to stand in the South, no one will look down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Liya nodded and said: "In fact, the next war The test is the key to everything. If Siegel can persist in the day of victory, his rise will be unstoppable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol blinked. Curiously asked: "Is this the prophecy of the elf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leah shook her head, "I have no power to predict." This is just her feeling. "Do you want to continue to wait? If you want to sleep at this time, I don't need to rest for so long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant shook his head, he It seems that there is no sleepy. "Right!" He suddenly said: "Ms. Lia, do you want to drink some red tea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At this time?" The elf shook his head: "If you don't sleep, then I will begin to meditate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meditation of the elves is similar to that of human beings, but it is shallower and can wake up at any time. Moore racked himself into a small pot, boiled the tea with boiling water, and savored it in the stars and the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know when he slept, but when he woke up, everything was safe, and he was still wearing a blanket. Elijah is using the embers to warm the rest of the food last night, and she smiles at Moore with a goodwill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning fog in the valley, but all the winds turned into frost when the north wind blows. Moore only thought that this was much colder than usual, and he quickly added firewood to increase firepower. At this time, there was a slight vibration on the ground, which seemed to be a heavy and slow pace. Then, Siegel walked out of the hole and his face was full of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the Master, Rhodes, who is covered with moss and mushrooms, slowly walks out. It covered the morning sun with his hands, stood on the edge of the shadow of the hole and thought about it, turned back and went back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked back and found that the demon carefully chopped down the dirt on his body, even with the mushrooms and moss, in the corner from the wind and wind . This makes it much smaller, but the action is obviously a lot more flexible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello. Someone is called Rhett. If you see it, it is a golem." It snorted and said: "The Master persuaded someone to be a healer." So someone decided to follow it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Lia looked up and down the big man. From the manufacturing process point of view, this is definitely the work of the dwarf. But in many places, the style of the dragon's coat of arms is revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard of a certain magical image, but I can see it for the first time." Lia stood by the magic image and used it. Her hand touched the body of earth and metal, and asked: "Which god do you believe in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone doesn't know the name of the god." He shakes Shaking his head, his voice expressed his doubts and puzzles. "Someone only knows that life is very precious. It is more important than anything else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ryder's situation is special, it is derived from ideas rather than teachings. "The faith." Siegel said: "I will build a temple for you in the city of Mith, there is no temple of the holy emblem. Wait until that day you can be inspired to know the name of the gods you believe, then consider hanging the holy "The thing of the emblem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Master will keep his promise." Rhett said: "Someone will follow the promise."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the battle of Dragon Lion Cliff, convincing the Golem has become a relatively simple matter. Before Siegel had made a draft, he used his religious knowledge to persuade Rhett, hoping that it could use its power to protect life and protect the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prison Dragon Valley was also affected when the Wraith enveloped the Walled Mountain Range and the Black Blood Castle. Many grievances penetrated the thick mountain wall and accidentally hit the area where Rhett was. These undead have no way to take the magic. Can only continue to send out an unpleasant bark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder carefully observed and eventually used the Holy Light to drive away these grievances. If there are still creatures in the cave, it will definitely be possessed by the grievances, losing control and killing each other. Rhett understood this, so he would join Siegel's team in order to prevent the spread of evil on the basis of serving the weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
