			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s interest in the kingdom of the dwarf is even stronger, and he can’t wait to support him to continue climbing on the stone ladder. On the snow line, the stone ladder will be covered with snow all the year round. After a round of heavy pressure, the snow in some places has become ice. The whole ladder is as smooth and round as crystal, which is very difficult to climb. Siegel carefully crouched on the steep mountain wall, sometimes even using the chin as a fulcrum to help maintain balance. The sickle is the extension of his arm, assisting him to break the ice, stop it step by step, slowly and carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is very long and can't be a bit wrong. On several occasions, Siegel wanted to speed up the movement, but the result of slipping under his feet made him wake up. He turned his head and looked down. The wind was rolling and the snow was blinded. He couldn't see the slow path of Panshan. Just a few steps below his feet, there was only the air of snowflakes, nothing else. The elf master once said that the ring road that the dwarfs have opened is much better. Many of the lots are tunnels that penetrate the mountain and can avoid the wind and snow and get a chance to breathe. But this stone ladder has always been exposed, always in the worst environment, and the harsh test always exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is even more obvious as he climbs over the boundaries of the clouds: clouds with snow flakes roll around, and two or three steps in front of him are the limits of his vision. The ice on the narrow stone ladder whispers, and often changes direction, as if there are many big hands to tear people out. Here, the hot air that is exhaled from the mouth will soon freeze on the face, making the skin painful and swollen. Although he put his head around the black crepe, Siegel still felt that his eyes were freezing. He often stops and closes his eyes, or rubs his eyelids through black ray to generate heat, which can barely maintain his vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is biting, this sentence has fully demonstrated the power. If it is not as early as the whole body is coated with butter, Siegel will soon be killed by frostbite. Sometimes he feels numb and his muscles are shaking. Whenever this happens, he will take out the spirits from his arms and take a sip to re-ignite the flames in his chest and abdomen to support his physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very difficult test, but there is no retreat, only to stick to the teeth. In the fatigue, Siegel felt that the lungs did not seem to work, and how to breathe hard did not get air. He also had the illusion that he had frozen with the mountains and would be left here forever. The most dangerous time is another illusion: Siegel once felt that he was still climbing, and his hands and feet were moving hard, but in fact he stopped at the place and did not move. Muscles make the illusion of doing the same movement for a long time. His mind feels the fatigue of the body and wants to rest. He also condone the deception of this feeling. Siegel will almost sleep on the mountain road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the whistling wind roused him violently, he did not let him fall into the sleep of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the cloud, the snow is much smaller, but the cold is getting worse. The snow flakes are blown from under the feet, making it difficult to grasp the balance. Siegel always feels that his body is swaying. Without the cover of the clouds, the reflection of the sun on the top of the snow is extremely glaring, and the white swaying does not dare to look around. Siegel almost has his nose against the mountain wall, his eyes only staring at the nearest step, moving up step by step, and squeezing out the last strength of the body. Many times he thought he would definitely die on this mountain road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he climbed the platform of the door of the Dwarf Kingdom of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a natural cave in the mountain. The hole is more than 50 meters high and more than 200 meters wide. It is like a huge open snow mountain. mouth. The dwarf used this as the entrance to the kingdom, using the stone that has not been damaged for a long time to build the city wall, and used the fine gold to cast the door of "never fall." Outside the gate is a platform paved with a whole piece of rock. On the side close to the mountain road, the area where the goods are stacked is left, and the other side is completely empty, and the cargo or the traveler is not allowed to approach. There is an alloy dwarf column in the center of the open space, and there are seven supporting feet at the bottom. Each foot is engraved with the family crest of one of the seven clan members of the year. On the short column, there is a fist-sized diamond that is perfectly cut into 80 faces, emitting a ray of light, and everyone's sight will be taken away. This is one of the pride of Mora's scorpion. Whenever there are three dwarf guards guarding the guards, they wear black body heavy armor, and the armor is inlaid with secret silver, gems and mysterious runes, which are easily recognizable. They look at the sky outside the platform alone, one looks at the passage in front of the kingdom gate, and the last one will always look at the diamond itself. They hold the flags that symbolize the three top clan signs, and the other hand use the dwarf sword shield - a special weapon for attack and defense. In addition to changing the guard, they will stand like a rock and ignore the other things happening on the platform. These three guards have only one purpose: to meet the brave who can climb from the ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel climbed up, he almost fainted, and he didn't notice the three dwarf guards. At that time, he only wanted to lie on the ground and stretch his limbs. He has been closing his eyes because of pain in his eyes. So when he opened his eyes and saw three pure black armor, there was a big beard that could be dragged to the ground under the helmet. Especially when the six eyes were shining, it was really a big jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, brave, through the real treasure, we have witnessed the process of your climbing, you will be called the Dragonfighter!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf lifted him up, asked his name, wrapped him a large gold belt, and fixed the three-shot flag behind him. The dwarves around are cheering, and the news of the new ‘Dragons’ will soon spread. His name, his appearance and his feats will be known to every dwarf of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has the opportunity to look at the mountains. At the foot of the mountain, you can't see the top of the mountain. You can only see the peaks in the clouds. Climbing up the hill and looking down, the scenery is very different. The sun was laid on the white snow clouds, and for a time Siegel created the illusion of being on the sea. Through the gap between the clouds, he can see the vast land and see the village towns as small as rice. If you look up, the summit of Mora is not far away, as the giant is as majestic. A strong wind blew, and the snow fluttering on the peak was like stretching a white flag. Like the magnificent sea, the majestic mountains and high mountains are also a wonder. Siegel stood on the edge of the cave, leaning against the winding mountains, facing the endless sky and the vast land, shouting hard and expressing the ecstasy of the heart. The scream of Mora echoed him and made a deafening roar, triggering an avalanche. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel scratched his head and looked at the dwarf nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, you can rest assured." The dwarf is not in a hurry: "The tunnels are built in places where avalanches are prone to occur, and no pedestrians are injured." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if you have seen a lady, her name is Lia-Amastasia. She is my master, we are here. Find the dwarf..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking for the dwarf Elinette - Invincible - Diamond!" A sound blew like a thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked over and saw that the Elf Master was standing behind a "huge" dwarf. The reason why the dwarf is described in this way is that he has the same shape as a water tank, and he is two times thicker than the average dwarf. But this is not a dwarf who has become fat because of his preference for ale. On the contrary, he is very strong, his arms are thicker than Siegel's thighs, and his thighs are really like stone pillars. The dwarf is bald, and the skull is covered with antifreeze oil, which shines in the sun. His hair may have all grown on his face, and the thick, lush red beard was braided into seven braids that hang down the dwarf belt. He was wearing a bear fur coat and came up to give Siegel a warm hug. Siegel only felt that the whole body was locked tightly, and it was harder to break away than being smothered by the eater. Many places were very painful. After the dwarfs had finished their addiction, Siegel was dragged by him to the gold gate of the kingdom, accompanied by Irene's shouting: "This is my friend! Siegel-Squid, the brave!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarfs cheered again in unison, and Leah smiled and applauded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irenet lives on the third floor of the top and bottom of the Mora, which is the exclusive area of ​​the three great clan. The gem clan has a continuous cave here and transforms them into beautiful accommodation. The stout marble columns support the top of the cave and are separated into functionally different rooms by thick masonry walls. There are many gemstones inlaid on the walls, and the stove burns and makes the room shine brightly. In the middle of the room is a huge long tablecloth with a tiger-plain wood. It is 20 meters long and can seat fifty people. Elinett is fulfilling his promise here and entertaining his best friends. Most of the people who are seated are his relatives, and his apprentices help. The excited little dwarves ran around and slammed their elders, which made Siegel think of a pool game that seafarers often play. All the dwarves wanted to come and say hello to him, patted him excitedly, shouted "Dragon and Brave" and congratulated him. Too many dwarfs' faces are covered with hair and they don't see the look at all. For foreigners, especially for Siegel, he can only rely on the beard to distinguish the difference between the two dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table is full of delicacies, the meat is piled up into mountains, the cheese is cut into large pieces, and the big bone soup in the saucepan is sizzling and aroma. Five golden crispy fat sheep, biting apples in their mouths, and screaming at the surrounding dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarf children always want to reach out to those who are delicious, but this is not allowed. The next adult will pick up the naughty child and throw it out. The dwarf was very determined, and the skin was thick and thick, and the children who had been thrown out rolled and rolled and laughed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
