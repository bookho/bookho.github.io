			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trolls smiled and took the dagger, then quit the cell, and the gnome rushed over to lock the door with a chain. "Give them better food, take some clothes and blankets." The trolls kicked the gnome and said, "Give them some gold syrup, which is good for fighting cold."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel didn't get the chance to get out of here, but he has more things. First he had clothes, shabby clothes with feathers and hay in the linen, and then a clay pot to store the porridge every day; he had a basket, made of curved branches. Cheng, the gnome always puts the black bread in the basket and uses it as a plate. In addition, he gets a skin pouch every day, which contains enough "golden syrup" to drink two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The succulent half-orc has been stopping Siegel from drinking gold syrup, but he does not care about other things. Siegel made preparations for himself, hiding some useful materials in the sleeping corner. One day, Siegel lied that the soup was too light, and he must put a lot of salt, but the next day he said that the salt was put more, the cook must be a fool. The gnome echoed with the consent, and the result was seized by Siegel: "You will bring some salt for me tomorrow, I will add it to the porridge. Otherwise..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel did not say much, he left a lot of imagination for the gnome. The next day he had a small packet of coarse salt. So he took off the dry branches on the basket, sprinkled the salt, and sang a curse while swaying. The branches quickly dehydrated and turned into gray-black carbon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘With charcoal, I can use most of the flame spells. Siegel made a small cloth bag with torn open clothes, and tied the mouth with the loose thread, and the charcoal was stored there. He made three such small bags, one hidden in the body, one hidden in the sleeping place, one hidden in the snowdrift of the window. Snow is a natural desiccant that prevents water from seeping into the bag as long as it does not begin to melt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice is the easiest thing to get. Siegel has clay pots, snow outside the window and enough low temperature, so he has a few pieces of crushed ice. At present, it is not the time to turn crushed ice into a skate, and a lot of work is carried out with half-orcs. The green eyes are always shining, and there are very few breaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel managed to get some fat, which made him store fat. He smashed some of the linen threads and made them fluffy, like the cotton that was broken. The availability of nitrate is relatively time consuming and requires daily urine to the wall, and the powdery crystals are scraped off after drying. When Siegel did this thing, the half-orc was like seeing a ghost, hiding in the corner and saying: "Zike, Zucker." Siegel couldn't explain, would you give half? Do orcs popularize alchemy knowledge? This subject is rarely studied even in the Masters Association. Most people will focus on the practice of spells. Therefore, the borrowing cost of alchemy books is very low, which is suitable for Siegel. It's also fun to make your own casting materials, but because of the lack of purity, you must have extra fine control when casting spells. However, with the idea of ​​meditation, it is possible to exercise both brain and hands-on skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel patiently prepared, he also found dead spiders, beetle shells in the cell, and found broken bones from the food, which were carefully collected by him. . The trolls had once come down once during this time, let Siegel reach out to see his injury. With the help of the healing potion, the wrist has begun to recover and the new meat has grown. The trolls thought it was the effect of the golden syrup, and they nodded and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Siegel guessed that his injury had healed, he might have to be taken away from the cell. Although the things he prepared can be hidden in the key space, the new environment is not suitable for escape. He decided to try it when he got into the night - all the materials were hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome carries a porridge bucket, and there is also a fat pottery jar - there is goat milk, which is given every three days. Some of Siegel. Siegel took his can, walked over to pick up the goat's milk, and "inadvertently" shattered the jar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All blame me." Siegel said: "Or do you hand me the cans in your hand."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jar containing the goat's milk is thicker than the railing, and the gnome has failed several times. He subconsciously reached out and touched his hand and yanked back his hand. "I am going to get you a new can, and wait a moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good, the gnome carries the key to the cell, confirms this, so it starts action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled. He found the shell of the beetle, kissed him, and then recited the summoning spell. A frosty horned worm appeared out of the door and forced the pygmy body to the side of the railing. Siegel reached out and rummaged through the pocket where the gnome had just reached out and tried to touch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to go out?" Siegel looked at the half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼克!" The Orc stood up and stood behind Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolved the summoned beetle, Siegel turned the key, and the door was quickly opened. He easily touched the iron chain that bound the door of the cell, which could be a good weapon like a whip. Siegel naturally did not forget the clay pot fragments on the ground, and several of the more sharp fragments could temporarily serve as daggers. Two people stepped out of the cell, although only a small step, but this is a small step to freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are brought in, remember the way?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike!" The Orc nodded and consciously walked ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went through a spiral of upward spiral steps, but fortunately there are simple oil lamps on the walls, and it is very simple to walk. Siegel took another light and he did not have dark vision like a half-orc. By the faint light of the oil lamp, he found that the rock on the ground was very old and had been smoothed down after a long period of trampling. This requires a lot of feet to be polished to form, and few people can come down. Therefore, Siegel judged that the cell was used for later transformation. Before that, it was just an ordinary aisle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the stairs is a locked iron bar door, which is fine and rusty and looks easy to remove. However, Siegel stopped the half-orcs to do so in case of alarming guards. He took out the twine head and placed it next to the keyhole. He quietly recited the spell with the value. The head of the twine was drilled into the keyhole by the tentacle, groping inside, determining the structure of the keyhole and the opening mechanism, and then absorbing it on the top. Turn. I only heard a soft bang, and the door opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thread is burning quickly and turned into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a thread that is hard to use with your fingers, but can only take one cast. Siegel now misses soft cotton very much, because cotton can cast this spell more conveniently and accurately, and it can be used repeatedly. But now is not a critical time, I don’t know what danger there is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the gate is a hall, the light is dim and the smoke is lingering. Instead of using inferior oil lamps, there is a row of torches on the walls on the left and right sides. The torch table is the bone of the human hand. The pine oil must have been added to the torch, so the rock on the top of the head was blackened. There are two channels not far away, one higher and one flat on the left. From the curving ramp, there was a strong smell of gold syrup, mixed with the aroma of ale and barbecue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼克 pointed to a higher passage and let Siegel tighten him. The two quietly moved forward and put their steps very light. After thirty-sixth steep and urgency steps, Siegel heard a soft humming sound from the front, so the probe looked. An old man with a sturdy body and a wrinkled skin is snoring. He had a long white beard and a wooden spear in his arms, and the old clothes were full of oil. The position of his snoring was very bad and he just blocked the passage. Zucker gestured to kill him, but Siegel waved his hand. He was worried that if the kill could not be completed in a flash, the voice of this person would be heard. As a sentry post, there may be hidden alarm devices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out the dead spider in the palm of his hand, then gently rubbed the spider's body with the other hand and whispered the spell. The corpse turned into a green ointment under the influence of magic, only a small pile. Siegel applied it to his hands and then wiped it on the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ointment with a warm feeling, very rough. This is a spider that mimics the ability of a spider to move on a wall, but is a weakened version in the absence of material. It can only provide the climbing ability of two people and four hands, and the duration is much shorter. Siegel demonstrated the magical technique of sucking away from the ceiling by hand, and the hacker wrench will be suspicious and follow-up. Two people crossed the sleeping old man and continued to move up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step, it seems that the steps never end, here is the place, is it in hell? Siegel couldn't help but wonder if I was locked in a deep position in the ground, but what happened to the snow coming in from the window? There are still sunshine during the day and stars at night. Are those illusions? Siegel experienced the turmoil of the illusion, and it seems to have a similar feeling here. He looked at Mike's back and silently followed the number of steps. One hundred, he promised to himself that if one hundred more units are still climbing, then this is a fake, a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
