			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team went all the way to the south until the edge of the elf's forest turned west again. Everyone in the New World knows that the Elven Forest does not welcome passers from other races. All those who want to enter this area must gather at a specific Elf Post. After inspection, they are taken by the Rangers Sentinel. Sergeant's elf master, Liya, belongs to this unit and is the defender and patrol of the Elven Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is such a system, it is almost impossible for the elves to let a half-orc-class team pass through the forest. In some things, they are as stubborn as the dwarves. Siegel naturally would not find this trouble. Under his command, they kept the forest on the left side of the forward direction and accelerated the speed of travel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone in the forest is watching us." Janet quietly told Siegel: "But I can't see where they are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay, it's the elf shooter hidden behind the leaves, they are on alert, and there is no malice." Siegel comforted her. However, he again ordered an increase in speed, and must not be close to the forest, even if it is to pick up the dead branches to do firewood is also banned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel very nervous, Siegel." Janet frowned. "This forest gives me the feeling and the deep forest of the Old Moon Bay." It's not the same. The trees here are stronger, but not elegant. It's more like a strong fighter than a poet. What do you think is caused?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small Cats, the North has just ended the war of the orcs, even now there are some scattered orc robbers in the countryside. The elves and the orcs have feuds, and it is imaginable to guard the whole forest." Siegel said: "I believe These days, the forest has been shrouded in such an atmosphere, and what you feel should be the tension that remains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you didn't feel it Is there a strong hostility?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel hesitated for a moment, or nodded: "Yes, the forest is full of hostility. But than the Wraith It feels a lot better for me. Just be patient, wait around the forest. The face should go after will be better "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Jenny nodded, sat back in the carriage. After a while, she felt that she was a little cold and needed a blanket. Siegel cast a human sleep spell for her. I wanted to let her take a break. But the spell was resisted by Janet, and it was hard for her to react to her body as if she could not find a suitable target. Siegel frowned, never hearing that human demons would have such strange spell resistance. He continued to chanting. Relying on precise spell control and sturdy energy surges, forcing the spell resistance, and finally let Janet enter the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage turned to look at the Elven Forest and looked at the plants that had awakened from the cold winter, and they were thriving in the warm sunshine at the beginning of spring. The river melted by the ice is still cold. But it can moisturize the soil and give birth to life. Siegel did not feel the strong hostility of the forest, only a conservative sense of alertness. He believed that if he left the team of half-orcs and went to the forest himself, there might be hospitality. Why does Janet feel so nervous? Siegel did not get the answer by using the vision, using the detection magic, and using all his abilities to feel the magical atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved his wand and formed an illusionary emblem on top of the team, indicating the identity of his Mage Union member, after which he played his own squid badge. The Knights of Deep Water City and the Royal Knights of the Star Kingdom. Not long after, a white pigeon flew out of the forest, hovering three times around the head of the team, and then flew away with wings. Siegel felt that the surveillance of the team had weakened a lot and the road had become better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They continue to move forward, leaving the area of ​​Deepwater City, sticking to the border of the elves, and spending every day on the road. They encountered a lot of trouble on the road, but they all overcome one by one under the concerted efforts of everyone. Siegel's item repair spells support all trucks to work well and will not be damaged in the wilderness. This also ensures that the speed at which the team travels is not affected. The Orc Gladiators will seize the opportunity to hunt around - of course no one dares to enter the Elven Forest - and let everyone have fresh food to eat. Because of the proximity to the Elven Forest and the absence of dangerous monsters and robbers, Siegel’s team is safe all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After ten days of marching, they turned south. Embarked on the "ore road" along the walls of the city. Siegel had traveled this way when he went to Longshi Cliff – just another branch that was more westward. This sand road has been in disrepair for many years, and many places have been eroded by rain, leaving large and small potholes. But as long as the team circumvents these places and is careful when crossing the river, the speed of advancement on this road is much faster than in the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of Fitzak, the story of the Morah’s ruins began to be circulated in the ranks, and there was always the existence of Siegel, the conqueror of the Mora, who defeated the towering with the strength of the flesh. Snow mountainHalf-orcs worship brave, strong and healthy, they surrender more than smart minds.After listening to these stories, at least they are more obedient.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They met the dwarven patrol on the road, although only four people from the district but walked out of the feeling of moving the fortressA few gladiators enviously looked at the heavy body armor of the dwarf, then looked down at the long sword and dagger in his hand, shook his head helplessly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel still uses his magical illusion to show his identity and then greets himAfter verifying the identity of the Siegelden brave, the dwarf became very enthusiastic, taking out the food in the tower and sharing with him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been going south along this road and should be safe all the way."A dwarf, after hearing about their destination, said: "After a while, some trolls robbers appeared, but they have been cleared.Our dwarf's powerful guards cleaned up all the places where the enemy could be hidden near the road, and destroyed a nest of the two-legged dragon! The caravans that have been in contact recently have not encountered any danger. You are catching up with good times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every time I come to Mora, there is good news and good mood.""Siegel and the dwarf hug, share food and wine"Do you know Elinte of the diamond family, how is he doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor dwarf, he is not good lately"The red nosed dwarf laughed: "Don't care, I'm just kidding."Didn’t he lose a leg in the adventure a while ago, and made a fake leg of a gem, we were envious at the beginning.Later, the leg did not know who was stolen, and made him furious.In order to be able to catch the wicked thief with his own hands, Elinte found the priest, and rehabilitated under the patron saint's divine power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not a good thing?" Siegel said with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, we feel that way tooSpells for broken limbs are not common, and only devout believers can receive God's blessings.After Irene returned to normal, she found the fake leg in her bedroom. It was estimated that she was drunk and threw it in the corner - it was completely strange to others, wasn't it? After that, the poor dwarf was in bad luck, and he was continuously injured in the battle of the Qing eater. Every new knee that was born every day was hit by an arrow, and the wound was cured and broken again, just like being cursed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other dwarf came over and the beard twitched with a smile: "I heard that he used his jewels to sigh and hesitate. It’s not a new one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can imagine his expression"Siegel can't laugh."On the same day he wrote a letter to Elinette, greeted him with "the most sincere blessing" and told him about his recent situation.Perhaps the information network of Mora has told the dwarf information, but a personal letter is still necessary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf patrol took the letter away, and Siegel led his team to continue, until the snow-capped mountains of Mora slowly fell behind them. positionAt this time, the "ghost fog" of the Deadwater Marsh began to appear in the East.Every day, the east is full of gray light, and often the sun is not seen.Sometimes the fog covers their feet and covers the road.Siegel arranged several half-orcs to look for the road in case the team went in the wrong direction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it is not easy to be fooled by this team. Ghost Fog has regained its tentacles and presented a well-maintained avenue in front of them.On the side of the road, there will be a road mark every two miles, with the dwarf language writing the distance from the Mullah and a few words of greetings.There will be some flat stones arranged by the craftsman on the roadside. The stones are tightly stitched together, and the weeds cannot be drilled from the middle.There is a simple ditch beside the big stone. When it rains, the water on the platform will be taken away and flow into the valley not far away.This is the place to rest for the caravans. Each platform is enough for ten cars to stop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, they are far from the core area of ​​the dwarf control, the road is still wide, but obviously the dwarf can not maintain the same maintenance level in all placesThorns and weeds begin to appear, and some sections are also flooded by rivers formed by snow melting on the mountains.However, this is a temporary phenomenon. When the ice on the river melts all the way, the landscape will still gather in those rivers and flow under the bridge to provide enough vitality and vitality for the vast land east of the Wall Mountain Range.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From there, there are beasts, first sly foxes, and later groups of wild dogs follow the team, trying to rummage from the rubbishA bear who woke up from hibernation appeared stupidly in front of the team, shouting loudly.Mana took the bow and shot and killed the bear with several orcs.The bear skin was handed over to Siegel - this is the power of the lord, the so-called prey taxThe wizard casts magic and makes a warm cloak with half of it, giving ManaThe other half, after simple processing with magic, told the half-beast to make a big drum.He took out the purse and gave five silver coins to each of the half-orcs who helped him, as a reward for buying prey and making drums.Although they can't spend the money for the time being, they greatly encouraged the morale of the half-beasts.There is no such good thing when you are a slave, so the half-orcs who shoot the arrows are surrounded by the resurrection every day, hoping to come back with some stupid animals.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
