			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior promised, and rushed out to convey the instructions. Many soldiers gathered and held long-range weapons such as longbows and javelins. Each look is determined and prepared for sacrifice. At this time, the red dragon is still happily chasing and escaping people, and the explosion is shining outside the camp. It thinks that the guy in the ring of fire is already in the middle of it, and it will be fine after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel called Janet and asked her to put on her armor and put on a weapon. "Take care of Kerry's wife and children, find a chance to hide, don't die." He patted the kitten's hand and shouted. Kerry looked at the tent for nostalgia, his child is still not born, he has not seen the black wolf princess for a long time. The giant knows that it is not the time when his children are in love, so he resisted not going in and armed himself with all his arms. He only had 12 shots in the back - the shot was very huge, and it looked like a siege.弩矢, dressed as a lion fish. Two people are ready to find the trouble of the dragon. Siegel saw a knight on the dragon's back. He suspected that the dragon was purposeful and dedicated to destroying the tribe. It would certainly not leave with a simple temper. Now that we are at the juncture of life and death, everyone must be desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you fly me?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I haven't mastered such a complicated spell." Siegel shook his head and felt a little guilty about his incompetence. He waved his wand and let the elements of the air adhere to the two people. "This will make you and I move faster, but it won't last too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough is enough, let us win in this battle. Let's kill the dragon, who wins!" A layer of frost covered the crepe meat and attached to his shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't know if the dragon meat is better than the snake meat?" Siegel said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard? Don't let me be shameful in front of my brother!" The giant Kerry raised his fist and shouted at his men: "Remember us." What is the hospitality of the Jackdaw tribe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors are full of face-to-face talks, until there is a person who tries to ask: "The tube is full?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Killing the Dragon!" Kerry screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"杀龙管满!!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Dragon flew back and lit A row of tents, cattle, sheep and horses ignited a raging fire, and soon burned through the flesh and bones, becoming the coke that fell to the ground. ‘This is too wasteful’ The Red Dragon thought, ‘If you control the heat, I can get a good barbecue. I don't know if this death knight is lacking in the mind, and even such important things are not known. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knight has neither the ribs in his head nor the feeling of eating. He just kept ordering the killing, and kept killing, killing and killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the camp swallowed by the fire tongue, Kerry’s right-wing group is still persistently attacking the Red Dragon, but with little success. The dragon's scales are so strong that even the arrows made of stainless steel can only be broken, but only the giant's "smuggling scorpion" can blast on the dragon's body, causing some scratches on the scales. The Red Dragon also saw this group of shooters, sneered at them and did not attack them. He wants this group to fully realize that he is small and realize that he is useless. When the people they protect are buried in flames, they will come back to appreciate their despair and pain, as the best adjustment tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can't kill this dragon, prince, let's leave! Go with the black wolf princess!" A warrior came up to persuade, kicked by Kerry . But he still said nothing: "As long as you are still there, the Jackdaw tribe will still be there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we are gone, the jackdaw tonight It’s dead!” The giant looked at his men and opened his mouth and smiled: “Try to lead the dragon and drag him, let others have a chance to escape.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that the dragon will simply ignore us." Siegel said. He has repeatedly tried to recall the introduction of the dragon in the book: thick skin, magic resistance, various elements of power spit, flight, dark vision, and a variety of magical abilities. There is no book on how to deal with this creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will try a magic that will make your weapon sharper and perhaps penetrate the dragon's scales." Siegel Jean Kerry Take the gun down, take out the wand, and slowly recite the spell. He is not skilled in this spell, so he must be extra careful to control the power of magic. Fortunately, this spell was successful, and a light blue glow was attached to the gun. This layer of light makes it stronger, sharper and more penetrating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked to the left and found that the red dragon was at the other end of the camp, raging in smoke and flames. It will also sweep across the ground, sweeping a tent that burns like a torch with its claws, and then sneer at the weapons that bounce on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they also fired a flash of light on the right side, only to see a group of frost falling from the sky and hit the fire circle on the outside of the camp. The icy snow meets the hot fire, a lot of steam emerges, and a large space around it is covered in dense fog. At this time, another wind blew outwards, spreading the water mist out and covering a large wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirit of the ancestors blessed! It is the power of the ice and the gun, my father must be there!" Kerry shouted loudly, excitedly jumped . He saw the people on the right side of the camp running away from the gap in the ring of fire, hiding in the thick fog, and disappearing into the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene naturally does not escape the dragon's eyes, it screams in anger, eyes become blood red, squirming in the air, slamming wings, such as sharp arrows I dive in the same way. The fire and rain fell and blasted on the ground, but there was always a rotating ice cloud that protected the gap and shielded everyone from fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" The group rushed in that direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon landed on the ground, sweeping a large tent with wings and tail, flesh and blood fragments flying across, clearing a bloody open space. Then, it gathered the wings, walked on the ground with four paws, and the tail was lifted high, like a proud lion patrolling his territory. The flames around it became dim in front of the red dragon, and they dared not compete with them. They could only burn more fiercely and restrainedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, a magical weapon, or a nasty frost power. Do you think that you can beat me?" The red dragon's voice is cruel and loud, with The buzz of the air detonated. "Flame, you may be able to overcome, but my claws? My fangs? My huge and unparalleled strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kraft double Holding a spear, the spear tip exudes a brilliant light. He kept silently meditating on prayers and praying for the help of the three spirits. In order to protect his people, even if he gives his life, he will not hesitate. ‘Unfortunately, I can’t see my grandson. This is the only regret in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, dragon! Try the power of the Jackdaw tribe artifact!" Clough screamed like a thunder, and the entire camp heard it clearly. "Come on! Let me see how powerful you are!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon has a sly smile, his eyes are twisted into a line, then he looks up Come, look down and down: "Wow, how can you understand my power, if you can't see anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magical manufacturing The completely dull environment spreads out from the red dragon, and all the light disappears. Even the dragon fire can only burn without light. Only with powerful light spells can this darkness be penetrated, and even a dwarf with dark vision can't see things in this situation. The Red Dragon is unaffected, and it collects all the information needed for attack and defense by relying on two other senses—a very sensitive sense of smell and a tactile sensation that can detect the tremors from a distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few breaths passed, the darkness disappeared, and Claf was missing, only one ice gun was inserted on the ground. There are constantly ice crystals shaking off the spear and smashing on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry and Siegel and others have already arrived nearby, just to see this scene. The giant screamed wildly and threw the shot in his hand. The power of his blood, the power of the muscles, and the power of Siegel's magic mixed, let this gun shoot through the battlefield like lightning, and when the sound of the air has not caught the attention of the red dragon, it is directed at its body. . Even the city wall will be broken under the power of this siege, let alone the scales of the dragon? The gun went straight in and went through the roots of the right and left front legs of the red dragon and inserted it into the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon made an earth-shattering scream, slammed its wings and blown everything around, even a giant like Kerry rolled backwards. A few meters. The action of the dragon crawling became very clumsy, and the blood was dripping from the legs, flowing to the grass and burning. It sniffed around, and in addition to black smoke, the nose began to appear on Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I smelled you, bugs, don't want to hide!" The red dragon looked around and the whole body was spreading the horrible power. "Awful strange smell, actually more than one?" It looked up and saw a tall tent standing in a very conspicuous place, and a bloody fresh smell was floating out from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
