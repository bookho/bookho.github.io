Janet reached out to Siegel's cheek, like a child, naughty: "That is, you become a god? It doesn't feel anything." "The difference!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case for the time being. Maybe I will brave my eyes in the future, and I will have a holy radiance, or wings with elements behind it. Good Well, I am joking, the appearance has not changed, but the inside has changed a lot. In short, Heim is safe, and he can live peacefully in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In other words, you don't have to listen to the prayers of believers and respond to their requests?‚Äù Janet said no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pointed at his head and tapped his fingers and said: "In fact, I can hear it anytime, anywhere, but I don't care." As long as the magic works normally, there is no such thing as a magical god. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, you can build a temple and find some pastors to work for you. "The Master is also fine." Janet said: "When you left, the Masters Association and the Star Kingdom really came up with a lot of orders that could not be rejected. The entire territory was busy. Fortunately, you left the makers and stars. So, otherwise it will definitely reveal flaws. Speaking of this, Xingsuo shut himself down, and all the secrets can be nuclear. Is this something you made?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, then closed his eyes. After a few seconds, he reopened and said to Janet that "it has returned to normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is not just to return to normal, but to eliminate hidden dangers together. . Before Sigel left, he knew that the plan to colonize the Earth required a large number of secret nuclear and space transmission arrays. The latter can be handed over to the federation, but the core of the former can only be done by himself. In order to hide the truth that he is not in Heim's collar, he let the maker's magic image use the magic spar as a material to make a pseudo-element polymer. This kind of material can make the secret nuclear operation, but it will persist in the stable period of about ten years, and finally it will become a splendid element surge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even his own elemental aggregate is not perfect, at most fifty years of life. The only benefit is that there will be no explosions and surges, it will only slowly go out. After possessing the power of magic, knowledge, and prophecy, Siegel quickly improved the core of the elemental polymer, making it safer and reproducible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a rule that God wants to have God. Although Siegel felt that it was troublesome to build a temple, he still needed the faith of believers to maintain the fire. This has replaced his hunger for food and is closely linked to the identity of God. Through the secret energy core, through the magic spar, Siegel knows that he can surround many beneficiaries, more extensive than providing treatment. These people will combine magic with their own lives, and they will rely on the concept of magic, which is more efficient than any temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About the illegitimate child," Siegel thought it was straightforward to say it: "I told his mother before, she refused my help. If you are not in an emergency such as asking for help, you should generally ignore them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you taking care of me?" Janet asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, nothing to hide. "This kind of thing is not what I want it to happen, nor is there a perfect solution. Just like life, I can only pursue better, never better. Maybe after a few hundred years, I am still alive, but at that time Hou just wants to experience life is impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not going to make us eternal? It is a stupid god." Janet deliberately changed the topic, will The illegitimate thing crosses the past. In any case, Siegel has become a magical god, so that he is entangled in these trivial things will only backfire, resulting in chaotic results. Is it necessary to have a fight with God, or to make a big noise, is there any benefit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By cloning, you are close to being young, you don't need to use divine power." Siegel pointed at himself and said, "I am worried about me." Self. Divine power will erode me, let me lose mortality, become like a lich, and there will be no more fun in life. All gods are like this, slowly getting out of this world and become their own gods. The shackles of the country. The fire of the gods is repeated, constantly searching for new victims. Of course, from another perspective, the fire is looking for a soul with a sacrifice, and will eventually sacrifice itself."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter if it's weakened..." Siegel said halfway, and the idea suddenly opened. When the mind becomes awkward, it is actually the weakest time of the fire. The new magic god will only inherit the knowledge of the previous one, but this knowledge depends on the accumulation of time, and has nothing to do with the pattern of the fire. This is obviously very inefficient, and it is only the path of decline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The race gods can last longer than the concept gods, perhaps because they are closer to the life of their own races. Why do the demons and demons have no gods, at most they only produce strong people like God, and probably for the same reason. God has placed his body in the kingdom of the outer plane, away from the world of the main material. In the outer domain, only the tendency of the plane will destroy many humanities, not to mention the dual influence of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think about it in reverse, is this a mechanism for forcing progress? God needs believers to strengthen themselves. It is necessary to go to believers, live the same life with them, and know their needs and ideas so that they can constantly adjust and adapt to new situations and continue to strengthen their strength. The limitation of the crystal wall ensures that God will not use his ability to forcibly reverse the rules and be able to be more of an observer and experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a "mortal" life will give back to the gods some kind of gift, perhaps to slow them down by the assassination of the fire. In this way, the "vigor" is worn away to allow the gods to collect more or generate "vigor". This logic can also make sense. Maybe this is the truth, something that God will keep secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel kisses Janet deeply, thanking her for the spark of wisdom. Lear eventually became insatiable, "degenerate" faster than other gods, and perhaps related to his absence of a temple. After becoming Lear, he regained his humanity, which shows that experience life is still very useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to be an individual for a long time, I am afraid I will be busy." Siegel decided to promote his magic spar plan, and he must do it himself. . The things in the territory will continue to be stable, at least until Isaac's adulthood, this is still his responsibility. If such behavior can effectively reduce the invasion of the fire by the fire, Siegel will continue to do it and use it as the normal state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least this time is not to avoid danger, but to live a better life." Janet said with a smile. She only feels that her dream has finally come true. A knight, a lord, a sorcerer, now a god, and love. There is no safer and warmer home than this. Even if people always have the inferiority of greed, Janet knows that he will only be greedy in the future to make his children better and happier without worrying about safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people sit quietly, letting time flow slowly, enjoying this most precious happiness. One inch of time, one inch of gold, who can be rich enough to have time to let go of all the fears and worries, really enjoy the peace? This kind of luxury is hard to own even God, and Siegel has not experienced it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and looked at the picture of the future through the barriers of time and space. "There is a guest coming, it is the Holy One of the Elf, coming from the Elven Forest, and there is Master Lia with him." He said to Janet: "Arrange a place for Master Lia, she can't go back to the Elven Forest." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the Elf Saint?" Janet asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He won't stay." Siegel's tone was a bit cold, and Janet began to worry again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it was not just the Elves and Leah who came to Heim, but a whole diplomatic group. Including the two divisions of the Academy of Arts and the three priests of the Moon Temple, important departments of the Elf Forest Management Department have sent personnel. They took the gift with a unicorn car and came to Heim in the name of a gift. They are all accompanying the elves of the elves, and Siegel knows at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saints with elves of the gods are next to them, can they take the initiative to say something? Perhaps the mages of the art institutes will have different ideas from the elves, but they will only be announced after the saints leave. So Siegel only told Janet that the Elf Saint and Leah Master were two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet thought the elves were close to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city of Mire, and they were prepared to blame the patrolling cavalry and the secret agent of Heim, but the news was finally obtained. But the elves have just set off, the first messenger has not crossed the hub, and there is still a distance from the Heim collar. On the one hand, he lamented the power of the gods' husbands, and on the other hand, he pressed his heart and prepared the reception work in an orderly manner. From the perspective of Siegel's tone, there is no need to be enthusiastic about these elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
