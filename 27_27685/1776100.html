			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn of the alarm sounded at noon and continually echoed between the rocks in the walls of the city. The figure of the dragon finally appeared in the place where the Black Blood Castle Watchtower can be seen. The scorching sun shines on the top of the head, casting the shadow of the dragon, and the entire valley seems to be under it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It squints at the castle on the mountainside, knowing that the enemy must be hiding there. The location of the castle is just right, right next to the Wraith Passage. The wraiths instinctively chose this mountain by the shortest route and the smallest loss through the wall mountains. The result coincides with the orc's long marching route, within the reach of the Black Blood Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Dragon has been able to feel the human breath in the castle, knowing that they are hiding behind the stone one by one, licking their great figure from the gap. No use, no use! It is thought that the stone will be melted, the steel will be dissolved, and the flesh and blood will become a thick soup together with the skeleton. The black dragon is everywhere, only death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It started to go downhill. Let the weak white dragon crawl slowly behind him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry saw the dragon figure from the tower that stood out from the castle, and he breathed a sigh of relief. "It’s finally here," he said. "See the dragon knight, a girl! It’s really a bastard with the red dragon! I have been waiting for a long time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The power of frost emerges from him, and the frozen armor is overlaid on the magic chain, creating a double protection. Then he put on the augmentation aragonite, slanting the silver-white thick chain from his shoulders and picking up the ice gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warriors," his voice spread throughout the valley, and even the dragons heard it clearly. "Ready to fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Battle! Fight?" The dragon laughed. "I am the destroyer of all things, you are this group of ants! Waiting for you only Death! Death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at how it crawls," Kerry’s voice rang even more: "It’s not like a dog!?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows rushed down, accompanied by the acidity of the sky. The irritated black dragon opened its wings and smashed himself into the black blood castle. One arrow tower was broken directly, and the other cut a large gap. The acid squirted in, everything inside was crushed and then melted by acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longwei spread and shrouded the entire castle. Siegel's spells are being played at the same time. A wide range of heroic techniques are covered in time. Although it can't completely offset Longwei's influence, it greatly reduces the difficulty of resisting fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warriors of the Jackdaw Tribe have a fighting spirit ignited by the fire of vengeance. The soldiers led by Heim rely on the fighting spirit brought by hard training, and most of them have supported Longwei. Impact. Keep enough combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire castle was shaking until the dwarf runes on the walls flashed and did not cause further damage to the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hands! A round of shooting!" Kerry issued the order: "catcher, up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The pickpockets came out of the hidden place and pulled the trigger in the direction of the dragon. A burst of arrows in all directions shot toward the dragon. Hits on the dragon scales to make a dazzling cremation. Most of the scorpions were bounced off by the hard and smooth dragon scales due to the angle, and fell to the ground, but there were still a few inserted into the gaps of the scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Dragon opened his mouth and sprayed the acid vigorously, spraying it toward the foundation of the castle building. It wants to melt the rock, let the building collapse under its own gravity, and the mice inside will be killed and crushed, which is the best way to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can't agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall is stretched out and blocked in the direction of spraying. The acid can only corrode the ground, and on the ground there is a rune array of Siegel's depictions. Provides resistance to acidity. A pipe dug out of earth elements can direct the acid to the outside of the city wall and spill it into the valley. This system can't last too long, so I only hope that Kerry's progress will be faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors drilled out from the heights of the castle and quickly ran to the well-preserved brakes, loading the special heavy-duty and aiming at the shooting. There are more than 30 heavy 弩 弩 巨 巨 巨 巨 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , With the sweep of the wings and tail, it distracts most of the sag, but the hips and thighs still have a few arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors of the Jackdaw tribe screamed in unison. Run from all directions to the dragon, holding a chain in his hand. This is the chain they built for the dragon, and the blessing of the spirit of war will not be melted by Longyan. The goal of everyone is to hook the chain to the large scorpion tail ring that is inserted into the dragon's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dragon swinging the body. The large sputum is shaken, and the claws are pulled out from the tip and inserted into the muscles of the dragon. The claws are coated with poison, which can make the animal's body stiff and paralyzed. However, for Yulong's physique, this level of poison will not make it lose its ability to move, but it is impossible to force the muscles to move out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second round of shooting! Free shooting!" Kerry also rushed out. Pulling out the chain on your shoulders is like waving a whip. The grassland warriors approached from all directions, throwing their flying axe, javelin and net. These weapons do not cause any harm to the dragon, only to make him more angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another round of arrows, the dragon hides his body under his wings. The seemingly thin wings are actually very strong, with only a few squats penetrating on them. Some of the smashed scorpions flowed out of the green electric slurry, which was seen by the death knight. As soon as he grabbed the dragon's back, he jumped over and stood side by side with the Black Dragon in the courtyard of the Black Blood Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick! Come on!" Kerry yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knight lifted the mace, smashed the ground, and ran towards the giant with wild power. Kerry was holding the ice gun, and a large gas element was blocking them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is screaming, the tornado is formed, and the speed of the death knight is slow. Just then, a fire element also flew over, entangled with the death knight with the element of gas. Both elements are changed from the Rune Guardian Scepter, and the dwarf's combat skills are instilled in the mind. The only purpose is to entangle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry, go to the dragon." Siegel's voice passed into the giant's ear. "I am going to drag the death knight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon roared in the sky, and the tail swept away as the body turned. Since the death knight is also in the courtyard, it cannot attack the "owner", so the scope of action is affected. Although it succeeded in flying several warriors and opened a few chains, it was still close, and the three chains were hooked on the heavy-duty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your strength can't hold me!" The dragon flapped its wings: "I will fly, lower the acid rain, melt the whole castle!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s late, black dog!" Kerry lifted the ice-cold gun and forced it to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of ice spreads. A layer of frost covers the entire courtyard. The chains blessed by the Spirit of War emit a blue glow that echoes the ice on the ground. When the ice comes into contact with the chain, immediately freeze it to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Spirit of War protects us! The spirit of the ancestors is watching us! The Spirit of Nature lowers the frost to control the enemy!" Kerry's voice spread throughout the castle. All the soldiers are wary. "Now is the moment to win the victory with courage and blood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice layer on the ground is broken. But the place to freeze the chain is extremely strong. The ice-cold gun stands in the courtyard and continues to provide the power of frost. The artifact of the Jackdaw Tribe is that even the birds in the sky can freeze the long guns, and only the cold-caught jackdaws can keep flying. Countless years ago, it was a white jackdaw that brought a gun to the tribe and condensed the tribe. From the Old World to the New World. Countless years have passed, and finally someone can fully exploit the power of this artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon found that he couldn’t fly, so a bit of acid sprayed onto the chain. The powerful dragon's breath finally has an effect, the strength of the ice is slowly receding, and the power of the fixed dragon is loose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Useless." The dragon pulled the paw out of a bloody chest of a soldier and said evilly: "When you are blind, how do you Fight with me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It exerts the power of darkness to block all the light around it, even if it is dark. However, this has no effect on the dragon. It can "see" everything as usual by virtue of the perception of the surrounding tremor. It imagines one after another to eat all these warriors one by one. A crispy mouthfeel and a flowing fleshy scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness lasted only two seconds and was dispelled. In addition to removing the magic of the Black Dragon, Siegel also waved his staff and constantly mobilized the power of the surrounding elements to supplement the consumption of gas and fire elements. The death knight almost smashed the elemental rune guard several times, but relying on a steady stream of supplements, the two element warriors are still tiring and ignoring the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
