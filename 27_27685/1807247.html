The quickest and safest way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the massacre is the easiest." Siegel squinted, his brows covered with dark clouds, forbearance The sarcasm in the tone: "This method has existed since the tribe of the cannibals. After thousands of years of development, the pirates, bandits and tyrants have inherited the key points and carried them forward. Now they have finally developed into Is there a military means of the kingdom of stars, the race of mankind and the entire world of thunderbolt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd frowned, and the other princes’ courtiers were doing their best to pretend Not on site. From the ********** to the weeds and the roots, and then the chickens and dogs are not left, human beings have accumulated a lot of experience and vocabulary in this respect. Especially the aristocrats have been familiar with this practice through political struggles, but they have never been Do not put it on the bright side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Siegel, he was the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those who are goblins, evil creatures of nature, kill and kill, what a big deal." Evan waved his hand: "Can let the goblin creature disappear It’s a good deed, and they have always threatened our security. You also said that we have been unable to negotiate with them, and the rest is just a question of how to fight.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I said this. I was still working hard to avoid the war. Lear of the school city pitted me at the most critical moment." Siegel told his king: "They still tried It is forcing you to fight, this is for the sake of no one knows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War? Siegel, you want to be wrong, killing the goblin is the goblin The weapon is not the soldier of my starry kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you just have to blame the person on the cliff?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what do you want, wait for the goblin to come over, and then proceed with this plan?" Wen took a fist and knocked on the table, and made a loud noise: "Is it waiting for the starry kingdom to die, and it has been bombarded several times by the powerful weapons of the goblin. Then you can agree to this plan with peace of mind? I didn't expect you to be like this. Stupid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the goblin threatens you, so you kill him first, so you can feel at ease?" Siegel knows that he will offend king. But still can't help but say: "Why are you killing these goblins, pursuing honors? Obtaining territories? Or are you afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fear? Going to you! I am just not stupid until the shadow of the sword is on the top of my head and I can't see it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would rather think of the Masters Association The way out is how to close the wall channel, not a massacre!” Siegel said: “I admit that this plan has any feasible, if successful. I said that if it succeeds, the starry kingdom will harvest a new one. The land. But what kind of foundation is it based on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king picked up the cup around him and drank the wine inside, then Sergeant is on the throne. "Based on the destruction of this world! This damn storm wall, the power of damn destruction. What should I do if I don't open up new land? Tell me, do you have a way to stop it? Say!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Siegel replied truthfully: "In this respect, I am still working hard. But because I can't repair my own cabin, I will be a pirate. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! Siegel, why didn't I find that you have such a strange temper!" Evan looked around the other members of the pre-election: " What are you doing in this group of people, don’t say a word, are you watching the fun? Don’t come to me to persuade this yak!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd to the King He nodded and said in a calm tone: "The Marquis is not reluctant, but he has a knightly spirit, although it is just a stupid knighthood." He discouraged his tone. Trying to reduce the anger between the king and the military adviser. "The war has many forms, but not all forms will satisfy the god of war. The Marquis of Siegel wants to fight the goblin in an upright manner. I think this spirit is commendable and a very important quality of a royal aristocracy. But unless there is operability, in order to survive, it is still necessary to use less knightly means. In many cases, the primary consideration is not that you feel uncomfortable in your heart, but whether this can bring peace to the kingdom." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Money?" Siegel directly pointed to the nose of the Chancellor of the Exchequer: "The killing still depends on the money, what do you think of us as a professional killer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I remember that adults used to destroy the Kobold for silver coins. This is essentially the difference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyes, the power of the elements As his anger broke out, the temperature of the entire chamber under the shadows rose instantly. The flame climbed the curtains and turned the silk into ashes. The glass embedded in the window frame began to melt, and the candles and paper began to burn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palace guards rushed to the side of the king. The anti-magic field quickly opened. Fortunately, Evan is not the goal of Siegel, otherwise they will not be able to save at their speed. The Earl of the Treasury, Warren, is like a red-hot crab that has steam coming out of every pore in the body. He grows his mouth, but he doesn't know if he should exhale the air or call in. He can only make a snoring sound from his throat. The blood vessels protrude from his skin, and the blood inside is about to boil, and it keeps beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, stop! This is in front of the royal family! Are you crazy?" Count Todd rushed up and grabbed Siegel's wrist. . Then he yelled, his palms smouldering, and he stepped back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defensive array in the palace began to function and immediately confronted the elemental field of the sergeant. The frost blew and quickly extinguished the flames on the curtains and furniture, but they could not get close to Siegel anyway. There is a region of fire, and the black flame produces a twisted shadow, as if there are many tentacles flying in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough!" King yelled, "Come to me immediately! You are a Marquis nobility, not a gangster!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waited for another two seconds, when everyone thought that there would be death here, Siegel slammed, and all the flames disappeared instantly. The Frostpower of the Palace's defensive array rushed toward him, and Evan only had time to scream: "Be careful!" Siegel's place has been drowned by sharp icicles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chancellor of the Exchequer is smoking, but Siegel does not really kill, so he will survive in the end. He lay on the chair and groaned, and the building minister, Baron Norris Nelson, picked up the ice and snow on his hand and poured it. And rushed into his throat to fill the cold water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel patted the frost on the robe and walked out from behind the statue in the corner of the room. The defensive array of the palace did not lock him at all, so all attacks were empty. By patching the transmission holes in the Star Trek Dungeon, he has already touched out some of the magical arrays here. And in terms of elemental spells. He has a unique advantage. Although it is not enough to resist the spell attacks here, it is easy to find a way to deceive and then avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why stop me?" Siegel seemed to be trying to restrain the taunts in his tone, but it was still clearly heard by everyone. "He slandered me and said that I am an assassin. This is a damage to my Marquis status. In order to avoid this situation, I naturally have to attack. Anyway, I can use the spell to kill him, then I will use the technique to kill him. Can I Wait until the shadow of the sword is hovering over the head, can you shoot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan's face is purple, with a finger to Siegel issued a warning: "You... ...here is the palace, sitting opposite you is not a goblin, but a living person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be human!" Siegel said: " I thought for a while that there were some goblins without a bottom line!" He faced the king, pinched his fingers, and had a black flame at his fingertips. This action made the guards nervous, and they stepped forward and stopped in front of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See? This is the end of the chaotic use of power." Siegel said: "My magical power is no different from before, but these people I am afraid of me, nervously between you and me. Why? Are they afraid of my strength? No, they are just afraid of madness. People can be kicked back like a dog, and even bite back; When you kick a foot, you start to bite; but people are not dogs after all. Earl Samson wants to pat my face, can I kill him and turn it over? This is indeed decisive, but what impression do you want to leave to the world? As long as there is a contradiction, there is only killing and killing. Who is not killing? But is that the first choice of the Cavaliers? In addition to approving the slaughter of the goblin, what did the Star King do? You think with your brain Think!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, I am a king. How can I not kill my enemy?!" Evan snorted, then Said: "I don't need your approval, Siegel, you have no better master. The goblin must die. In this way, there is nothing to discuss. I will not wait, I will not let the people of the kingdom risk their lives, the threat of the goblin must be solved, and it must be solved as soon as possible! You are the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
