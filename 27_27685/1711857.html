			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the camp is not long, but the stone steps are rugged, and the snow makes it slippery. The jazz's legs began to tremble as he rushed back to the castle. On the one hand, age and intense exercise, on the other hand, it is because of the bishop's message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil? Is there a devil in the castle? If this is said from a big soldier, Sir Bill will definitely rebuke him for spreading rumors, bundle his mouth and throw it into the dungeon. But the bishop of the bishop will not talk indiscriminately. There must be some evidence in this. However, Cooper is obviously not prepared to say more on the wall. Who knows where the snow will send these words? So three people came to the room under the prince's house, where they were protected by layers of enchantment, and at least five paladins stood on each channel outside the door. Sir Bill thought: If evil can come in from here, it is a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found the devil's poison in the prince's diet." After the door was closed, there were only Sir Bill, Evan, Prince Aaron and Todd. After the count, Pastor Cooper said. "Although it is very weak, it is indeed something from the lower level. Because the number is extremely small, the paladin who inspected the food and beverages did not find it, even I was only inducted when I accidentally picked up the cup. Now I still judge Out of its role, but it is likely to be a kind of cursing medium, so that the prince's body is getting weaker and weaker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's true!" Count Todd Extremely annoyed. He looked at Aaron on the sickbed, watching the old-time confident prince now only lying on a soft bed, slouching all day, and his heart was very uncomfortable. I should stop him from entering the cave. The count has been blaming himself. I should do my duty to exhort, but I don't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince did not fall asleep, and it is difficult for him to really close his eyes and rest now. He sleeps a lot and is always sleepy, but as long as he drinks some red wine, he can feel his body full of vitality, as if sleepiness and exhaustion have never happened. But the drunkenness that followed was a big problem, and the count had begun to control his drinking, so he could only rest in bed. I heard this news. He only had one idea, ‘Give me a good glass of wine, and then everyone went together to find the devil and destroy it. What a great adventure this will be! '<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness. If you agree, we will begin the investigation. Everyone in the castle has to check it out, and the devil is very disguised." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First check from every guard." Evan said bluntly: "First, to ensure the safety of my brother."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every Paladin is a model of courage and justice." The bishop of the bishop raised the volume slightly, but he then regained his calmness: "Before killing the evil, it is natural to grind first." Good sword - we will start self-examination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince raised his hand. Gently waved: "If the doctor is still there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this sentence deviates from the theme, it is actually the biggest blow to the morning priest. What happened to the body of His Royal Highness Prince, even Pastor Cooper could not see it. From a diagnostic point of view, all his physical functions are intact, but only the spirit is weak, only energetically stimulated by alcohol. This is like a person who voluntarily gives up his fate and never pursues. It seems to have lost interest in everything around him. The priests took turns to display various magical techniques: restoring, removing curses, removing toxins, and eradicating diseases, but they did not have any effect at all. It is said that when the prince came out of the cave, the body was much better than the present under the treatment of Dr. Rees. You can also host the canonization ceremony. It is a pity that in the snow ambush, the doctor died under the arrow and the body was thrown off the cliff. The priests could not find any clues to treatment and did not find any remaining prescriptions. After being compared by a pharmacist, the morning temple was lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill’s prompt round, he suggested to Count Todd: “I don’t think it’s a good thing, it’s best to secretly. But you can call everyone, then the pastor. Let's check out together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The jazz is right, there are already some complaints outside. Everyone is sitting in the city, watching the orcs but not playing. If it happens again The internal devil incident, I am afraid it will be chaotic." Evan pointed to the cousin Cooper and said: "If the devil really exists, it is difficult for him to start his brother, it is difficult to succeed. But if he changes strategy Just killing one or two nobles is enough to disintegrate the military. So the matter needs to be done as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd looked at Evan with some surprises. In fact, he just thought about this problem. It seems that after a series of things, the king's illegitimate child is growing up quickly. At present, the condition of His Royal Highness is still not good, so he ordered it on his behalf: "Just as I said, first start with the Paladin. At least there must be some trustworthy people. Bill Baron, you organize the mercenaries, you have The task of earning money is given to them, and if they don’t want to come, they will immediately get out of the Black Blood Castle. Evan, you go to the Knights of the Sherbrooke and let him bring the knights to the Chamber of Deputies. I will meet with the bishops. They."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your brother." The count pretended not to notice the anger in Evan's heart, still calmly said: "I believe that nothing can protect you through your sword, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discrimination can be, pressure can be. Evan thought about it and turned his gaze away to meet Aaron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no expression from the eyes of His Royal Highness, and weakness has destroyed the flame of emotion. Aaron’s eyes are only indifferent. Evan felt that his brother was very pitiful and then ashamed of his childish behavior. The three words of illegitimate children did not appear on the first day. Have you already realized that this life is impossible to get rid of its influence? But why is it so sensitive now? Evan thought about it and thought about it. He suddenly woke up: even if he was lying on the bed like a corpse, the temple is still His Royal Highness, and it is always more important than the illegitimate child. It is also difficult to fight against the laws and customs of human beings, and only three words can kill a person's life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You act," Commanded Count Todd. Everyone sneaked out, but when everyone was separated, Sir Bill patted Evan's shoulder comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladins have no problems, and the mountain cavalry is also. The jazz are very safe, even if there are no devils in the mercenaries. There are a few evil guys who are entangled in the resentment of the victim. These people were taken out and thrown into the black prison with the people of the Schlint family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol soldiers began to investigate in the afternoon, and the pastors still had nothing. It was followed by rumors that the priest of the morning temple was looking for a scapegoat and was responsible for the physical health of His Royal Highness. There is also a saying that there is a traitor in the castle, and the appearance of a human being is actually a spy of the orc. As a result, the castle was very popular, and everyone was looking at each other with suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, there was no second devil poisoning incident in the Black Blood Castle that day, otherwise it would be as chaotic as the bombing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the scope of the investigation was extended to all servants and descendants, and then to the prisoners held in the cell. Evan looked at the action of the morning knight with a mocking attitude and sat with his prince all day. Since the servants were all called away, he was temporarily responsible for helping his brother drink water and eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even these things can't be done, how can you rule the country in the future?" Evan's words can't cause Aaron's reaction at all, only the reflection of the red wine bottle Row. "When are you going to be good?" This is almost the verbal language of Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud noise coming out of the door. It seems that many people are running on the channel. Evan subconsciously supported the hilt and prepared for the battle. At this time, the door opened, and a morning priest came in. The pale gold robes on his body looked particularly eye-catching, and the smell of the scented powder also made Evan hate. The priest made a simple and quick ritual and said, "We found the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan does not believe this news, his hand has never left Hilt. The only thing he was interested in was the position where the priest stood. ‘Going forward two more steps, I can kill you. Evan's eyes are full of chills and always maintain the highest vigilance. From beginning to end he knows one thing: the devil is only in the heart of the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand gently climbed his arm, Prince Aaron took a heavy breath and said in a weak voice: "Give me those who drink, I am going to see it." At this time, Count Todd also came in and saw a big surprise. After all, the prince had improved and was willing to take the initiative to do something. He and Evan put the prince on a suitable coat and poured him a glass of red wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red wine is like blood. After drinking it, Aaron is obviously much better. The count is hesitating to wear a long sword on the waist of His Royal Highness. Sir Bill rushed in and said loudly: "Janet is only a demon, not a devil, something must be wrong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't yell, what is it?" Count Todd frowned and reprimanded. "After the snow was vacant, did Janet not disappear with your apprentice, how could it be mixed in the servant? Especially after the arrival of the pastor of the morning temple, you and I have regained control of the situation, why is she not showing up? Can't doubt her motives?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe because she is just a child, frightened." Sir Bill continued to argue: "The devil is not after all. The devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
