			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they left the foggy area, they were exhausted and their bodies were on the verge of collapse. However, while the vision was restored, their mood was much easier and the fatigue was alleviated. After another half an hour or so, they saw the Kerry tribe far away. It was a stretch of tents made up of conical tents, a thriving scene: people used straw mats and rattan to tie tents and build shelters from the wind and rain; the smoke rose from the spire of the cone, but people held their rice bowls Eat at the entrance of the tent. It was like a social occasion where everyone sipped hot porridge and talked loudly and exchanged daily work. Several strong men wore hides and put their bows and arrows at their feet. They were shaving the rabbit's flesh with a knife and then smashing them into small pieces. A pot rack is on the fire, and the water inside is burning. The hunters throw the rabbit meat into the pot and put the potato pieces and pueraria in it. A group of children holding bowls, holding a millet cake in their hands, are waiting in line to eat meat and soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All tents are basically the same size, just new and old. They don't have a lot of things, simple cookware and some cover are all home. However, they will spend a lot of time decorating their homes, polishing them with horns and bones, and collecting colored flowers, making paints, and painting the tents. A group of people took the horse and walked in the middle of the tent. Many people greeted themselves and looked very enthusiastic. Although Siegel has been studying hard, he can only barely understand a part. Most of these people say "Is it back? Eat it? Is everything going well?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one tent in the entire camp that stands out, which is higher than the others. Siegel thought that it would be the place where the leader or elders lived, and found that it was Kerry's home - and only such a tent would allow a big man to get into it. A woman with a big hand and a big belly waited for Kerry at the door, and was lifted by the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my wife." Kerry said happily, then he pointed to the big belly and proudly introduced: "This is my son!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is not shy when she sees outsiders. She has been busy greeting everyone. She moved in the cushion, took out a large can of goat milk, and borrowed a cup from her neighbor. . Janet also went to help, and soon became a friend of the woman, and carefully touched the upcoming belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect your maid to speak wild." The poet grinned, and some were not happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet is not my servant, she is a...good friend." Siegel scratched his head and patted Jarrell, discovering that the poet still hurts The fangs are grinning. So he said: "So a big tribe should have a herbist or something, can you treat it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Right, I should go see Looked." Jarrell stood up and said: "Since your friends can speak the language here, then I should not be in a mess after a while. Remember not to run around the Jackdaw tribe, although they are enthusiastic, but they are passionate, but If you accidentally touch the taboo, you will not talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will stay here, nowhere." Siegel waved his hand: If I am not worried that I can't find the way back, I will send you there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't." The poet smiled and replied: "I remember the cold." The therapist of the Crow tribe is a big beauty, at least I heard that, I always want to see you. If you go, it will affect me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End, the poet Just ride the horse and walk away. Siegel took the time to open the key space and take out the stored cakes from it. Because the treasures inside have long been taken out, and also for the need of adventure, Siegel filled it with food and drink, spare weapons and emergency adventure equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave the deep water city cake and a small jar of sugar as a gift to Kerry as a blessing to hope that his child will be born safely. The big man hugged Siegel and shouted: "Good friend, this gift is too expensive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time someone came to Kerry and called him gone. The woman of Kerry explained that it was their father who had something to look for and should return later. So two women and one man began to prepare dinner. They took out the black bread, hard cheese, carrots and a few spinach, chopped them and put them in the pot and cook them with the bones of the sheep. After the pot was opened, the hostess threw some dried meat pieces and scented stalks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a buzzing noise in the camp, and then I heard the rush of horseshoes coming. Siegel straightened up and found five horses crossing the gap between the tents, crossing the screaming dodge, carrying a spear and rushing toward them. He hurriedly called Janet and wanted to avoid these imposing people. However, the speed of the other party was significantly faster, and they blocked them just outside the tent. Five long pointed spears pointed at Siegel and Janet, surrounded by a semicircle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet was very excited. She shouted: "Is this your hospitality for the people of Northland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry’s wife rushed out to explain, Said that these people are friends of Kerry, just came to the tribe and are about to entertain them. "Captain Leica, don't hurt them." She said: "There may be some misunderstandings in this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I found this thing from their friends. The man armed with the thickest spear shows something from his hand, a small silver crow badge. "You should recognize such things and know that his master has been missing for more than ten days. If you are replaced by you, what do you do most?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leica Captain, I will also grab them.” Kerry’s wife looked up and looked at the captain who was riding on the horse. He said slowly: “But I will not easily make any conclusions, nor will I judge things with a preconceived vision. The truth. I will let them talk and listen to them. Then I will judge this after the spirit of nature calms me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you Wish, Mishella, the dear Princess of the Black Wolf, the conqueror of the giant.” Captain Leica asked everyone to put away the spear, and then used the lingua franca to say to Siegel: “Follow us, don’t try to escape.” Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were taken to the front of a large shed on the north side of the camp, where a lot of thin, long wooden poles were hung and flags of various colors and patterns were hung. . Some flags depict fierce animals, others are abstract shapes of clouds and winds, and others are more like graffiti. Under the flag stood a crescent-shaped standing nine people, all of whom were strong men after the weather, the white hair of the center, and the anger. He wore a bearskin cloak around his neck, holding a giant spear with a length of two meters in his hand. The spear was made of straight hardwood and the tip of the spear was an obsidian. Several other people were squatting, empty-handed, and staring at Siegel and others with angry eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troubadour, Jarrell, was tied up by the rope, and stood by the two fighters, standing on the side, and he made a helplessness toward Siegel. Smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you do with this guy?" Janet yelled, "Why are they arresting us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I took the dead man's thing, but I didn't expect it to be an important guy." The poet screamed, his heart was awkward: "Listen to the fate."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the bearskin cloak stepped forward and his voice was thick and full of momentum. He said: "I am Kravchenko, the son of Sherp, the chief of the Jackdaw tribe, the spokesperson of the northern people, the holder of the ice gun, the undead white crow of the grassland."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Siegel, the woman next to me is Janet, the one who is tied up with hands and feet is Jarrell. We come from Deepwater, to the North Look at the scenery and want to go to the orcs to give them some trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to my son?" Clough took another step forward and his eyes showed Sad, but still strong tone: "I found something belonging to my son from this contemptuous person, how is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When we found him He was pierced by a spear in his throat and fell in the deep valley. But I think his death was more like being attacked from behind by some kind of monster. We buried him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clough issued a scream of "ah", his body swayed, and took a step back, relying on the support of the spear to regain stability. He had already asked the question of Jarrell beforehand, and now he heard the same description from Siegel, and he believed in the fact that his son had died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nonsense! You and the prince's death can't be separated!" One person shouted, and three or four people followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and said calmly: "No, we regret that you lost the prince, but we are not the murderer. I tell you his body." Where are you buried, maybe you can find that the wound is not something we can do. Moreover, I believe that the body in the deep valley can be guided by the mysterious power." So Siegel slowly told the magical birds in the sky, flipping The smoke that emptied from the body. He also confessed his doubts, including the disappearing internal organs, the strange burning and rolling around the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ordered the left-wing team to take the team to get my body back, let the wizard look at it, and then bury his ashes in his grandfather. Next to the ashes." Claf announced: "Now, you steal the relics of the deceased and steal the important tokens of the tribes and will be tried here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
