			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked around and the battlefield was a messy sight. The surrounding is either a lucky one who has not been injured, or a dead body that has become a fragment. The incredible power of the warrior allowed all the soldiers it hit to die on the spot, and many of them could not tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just this time, there are thirty to forty deaths, most of whom are heroic knights. On the battlefield, they made enough momentum to attack the enemy first. The sword in the hand and the armor on the chest did not help their heroism, and they first shattered under the attack of the mace. Then their knight's heart was also knocked out, and they could no longer be beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel killed the warrior, which made the Uther family soldiers no longer hostile to him. The Knight of the Knights rubbed the blood of his face with his hand and swept the wood thorns stuck in his skin. He stood next to Siegel, gasping, and watching the beheaded enemies with the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel only feels that he is simply wielding a few swords, more tired than any battle in the past. The dust of the stars in the hands became very heavy, but it was only the illusion of the wrist that was inserted into the scabbard. When he landed on the ground, he found that his feet were so cramping that he could barely stand - but he had just used flying to move, and the elves did not use much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not because of psychological reasons such as tension, Siegel is no longer a recruit on the battlefield hill, he knows how to break his physical strength without getting extremely exhausted, so This must be the abnormality caused by the warrior. He looked at the body of the warrior, and his mind was full of strange runes. The spiral patterns that do not cross each other, unlike the magical array system of any genre, have never seen anything similar in the knowledge that has been lost and cannot be decrypted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a major discovery for the Masters Federation, but among them Knox will be together? Siegel shook his head and decided to temporarily conceal this matter, and wait for the manpower arranged by the bachelor to say when he built the magical test field at Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took his gaze back from the scorpion and said to Matt Knight: "You gather the remnants, I want you to fight between my territories." Can come to an end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for the Cavaliers to answer. Siegel fluttered back to the Drey's side. The lord of Herod had broken the arrow on his leg and barely stood up. Even if he fails, he must maintain the style that a nobleman should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you know that you are not my men." Siegel said: "I believe you also see it, if not I intervene. You The troops will face the catastrophe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Duke of Dray still has doubts, this time he can only choose to nod and admit it. He saw the changing means of the Master, and he also knew that Siegel was a wise, or deceitful, lord. But he did not know what other means the young man had to show, unless he also found the caster. It would be unwise to attack the Heim collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the honor of the Lord of the West, the Count of Herod and the Uther family, I am willing to enter into a truce with the head of the Helm, Lord Siegel." He reached out and held it with Siegel. "I hope that Mr. Baron can guarantee this peace with the same honor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be able to have this The result is also my wish," Siegel replied. “I will send people to build bridges as soon as possible so that your men can get out of the Rift Valley. There are frequent earthquakes here, and marching from here is a very risky move.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Viscount admitted the failure very quickly: "I thought it would be unexpected, but I didn't expect everything to be in your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage has a lot of eyes Like the stars in the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana stepped forward and brought a bandage to the Viscount Dray. Then she stood behind Siegel. Looking at the remnants of the Rift Valley. Even at this time, she still does not trust the situation on the battlefield. The trip to the north made her learn to be cautious and learned to be suspicious of everything around her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Keke came with the remaining militia soon, so Siegel had enough manpower. He threw a few thick ropes on the rift, so that the soldiers led by Hilo were fixed with a temporary stake, and then the wooden planks of the truck were removed, even if a temporary bridge was built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a person with honor!" The Viscount Drey snorted and ordered his men to carry only a long sword across the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero led through this failure, will be quiet for a long time, unable to attack. As long as someone is in the hands. I am not afraid that it will do little tricks in the dark. The sudden appearance of the annihilation of Uther's best knight, if he wants to organize an army, the combat ability will be greatly reduced. Plus the lost weaponry, although it is not difficult to add to a territory. But the morale's loss is not restored in a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially those temporary soldiers recruited from the peasants, who not only did not get any oil and water, but suffered a lot of losses. If there is no grasp of winning the next time, the Uther family cannot use the incursions without restraint. It is believed that as long as you control the ore avenue and intercept the iron ingots and finished weapons that are transported to the south, you can continue to delay the time of the next war - even destroy it invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The completion of the city of Mith. Will give Siegel enough room for development. Through this war, Siegel won the time slot for the construction of the city of Mith. It’s just that the sudden appearance of the embarrassment made him uneasy: earthquakes often occur in the Rift Valley, is it related to this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wick, move the donkey back to the castle, I have to check it carefully." The Master explained this matter and changed the cast spell to hide his body shape. . He will go down to the bottom of the rift to investigate, but this must be done in secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the rift is a dark world, and the sun above the head turns into a thin line that seems to be on the other side of the world. It is silent here, only the smell of muddy soil. However, due to an earthquake that has just happened, the falling dust covers the moist soil at the bottom, and the air is filled with a horrible smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no creatures that should be expected in this area. There are no cockroaches, no scorpions, and even no small beetles. However, Siegel did not come here to examine the ecology. He concentrated his spirit and felt any strangeness in this narrow space. Although the runes on the skeleton have never been seen before, the power to break the metal weapons is unheard of, but the strange and rare things can not appear out of thin air, they must have traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned, he did not feel the imprint of the magical fluctuations, but found the same element. The four elements of gas, water, and fire are usually mixed together. There are more or less elements in different environments, but only with the power of magic can they be separated from the mixed state, become orderly, and then used. The elements at the bottom of the rift do not have this feeling. The four elements are separated from each other like the rainbow, and they are independent and do not interfere with each other. They are like tattoos on warriors, and although they are twisted, there will never be intersections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following this bizarre elemental vision, Siegel flies in the uneven rock, bypassing the steep layers of soil and drilling through the tortuous Arched holes. This tracking stopped in front of a prominent, smooth-skinned black granite. In the eyes of Siegel, the abnormalities of the elements are generated from here and then spread out. At the core of the lines that do not interfere with each other, it is a void of nothingness. It is like a bottomless well, constantly releasing the power of the four elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel used a wand to lick the black granite and observe it with the light of the top of the wand. He did not find any traces of the spell. This rock is not naturally shaped, otherwise it will not be as smooth as a mirror. But in addition to smooth and flat, there is no magic, no spell enchantment, no dwarf runes and elf's moon pattern, but it is just an ordinary slate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel tried to move it, but the heavy earth grabbed its property and couldn’t figure it out. Then he tried to summon the earth element, and wanted to use its power to dig the soil around the stone and try to take it out. However, the earth element cannot be formed, and the structure of the spell cannot be stabilized in a very special environment here. The same is true for other summoning spells. He left a distance and summoned the earthworms that could dig holes. But before approaching the granite, the summoned object collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In desperation, Siegel can only choose to cut stones with the dust of stars. This is a laborious job, especially for his current state. After a while, he was so tired that he could only stop and rest. I wanted to open the space bag, but I found that the space effect became very unstable, and the rope that tied the bag mouth could not be opened. In order to be safe, he did not dare to try to use the space key, so he could only continue the work with his scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until two hours later, he finally dug the rock. The other side of the black granite is still very flat, but this time it is not blank. Unlike the pattern on the scorpion, the symbol behind the rock is filled with something like a dragon language, leaving almost no gaps. But from the fracture of the edge of the rock, this is not a complete article, but a drop from a larger object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
