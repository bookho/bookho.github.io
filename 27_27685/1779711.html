			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked down the stairs, although it was as heavy as water, but after a simple cleanup, it would not be paranoid or crazy. Wwacks and his hands on the crutches, stood up from the chair. But he hadn't spoken yet, and Siegel hugged him up and stared at him again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, I am very upset after hearing the news." Fitzk said: "Janet is a good girl, but her life is not good, no I can escape the scourge, but you have to calm down. I don't persuade you to be similar to the reasons for the safety of the tens of thousands of people. I only ask you, are you sure that this can achieve your goal? Don't die in vain, West Geer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have calmed down, really." Siegel said: "Thank you for persuading me, only those who really care about me will Try to stop me at this time. Don't you know that this is dangerous? I almost killed Mana just now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She cares about you better than caring for herself, She has always been such a good person, like a fool." The one-eyed old man patted his stiff knees and looked up to Siegel. "Remember Macabu? At the time, the two of us fled, thinking that they would be poisoned by gnomes, orcs, or ghosts flying around in the sky. I still had an arrow in my leg, which slowed down the speed, so I Just advise Mana to hurry and leave me alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We only know three or four days, how much can each know? I have one The old-fashioned head of the eye has nothing to imagine. At that time, I thought that I was dead, so I didn’t drag the young man. But Mana never left me and dragged me forward. She is a kind person. From the bones, kindly, you have to listen to her opinions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The troops have assembled, and the knights are waiting for you to give orders." Fitzk said: "I don't know much about how to fight. But I Knowing that desperation is a desperate good friend, anger and stupidity are difficult brothers and brothers. You pinged from the middle of the night to the present, I didn’t sleep well. It’s going to deal with the news from various lines when I’m up. Oh, it’s really hard. "Life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry. I will help you later." Siegel patted Fitzak's back, then stood up and sorted out the clothes. Calmly said: "And wait for me to arrange the work of the knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-eyed old man puts down his heart and waved his hand to let Siegel go first, himself Then slowly stand on a cane. He called his servant and asked them to reach out and walk back together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Siegel pushed the castle gate. The first morning sun appeared in the sky from the east, just in the courtyard full of puddles. The dark clouds in the sky have not completely dispersed. The low thunderous sounds from the north, the black clouds are moving south quickly, and there may be rain soon. In this kind of weather, whether it is marching or fighting, it is a chore. It is still unknown how much power is left by the rainwater and the power generation pulp. In terms of commanding operations, there are several people who can listen to the drums in heavy rain. And the horn to execute the command? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the door armed with arms and held his hand on the hilt. Glance at the entire castle with black eyes. The people he saw were kneeling on one knee and expressing loyalty to him. However, Siegel sees more of the stunned, curious and blind followers in the eyes of the soldiers. They don't know why. It is just a simple trust and a fear of one's own lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost disappointed them, tied their free will, and threw their family to the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All knight commanders, come to the Chamber of Deputies immediately." Siegel said: "Zike, you are most familiar with the city defense, and also responsible for the training of the recruits. First arrange the soldiers to eat and rest, then check the equipment of each team, according to your standards, to see which are not qualified!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that. He gave Mana a look and let her catch up as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are on the elf territory. The elf must give me a statement!" Singer, Siegel slammed his fist on the table. The flames on the candlestick were provoked, and all the generals were shocked and sat up straight. "This and the elves' rotten fights should be enough now! The black people's incident is an opportunity. The elves can't even protect their own base camps. What are they doing here? I ordered all the troops to prepare for the battle. Everyone who can pick up the weapon is ready to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goal of this battle is to catch the captives." Siegel said: "The elf forest was attacked, and the elf troops outside would be called back to help. Although the hub is closer to the Elf Forest, I want Lia. The legions will also move. From now on, keep an eye on their movements, as soon as they leave the easy-to-follow place, they start attacking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The Lord, how to catch the captives?" asked a knight, "There has been no precedent for the elves to surrender until now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elf is also the flesh and blood They will also be afraid, fear, and may surrender. I hope that your bravery will be fearless. I want to see the murder of the team. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The knights nodded, and the beasts and other orcs screamed, and the fighting spirit was much higher than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana sighed and finally relaxed. As long as you don't attack the hub and kill all the way to the Elven Forest, there is still a big chance of winning against Elijah's army. Under the constant harassment of Heim, the elf army has lost its initial deterrent, and can only stay away from the elemental rune and squash behind favorable terrain. Without enough war trees, their overall combat effectiveness has dropped a lot, and the original system is difficult to maintain. The elf was pushing too fast in the early stages, causing it to be too distracting. There was no problem in the absence of the plasma to deal with the ancient trees of war, but now it is difficult to regroup the fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mana, give you a task." Siegel’s voice pulled her back from her thoughts: "You are responsible for the center command, scheduling various Resources, when to attack, when to retreat, what tactics to use, these are given to you. My task is to provide spell support for the troops, extending the effect of the elemental rune matrix on the battlefield. Free of fireballs, hail and the like. Things fall on everyone's head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Lord Lord, I will fight for your honor!" Mana exclaimed. This is the lord she likes. Be able to think rationally and act impartially. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give a message to Kenki so that he does not have to come back. You can see the machine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the shouts of the guards outside the door rang: "The Lord Lord, Master Dunba seeks to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gestures to let him in, then The Knights of Heim’s collar saw a fat man in a brown-gray robes and a short braid behind his head. He looked nervous, circling the knights' shiny armor and weapons and handing a piece of paper to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Lord, Idis teacher said, please don't fight with the elves. The black people attack has caused the elves, the wizard association, the major The attention of the temple. There will be results soon. It is not appropriate to expand the conflict at this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the note and threw it on the table, cold Cold said: "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunbar stood still, carefully watching Siegel, still waiting for his answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana kicked the half-orc at the table and gave her a look. When he slammed the table, he stood up and reached for Dengba. The protective spell on the mage flashed, and Siegel raised his hand and dispelled it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Mank put Dunbar’s head under his armpit. The heavy smell made the mage tremble. "Ah? Are you going to stay in a meeting? I don't know how to get out of the letter, I don't know how to be polite, it's not as good as me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denba's hands and feet are not Live swinging. But after he was arrested, he could not speak, nor did he have enough strength to break free. He could only be dragged out of the parliament hall like a chicken that was only raised. Zucker released him at the door and closed the door of the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My actions on my territory do not require the Masters Association to dictate." Siegel lit the note on the candle and threw it aside: "also 愣What are you doing? Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heam's war machine is working in an orderly manner, scouting and cavalry. The infantry followed. Mana left a thousand soldiers to guard the city of Mith, and another thousand as a reserve team. The caravan of the caravan is being used as a means of transportation and ready to support the battlefield. So the real attack is only about a thousand people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
