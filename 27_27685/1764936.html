			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meg's lab also serves as her study, which is neatly packed. The desktop of the wood is spotless, and all the alchemy tools are not stained. On the shelf next to the wall, the various herbs are sorted and placed in their respective small boxes. Siegel found a magical array on the shelf that would keep the drug in good condition for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage Master walked into the room and looked at the place he was familiar with. She passed through the writing desk and came to the cabinet full of books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees that it is full of magic enchantments, connected in series to form a complete and complex protective array. He saw the familiar spell structure, whether it is the element node or the connection between the various components, it is handled perfectly, just like a textbook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meg entered the scope of the magic array, the spell above reacted and the enchantment gradually brightened. Siegel saw that the recognition spell and the triggering spell had begun to work, and that Meg was covered in a faint gleam. The magical array sensed Meg's magical volatility and recognized her identity. All the protective and attacking spells stopped and the entire magic array was released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the design here good?" Master McGonagall said his chin and said with a final expression of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and showed a sigh of expression. In the method and precision of drawing magic arrays, I am not as good as Master Meg, but all the rituals here are only repeated application of knowledge in books, and there is not much innovation. In the aspect of the Faction, Siegel developed the elemental rune array and the energy focusing lens, and his pride is no less than that of Mage Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The book you want is on the third floor of the second row of bookshelves, the red cover." Master Mage said: "I have already After reading it many times, many of the things inside are just random guesses, and they can't be tested at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that this "Moonlight Moya Vol." is not a complete spell. Books, more of a law is a research note when creating spells and magical arrays. In Siegel's view, it is often more important to know the process of thinking than to see the answer directly, because the spark of thinking can lead to countless futures and give people a variety of perspectives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, instead of thinking about how to study spells, Siegel came to the bookshelf. Sure enough, I found this book that I have been waiting for for a long time. He took the book out of the shelf and held it in his hand. The cover of "Moonlight Moya" is the scale of an animal. It feels rough and hard, and it has a cold feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finally..." Siegel sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s at this time. McGonagall quickly stepped back a few steps and slammed his foot on the brick below the desk. The magic array of the room was immediately activated, and the magical light of the detection magic slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what she wants to do, it will not be a good thing. Siegel grabbed the book with one hand. The other hand stretched out into the arms with a quick response and took out a rune core shaped like a short stick. As he pulled out the core, he began to recite the spell and let the power of magic stir. The magic of identity recognition shrouded and everything in the house escaped detection. Meg is waiting for the end of the detection magic, and the attack magic will take effect at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petrochemical, fixed, paralyzed, and shocked are the four strongest control spells that can instantly subdue enemies. Although the Master from the outside took care of her and was very kind, McGee had already suffered betrayal and had no trust in the people around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially this wizard is peeping into his own mind, what he sees is a great security risk. Especially when the darkroom is opened, if he tells Puland, then his last hiding place is no longer safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he controls him, even if he loses his hands, McGonagall still has the means to kill the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective magic shrouded and scanned everything in the house from top to bottom. In Siegel's taunting eyes, the detection of magic has not stopped, still emitting aura. If the magic is detected, the attack magic will not take effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of the rune in Siegel’s hands still exudes a hint of green light, which is what delays the detection of magic. A circular array of self-deception. Specially designed to detect the characteristics of magic, so that the spell will never reach the end in the process of continuous self-circulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a delay in seeing the emergence of attacking spells, McGonagall has begun to panic. She slammed the chain on her hand and rubbed the bricks on the floor over and over again. The previous spell node has not been completed yet, and the next spell will not start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at her, although she felt that she was pitiful, but she was still angry with this practice. I first received the book in my hand and then said: "Mage Master, you don't have to do this. If I want to be against you, I have already mixed your memory into a paste. Don't doubt this. One point, I do have one or two such spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meg has stopped struggling, she has no other way to deal with Siegel, now her own The fate is completely in the hands of the other party. There was pain in the broken limb again, but she was even more heartbroken by the pride of her own spell: "How did you do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Some little tricks." Siegel didn't want to continue to waste his tongue, and walked past Master McGonagall. Maybe there was a bit of sympathy before, and I wanted to bring Master McGonaga back to Heim for treatment, but now this idea is gone. Since she can't get along with others, let her find her way in this fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked out of the Chamber of Secrets and saw Moore pull out his sword in his hand and carefully hide behind the shield. The male light attendant saw the lord and shouted: "Be careful, there are people ambushing around!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas element is still rotating around the house, constantly sweeping away and trying to close Thick fog. They didn't send out any alerts that were attacked, and they didn't know what Moll saw. Siegel pulled out his wand and opened the vision, trying to look around. But there was no movement around him, he couldn’t feel anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol slowly leaned over and stood beside Siegel, his eyes did not relax his vigilance, and he lowered his voice and reported to him: "There was a deep fog The movement was quiet. There was a heavy footstep. Then a shiny ripple spread from a distance, swept across the ground, and then disappeared. My stomach felt a discomfort, and my hands and feet were a little paralyzed. Will it be? Encountering magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very likely." Siegel nodded and placed his hand on Moore's shoulder. "Things are done, let's go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he started using the teleport spell. When he summoned the power of the surrounding elements, he finally noticed that it was not right. The volatility of the surrounding elements is now extremely sparse. Only the energy of the cockroaches is gathered. These forces don't say that using teleportation, it is already very reluctant to cast a fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a dazzling white halo appeared behind the thick fog, spreading like a lake's ripples. Through the layers of fog, nothing can stop it, but he did not interfere with the surroundings. The shackles of light swept over Siegel's body, further reducing the concentration of elemental power and completely defeating his transmission spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the sound of the rumble came from the ground, and there was a slight sway under his feet. Their first reaction was an earthquake. But then this speculation was denied. The vibration is very regular, it is a time when the heartbeat is shaken three times, and there is almost no error. The power of nature is always wild and free, and it is not like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two gas elements received interference at this time, and after losing flight for a while, they lost their form. The two elements of the Rune Guardian core fell to the ground and leaped with the vibration. Siegel picked up the core and knew that there was nothing wrong with this magic item. The root cause of all problems was the element concentration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a general mage, this time will be helpless, letting you lose most of your power. But Siegel learned something from other worlds. Some means can be used for emergency. He took out a small piece of inflammatory soul crystal, placed in the rune scepter of the energy-focusing lens, simulating the energy of the element to support the magic. It's like a universal spell wand that allows Siegel to use a few spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is one more conversion step. So using magic in this way is more dangerous and more difficult to control than using elemental casting. The strangeness of the ghost fog swamp makes Siegel very curious, but it is obviously not suitable for a long stay. He waved his wand again and recited the spell of the teleportation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high wall formed by a ray of light emerges from a distance, even if it is thick fog. The trajectory of the light wall movement is exactly the opposite of the direction of the halo, and the strong magical energy fluctuations can be felt from a long distance. If you use a popular language to describe. Then the light of the ripples is like the water on the beach is far away, and the light wall is the energy tsunami that comes with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
