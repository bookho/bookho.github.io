			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfocused work of concentration is a kind of enjoyment, just as the composer is immersed in music, and the painter is in the ocean of color. "Siegel's Energy Focusing Lens" is a revision of the Rune Absorption Array, which absorbs the energy of a particular source according to the user's needs and sends it to the rune core - the "stick Sugar" device. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will operate the focusing lens and plan to return the energy that has been painstakingly collected by the singer to the void. It will bind a large amount of energy to create a shield of energy and protect yourself in the center. Except for the parts stored in his hand, the rest will dissipate. Within the radius of thirty miles, all the soul crystals will be evaporated, and even the void will be illuminated by this huge energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the formation of the squad, Siegel did not have a chance to actually test it once. So far the lord has not found any abnormalities here, but as soon as the magical array is launched, he will be exposed immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wants to understand the loopholes in the Monroe plan. As soon as he activates the portal, the energy fluctuations that traverse the space will surely draw his attention. Maybe only a few thoughts, the door to Siegel's home will be closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going home, Siegel remembers the purpose of going home, and all the adventures are for this purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he can’t let the entire Void ship have no energy left, or he will be trapped here. Siegel quickly collected the sacred crystals of his sight, hid them in the key space, and protected them with tweezers. Most of the supplies inside are thrown into the space bag, or stacked on the floor of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two bets still couldn’t be found, and Siegel didn’t know where this konjac kid went. There is also a smoldering crystal in its brain hole. I don't know if the energy focusing lens will affect it after it starts. The road inside the Void Ship is like a labyrinth. Siegel never dared to go far, afraid to find the way back. Every time he goes out, he will make a mark, but there are still a few times he has gone astray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel can only wait in the manufacturing workshop, while constantly checking and correcting the format of his own. Two tones have not appeared, and Siegel decided not to wait any longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly looked at the squad in front of him, this is his most proud work so far. It’s time to let it shine. Siegel stepped into the center of the circle, and the place where he passed through the rune lines in turn, the long white light appeared in the dark manufacturing workshop, casting the shadow of the machine on the cold wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no shadows here soon. There will be only light - Siegel thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his finger, a sturdy mace flew into front of him and fell into his grasp. Siegel connected the core of the circle with the mace, and then threw a piece of flaming soul into the node of the circle. He concentrated on focusing on his spiritual touch and this legal matrix. Give the soul fire to this dead creature temporarily. The light of the circle shook and then stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is alive, Siegel understands that the energy focusing lens is like a child who just got a life. He needs further nutrition to grow and maintain. This is a child who is destined to grow up. His energy will be dissipated into the void; this is a short life like a fire, but he can stop the footsteps of Nissan and bring hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first only the void, and later the world. Although compared to the void, the world is always short-lived. But there will always be a different world. When Nexus serves the void, there will be people who will serve the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel raised his hand and pointed forward with a nail-headed hammer, then said: "There is light!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Array received the order and immediately started to work, producing light. It’s just a blink of an eye, and the whole soul of the Nethership is connected by the Faction. This is Siegel's intention: to regard the island as a sacred soul, for energy extraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master immediately noticed the problem, he took back the spiritual tentacles of the void and put it into his body. It only took a moment. He discovered Siegel. In the next moment, a huge spiritual pressure rushed to the intruder, killing the invader who disguised himself. This is the means of war of God, and mortals simply cannot afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine stopped working after it had not started roaring, and the Nethers warrior had fallen asleep after not starting to wake up. A spherical green energy body shreds the building that makes the weapon, forming a protective eggshell, and wrapping the Siegel in the Faction and the Faction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the real spiritual tide slams up, and the energy from the shadows of the passing shadows. If it is the wall of matter, the dominant consciousness can pass through without any effort. But this energy wall can't. After a layer of consumption, there is only a shallow whisper in the soul of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"湮灭."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has no distraction to pay attention to this sentence, he Still stay focused on the spell. The energy ball is getting bigger and bigger, and a hollow is eroded in the void ship. The green light illuminates the surrounding space, as Siegel thinks, there is no shadow left here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" The master changed his strategy when he found himself unable to destroy the law from the outside. "Stop this squad, I will give you everything you want!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel didn't believe him, he still carried out his own plans. At this time, he was like a soldier with no feelings, and he waved his weapon without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master mobilizes all forces and rushes to the squad. The warrior uses his own power to rush to the glowing sphere. The lines on them touched with huge energy, and they were quickly lit and blazed. However, their bodies could not withstand this level of energy shock, and all collapsed. The broken bones piled up in front of Siegel, then contacted by the energy ball and burned into powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflammation of the soul gradually dimmed, the entire Nethership was in a state of stagnation. The plasma flowing in the grain also gradually fades from the dark green, just like the blood vessels lose their nutrition. The refusal of gaining energy from the destruction of the world has also begun to enter its own destruction - a sinister and devastating destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary warrior was found unable to cross the energy shield, and the dominant consciousness immediately called the gold general and the floating beetle. He ordered the beetle to form a ball, wrapped the gold general in it, and sacrificed the outside to save the center's soldiers. Siegel found this and immediately pointed the hammer in his hand in that direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulated energy always needs a place to vent, otherwise it will burn the ruling itself sooner or later. A major use of energy focusing lenses is to emit energy streams. For the Capricorn, this is a growing lollipop, but it is devastating for the Nethers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massive flow of energy violently tore the outer shell of the floating beetle, burned down the composition of all matter, and then fell on the gold warrior. Even the multi-reformed Nexus can only hold for a few more seconds. In the shouts that dominate the unwillingness of consciousness. Its army has all been defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-fifth of the entire Nethership was destroyed by the energy ball, and all the soul crystals became powder. Because the speed of extraction is too fast, many grievances have escaped from the soul of the soul, looking around for ways to vent their resentment. But all around are dead spirits that cannot be attached. Only the master has a strong soul fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their impact is like a moth to the fire, no harm to the master. It only needs to sweep away with the energy of consciousness, and all these grievances are annihilated. But under the torrent of consciousness, Siegel and his squadron did not move, and lit the void like the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me back the energy!" This is not a voice. It is the result of the gathering of thousands of sounds. The sleeping souls are also awakened, giving their own different voices. Some are threatening, some are begging, some are reprimanding, some are tempting. In the end they all quieted down because Siegel finally responded to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you let go of other people’s pleading for you?" Siegel said, "Tell me the answer."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the dominance is confusing, like a noisy bee. Siegel waited for a while, and when the voice of the master calmed down, it seemed that they reached an agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All things have a day of destruction, this does not require mercy and argument." The lord said: "Please destroy everything."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, all the sounds around it disappeared, and all the warriors also closed the soul fire, lying on the ground, like a real dead body. All the plasma lines on the Void ship stopped working, and the void began to erode this island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
