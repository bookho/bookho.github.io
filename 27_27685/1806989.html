			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing will disappear from the air, and the god and the power of the god of magic and knowledge are even more impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel understands that he is not the only one who knows that Lear is the secret of the mortal state of the magical god. Those saints are not blind, they can certainly see Some clues. Maybe a bloody knight like the God of War is not interested in the field of magic, but who wouldn't want the field of knowledge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take the power of prophecy again, this temptation cannot be easily rejected even by God. No matter what Lear did, he was able to exist in a mortal state, while still ensuring the proper functioning of magic and knowledge. What cannot be changed is that the power of the god of magic and knowledge is definitely much weaker than before, and it is placed somewhere, waiting for someone to take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the level of God, God is proficient in the war of God, there is no possibility of not being able to get it, then there is only one explanation: no one can find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is like his twentieth scorpion, even if it is a magical god, know all magic spells, and Lear, who exists as a big prophet, is looking for No, the ring of the writer alone can be sensed, so at some level, the ability of the ring is beyond the magical god. Conversely, the magic god's means of finding things and his ability to hide things should be in the same line, then the ring has the opportunity to find the hidden gods and divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a possibility, but it is always better than no plan. So Siegel used cloning as a cover to secretly conduct research in this area in the magic spacecraft. In addition, he also has to take care of Sir Bill, show his face at the Imperial Conference, and then go to the Royal Library to access the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill’s body recovered very well, and the debilitation caused by long-term negative energy occupancy is almost disappearing. He doesn't have to lie in bed all day, living a happy life that can eat and drink. The pastor of the Temple of Dawn, he can start to do some sports properly, so he started playing against the squad with a blunt sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is sweating and panting every day, he is in a good mood and seems to have found a colorful feeling of life. The things that were previously possessed have passed to him, and the future life will slowly return to the right track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Siegel has a feeling that things should not be that simple. In order to avoid the danger of Sir Bill. Siegel also made a clone for him. Of course, Janet and Isaac will need to be cloned in the future, and Evan will be indispensable. In this way, it is necessary to reduce the consumption of cherished materials by cloning. In order to guarantee the cost of the spell in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the kind of person who will make sure that he is safe in the future and will be brave. When I was alone, I was not afraid of anything. After I had family and friends, I couldn’t be afraid of it. If he is alone in destructive power, he can drive a star-shaped cable and launch a virtual cannon against the Masters Association across thousands of kilometers. Even if Lear can predict this threat in advance, he can't stop it. The Tongtian Tower of the Masters Association or the large library of the City of Learning, can their magic defensive arrays win a few shots? Detonating a Mier nuclear can create elemental surges that destroy all the magical effects associated with the elements. How long will the rest of the building last under the star's array of electromagnetic guns? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, you can push Lear out of the nest. After that, Siegel can use the Mire to nuclear and fight with him. With nearly unlimited magical energy support, Siegel has the advantage of “land advantage”, even if Lear can use legendary spells. In the end, it will be exhausted. So, assuming that Siegel has only one person, then he can indeed solve the problem with this method of killing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a saying goes, everyone has a beast in their hearts. If you think about it from another angle, that is, "What is the difficulty of becoming a coward?" Victory is only a goal, and it actually represents multiple outcomes. There are wins, big wins, no wins, no wins, and Siegel never wants to end the game. Winning the prize is certainly the best pursuit, and for this he needs to be prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is busy with this, time is passing away day by day, the rumors of the end of the world and the jackdaws and the deep water city are temporarily put on hold. At least at this stage, no military consultants are required to worry. It is rare for the Master to have a good mood for a while, and this good mood reached its peak on the day when Countess Ferrara "killed" to the Star Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events that took place in Swan Castle slowly spread, and the Orthodox traitors were all locked in the wiki's dungeon and accepted endless inquiries. And torture. Most of them will draw a rest for their own life in the form of heads. The news naturally spread to Nautai Fort, and the Countess of Ferrara was not alive all the time. After hearing the news, it was fainting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, Countess Ferrara has never received any news, and I do not know that Sir Bill has been saved. However, she knew that the "Squid of the Squid" and the "head of the hound dog" knew the inside information, so she took a team of followers and went directly from the Earl to the Star Fortress to ask for sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the intelligence manager can't avoid the news in advance and avoid it, then he will not call the intelligence chief. Although Siegel was shocked by the countess at first, he would never be black. He sold his master with his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a bad bastard, are you hooking up other women here in Wangdu!" The countess’s hot opening is comparable to a big drama, she slammed Closing the door also left infinite thoughts for others. These people do not include Siegel, and the simple eagle-eye sharp spell can observe the room from the wall. This is not Siegel's voyeurism. Master Bill taught him the skills of swordsmanship, knighthood, general knowledge and human life, but his greatest skill - how to get along with women - never taught to Siegel. a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Siegel is making up the lesson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s always a very happy thing to learn knowledge. At the dinner party that day, Siegel Squid – Janet’s husband – feels optimistic about the future. With hope. The Bills and the couple were as good as they were, and they decided to hold the wedding again. Of course, in order to avoid the limelight, the date of the wedding is chosen next spring, but this time Sigel may participate. And by that time, the experiment of cloning should also produce results, the situation will be very different from the present, Isaac, Janet may also be able to participate in this gathering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other good news came from Heim, and Janet was pregnant again. Siegel, who will be his father again, is excited to keep his mouth open, but he does not know that Janet is full of fog. After changing the body, the magic priest Reid once said that Janet's new body has been traumatized in the past and needs at least three years of planned rehabilitation to return to normal, so she did not have any hope. Now pregnant again, it seems that everything is normal, what is going on? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood of the Marquis may be the root of everything. His black hair and dark eyes are very unique, and he is not the second person in this world. Maybe this blood is representative. Great ability to multiply." Rhett can only explain this to Janet. "Isac's birth is not completely affected by your demon's bloodline? The time of taking a fetus is exactly the same as that of human beings, and the children born are also black and dark, and there are no signs of a little demonic. So pure Blood has never been seen, even a bloody dragon can't do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this good or bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course is a good thing," Rhett replied: "The Marquise, please rest assured that the child now looks normal. You are difficult to get pregnant and do not affect the seat. After all, your physical fitness is much better than that of the average pregnant woman. You can raise it with peace of mind and wait for the birth of the second baby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel only knows The latter part of the sentence, that is, "wait for the birth of the second baby." He always showed a silly smile on the table, let the Countess Ferrara think what he found, and kept his head down with shame - he did "discover what", but nothing to do with this smirk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wu Ke and the maid eyebrows, maybe they have achieved good things. Although Zucker is a half-orc, his face has tangled cross-skins, and the scars have faded, and the four fangs are barely protruding from the fat lips. According to human aesthetic standards, he is ugly. Among the half-orcs... In fact, he is also ugly. Zucker is the half-orc of between the half-orcs and human beings. In the stone village of the northern wasteland, he has lived alone for a long time because of his unfamiliar appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the half-orc lineage and the ugly appearance, all others are advantages. Especially after reading a lot of books, he can also be polite and act like a personal knight. Although he is now the guard of the Marquis of Siegel, it seems that he is doing nothing all day, not important at all, but in fact he is also a Viscount, with his own castle and territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without formal marriage, there is no scorpion. He is also an important figure in Heim, and is the second commander of the Marquis army. His own territory is very wealthy - although it has nothing to do with Mike himself - and it is said that there is an unexplored gold mine there, which adds to the potential wealth of the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very strong, this has eliminated more than 80% of the single Viscount and the lord. He can also sing poems and even write long poems with twists and turns, rich scenes, emotions and movements. And somehow, compared to the nobility lady, Zucker prefers to be with the beautiful maid, which is absolutely perfect for the young woman of the Star Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
