			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving the Black Blood Castle, the sky is already dark. The mountain knights of the assault opened the way, and the pastors of the two morning temples displayed powerful blessing spells for them to help them break through the enemy's defense. The orcs were caught off guard by sudden attacks, and when they tried to fight back, the castle began to fire bows and arrows. A simple isolation strip was created. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry did not go far, they returned to the castle after the attack - but less than a quarter, the other is Siegel Illusion. With the cover of the terrain, most of the knights were hidden on the mountain road and began to prepare for the downhill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time, from the Black Blood Castle, the riprap will be used to sprinkle the falling stones, and the bows will be used to clean up the orcs who are trying to get close. Under the command of Count Todd, the soldiers on the front line stepped up their defense and seemed to vow to kill the orcs from the area. The giant python on the opposite side of the cliff began to counterattack, causing more than a dozen casualties, forcing humans to explore in the dark. Earl Todd expected this, and ordered the castle to extinguish all the light sources and prepare to evacuate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people must remain quiet and must not carry anything other than weapons, food and water. This means that the craftsmen and servants of the original castle need to give up all property. They were originally unwilling, but they also understood that after the soldiers left, the orcs would certainly occupy this place, leaving only one dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel, Janet and Kerry will be left after the departure of His Royal Highness, belonging to the last few of the nobility sequence. Behind them will be a long civilian team. Despite the strict withdrawal of the light, civilians are reluctant to leave their homes, and they will still be full of jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill and Siegel complained of no results, and Earl Todd heard the incident and ordered the guards to lengthen the defensive distance and protect the civilian team. At the same time, he asked the soldiers who protected the civilians to put all the supplies on the end of the aristocratic team, carrying only spears, short bows and light leather armor. Siegel pondered the taste: with a single command, these soldiers would be able to quickly gather forward and get rid of the bloated civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told Sir Bill about this, and the Jazz seemed to be mentally prepared. "Only on the battlefield can only be like this. We can't take too much risk for the disobedient part." He understood his disciple and advised him: "Do not say more about this matter, lest it cause more confusion." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter affected the mood of the Master, and then he became very silent. Giant Kerry did not notice this. He has been busy beside the trebuchet and is excited to operate. When Siegel passed by him, he also lowered his voice and said in an excited tone: "I have figured out the truth of this thing, and our Jackdaw tribe will also have a trebuchet, hehe!" Siegel is just a courtesy Sexual smile. The mind is not on this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet prepared things for a few people, she found a fitted inlaid leather armor, and after all the weapons were put on, it looked smart and strong, and full of Danger. She painted the image of the Mother Earth on the wall with chalk, kneeling in front of her, and praying silently. "Mother, please show your compassion and bless everyone. I know that the orcs are also the creatures in this land. You treat all life equally. I don't pray for victory, I only pray for reduction of killing. Peace and tranquility."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please look after us, please take care of Siegel, take care of the kittens. I finally do not have to pray to the god of shadows hypocritically, I want to get rid of the shadows of the shadows, the light I walked on the vast land. I used to secretly recite your name. Now I can finally pray to you, please don't give up on us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Janet heard the big voice from Sir Bill outside, and Kerry was laughing in the courtyard. In addition to this, there is a constant sound of the bowstring and a strange whistling of the hollow iron. She suddenly thought that she is currently on the top of the mountain. I don't know if the Mother of the Earth can still hear her prayers. It is said that this god is the most approachable and most lovable one. All the creatures born on the earth are her children. I don't know if the demon is counted in it. After all, the devil comes from hell and the abyss. Its lineage has nothing to do with the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncontrolled deformation of her left hand happened again and again, Janet did not dare to tell Siegel. Fortunately, every time the deformation is not as painful as the first time, the body will have a sign before the change, so that Janet can find a place to hide. She tried a lot of methods, but it was always impossible to organize the deformation. Fortunately, after the hand recovered consciousness, it could change back to its original shape, so Siegel never noticed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of bodies that can be changed each time is getting bigger and bigger. Originally only to the wrist, now has climbed half of the arm, but fortunately this trend has gradually slowed down, temporarily stopped under the elbow. Janet also prayed to Mother Earth that she hoped that this strange condition would heal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bowed her head and prayed devoutly: "Guide me, and the big mother, guide me the way I should go, I have been in the dark for too long, please don't let me lose my way."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after, she heard footsteps sounding behind her, and the sound of the robe dragging on the floor. Siegel came over to find her, and it should be time to start. Janet stood up stiffly, and her long knees were sore. She finally kissed the chalk portrait of Mother Earth and put the short blade back at the waist and greeted her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's time to go, Janet." Siegel reached out to her. "The time for evacuation is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They silently followed the last of the nobility team and walked on the rugged mountain road. Both the Hummer and the horse's mouth are wrapped in cloth, and they will not make a sound even if they encounter an emergency. Behind the ranks, the irons on the civilians sometimes sounded a collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was worried about this for a while, but the orcs didn't seem to care. Perhaps absolute silence is more likely to cause suspicion than the sound of jingling. The main goal of the orcs is still the castle, they are constantly shooting upwards, and they are not aware of the leaving team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ten mountain knights left in the Black Blood Castle to make the final delay. They throw javelins and stones at the foot of the mountain, shouting slogans and making the illusion of persistence. In the middle of the night, they will ignite several braziers in the castle to shine the dummies made in the courtyard. Then these mountain knights will also evacuate. Climb from the steep hills with the help of a six-legged lizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, people and horses line up a long queue and steadily march down the hill. On both sides of the road you can see the bodies of the orcs left by the cavalry, they are thrown away at will. It smells disgusting. All the nobility, soldiers, and civilians did not know the situation in front of the battle. Only Siegel knew through the eyes of the raven: the mountain cavalry had already crossed the two layers of defense, but was stubbornly blocked in the third orc camp. . Well, there is a relatively open valley with plenty of maneuvering space. The paladins of the morning temple have finally come into use, and they have summoned the gods to mount. All are exactly the same pale gold high horses. Armor like a wall, a long gun like a forest, with the group of cavalry, the third orc camp is only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, do you still need to follow this team after going down the mountain?" Kerry whispered and asked: "With our goodness, there is no above the plain." People can catch up and follow them instead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't worry about the threat of the orcs now, only the shadows of the dead." Siegel thinks of his own The friend did not qualify for the meeting, he should not know about it. He simply told the two companions and said: "If those undead creatures arrive, the pastor of the Temple of the Morning will protect you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We? Janet questioned: "What do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can't take me." Siegel thought of his undead. Say with confidence. But when Janet asked why, he just shook his head and said it was the credit of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked from the night until dawn, and finally the voice of the orcs screaming. After discovering that he was being played, the angry orc screamed and rushed down the hill. They are far from seeing the slow-moving team on the mountain road, especially the most civilians with heavy loads. The killing and looting ** made them extremely excited, and the speed of the charge was almost comparable to that of the running horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accelerate forward!" The order came from the front of the team, and sure enough all the soldiers began to run. The Paladin chose to place a line of defense on a narrow road. They used the help of divine power to move the stone of the size of the grinding disc and set the shooting position on the mountain wall. The commanding cavalry ran back and forth twice. The speed of the entire team has suddenly increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, civilians have not been left behind. After the emergence of the orcs, these people, who had little resistance, recognized the reality and knew that they could not escape with heavy cargo. So they dumped things on the side of the road. They help the old and carry the young, in order to survive as much as possible to squeeze the physical strength, biting his teeth and following the aristocratic team in front. Siegel stood by the road and continued to show lightness to the slow-moving old people and children so that they could keep up with the speed of the team. With his help, the civilian team was not opened. Instead, it has tightened a lot forward, and some have been mixed with the nobility queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Siegel took out the flames and raised it into the air, beginning to recite complex spells. He used his own artifacts as part of the spell material to summon the fire elemental creatures. The magic around them all rushed toward Siegel, forming a red vortex visible to the naked eye. The large fire element with four hands and four feet at the center of the flame instrument stood in front of Siegel, and a pair of flaming eyes on the orange-red body looked at Siegel with aura. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
