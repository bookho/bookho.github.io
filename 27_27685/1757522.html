			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stepped onto the wall and finally saw the situation outside. The lords of the south built camps three miles away from the city walls, and dug trenches and bunkers in the open space between them to transport the siege soldiers under the walls. They cut down trees and installed mobile towers and trebuchets in the camp. Siegel understood that now they are constantly launching an offensive, in order to drag his troops and wait for the completion of the siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to avoiding the arrows, transporting troops, the trenches can also limit the cavalry. Due to its good relationship with the Jackdaw tribe, the proportion of cavalry in Heim is the highest in the South. It seems that the enemy also knows this information, so it has taken precautions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy is very cautious and rarely reveals flaws," Mana said. "There were several fighter planes that had been attacked by cavalry, but then I thought it seemed to be all Trap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, raised his wand and began to sing a spell. The energy of magic, as he pleased, continued to gather in the air and surrendered under his control. Yan Ling Jing emits a reddish glow, guiding the fire element into the wand. Siegel only felt a gentle heat in his hand. He caught the tamed element of fire and then waved it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a loud bang, the fireball burst in the siege army, the red fire swallowed steel and flesh, and the airflow of the explosion allowed the soldiers to squat. Falling on the ground. "It's a magician!" someone shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a blast of oil tanks, nothing terrible." A knight waved his sword, pushed the hesitant soldier, opened his mouth and began to climb the ladder. Just then, another "tank" flew to him and burst on the ladder. After a flash of light, the knight fell heavily into the dirt, and was covered with pieces of burnt wood. The blood rushed out of the big mouth and could not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the lord, the lord is back!" The soldiers on the wall found this and cheered in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved his wand and dropped the fireball again. The enemies who attacked the city mourned in the flames. Roll over and use the dirt to extinguish the tongue. They watched in horror, hiding behind the knights with good armor, as if this would provide them with protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Cavaliers are the mainstay of war. They are the sharp knives and backbone of the army. For honor, for wealth or for love, they came to Heim's collar and wanted to prove themselves in the war. Siegel only wants to prove one thing: fire is stronger than meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball flew off the wall and fell into densely populated areas, effectively curbing the enemy's offense. Some knights picked up the longbow. Even raised a heavy scorpion, aiming at the city to shoot. Siegel naturally does not stupidly target, constantly changing position and launching fireballs from all angles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the military camp of the Southern Lord, someone counted the number of fireballs silently. "There are already seven fireballs." The man said: "Eight! It seems that the strength of this Siegel Master is really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Expected." A middle-aged knight wearing a silver breastplate and using a scorpion as a family emblem holds a string of roast chicken in his hand, painted honey, and placed it on a fire. "Master Caspar has long been acquainted, can not underestimate the enemy, can become the master of the Master's brain, strength is not bad. But he appears. Fireball will not have a great impact on our army."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" A female mage wearing a red robe and a beautiful face but shaved her hair snorted: "When did these troops become ours? Felton, you can To figure out the situation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I will send the Anpa of Nanchao City, Scott of Huaman Mountain, and the Campbell family of Soft Lake City to the front line The rest of the army is ours." The silver breasted man waved the chicken string as if he were using a wand. "Serra, I have helped you a lot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serra knows Felton’s thoughts, so he walks behind him and uses slender The scalloped fingers massaged gently on his head. "Want to reward, ha?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reward?" Felton shook his head. With a gentle wave of his fingers, Serra loses control of his body. Drop sitting next to the chair. "You have to remember your identity. I am the first singer of Master Caspar. Only the master can reward me. You only pay me at most. The South has gone through such a long time. There is still no red minaret, master. I am very dissatisfied. How can I help you if you are not looking at your classmates in the past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is camouflage and part of the transformation. Felton has often lost his initial appearance, he has had too many identities and has performed too many tasks. However, he always remembers that he is an apprentice of Master Kasper and wants to fight for the goal of the Knox Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no progress in tracking the work of Black Phoenix and Golden Dragon. The truth of these two names seems to be hidden, and even if you use prophetic spells, you can't get any information. Felton was afraid of the punishment of Master Caspar, so he calculated that he would make a contribution in the South to please the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to let the soldiers of Andoin attack until the wizard no longer uses the fireball." Felton did not care about the casualties, the cruel order : "Let other lords take a good look at what is called loyalty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel avoids bows and arrows, looks for opportunities and then shows downwards The fireball suppresses the enemy of the entire line of defense. Under constant bombing, the militiamen who had escaped their lives have all retreated into the trenches, trying to push their bodies down, letting the storm of fire pass over their heads. They prayed loudly, hoping that the benevolent Mother Earth would protect them from flames and burning torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s target for the attack was changed to a ladder. He summoned the fire hound, ran along the wall and swept past the defenders. They found the ladder on the city's head and they jumped up and then swooped down and attacked. The knight who climbed up took out the long sword in his hand while maintaining his balance while blocking the hot dog's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put the arrow!" The knight's sword was bitten, and there was pain in the tiger's mouth. He called out for assistance: "Archers? Pick up your hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support will come soon, the bow is inserted on the flame hound, and then like a torch Burn it up. The knight took the opportunity to withdraw the bitten weapon. Then force the dog's head down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He won, but immediately found himself losing his victory. The fire element hound, which stays on the ladder, has ignited the wooden ladder with its own body, and the flame blows the ladder of the ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladder fell. The brave knight fell and fell on the body. Fortunately, with the protection of armor, he saved his life, but the broken bones and the misplaced intestines made him lose the ability to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retreat!" Someone shouted: "Get away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignite by fireball The militia ran around and made a heartbreaking cry. Crazy rushed to the shield river and jumped in armor. Such a scene completely defeated the morale of the attackers, they jumped into the trenches and quickly withdrew. Siegel casts a spell, summons the false eye that floats, and floats out the wall to investigate the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The militiamen retreated, and the injured knights were also evacuated from the distance with the support of the attendants. Siegel saw some people hidden in the ditch, they clung to the wall and covered the figure with sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one is allowed to open the gate," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults, we need arrows. There are many more on the battlefield." Mana replied: "You must pay attention to the supply. The cost of war is too great." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought for a while, then said: "Hang a basket from the wall, up to three people at a time." He lowered his voice and said to the female shooter: "Hide the assassin in the ditch, don't relax your vigilance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the enemy retreated, the wall shouted with triumph, "Long live the Lord!" The orc soldiers raised their weapons in their hands and the screams were deafening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't call, pay attention to rest!" Siegel said: "They are all stupid, so they will come up and die. You have to be patient with idiots. Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people laughed. Then go to rest under the arrangement of the Orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come back, adults." The Orcs themselves wrapped in bandages and suffered multiple injuries, but the fighting spirit was still high. He pointed to himself. Said: "Can continue to fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel embraced the Orc and patted his back - it was the only one in his body that had no wounds. local. "Give you a task, 哼克, put my flag up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
