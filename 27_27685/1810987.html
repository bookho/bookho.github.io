			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to go to the city of Myrtle, you must also try to hide your identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will change the color of the hair, and the eyes can also make up. We will not say to know you or have anything to do with you." Elsa looked at Siegel, and some unconfidently said: "Adults... this way, Should it be enough?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t think they are tracking you through appearance.” Siegel said: “So, you need to stay with me. In a few days, I will create magical items for you to cover your identity. If you still haven't changed your mind in a few days, it will be safer at least when you are on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mother and the child looked at each other and agreed. Black hair and black eyes are the main signs of Siegel, which is reflected in his two descendants, but it is a needle in the hay to use these two clues to find people in the vast sea of ​​people. The mother and the child have been traveling, and the group of wizards used the transfer to find the hotel directly. Even if there are two probes tracking the mother and the child, the time for calculating the message delivery cannot be so accurately intercepted. Only by some means of magical positioning can the enemy's high efficiency be explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Siegel has to do is to block this detection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who are good at finding things are also good at hiding things, especially when Siegel knows about blood and magic, there is more to hide a living person. He took the mother and son two makeups into the city of Jima and lived in the hotel. He made Elsa pretend to have a fever, so there was a good reason to stay for a long time. Although I am afraid that this is a certain infectious disease, the two people around the patient are very healthy, and the room rate is always paid in a timely and sufficient manner. There is a tip from time to time, and the hotel owner will close one eye. eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such environment in a magical laboratory, so Siegel’s desire to make magic items must be done by himself. He arranges a simple array in the hotel room, relying on precise control of the elemental energy to cast, ensuring that there is no obvious magical fluctuations. The whole room was like a closed can, and from the outside it was not felt that someone was casting a spell in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is another look inside. Two magical necklaces float in the air, constantly emitting a multicolored light. These rays will be absorbed at the edge of the circle. Become a bright ball of soft light. Then Siegel will put in the glowing dwarf runes and re-inject the ball into the necklace, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of using dwarf runes is to make the necklace work longer and less affected by changes in the magical environment. On this basis. Siegel uses the techniques of Elf Magic and Blood Magic to turn the bloody features of the wearer into pure elves. In this way, no one can think that this child will be the son of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the necklace is still casting a spirit control effect, using the spirit spell effect of Knox. Subtle influences on people around. This spell is not harmful, it just makes the people around you always believe that the necklace wearer's statement about identity is not suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forging two necklaces took ten days, and Siegel used all his magic skills to achieve such high efficiency, but he did not touch two. The magical person took a vivid lesson. For young Dodd, it was like opening a door to the new world in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms., I still recommend that you go to the city of Myrtle and accept my asylum." Siegel took the horse and sent two people to the outside of Jima. . "The plan you have to go to your relatives has told others that it is likely to have been exposed to the group of people who want to catch you. So the place you are going to is not safe. You are not safe on this road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, I thank you for your kindness, but staying away from you is the only really safe way." Elsa said. Sometimes she feels that she is a bit blind, why not accept the help of this man? He is a Marquis, who is in charge of the vast territory, and is still a caster with powerful power. If you go to Heim, the risk you have to bear is nothing but the eyes and hurts of the Lord's wife, but it can give your child a higher starting point. Whether it is to learn the skills of the knight or the skill of the mage, it is impossible in the country. In the country, his best ending was to become a big businessman. Or be a waiter under a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then he will live as an illegitimate child and suffer the damage that this name brings to him. Elsa had seen many illegitimate children, and the nobles brought them to the world with their own preferences, but at the same time created a world full of prejudice and harm. This is very unfair. In comparison, orphans can get sympathy and help, much better than illegitimate children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five years? Why is this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said: "Not only you, my wife and children are also threatened by the same group of enemies. I have given myself five years to solve this problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You as a sergeant and marquis, and an enemy that can't be dealt with?" Ersha didn't understand the situation, but she had a tougher character: "There are enemies outside, are you still here? If it is me, I will kill their nest and kill them one by one. As long as the enemy dies If it is gone, then there is no threat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled: "There will be a day." Then he looked at Dodd and said to him. "In the future, no matter what problems you encounter, you can come to me. I will shelter you and help you. But there is a premise, that is, to protect your mother and keep her happy. I have not been Knowing your existence, now that I know it, it’s not the same thing, whether it’s for you or for me. I have no parents after I was born. My last name is a squid. It is no different from the illegitimate children born at sea, 'waves' and 'fish.' I don't know how to feel it, so I will never let that feel to you. Are you willing to go with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsa was shocked. She knew that if the man in front of him forcibly took away his son, she could not stop it. Even the four wizards who found them were not killed and killed between the electric and the flint? And the two necklaces have the ability to confuse people, more powerful than any psychedelic hypnotic potion. According to Siegel's magical ability, he can take the child away and erase his memory, letting her forget that she once had a son. He can also change the child's memory and let him forget his mother. For ordinary people, he is absolutely capable of doing whatever he wants, except for his own sense of morality. Nothing can stop him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dodd shook his head and said, "I want to be with my mother." On him, I can see my own shadow, which makes Ai Elsa is very pleased. But it can't alleviate her nervousness at all. The woman licked her lips and looked at Siegel, for fear that he would take out his wand and start casting spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel just reached out and touched the child's head, revealing a helpless smile. "Okay. If this is the case, then we will say goodbye. I sincerely hope that there will be opportunities to meet you, or at least to receive your letters. I have no other requirements, even if you do not want to tell me your address, please tell My current situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, we will write." Although Elsa took a sigh of relief, she still wanted to get on the road as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved and bid farewell to them, watching them ride on horses and donkeys to leave. Then he took a deep breath and suddenly reached out to the woods on the side of the road. The transparent spherical force field squeezes from the outside to the inside, sweeping down a lot of shrubs and grass. A group of black shadows hit the left and right in the ball. But it can't break through. Siegel’s strength is far more than in the past, and it’s hard to prevent him from suddenly shooting without warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow slowly calms down and gradually condenses into a human form. He looked at Siegel with his hands down, and his cold eyes were as always. "I didn't expect to be discovered by you, Siegel Squid. It has been gone for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chaney, is this something you arranged?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What appears in the prison of the force is the saint of the murder god, who has dealt with Chanem in the underground base. If it is not the magic ring that is carried in your hand to remind yourself that there is a moving saint force around you, it is impossible to find the sacred person who is proficient in hidden murder only by his own investigative ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem, as the sacred murderer, is sure to be well versed in planning and using various arrangements and plans to achieve his goals. So when he appeared. Siegel suspected that all this was the arrangement of the murderous god, and even the appearance of the Lear apprentice was in his plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All this has nothing to do with me." Chanem said: "Do you believe that I am your business, and what to do next is your own choice. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stared at him, constantly compressing the size of the field. Chanem was squeezed. But did not reveal a trace of fear. He knows that even if he is squashed, he will be born again and stand up again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know the encounter of the Mother of the Earth not long ago, the poor halfling." Siegel said: "He was born again hundreds of times. This makes me know that even the Holy One has limits. Chanem, I want to know where the limits of the sacred murderer are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole thing has nothing to do with me. If I don't find someone using the transmission, and then there is a spell battle, I will not come out to see it." Chanem said: "I thought you were coming to trouble me, unexpectedly. Until you are just dealing with the troubles of your lover and illegitimate child. You don't want Lear's guy to know their existence, which I can understand. I have a common language with you in dealing with the prophecy master."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can think that you are begging for mercy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Chanem shook his head. "You don't believe that I can understand. After all, using lie to mislead is my ability, and in this respect, I claim that no one will object. But I will never ask for mercy, even if it is a master. The sorcerer of the legendary spell level ability. I really didn't think that you would actually..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly thought of something, squinting and looking at Siegel I saw it from head to toe several times. Then he began to laugh, from a low smile to a loud laugh. Siegel tightened the prison of force again, and Chanem stopped laughing and waved at Siegel: "I understand, I understand. You are hiding in the god of magic and knowledge. Godhead, but I don't know how to find me. I have to say that your search ability is really strong, even I can find it, then there is a trace of what you might find all the gods dream of."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the murder god and was shocked by his ability to reason. None of these saints have a good deal, they have seen too much and have done too much. Unlimited life brings infinite experience, and those ideas that I think are incredible are just reappearing for them yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s useless to kill me. After I die, I will reconnect with the body of the gods. The god of murder will be able to get this information. He will Shape a saint again, or exchange information directly with Lear for the benefit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can imprison you and seal you deep into the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chennam nodded: "You can do this. Imprisonment has this ability, but for me, imprisonment is not a permanent effect, I will slowly It’s not so easy to be sealed, just like the power of God is not so easy to find.” He rubbed his hand and looked at Siegel, solemnly saying: “I work with you to find the magic god. The power, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"purpose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just a saint, if Keeping the current situation can never be a true god, just a vassal of the murder god. But as long as I can get a little power, I am enough to ignite the fire, there is The pursuit of the power of the true God. You are not very strange why I will give myself a name? The body of the murderer has received serious harm, has been torn apart. His power spread to the world he has shrouded, turned into a child to kill each other Through this kind of killing, he was able to regain strength and restore the true body. The world of thunder wall is shrouded in the ruin of the world, and it has a serious hindrance to the divergence of the divine power. Therefore, my saint is able to stand on his own. This is my best. Opportunity, murder the god of murder and become a new true God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, "I can hardly believe your words, after all, you are cheating and Layout is the main force, you are probably misleading me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this is very likely." Chanem spread his hand: "I am good at Various layouts, but nothing to do with chaos. In order to achieve the goal, I and the devil are very respectful of the contract. I have told you the most secretive situation of the murder god, and even exposed his weaknesses - if you are here Kill me and can't recover I really died because there is no god of murder to raise me. For me, this is a kind of gambling, it is more for you, but the ultimate choice is in your hands. Kill or not kill, It's that simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do I need you?" Siegel said after thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The layout of the gods is not so simple, even if you have the means to find the power of the magic god, you are sure to be able to crack the trap he set? Although I also I can't do it, but I'm the best helper you can find. The magical priesthood is tempting, but predicting the priesthood is my goal. When the combination of prophecy and murder ability, I can do anything. Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a more precise killing, just like you were before." Siegel shook his head. "How do I know that you will not slap me at the last moment to steal the fruits of victory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
