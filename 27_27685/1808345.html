			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a voice in the heart that keeps persuading Siegel: Promise him, his plan is the most correct way out; you You can end waiting, suffering and worry, open your arms and embrace freedom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you implement this plan, you can take away many people with the door of the outside world. Janet and Isaac will definitely follow, Mana has no problem, Sir Bill's family should be able to talk about the work, the wizard's mage can also see the development of things, at least deceived can be deceived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve scorpions, that is, Moore’s wife Nata, may follow, maybe not. However, as a sergeant, it would not be too difficult to tie her up. In fact, I believe that as long as I pass Moore, I can still speak her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Evan... can he let go of his country and his subjects? Do you still want to kidnap the king? Siegel thought carefully and found that everyone actually has people he cares about, and each person he cares about has someone he cares about. This will be endless, unless you only give each person a limited number of places. The greater the number of people, the greater the possibility of disclosure. As long as one person prays to God about this matter, the plan is exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This turned out to be a difficult choice. If the world is about to be destroyed, it is a kind of good deed to live with anyone. Although there are many people who are left to meet death, at least they can say to themselves: "I am not capable enough to save everyone, but I Do your best." But the current behavior is exactly the opposite, taking away a very small number of people and then killing the rest. Although there is not much difference in the results, the way of doing things largely determines good and evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like people will die one day, and it’s two different things to let him die or murder him. Even if this person has an incurable disease, he will soon be in the air. Is it okay to kill him? Siegel is deeply immersed in deep thinking. What is good, what is evil, good and evil on motivation, good and evil in action, and moral speculation seems to never end. Siegel feels that he can't find his life. The answer to this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner looked at Siegel and knew that he was caught in a tangle. Then wait. As time goes by, he is losing patience. "No matter how you are, I can stop the wall of the storm and let the world be destroyed! Don't get caught up. Get up and get up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel looked up at him and looked at him with gaze: "I thought about it! You said that I can learn anything, can you teach me how to stop the wall of the storm? I can try to build a The magic array, you can support the world instead of you. Then you can be free!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a fool! This world has never meant anything to me! If it’s not for a few of you who need time to be born and grow, how can I manage these people’s lives and deaths!” Turner screamed and yelled: “I want to kill those gods and let them die in this world! It’s my purpose, this is what I have to do!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But can you really do this?” Siegel shook Shaking his head: "Can you be sure that God's body is in this world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& "I know that many worlds have racial gods. I know that it is impossible to kill the elves, the guardians of the dwarves, unless all the elves and dwarves are cleaned first." Turner’s eyes were filled with fierce light, with excitement and addiction. The look of blood. "I just want to kill their local gods, this is enough to eliminate the hatred of my heart! This is no problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded but shook Shake his head. "The body of God is in the kingdom of God. Even the local gods do not live in the walls of the storm. Of course, you will say that the rule of the storm wall's ability to absorb and destroy will bring these gods together and eat them together. But that's normal! You stopped the wall of the storm and actually saved these gods, giving them the opportunity to deal with the destruction of the crystal walls and believers, at least to relocate their own bodies or cut off the connection with the world. It’s an arduous project that takes time. But I think even the god of magic and knowledge can give up the godhead and divine power, and other gods should be able to do it. Once this happens, they will definitely have time to evacuate this time. The power, but death is definitely not going to happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner was stunned and stood on the ground and trembled. His eyes swept away unconsciously in his eyes, and there was no focus at all. Siegel looked at him. Waiting for him, patiently persuaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, among all the gods, what do you hate most is the magic god? You value and love our brothers, so the most intolerable It should be that he took away a hundred scorpions and was trapped in the magical array to do experiments. He is now incarnation of Lear. The prophecy of the school and the Masters Association. I can open the door to the outside world, he naturally Yes, no matter what world we go to, he will find us again sooner or later, and reopen the plan. Perhaps in order to achieve the purpose more conveniently, it may even reach a new agreement with the gods of the new world. This will be endless. Unless there is a way to get rid of all the tails!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now are we afraid of him?" Siegel shook his head. "I'm already thinking of ways to deal with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You already have a plan?" Turner gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I have a plan for the gods. And I think, since you can build the first balance agreement, then after the situation changes, it should Can you still build a second one?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner touched his chin and said something difficult: “It’s hard to reach a new agreement. Those gods have already eaten. If you lose money, you will definitely be prepared. But... If you can show the power to destroy the gods, then it will be much simpler to reach a balance. But even then, I don’t have the extra strength to stop the wall of the storm, the world will still Destruction. What is the significance of doing this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you implement your original plan, you will not be able to speak without success. I can't convince myself. You will say that I am pedantic, I know this very well, and even I will say that I am pedantic. But even then, I have to do it. It is like a knight rushing to the devil, is he not? Know that you may die, or you may not be able to make it completely. Threat? Doesn't he know that he is dying? Sir Bill said that the spirit of the Cavaliers is the beautification of the Cavaliers by ordinary people. The real knight knows the consequences of his actions. He knows that his actions are stupid and not according to the opinions of most people. Meaningful, but they can still persist because they know that it is right. It does not mean that it is good, and sometimes it is not good for itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to be such a fool." Turner shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't laugh at me, are you not the same?" Siegel said: "In order to create an environment for us all to survive, we are shut down by the gods." Place, not seeing the sky, are you not stupid? According to your statement, what is the sacrifice of others, is it a fool? You have your persistence, I also have my own. I have no qualifications to ask you anything. You have done so much, I am thankful that it is too late. I only hope that you can believe me and give me a chance to work hard. And..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" And what?” Turner sighed and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have hatred, you have depression, don't you want to see the moment of revenge with your own eyes? Let the gods who are high on the top bow down, let them even do it." Prepare for prevention, but still have to bow. Is that feeling bad? From the enemy, you can't even be sure that they are dead or alive, isn't this what escape? I don't think it's addictive, how about you?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persistence is a force, and hatred is also a force. From the conversation, Siegel knows that Turner is not the kind of character that is considered for the people of the world. He only cares about himself and his "brothers." So talking to him about morality doesn't make any sense, but only irritates him. Only from the hope of Siegel itself, from the perspective of revenge, it is possible to do his work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is no hatred between Siegel and Lear. At present, there are only different positions and conflicts of objectives, so it is necessary to decide the outcome. Lear is not a madman. He can at least understand the truth of controlling the scale of conflict. If he reaches out to the people around Siegel, then Siegel will be like Hatna, full of hatred and become crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner sat cross-legged in Stonehenge, closed his eyes and thought about Siegel’s words. Siegel, who can say it, has already said it, so he also sat down with his knees to think about Turner. After about ten minutes, Turner finally opened his eyes and said in a calm voice: "If it is other guys, such as the top of the peak or the extreme twelve, I will not agree. But you The rules are possibilities, the possibilities of expansion, tolerance and learning. If the plan is likely to succeed, then it is only you! OK, what do you say specifically!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Chang Shu breathed out and finally "save the world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I plan to find the power left by the god of magic and knowledge to reach the point where it can threaten the gods. Although I am somewhat stubborn in many things, I know very well that the power of choice and the basis of persistence is strength. Without power, ideals are empty. Even if it is found that things are impossible, it is important to have more self-protection power. Evan, the owner of the hundred-faced scorpion, is a Swordsman, no matter what world he has, he will not have much influence on his strength. I can't. Many worlds have no magic. After all, magic is not one of the three basic rules of the world. Spirit is more common than Rubik's Cube. After all, faith More close to the soul's needs than the spell, you say yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
