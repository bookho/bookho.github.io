On his back, he had an obsidian dagger, and the blood soaked the back of the mage's robes. The original neat silver hair has also become dilapidated and chaotic, and a face is even more embarrassing. It seems that Chanem has caused him a lot of trouble and injury, even more than Siegel completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He twisted his body and hooked the nibble dagger's grip with his fingertips, but he couldn't catch it because of the slippery blood. When Siegel saw it, he stood on the steps and displayed four arrows, and he was not ready to hit his arm. Along with the silent explosion, Lear's arm fell softly, and burns, frostbite and corrosion wounds covered half of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You won't be a god, you can't be a god!" Lear snarled, his words with the smoldering smoke. "You will die, you will kill everyone! You don't understand the concept of magic god, you can't bear so much power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things are artificial Siegel said, while condensing the power of the element in his hand. His ultimate goal is to eliminate Lear, and not to be on the final stage or to rank second. When Lear was seriously injured, couldn’t he use the spell quickly? "Big crack!" At this time, the lengthy spell finally came into use, and the ultimate destruction spell that destroyed all magical effects and magical equipment was displayed by Siegel and succeeded in Ley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destructiveness of similar element surges, the big cracking lifted every protective spell on him in a very tough way. The structure in which the elements are connected to each other is completely destroyed, which causes the magical formation to smash into dross and all the magical items fail. The scroll became dirty paper, the potion became waste, the spell stick and the short stick changed. Lear is like a pierced balloon. Slammed down. The original magical light is attributed to bleakness. He was a teenager in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stubbornly raised his head. Lear showed a bleak smile. "You won." He said: "You and the sacred murderer killed me. You finally got what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he Just fell to the ground and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since far away, Siegel can feel the death coming to Lear. Heartbeat, breathing, and muscle tremors all stop, and it is completely dead. It's that simple? Siegel never believes. He showed his death truth on Leer and found no reaction, just like the state of stone or corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not going to die at the School of Magic." Lear’s words were still in his ear, only one day passed. Siegel will not forget. He frowned and seemed to think of something, so he rushed up the steps to the top of the Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that comes into view is the fire of God. It is not a burning flame, the fire is very cold, like a pale blue crystal that freezes. There are a total of fifteen forks in the crystal, which is more than what Chanem said, representing the strength of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a group of things that are constantly creeping and deformed in the center of the cold crystal. It looks like a flame at a distance, but it is a mysterious text. It is said that different people will see different things, the warriors will see the battle of various weapons, the assassin will see the changing shadows, and the druids can see the vibrant nature. What appears in Siegel’s sight is the magic runes, as if each one is familiar. But it can't really understand. The fire of the gods exudes a strong attraction, and people sink into it without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the scorpion reflected the tragedy that occurred five seconds later to Siegel’s mind. He suddenly woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black trajectory slanted from the air, silently, ignoring all magical protection and heading straight to Siegel's back. The trajectory has an anti-magic field effect, but it is limited to itself and does not touch the magical perception of the attacker in advance. Siegel saw the situation is not good, and quickly squatted, while using the pace of the elves to accelerate. He rolled forward, escaped the attack, and turned back to see the attackers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a goblin, the bloodline should not be pure, there are some characteristics of human beings, but it is indeed a goblin. He was only wearing a black velvet blouse, bare thighs, and a black metal wand in his hairy hand. The staff is not completely black, and a milky white gem is inlaid in the top groove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leer?" Siegel raised his hand with four arrows, but was easily opened by the black staff, and the energy of the elements dissipated in midair. He hasn't encountered this kind of situation yet, at least no one can crack the four arrows. He became cautious and couldn't easily waste his own cell phone meeting, otherwise it would be easy to be controlled by the rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not Lear, I am called Ender." The goblin waved a staff higher than it, and said to Siegel with imposing manner: " Leave here and leave my fire! You don't deserve it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still call you Lear, so I can feel more comfortable." Bounce your fingers and constantly emit elemental energy fluctuations. He found that no matter what kind of element will be rejected by the black stick, and no matter what kind of energy will be absorbed by the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All your spells are based on the elements, and it is just being restrained by this weapon." The goblin proudly said: "The element negates the staff, in Created on the basis of magic, anti-magic field, dissociation ray and large cracking, all the elements in the spell will be broken down into harmless forms. There is only one such thing in the world, but with it, you can't help me. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From magical energy to magical skills, you have lost to me, even if your layout will send me to the wild beast wilderness. It will start now. Comparing the strength of magical equipment? I am definitely not as good as you. After all, you were a magical god. You must be knowledgeable and rich in reserves for many years. But you still have some shortcomings in some aspects. In any case, you are only It’s the magic god of this world, your eyes are in this world. I don’t know if the spell is based on the rules you established or the part of the world itself, but you have to know that in other places, it’s not necessarily the elements. Core."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Selling knowledge in front of me?" Lear Ender said with a smile: "Of course I know. Do you know why?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I can use it." Siegel showed a sly gesture. Take out the heavy-duty siege hammer from the space bag. Slowly go to the goblin. "Time and time again, through the test of life and death, through the pain of blood and fire, I lost the dangers that were added to me. I saw, I learned, I seek peace by fighting."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, what you have experienced is just the fate line that has been modified and controlled by the nephew. Your life has long been doomed, from the beginning to the end, but a book written in accordance with the outline. The process in the middle is boring, but the end is already doomed, you are born in the ocean, died in the fire, complete the cycle of ice and fire. You still have a lot to learn, but you have no chance to learn! You are just watching Not the future scorpion! That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you look at the light, you are blind as you are in the dark, I only believe in myself. Efforts to get out of the road. Not God sees and plans a good future.” Siegel said: “It is obvious that it is not the breadth of knowledge and the depth of the vision that determines the battle between us. Even with the mastery of magic and It doesn't matter the use of energy, just Who is working harder. That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek Lear smiled and said: "Good, good, good! I like it, I like it!" As soon as he finished speaking, he rushed up, and the long stick drew a black arc and slammed into the mace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the great power from the arm, Siegel only feels incredible, how can this dwarf goblin body be so strong? Hundreds of rounds of hands-on, he found that this Lear's "divided body" is not only powerful, but also very agile, martial arts moves are sinister, and the footwork is also biased towards the assassin genre. Where did he learn from him, is it from Chanem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A distraction, his pelvis is stunned and his body recedes. The eyes of the goblin shine brightly, and the opportunity to swoop up, jump into the air and squat! The dwarf Elint once taught that any attack that leaves the ground can't be changed. Just watch out for the twisting movement, and the rest is just the difference of how far it can fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the true power of the Siege Mace has not been reflected yet, this time just let Lear see it! With a glimpse of his arm, Siegel uses the ability of plasma to activate the mace, allowing it to rush toward the goblin in an unstoppable way. The black mace hammer and the black staff collided together, and the huge shock wave formed a substantial wind pressure, which made Siegel's body squat back three steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblin was even more miserable, and was directly shot and flew out. In the blink of an eye, he hit the ceiling and spewed a blood, and slammed it on the ground. The staff became u-shaped and bounced on the hard slate floor, making the last sound. The breath of life disappeared again, and the goblin lost his breath like the old Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
