			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder has been sitting in the ruins of the lonely dwarf for 400 years, and since he finished the last order of the maker, he has been sitting in his birth. Inside the workshop, a mottled, burnt-out test bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is made of clay and can change shape, but he has not used this ability for a long time - no need - he thinks so of. Moss and mushrooms have covered his body for a long time, and he blended with the surrounding ruins. Only a pair of pure red eyes radiated a faint glow in the eye sockets - so he had a special name called Rhett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while there was a mage passing through here, he closed his eyes and pretended to be a common mound, so he could continue to be alone but safely sitting here. He didn't like the smell of blood on the wizard, which reminded him of the crime he had committed. Although these crimes were ordered by his master, he had no choice but to loyalty, but the dwarf's blood was still stuck on his fist, and their curse before his death would still linger in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was at the beginning of the production, as a member of the trench army against the dragon. But something in his body can absorb the soul power of the dragon. His body is stronger and stronger under the water of the dragon. He gradually has his own ideas, but he is still just a clay figurine and must execute orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf Runner found this and tried to understand why. "Perhaps you can understand how magic items are intelligent." The runeman said this, "This will make the Petit clan more powerful." But contrary to expectations, the soul of death is bred with the power of horrible chaos, and the dwarf rune is gradually plunged. Depressed and crazy, he issued the wrong order, triggered the wrong organ, a series of events that made the fortress self-destructive, and the dragon finally completed revenge in a strange way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder began thinking after completing everything, for four hundred years. In the first hundred years, he was thinking about right and wrong. In the second hundred years, he was thinking about good and evil. In the third hundred years, he was thinking about life and death. In the recent hundred years, he has been thinking about the problems of God and the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought is now interrupted by a young human being, wearing a breastplate but holding a wand. After having a map of the entire cave, a lot of things have become easier. Siegel can easily avoid the trap and use the nearest shortcut to get to the destination quickly. He managed to recognize the golem from a pile of mushrooms and patted him gently. The spores of the mushroom floated into the air with the tapping, and Siegel even sneezed several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Golem, I am guided by the guide to seek your help. A blood magician caught my friend, I hope you can help me rescue They."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam decided not to move, he still wanted to continue thinking, not wanting to participate in the battle of mortals. Anyway, whether it is a hundred years or a thousand years, these flesh and blood will eventually die. ‘What is the point? He always thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not give up, he cast a spell, cleaned the rubbish and dust attached to the golem, and then moved the mushrooms and moss to the side. The body of the clay golem is revealed, still strong and strong. If you look closely, you can find some dark red runes deep in the cracks of the clay. Originally these were silver, which was painted when the dwarf clerk made the golem. But the blood of the dragon has stained these runes, giving them a mysterious power, which has created Rhett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees the Golem and ignores him. Guess that there should be a correct way to activate the Golem. He first looked around and tried to find the control necklace of the Golem - the Golems created by the Masters are often manipulated with such things. The dwarf's rune is using another control to identify the lineage, so there are no controllers around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I have no other way, I can only try Jacques's spells." Siegel scratched his head, found the casting material, and placed it in turn. in front of. "The dragon said that you have a smart golem, so I will try to break the lock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I don't have a lock in my body, if I want to move If you have already, you can move yourself. Reid thought, and then his thoughts began to drift away again. He often did. ‘Why can I think? Where do I think? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel spent more than twenty minutes preparing the spell, and the light caused by the spell shrouded Rhett’s body and went straight into the body of the Golem. However, the young mage did not know that this spell was not originally designed for Rhett. When Jia Kun came to this ruin, he found two passages. One wants to verify the blood, he thought that the dragon blood can be successful, but the ghost of the dragon will sense the breath of dragon blood and launch an attack. This ghost is not afraid of most of Ja Kun's magic, but it is enough to end his adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhett felt itchy under the influence of the spell, which is a novel experience for him. He wanted to get up and return to the state of rigidity and indifference, but he was able to restrain the impulse, still motionless, with his eyes closed and sitting on the bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the spell dissipated, and Siegel did not notice any change in the Golem. He thought the spell failed. As an apprentice mage, the knowledge of the Golem is too esoteric. Only after a lot of disciplines such as spells, occultism, magical rituals, and summoning and shaping are studied, it is possible to learn the production of the Golem. Siegel had a copy of "The Study of Magical Decoration" in the folding fortress - there were two books, but the people of the Knox Association took one. He also opened it in his spare time. Only about 10% of the text, he can understand what it means to express, and the rest is completely incomprehensible. He also went to the Masters Federation to inquire about the author's name: Lynch and Oss, but these two people did not record it, it may be just a general country mage, the conjecture recorded in this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a few paragraphs in it, Siegel remembers quite clearly: Lynch once said that he has encountered a ghost with a soul, the process is "full "Pain and horror", "The condition of self-awareness is cognitive life and death", but even the most brilliant mage "is difficult to explore this problem." Therefore, it is difficult for the Master to actively create a magical image. On the contrary, some gods through the hands of the priest, "have a very small chance" to complete the process. "So I think that this problem can only be studied after becoming a god," Lynch recorded. "So I gave up the research in this area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former words he thinks are very It makes sense, but the latter sentence makes Siegel think that the book is definitely the hand of a local mage from a head with a fever. However, this book is a commemorative adventure of Longshi Cliff, and it seems to work very well, so it stays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the magic image, I have no way." Siegel gave up the release of the spell and stood up and said: "I can't guess your control." Command, I have only a lot of spells, and there is really nothing to do. I hope that you can help, but I will also save my friends without you. It’s a matter of life and death, and I can’t think of that much.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Siegel patted the clay golem, stuffed a few mouthfuls into his mouth, re-examined the whole body equipment, left the workshop, and proceeded according to the map instructions. "Dwarf Temple", the dragon said that the blood magician was there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually close to the destination, Siegel has long extinguished the light of the wand, he tried to lighten his feet, weaken his breath, and move it step by step. He heard a breathless gasp from far away, like a patient who had been tortured for a long time and was taking the last force to fight death. Then he saw the shining red-blooded light, accompanied by a sizzling like lightning. Only then can he hear the screams of violent screams, and there is a burst of hysterical laughter with asthma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out the dragon's tooth dagger and was ready to throw, and the obsidian dagger was placed at his hand next to his belt. He firmly believes that even a blood magician needs to recite a curse, and he needs to make a gesture of guiding. He only had one chance. Just insert the dagger into the heart of the wizard and everything will end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly approached the room, where the door was just an arched hollow and there was no door panel. The source of the light seems to be a swaying wind lamp on the roof of the short temple. The dim light shone on the pillars inside the temple, casting a black shadow on the stone wall of the outer passage. Siegel saw a figure in a robe wearing it in the projection of the pillar. Sometimes the room suddenly became brighter, and the figure would become huge and fill all the gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is getting closer and closer, his toes slipping through the dry, hot ground, and there is no sound at all. This is a skill of the Elf War Dance, which keeps the body's center of gravity moving smoothly and silently. He is calculating the law of screams and ray, and guessing the layout of the room in the room through the projected shadow. ‘Rhythm, Timing and Determination’ Siegel reminded himself that he worked hard to apply all the knowledge he had learned and to do everything best to fight for a favorable situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood magician is satisfied with the Prince Aaron who is hanging on the wall. All the royals are eager for eternal life, so he can heal with superb blood magic. His wounds and led him into this trap. The Knox Federation arranged the attack, and the red magic tower they built was so powerful in controlling thinking that even the slayer of the murderer could control it. But the blood of the king is so important, how can it be given up for the politically insignificant harvest? Sending a lamp god is a step in the game. Fortunately, neither the Knox Association nor the Mage Federation found it. The blood of the king was led to the dragon trap, where the dwarf tried to extract the magical power of the dragon's blood power, and the blood was changed to have a chance of success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
