			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark underground, only hearing and touch have an effect, but many times it is impossible to tell the difference between the two. Siegel transforms himself into a form of sputum, which saves the trouble of breathing and better hides his figure. With the help of anthropology, he constantly changed his position in the underground, and the province was caught by some huge creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield has become very confusing, even the keen animals that can perceive the environment through tremor can not tell the enemy. Although the rules of the magic tower constantly command the magic beasts to find the enemy and kill him, after all, the magic tower only commands the order, pointing out the approximate position and not taking over the sensory ability of the creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual-oriented monsters have become like the blind, they are squatting on the ground, often kicked off by the big monsters they suspect. The magical beast using the olfactory search sniffed on the ground and found the smell of Siegel and began to dig down. But only when the creatures with the true Nuggets ability arrive, can the pits really become holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underground, Siegel uses silence to eliminate the sound around him. Although this does not completely shield your position, it is enough to bring trouble to those who feel the vibration. There are many creatures like the Zirot, Fermi ants and Sol Stone. They also interfere with each other when searching for Siegel. Occasionally, the single creatures close to the Master are quickly resolved. Lear had to use a thousand troops to kill Sigel, but in the end it was turned into a controlled hide-and-seek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no way to find the target would have allowed these creatures to relax, and the tranquillity circle was on the sidelines. Although this array is not as efficient as dealing with humans in the face of monsters, rest and relaxation are concepts that all creatures can understand. At first, the small creatures of the three or three were left in the gathering area of ​​the large units, and they found an undisturbed place to climb down and fight the children; then the dragons hovering in the sky were also bored, and the thoughts in their minds were full of sleep. After that, in addition to some magically resistant creatures still wandering slowly, other creatures began to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the creatures on this layer of the Magic Tower are resting all the year round, or are stagnant by time, or simply dormant. It is impossible to provide all the biologically sufficient food here, but to maintain their survival with the power of magic. So rest is a normal state for these creatures, and the tranquility array touches the "switch" of their rest, and soon the violent herd is calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly, these creatures have no pursuit except for rest, and even the basic needs of working hard have been replaced by rest. The feeling of hunger and thirst killing can't affect the happiness brought by rest. Soon, even breathing will become less important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are elemental creatures, constructed creatures, or undead creatures in this group of monsters, then at least some guards can be left in the sphere of tranquillity. Now it seems that as long as there is enough time, even the dragon will eventually fall asleep. Being too happy is fatal, and this sentence has become a reality by Knox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only monsters on the site that may not be affected are plant monsters, but most of them are very slow and are still far from coming. The buzz on the ground shook the sky, and nearly 100,000 monsters occupied the ground for dozens of miles, cuddling and slumbering together. After a while, a small earthen bag arched from the tail of the Sphinx and broke into a clod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call...the outside is finally quiet." Siegel has been in the ground for hours, he is afraid that when he leaves, these monsters will be magic tower Leaving also left the scope of the tranquillity. It seems that Knox's spells have their own uniqueness when dealing with large numbers of enemies. If you rely solely on the indiscriminate bombing of elemental magic, it is estimated that...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not necessary to estimate that if a spell is formed, the death must be Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as he appeared, the Magic Tower noticed that he continued to give orders to the monsters. But sleeping is really a very pleasant thing, most of the creatures are only in the dream of the invasion of the invaders. Even the dragon, but gently turned over, rubbed his teeth, even if he handled the errand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel came to the place where the Lille station was before and began to verify his guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He constantly oscillates the space and tries to find weaknesses. For the sergeant, space is not a stable existence, but has its thickness and density. Any door is the earliest use of space power spells, and subsequent transmissions and shadows have been to the door of the outside world, and it is not developed on this principle. Until the "space" seeds in the legendary spells appeared, the ability of this type of spell was basically the ultimate in strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the flow rate of time became different, Siegel finally saw the clue. At this time, the space turbulence formed by the sputum depicts a different picture, the magic array used to hide the entrance channel to repair the space barrier is somewhat "can not keep up with progress." It was like a mischievous child dig a hole in the ground. The adult at the tip of the eye quickly found the pit and filled it up so that it couldn't even be seen by the naked eye, so the child would think that he had not dug anything. Now that Siegel has changed his time, the adults are "not too late" and the pit will naturally appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finally found the clue, this is a breakthrough result, at least the possibility of analysis and cracking. Siegel rushed to write down this magical array, and then began to calculate in his mind. His process of being a magician is the process of studying and learning the circle of law, from dwarves, humans to elves, Neats, Knox, and writers and goblins, and various tactics accompany his growth. Sometimes, the spell becomes an aid, and these arrays are the things that run through all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear’s legal array is very subtle. Many things are the kind of skills that can only be thought of when they are accumulated over a long period of time, and the efficiency of his application is also high and scary. Siegel has inspired a lot. Although the two were subordinate, Lear's knowledge was enough to make him the best magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not enough to make his spells unbreakable. Siegel thought of several methods, but the method of deceiving the tactics is the safest, and can temporarily make the squad think that the manipulator has become Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it. Siegel vacated and began to fluctuate in time and space. He took out the rune material from the space bag and acted quickly. Thousands of creatures around him are his audience, but these forces, which should have been besieging his army, have no interest in his success or failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really hard to find it when it’s implemented. Lear's magical array is extremely tight, and it is very difficult to insert a spell fragment into it, let alone attach an external magical array. The most powerful aspect of the sky's statute is its self-detection. Once it finds a problem, it will be quickly smoothed out. This is the core of its trick to ensure that space does not leak. What Lear left was not the one-way scanning type of array, but the shock that came from all angles. Siegel must find a way to deceive all detection capabilities before it can succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New issues need to rethink the composition of the magic array, which will take quite a while. Siegel stopped the shock of time and space, left the slow-moving area, and sat on the cool belly of Bailong to think about new countermeasures. Once he has an idea, he will oscillate time and space to create a magical rune array, saving every minute and every second. Even so, he expects to spend at least half a day outside of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how much the battle between Chanem and Lear is going, it must be very exciting. If Chanem is smart enough, he won't use his barely qualified spells and concentrate on his assassin ability. But then again, maybe using the failure of casting to make a trap to attract Lear, maybe it can be a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t expect Chanem to drag Lerdo for a long time, after all, the murder god is still in a downturn most of the time compared to the magic god. Besides, the character of Chanem, only to see the last benefits will be really powerful, he will never sacrifice himself, died ahead of the finish line. Therefore, it is the limit to be able to fight for one day. If it is long, Siegel will worry that Lear and Chanem will fight each other through battle and then reach a certain cooperation agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that Lear can have enough confidence in his Warcraft, but not too much confidence, otherwise it will not leave the time to crack the magic circle." In the heart of Geer, I understand the current situation. "Whenever I get to the end, I still have to rely on myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery can continuously provide elemental energy, brain magic spar As fuel burns one by one. The Advanced Creations Array provides Siegel's abundant resources, and the magical beasts everywhere are a rich resource pool. The Tranquility Array has completely ruled this area, even if Siegel takes the obsidian dagger and cuts the chest of a monster and takes its heart out, it will not be resisted. It was with these help that after more than forty failures, Siegel finally succeeded in connecting his own deceitful law array to the space barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the normal time flow rate, Siegel recruited the lamp god to order it and open the room to the top floor. The lamp god swayed for a long time, saying that he could not find the entrance and exit, and could not do anything. At this time, Siegel launched his own squad, temporarily removing the barriers that were sealed at the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp god seems to be inductive, saying a little to Siegel, it disappeared out of thin air. Then, Siegel felt the hot temperature from the Lord of the Rings, and a voice repeated in his mind: "Found, find the target, find it, kill the target..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
