			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment before, he was still worried about not having enough elemental energy, and the last minute was another situation that turned upside down. The power of the element sweeps everything, and the phantom that stays outside expands three times in a moment, then bursts like a balloon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of the rainbow light ball is not good, and Siegel can even hear the screams of magic when the structure of the spell is supported to the limit. If this layer of protection is destroyed, he will become a state of paralysis in order to save his life, and try his best to lower his body, it is best to drill underground. Do not leave magical energy in your body. It is best to discard all magic items in order to have a theoretical life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is safer than the ground, it does not mean that it can be safe. Siegel felt the vibration of the constant explosion. The source of the explosion was the dark room of Master McGonagall. The magical instruments inside are now dangerous bombs, and the protective enchantment is the biggest one. They have no resistance in the face of the surge, and they all become the culprits of their masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Master McGonagall’s biggest trouble is not from these magical items. She can't cast spells, so her body is filled with a lot of magical energy, which is the most dangerous thing in the surge. Siegel pessimistically believes that Meg may be afraid of death without a whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainbow light ball began to crack, a horrible emotion spread up, just like waiting for the five horses to split the body. Then, only to hear a bang, the outermost purple disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a breath of air and was preparing for the most dangerous situation. It was at this time that the lucky god finally looked after the two, and the elemental surge finally passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything around has changed its appearance, and there is no fog that covers the sky. The long-lost sunshine has revisited the land and sprinkled the last touch of warmth before the arrival of winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking in the distance, there are so many trees that are about to die, their branches and leaves have long become yellow, and they are so weak that they are dying. But the sun brought them back, and the trees were recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye. Green climbed up and drove off the gray and yellow. Even if you don't get back to health immediately. But these plants have been able to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original thick fog contained a certain amount of magical power, and the gas element was reported when the wind wall was stirred. Elemental surges naturally do not let go of these magical energies, sweeping them all out. I just don't know how big the scope of this surge is, and I hope that it will not affect the Heim collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the line of sight is no longer blocked. And the home of Master McGonagall is on the hill, so Siegel can see the horizon in the distance. He could see a few miles west of the west, and a group of cavalry were walking hard, lining up from the ridge and moving slowly. That was the tracking team of Viscount Plan. They cheered after the fog had dissipated, and now they are getting ready to start riding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the north, Siegel saw the spectacle that he would never forget. A thick woods are dark in color, and the huge trees are taller than the towers of the castle, just like the giants standing upright. There is no gap between the thick branches and leaves, like a wall that is not airtight. Where do these numbers come from, and why are they growing so well? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky has changed very quickly, and there are strange blue-violet clouds on the trees, which are mixed with strange golden lightning. From there, there was a deep rumble. But I don't see a thunder, a drop of rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a deep breath, wiped his face and held Moore to stand up. The concentration of the surrounding elements is constantly recovering and will soon return to normal. It seems that the surge will not happen again, and they are temporarily safe. Where the energy is swept, there is no longer a feeling of dampness, and it seems that the climate that belongs to the wasteland has begun to return. Siegel looked far and wide, and until the horizon was far away, there was no trace of ghosts and swamps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? Fog? Marsh?" Moore looked at the dramatic changes around him and was at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not sure," Siegel replied, but the calmness in his tone still gave Moore a lot of peace of mind. “There has been a very dangerous elemental surge, perhaps it is this phenomenon that dispels the dense fog of the ghost fog swamp.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we can go back?" ?" Mohr asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t understand magic Moore at all, it is the inscrutable means of belonging to the lord. However, it seems that the surrounding area is much safer and the field of vision has expanded. At this time he found the cavalry of the Viscount Pran, and in order to prevent it, he put away the sword. The longbow was taken from the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, they can't get there." Siegel took out his wand and began to check the surrounding elements. At this time, the blue-violet clouds in the distance finally began to thunder, and the golden light slammed into the jungle formed by huge trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the cymbal came with the thunder of thunder, and then it was the second thunder, and then the frequency became faster and faster. After a while, the golden lightning was connected, and it was as dense as a raindrop. In such an environment, no one can be spared? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But beyond Siegel’s surprise, all the trees were safe and sound. He saw the continuous silver brilliance flashing from the leaves, like the sparkling light on the summer lake. He saw this wonder, and then he understood the origins of those trees: the whole forest is all rune trees of the elves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I see a lot of rune trees in such a south? Why do they grow in the misty swamp? The most critical question is, what are the golden thunderstorms doing, and why are they constantly turning to the trees? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder gradually weakened, the blue clouds quickly disappeared, and then the wind began. The octagonal strange moss that was originally hidden in the soil opened the leaves, and as the wings rose with the wind, forming a cloud of tens of miles, flew in the direction of the jungle. Rune trees begin to tremble, attracting all the moss around them like a whirlpool, and blending them together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the trees made a whisper, like a behemoth. Then in the eyes of Moore's big eyes, the rune trees stand up one by one, pulling out the roots from the soil as their feet, and the waving leaves are the arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are taller than the tower and they are powerful. This is a legion composed of trees, which is even more powerful than ordinary trees. The key is their quantity. In the eyes of Xigel alone, there are more than 2,000 tree giants that can be distinguished, and they will form a huge circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few black figures flew from a circle of trees and floated over the trees. Siegel used magic to strengthen his vision and saw that it was the wizard of the three elves. Wearing a magic robe decorated with stars and the moon. With the help of magic, Siegel also saw some elves wearing gray-green leather armor, standing on the shoulders of the giants of the trees, constantly stroking some mysterious gestures. distance is too far. Siegel couldn't see what spells they were casting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tree Giants squad brushed their bodies and then marched north to the north. The mightyness was like a wave, and its momentum was no worse than the elemental surge. What are these tree giants going to do, and what is the elf planning? The elemental surge that just happened is obviously not naturally formed. Definitely the handwriting of these elves. How do they gather such huge energy, what conspiracy is hidden behind the troubles? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elf flying in the air looks to Siegel in this direction, sharp eyes penetrate the distance of dozens of miles, still makes Siegel feel threatened. The elf took out his wand and began to cast spells. Siegel only knew that he was raising his hand and knew that it was a spell associated with the transmission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel immediately waved his wand, at this time, what level of element concentration! The elves are not good, and their big moves here do not want to let anyone know that the surge of elements is the best way to clear the field. Siegel relied on the rainbow light ball to survive, but the ring took time to slowly recover energy. He definitely has no ability to save his life in the hands of the wizard wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whirlpool of the transmission appeared in front of Siegel, opposite the Hell's Colle City. There is his elemental rune array, which is like the home of the Magic Tower, which provides some protection. Siegel pushed in Moore, who was still worried, and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this short moment, a lot of things happened. The darkroom was blown away by a burst of explosion, and the whole body was transparent, emitting green fluorescence, and the Mage Master, who was like the fire element version, flew up. Her body is entwined with many magic scrolls, like the mummy that wakes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chain that was originally tied to the wrist fluttered in the air, as if it had life. The power of the element entangles it, leaving a trail of flames or lightning. She yelled out in anger. But what appears in the throat is not like a human voice, but a primitive bark like a beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
