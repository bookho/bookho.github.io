			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers of the Jackdaw Tribe have reported the situation, but it is not the same as seeing it with their own eyes. After a few days of trekking, the Knights of Heim’s collar finally came to the famous northern city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they have a weird feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city has just experienced war and has been ransacked, which is supposed to be a kind of run-down, chaos and depression. There should be wreckage, smoke rising from the ruins, and people crying for the body. If you are miserable, there should be a group of crows and vultures in the sky, and fight for the carrion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw the craftsmen who were repairing the gates and rebuilding the residents of their homes. The guards patrolling at the gate of the city looked very young. When they saw the cavalry, they were horrified, but they also remembered to sound the alarm and inform his commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon there were more than 30 people wearing leather armor and holding spears gathered at the gate of the city, standing in front of 1,200 knights. It seems to be the leader, the more out of the crowd, said to Siegel and others: "Stand up! Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are behind the city gates No. There are only thirty flesh and blood between Siegel and Deepwater City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a city guard? Why are there no military uniforms?" Siegel took out a reel with a sash, blue and gold fine-striped sheepskin The paper reads the identity and title information of Siegel. "I am the baron of Deepwater City, pioneering the Knight Siegel. The squid. Are you in charge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Siegel Baron?" The suspicious result of the man Paper, looked at it with wide eyes, then said to the back: "Who do you guys? I don't understand many places!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three young people ran over Work hard to crack this reel. In the end, they unanimously determined that this is a volume of the seal certificate, and the Sham Shui Po Masked Lords Council awarded the title of Siegel. But as for the authenticity of this thing, they cannot judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately these people are not stupid, knowing that more than 30 people in front of them are meaningless in front of more than a thousand cavalry. Since the other side has not attacked now, it must be malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Sir Siegel, my name is Newman Charles, the captain of the City Watchman. Today is responsible for the security of the Northwest Gate. The city has just returned to the people. Is rebuilding, don't know what you are doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People?" Siegel asked: "How is the masked lord's parliament?"<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Returning to the Baron's adult, the masked lord's parliament lost its ability to rule. It has disbanded itself. The elders elected by the residents of various regions are currently negotiating to the new parliament. The form temporarily manages Deepwater City.” Newman is very proud, but he is very humble in front of Siegel. He said: “The new parliament is very capable and has cleared the passage of the sea. There have been merchant ships entering and leaving, and the order of the city is recovering. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, but he did not believe in this new parliament. Just a few days after Kerry left here, how could the new regime be able to have such high mobility immediately? Even the residents of Deepwater City hope that the desire for peace is extremely strong, rejecting all militants and chaotic behaviors. Can the new parliament not immediately bring merchant ships at sea? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this merchant ship originally parked not far from the harbour? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the city has a certain order, then I am more assured." Siegel said: "As a knight in Deepwater City, I came from the south, It is the obligation to guard the guard. But now it seems that the elf has been repelled, the city's encirclement has been lifted. And I heard that the prairie people have also left. Newman captain, do you say that my troops still need to enter the city?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you maintain peace and abide by the rules and policies of the new parliament, you are free to pass through the gate. In the original lower town, there is an open space near the Pigeon Square. You should be able to house your army. However, the price is high in the city. Please pay for it yourself and don't cause riots."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have our own supplies And it won't stay here for a long time.” Siegel said: “If you are willing to help, I would like to meet with members of the new parliament. I would like to discuss the issue of the title of the Deepwater Castle.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buildings near the wall were destroyed by the elf's trebuchet, and then burned to the ruins by a silver flame that was difficult to extinguish. Residents will clean up after this. Use wood, gravel and straw to build shelters to shelter from the rain. The people here looked at Siegel with a curious look, pointing at his cavalry, not afraid at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana caught a horse's belly and hurried to the side of Siegel, and lowered her voice and said: "The lord's atmosphere, the atmosphere of the city is really strange. Why are they not? Know the fear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Siegel replied: "I was wondering if there was a Knox association when I entered the city gate. Spiritual spells. But after checking many times, I still haven't found any suspicious magical fluctuations. Although Deepwater City does not show hostility, you convey my orders and still follow the highest warning. I will shorten the time spent at the Three Peaks Tower. Let's leave as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, pay attention to whether there are any unusual mental activities among the soldiers - just like the residents of Deepwater City. Whenever I am One-third of the people are guarded, one-third are awake, and the remaining one-third can rest. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mana nodded and began to arrange immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is getting worse inside the city, especially in the Upper Town. It was a place where wealthy businessmen, senior artisans and powerful people lived. They were not affected in the siege of the elves. They thought they could survive to the end, but they met Kerry. The warriors of the Jackdaw tribe ransacked here, completely destroying the original exquisite and clean environment. Fortunately, Kerry is only interested in gold and silver treasures, and has not issued orders for massacre or free looting, so the lives and personal safety of the residents here are innocent. But when Kerry left, it was the beginning of a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city squad who surrendered to the rebellion in front of the Jackdaw tribe eventually became a robber, committed a serious crime in the Upper Town, and then escaped from the city and became a robber. . Therefore, the upper city that Siegel saw was disorderly and disorderly, and people who had little hands-on ability looked at the ruins in a daze. The skinny cats, sheep, and dogs wandered around, trying to get what they wanted from their former owners, but they found nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at this group of people, and this group of people looked at Siegel with curiosity and joy. There must be something wrong with this, the Master thought, the whole city is like a girl who is over-excited, and everything is reversed. The people who should cry are optimistic and hopeful. The people who should be fearful and cringe are brave and strong, and the cities that should be depressed and chaotic are being rebuilt in an orderly and orderly manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing the cavalry. Residents here will also show signs of fear, but turning their heads will return to normal. Are their forgotten skills so powerful that they can immediately throw negative emotions behind them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to get an answer at the Three Peaks Tower, what did Knox and the Elf do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours later. One thousand two hundred people came to their destination. Instead of going to the Pigeon Square in the Lower Town, they came to the original Siegel’s home next to the Three Peaks Tower. Because Siegel moved to Heim's collar to build and live in the city of Mire, so here has been given to Mrs. Linda Dip and his son, the only requirement left is to open the door to Siegel forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house is locked and there is no one inside. There was no looting here. It’s a miracle that even the flowers and plants in the courtyard have not been destroyed. Only the back courtyard was searched and there was nothing left in the field. I still remember that there have been a lot of vegetables to supplement the home to cope with the rise in prices and the lack of food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how Mrs. Linda Dipp is doing, is it safe? His son Carl is an internship pastor of the Temple of the Moon, which is theoretically an elf. At the beginning of the war - Siegel had not yet traveled to the hub for a conspiracy - Deepwater City did not immediately attack, so the Moon Temple was safe during that time. Maybe the precious mother and son have left Deepwater City, maybe...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel doesn't dare to think, the more worried, the more fear. He set his own home in a small building. The soldiers who were under the squadron circled all the large open spaces around them, arranged to stand guard and whistle, and refrained from patrolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not far from here is the home of Lion King Alexander, who is familiar with it, after living for a long time, still being the Iron Golem I’ve been watching it. Unlike the quietness of the side, Alexander's mansion has been burnt into black ash, and only the ruins of the building are broken in the twisted and melted wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
