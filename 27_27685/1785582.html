You can Reaching out the food you like, you can exchange the knowledge of magic with confidence." Wendy's hands are on the stage, and her words resonate with everyone. "I remember my days in the red spires of the Hubburg, although there was a strong magical enchantment protection, but there was no sense of security. When the elves broke the outer wall and occupied the phalanx on the platform outside the tower, I thought that I must The commandments will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people are silent, and the Masters at that time did lose hope. The elves encircle the hub with a magical array, limiting the scope of the transmitted spell to ensure that no wizard can leave. At that time, there were many voices of surrender, some of the sorcerers who were co-founded by Knox vetoed, and others ended up because of the tough attitude of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the red-red minaret gate was opened, everyone was ready for a desperate attempt: one could escape one count. But it is not the attack magic, but a letter. There have been peace negotiations with the elves, one of which is to release all members of the Mage Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to thank anyone here today, because I can survive, everyone depends on myself. No one has cast spells to strengthen the red spires again and again, we wait No victory; no one can't give up in the crisis, we can't wait for victory; don't insist on sticking again and again, believe that there is a better tomorrow, we can't wait for victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After that, the Masters Association is late, I hope we can join them. Of course, we need to carry out the research of the Federation for many years. My memory may not be as good as the Shelley Master, but I am still clear. I remember the price code that the Masters Association gave me: two mentors as tutors, exclusive research funds of 300,000 gold coins, an independent laboratory, and a lamp god assistant. With these conditions, I have confidence in fifty. I became a new sergeant before I was old. But I refused, because the Masters Association wants me to write a spell of the Federation's mana pool. How much can be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words caused a whisper, this still has For the first time, people took this matter out of public and talked about it. After the Elven War, the Masters of the Federation were more or less tempted, and some even chose not to join the Masters Association. Knowledge and resources have also been exchanged to some extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters Association also prepared a big gift for Siegel, but Idis thought it was not enough to win the Siegel as the winner, and maybe He felt insulted and terminated the proposal after reporting to his teacher. Other transactions have not passed through Idis, but he knows more or less about it. Wendy’s speech is very good. It doesn't match her usual performance, so the half-elves are thinking about who is behind the scenes. Siegel? He first suspected that Heim was leading the lord, but he could not see the clue from Siegel's expression. This person can make Wendy obedient, but also has the power to touch people, only someone in the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis's gaze swept through every suspect, and he secretly guessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, none of the people present today went to the Masters Association, and everyone still lives as a member of the Federation. Why?" Wendy looked forward. Holding his body, he licked the fat Simonton with ice blue eyes. The latter kept talking to Wendy while he was talking. "Symonmont, why don't you go to the Masters Association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swallowed the meat rolls first, wiped thick lips with his hands, and then used thick The voice said: "The people of the association are bitter and persuaded to lose weight. If they are so wise, why not persuade before I get fat? They are too much, just like the chattering old woman. I won't go!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What price tag did the Masters Association give you?" Wendy asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Simonton raised his obese fingers and pointed at Wendy, and it ignited in an instant. However, all the sparks were concentrated within a few inches of the plasticist's fingers, and he did not recite the spell. So it is not counted as a threat and attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty looked at him without showing his weakness, and his eyes didn’t even blink for a moment. There was silence in the tent, and many people took out the gesture of protecting the spell, if the plastic master read the spell. They will block for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symonton waited for a while and suddenly laughed. He put down his fingers, grabbed a piece of fried cheese and threw it into his mouth, replied vaguely: "馄 煎 煎 。."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Xiaonizi, I didn't expect that my temper is now hard, I can speak so loudly!" Although the mouth contains food, the sound of Simonton is still clear. He likes to eat, but he has already practiced the chewing method that does not affect the curse. It is natural to have a clear speech. “The Masters Association promised to give me a chaotic diamond with four elements of energy. You can use two firestorms, ice storms, lightning strikes or acid rain every day. You know, because it contains very primitive basic elements. Strength, and in a natural delicate balance, so for our plastics, it is a good thing to promote understanding and enhance strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symonton Look around, lick the fingers of the fried cheese, then look at the people around you. "If any federation can get a chaotic diamond, I will support him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is talking about anyone in the federation, his eyes are Watching Siegel. His gaze led the eyes of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead fat man, at the time said that there is no such thing! Wendy squeezed her fist. Worried that he had helped Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have chaotic diamonds, but I can give you this." Siegel thought about it, set the defensive stick aside, put his hands on his chest, Just like holding something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? I don't need extra air, I'm already breathing enough," Saymonton said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I don't recite the spell, isn't it a spell?" Siegel asked: "I just mobilize the power of the element so it's okay?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone's curiosity was hooked up and wanted to know what Siegel had, so the tents sounded one after another. "No problem, come on!" "Scream like it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel communicates with the secret nuclear, commanding it to increase the output energy and send it to the hand through the energy focusing lens. He did not chanting spells, nor did he make a gesture of casting spells, but the elements that gathered in an instant were enough to release four fireballs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symonton just frowned. The way Siegel gathers energy is very interesting, but it is only an improvement in the application level. It doesn't involve any profound magical reason. What does he want to express? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire element arrival is only the first step. The other three elements are then followed. Between the two palms of Siegel, the four elements are isolated and rotated to form a beautiful ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time most people are involuntarily retreating, and some have used the spell of protective element damage for themselves. The elements of the scene are already very powerful. If the control is not good, it is likely to cause disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few people can understand that Siegel has mastered the balance between elements, and his ability to operate in macro and subtleties is enough to ensure the safety of the elements. Simonton nodded, his three-layered chin shook, and said sincerely: "Siegel. It is not easy for you to reach this level at a young age. It seems that you have found a trip to the sergeant. I congratulate you on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this can also It’s not enough to impress me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I know, so I will continue to work hard.” Siegel said to Master Sementon: “If I made a mistake and hope that you can control the energy of the escape, don't hurt everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what do you think of it?" Mengton said: "Let me see your volume!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel first closed his eyes and thought about the whole process, then pinched his hands . Directly crushed the barrier between the four elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements are mixed together, the opposite elements try to explode, while the similar elements are constantly trying to push the power. Instead of dissipating the elements in his hands, Siegel continued to compress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you crazy? Want to kill everyone?" Some wizards shouted, protecting themselves with layers of spells. Some people tried to leave with teleportation, but they were despised by other mages. Using teleportation in a place where elements are violent, I really feel that I am too slow to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
