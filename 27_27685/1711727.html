			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at noon, Siegel set off with Sir Bill and left the West Gate of Ximu Town. Here, together with the ten people of the “Golden Coin” caravan, they escorted three big cars to the hub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the caravans seem to be honest civilians, they have traces of long-term work, the shoulders and palms are full of calluses, and the coarse cloth is also The rope is worn and ragged. These people talk to each other but are unwilling to share the topic with Sir Bill. Whenever the jazz rides through, they will carefully bow their heads and hurry to work on hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the caravan accountant McCarter will talk to the jazz, accurately saying that he is actively coming to talk. This person is in his thirties and is an ambitious age. His words and expressions are all savvy, and he likes to talk and lick his lips, just like being thirsty. He never revealed much information, but he kept asking questions. As long as you open your mouth, it will lead to his endless words. Siegel felt very tired to listen to him, so he didn't have much interest in talking to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill is too lazy to care for him, always leaving with a variety of excuses. Sometimes he would pull out a light yellow silk handkerchief from the cuffs, gently wipe the dry eyes, pretend to see the wind and tears, so as to interrupt the accounting. This handcuffs always attracts the idea of ​​others. It is the trophy of the jazz. Ximu Town is a warm town. There are many battlefields that are not noticed, and there are no opponents who are worthy of being beaten. The Jazz put the spoils back into the sleeves and regained his body immediately. He and the entire New World needed to conquer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put something on the van and start training." After using the handcuffs to make the props, the jazz will pass the horse and say to him. "First run, then walk while swinging the sword." So that later, this handcuff became a sign that Siegel needed to start training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, in the mild and mild weather in May, the group set foot on the Cape Avenue. This is a long, smooth road that stretches from the hills and valleys to the west. On both sides of the road, you can see a piece of green farmland. A few sporadic farmers are leaning against the big tree to pray for good weather. When they see the caravans, they will come over and ask what is loaded on the carriage. The accountant will be very friendly and open the canvas for them to see: Hey, how good apple saplings and loam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jazz riding along the road, taking care of both ends of the caravan. When I first left the town, it was the most dangerous. Many of the farmers here were eyeliners of robbers and robbers. They didn't mind getting a piece of food from the stolen goods, or simply getting a few silver coins to sell the news. However, the goods of the “Golden Coin” caravan are not very attractive. Only the Hubburg needs to plant a large amount of fruit trees on the hills to improve the food shortage. The robbers do not have the skills of the fruit farmers and are not interested in planting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravans were very calm all the way, and the drivers were walking down their heads. Only when they stop to eat occasionally, they will hold a few happy foods. In order to get to the destination as soon as possible, they only stopped once a day - stop and take a break at dinner, and use the breakfast to get on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no lunch that makes Siegel very uncomfortable, especially since he has always maintained a large amount of exercise. As far as the caravans of the caravans are concerned, this is simply accepting cruel abuse. Siegel had to go back and forth for twenty miles in the morning, slashing two thousand, slashing five thousand, and then running twenty miles. This is only the amount of the morning. In the afternoon, he needs to jump on the ground, walk upside down, and then keep swinging the sword until it is dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, no lunch is absolutely intolerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of exercise is going on every day, and the benefits are also very obvious. Siegel's posture is more slender and his endurance has been greatly improved. His shoulders and leg muscles swelled and his back showed obvious lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, they were still traveling where they could see people, and soon the good road ended, and the caravan entered a more desolate area. There are many such areas in the New World, most of which are not fixed sources of water and are not suitable for settlement. They are simply referred to as wild areas. There are no residents here, not to see the hotel, the road conditions are also a lot worse, the cloak avenue is sometimes covered by weeds, only to see the traces faintly, need to be careful. The woods here are sinister, covered with eucalyptus leaves and twisted vines, making it difficult for pedestrians to pass. Many animals live in this undisturbed woods and often hear their sings of wild freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, when the road climbs to the top of the hill, Siegel can look at the entire wilderness. In the west and north of them, there are rolling hills, called "city wall mountains", which is the dividing line between civilization and wildness. There are cliffs, it is difficult to climb, and the mountain top is covered with a layer of snow all year round, hidden in the thick clouds. In the southwest direction is a dead water swamp, even if it is the hottest and clearest day of the year, it will be covered by a layer of black mist. Legend has it that there are evil ghosts in the swamp, turning the creature into a horrible dead spirit, trapped in the black mist and wandering endlessly, never being peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
