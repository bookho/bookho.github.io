			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wenty, when did you start to be interested in these magic books?" Knox’s mage embraced his arms and raised his chin with a proud look. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked up and looked at the bald mage, his eyes filled with cold eyes. This look has never apparently appeared on the face of Master Wendy. The Knox took out his wand and stood in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Wendy’s position in the Magic Tower is not high, this should have nothing to do with the level of magic – Siegel can feel the magical fluctuations in her body. The thick and tough force - all that soft personality makes everyone look down on her. In fact, as long as she is serious and shows a little claw or fangs, others will feel the obvious threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mage tower you built is full of Knox-style spells. If you don't read these red magic books, would you explain it to me?" Siegel rejected the thousands of miles with his cold voice, as if he didn't see the wand from the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knox’s two mages looked at each other and felt that Wendy’s performance was somewhat abnormal. But they are not stupid enough to use magic here, leaving with doubts in their hearts. Siegel deliberately did this in order to create suspicions between members of the federation and members of Knox. However, these seeds can only be germinated and flowered after they have dug the pits. So when Siegel waited for them to close the door, they took out their wand and portrayed the magical emblem in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original design of the Master Tower, this room was used to place the control hub. The red crystal magic tower collects the energy generated by the urban residents' daily thinking, and uses the array of mad laughter badges to store and transform. When the Knox Association wants to attack, it is necessary to control from the hub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Master Tower’s hub has the ability to control all protective spells throughout the building. Most of the time, the protective spells on the outer wall don't always run with maximum power, and the magical array of counterattacks is generally not activated. Only the spells of detection and protection never rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the elves launch an attack, they need to activate all the power of all the tactics through the hub. This is a very important place. After the Magic Tower accident, the hub was deliberately changed. Hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel uses the Array to enhance the detection of magic spells, combined with positioning and spell parsing. This is a technique commonly used by prophetic mage to quickly detect the fluctuations of surrounding magic and the traces they have left in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The library is mostly simple protection spells such as waterproof, fireproof, and comfortable and stable. These are not the goals of Siegel. He was thrown aside. There are also many spells in the Necromancers. For example, for a variety of locusts and small animals that are destructive to books, there are not a lot of dead spells here. In all these strange lines, Siegel is looking for control spells, especially the control spells of enchanted spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kung Fu pays off. He finally found a clue in the corner of one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical enchantment line drawn from the red magic tower changed direction under the floor of the top floor and came to the back of a bookcase along the corner. The protective spell enchantment is released on the bookcase. If you don't know the correct opening sequence, it will definitely cause an alarm and even directly suffer a spell attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other way to get around this entry. Cracking spells is too difficult and requires a high spell. Fortunately, I have seen the design drawings here, knowing how to bypass most of the spells, but there are some that are not on the design. Siegel does not know the source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely someone in this magic tower that knows more than one person. The security of the hub is important, but more importantly, the hub can work normally in an emergency. Siegel guessed that at least three of the Knox's official mages on the tower knew how to open the door of the control room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel estimates that the three people should be similar in their level of casting. If you don’t really fight, it’s hard to judge the strength. Everyone has their own strengths, and there must be hidden cards. And in this red magic tower, Knox will be the home, their mage can call the power is definitely higher than Siegel. Besides, even Siegel defeated one of the wizards. What kind of method can I use to find the information I need from his memory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel only took the idea to the other people in the Master Tower. According to his observations, Wendy, who is patrolling the Mage Tower every day, is the most likely candidate for the Department of Defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not a last resort. I really don't want to take advantage of it - he knows very well that his behavior is a real "utilization" - the female wizard named Wendy. First of all, she was not Knox, she did not do anything wrong, and she could not punish her. This elf war has nothing to do with her, even if she is fighting with Knox, she is a potential ally rather than an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is just an ordinary person who happens to know the key information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter is timid and self-isolated in the impressions of other mages. Always confused and distracted. However, she is very good at protecting spells, and ordinary spells can reinvigorate in her hands, raising a level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also puts higher demands on Siegel’s plan: simply using linguistic communication, Siegel is almost impossible to establish with her in a short time. The relationship of mutual trust can only be achieved by means of spells. As a protective mage, Wendy carries a variety of defensive spells, and only the Knox Commonwealth "euthanasia" statute can play a role in her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel does not know the name of this squad, but it can’t be called "mad laugh". The mage thought of eating a few of his colleagues in the red-red minaret and felt that the words "euthanasia" were the most appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By reading Knox's books and deductive spells, Siegel knows the design philosophy of this squad: its ultimate goal is control. Once it is affected by “euthanasia”, the way of thinking of the target of the spell will be subtly changed, and it will be difficult to get rid of its spell effect in the whole life. It is only because of the difference in the willpower of each person and the length of time controlled by the spell, the degree of change in behavior patterns is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is still hesitating. He used the spelling skills of the Knox Association and borrowed the power of some magic towers to establish friendship with Wendy. The next job is to control her thoughts subtly and make her a helper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long can I leave for myself, will there be no more than a week? The work of cracking the entrance to the control room was almost stagnant, and it was time to use the alternatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he knocked on the door of Wendy’s lounge, the door opened itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save space, each mage’s room is very simple, with simple furniture such as beds, tables, chairs and cabinets. Some magic towers have a space array of space effects. You can make a small room bigger. However, Knox has built several magic towers at the same time, and obviously has no spare capacity to invest in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy’s room was to accommodate two people, it was a bit cramped, not because of the size of the room, but by Wendy’s dress. It is completely different from her usual serious and conservative dress. Wendy is now wearing light, elegant clothes that highlight the beautiful body curves. Her original appearance is very good, and today she also deliberately made a light makeup, brought the earring necklace and bracelet, and made a careful dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...Hello. Mr. Soth." Wendy smiled and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel closed his eyes and breathed a sigh of relief, forcing himself to sigh. The Red Magic Tower sensed his mind and responded to his curse call. Some magical fluctuations affecting thinking are passed on and filled in Wendy's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Warmy Master, meet again," Siegel's voice was very soft, like the finest velvet. "I ended my work and came to see what kind of needs you have. Beautiful lady, please let me know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter in the spell I feel a little confused under the influence. I don't know what I need to do with the opposite man. She feels very happy now. In fact, she only wants to quietly taste this feeling now. Nothing else matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel sees the expression of the female mage, knowing that the power of the squad is a bit too strong, especially for those who have been affected by spells. He gently bounces the fingers under the long sleeves, weakening the influence of the array. If Wendy is completely tempted, she doesn't want to do anything, and she doesn't provide the spell of the entrance to the control room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
