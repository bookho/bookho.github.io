			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the siege of the element, at least know the several attack methods of the Golem. Everyone wants to try to deal with remote shooting, what kind of response they can make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, let me take a break." Siegel said: "Too much elemental energy passes through my body. Now every nerve is in my body." It hurts, my arms are shaking. Can you give me time to recover?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have three long bows and two cymbals, you don't have to shoot Kerry said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is other means for the golem, you will need my spells to deal with it." Siegel said to the giant: "My most important task is not Attack, but make sure everyone has a retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to Siegel." Lia said: "We are not in a hurry." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage sits on the ground to rest, adjust his breathing, and relax his spirit. Although generations of magicians continue to improve spells, the human body is not completely magical, and unlike the dragons, it can carry magical energy without stagnation. If you continue to use magic like Siegel, the residual spell power will accumulate in him, not only affecting the release of magic, but also making him feel extremely tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a physical problem that can be solved by exercising. It can only rely on accumulation of time to cultivate adaptability. The good news is that Siegel's physical resilience is far superior to that of ordinary people, not only in the recovery of wounds, but also in the recovery of "magic fatigue". After a while he smoothed his breath, suppressed the shaking of his fingers, and the tingling in his skull gradually disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rested for a while until he stood up without any strange feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have been waiting for a long time, and finally you can move your hands and feet. Unfortunately, there is not much space on the platform, only the most edge position has the best shooting angle, so it can only take turns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow cut through the air, tied to the body of the magic, and the magic figure immediately stood up, they looked around, and it took a long time to find out The enemy of the attack. The gas element Golem is the first to fail, it stands on the edge of the platform. The palms stretched forward, and a whirlwind wall blocked the route of the archery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the elf's bow and arrow, other ordinary bows and arrows can't penetrate the wind wall to fight the enemy. "If there is a trebuchet or a gun," the dwarf said very annoyed. "If you play this way, I am afraid that there will be no win in 100 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The counterattack of the Golem is not over. The Earth Elemental Golem stands behind the air elemental demon and picks up a piece of dirt from the ground. In the hands of the force smashed. Everyone thought that he was going to throw a stone ball. He didn't expect it to be loose with both hands. He left the soil on the ground, leaving only a green light floating in the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a strong acid arrow," Siegel said. "Don't be touched by them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The Master immediately responded, the wand swept through the air, and a transparent wall made up of force fields blocked them and the Golem. The strong acid arrow of the Golem was turned into a five-six meteor, and the people on the platform flew in. The wall formed by the force field caught all the attacks. Strong acid flowed down the air. Drop on the mountain and burn the stone out of a small hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know how the Knox people eliminated the other two. It's too tricky!" The dwarf scratched his scalp. It seems that there is no other way than to confront them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others nodded and knew that a war was inevitable. Before the Earth Element Golem was ready to launch another attack, Siegel took everyone down the mountain road and climbed down. Seeing that the enemy had left the line of sight, the Golem returned to its original position and began to slowly repair the damage suffered by the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone spent a long time, the most listening to Siegel's suggestion to set up two battlefields. One is above the platform. The martial arts high-powered giant and the dwarf shot together, so that the golem is busy with melee, and has no time to take care of the elements of the mountain. This work does not need to be done in one go, and it can be tried constantly while ensuring safety. If you can find the weaknesses of these golems, and destroy them, it is the most ideal situation, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the scene is deadlocked, then rely on the strength of the construction team, Cut the entire platform. Let the goth fall. I hope that these hundreds of meters of drop can cause enough damage to them. A second position will be set up at the foot of the mountain: the dwarf dug the pit, calculated the good ruler, and transported a small trebuchet and rifle from the Mola to build a siege platform. As long as you leave the narrow terrain halfway up the mountain, at the foot of the relatively open foot, the dwarf can put more troops into the fight,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would those gossips not beat, but the giant Kerry asked, "With their bodies, it is difficult to stop if they want to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"According to common sense, this will not happen. The goal of the Golem is to guard the hole. This is basically certain, so they will definitely try to return to the hole and continue to perform this duty. The Golem will not feel Fear, nature will not escape,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel finally said: "If you have no problem, let's start working!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield has thus become a construction site, and everyone is busy. After a series of constructions, Siegel's engineering knowledge is also accumulating. His rune guards play a much more role in engineering excavation than in combat, and how to control these elements to improve work efficiency. Siegel’s experience is also growing. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of earth and stone were transported out, and the dwarf dug a pit while raising the surrounding ground to set up a platform for artillery and trebuchet. In the name of training, the gem clan sent a large number of personnel to Longshi Cliff, and there were hundreds of elite warriors. They used carts to pull large and small boxes, removed parts from them, and assembled several guns in a very short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Kerry is very interested in these things, wandering around these engineering equipment all day, asking Dong to ask West. The dwarf saw that his character was straightforward and he did not treat him as an outsider. He went with him to see him. After a few days, Kerry learned some plausible slinging principles and excitedly came to Siegel and said to him, "I am more confident that I will break through the walls of Deepwater City."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have always been obsessed with looting the city!" Siegel laughed and laughed, but thought of the threat of the Knox Association, the Three Peaks Tower was still behind the deep water city walls, so he decided not to intervene. Something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golem squats on the platform and looks at the busy people below, they feel a certain threat. But with their intelligence, I don't understand what will happen. And subject to the pre-set instructions, the Golem can not leave the platform to raided the camp, only passively waiting for things to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been ten days, everyone is ready. On the day of the victory, everyone was very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trebuchet and the rifle were all ready, with as many as twenty, and more than enough to attack a strong castle. There are 4 to 5 people working next to each machine, and the ammunition is also very well prepared. Just look at whether the attack squad can attract the attention of the enemy; the construction team of the mining platform. Is there enough speed to get the job done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The platform attack squad consists of 6 people. The giant Kerry is not allowed to stand in the first place. This is the pride and persistence of the chieftain. No one can block it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel solved his sword and handed it to him. "The ice gun is strong, but not necessarily on the narrow terrain of the platform. Execution, you take my sword as a spare weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Master then sent a runestone to each of them, which gathered the dwarf's rune technique and Master's spell. Feathering help can be provided to those who fall. It should have been prepared for everyone to drop the potion, but the level of Siegel's syrup is not good, and the bottle is easily broken in the fierce battle. The dwarf runes are not so delicate, but there are no feathers in the rune language. Siegel combines the characteristics of runes and wizard spells to create this temporary runestone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is here, the priests of the dwarves have blessed them for fighting, and the crowds have soared, and soon they climbed to the platform where fossils were made for mud. Since the Golem can only be passively defended, the time of the war is counted by Siegel. So everyone still has time to finally check their equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the Master, this is already preparing for the ultimate battle, I really can't think of any reason for failure!" Dwarf confident, giant Fighting high spirits. Siegel also summoned the earth element rune guards and selected the construction angle of the excavation platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War, Warriors!" Siegel ordered: "Assault!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The giant screamed and jumped onto the platform by running. In order to avoid leaving a smooth ice on the ladder and causing trouble to the person behind him, he began to apply the ice armor after the charge, and the cold and cold power of the long gun was also stimulated. The golem jerked up and stood up. Waving his fist toward the Kerry. It doesn't worry about its own damage at all, just wants to kill the enemy at the fastest speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hole was healed at a speed visible to the naked eye, and Kerry rushed to pull back the rifle. Unexpectedly, the Golem took a step forward and suddenly approached, and the other fist swayed and slammed into the giant's arm. Kerry is determined not to let go of the gun. This is the tribe and symbol of his tribe. Then the giants took full advantage of the power, fully exerted the power of the ice, and prepared to fight against the magical fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dwarf rushed up and stood by Kerry. He inserted the shield in his hand to the ground and dialed the organ. Only heard two screams, the shield smashed into the soil and turned into a protective wall on the side. The fist of the golem slammed into the shield wall, and the dwarf body shook, accompanied by "hip-hop!" and slammed the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third soldier climbed up, holding a steel hammer larger than his head. After he saw the situation, he rotated in place and called to throw the hammer in his hand. The hammer was accompanied by a squeaking lightning in the flight, like a flat thunder, slamming on another golem. The momentum of its running was stagnant, and some of the fragments hit by the hammer on the chest were flying around, and it fell to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth person climbed up was the Dwarf Rock Pastor. He held up the rune jewel and prayed for help to the patron saint. The "Resolute" runes sparkle and cast power on everyone. Everyone can recover the energy they are consuming and maintain their ability to continue as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth soldier climbed up, holding the hammer in one hand and the hammer in the other. The platform is almost full, so he launches an attack in the back row. The long chain smashed out and wrapped around the arm of the golem. The dwarf lifted the hammer and the steel bar and fixed the other end of the chain to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golem found himself bound, slammed backwards and pulled out the chain. The dwarf defender, on one side, used his body to block the chain from the Kerry. The giant stood firm and pulled out the ice gun before the magic fist fist healed. He screamed and stepped forward three steps to attack the lower body of the Golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last soldier is the red-bearded Occam, whose weapons are different from others. He used his hands to hold a bronze cylinder with complex lines drawn in platinum and silver. The dwarf stuffed a "cured" runestone from the front end into the cylinder and then raised it to aim at the golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only heard a loud bang, the cylinder shot the runestone. Curing runes are often used to reinforce the foundation of a building, which can withstand tremendous stress and remain firm. Elemental Golem feels threatened and raises his hand to block it. When Runestone hits the body of the Golem, it immediately provokes a huge impact. The little runestone became like a huge stone ball, and it destroyed the palm of the Golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dry beautiful!" The giant Kerry cheered and the attack on his hands did not stop. There have been several holes in the knee of the Golem, and it has been forced to retreat continuously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of the battle is almost at your fingertips, but the Golem is not so good. The elemental demon that was knocked down by the hammer stood up and pulled out the hammer embedded in the chest and left the mountain. The throwing hand dwarf straightened his arm and opened his palm. The hammer that was falling received the command and turned his head and flew to his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regained the ability to move, the two ghosts came together, and the magic figure behind it suddenly straightened his hands and inserted straight into the shoulder of the previous Golem. position. They are connected in this way and start to mobilize the energy of the surrounding elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to me!" The dwarf defender screamed and pulled the shield from the ground and stood in front of him. He took a bottle of grease from his pocket and broke it over the shield. I saw a shadow of a mountain shaped like a Mora, rising from the shield and blocking it in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Kerry knew that this was not the time for indiscriminate action, so he stood behind the dwarf defenders. However, his tall body could not be covered, so he simply made a second shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is commanding the earth element rune guards to madly dig the platform, suddenly feeling the strength of the surrounding earth elements and gas elements gathered at a very fast speed. He saw the two golems connected together, his heart was not good, and he immediately took out the scroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water element has the least fluctuation in this environment and can form a stable structure. So Siegel set up an ice wall between the Golem and the combat squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice crystal is climbing and thickening, but it has not yet fully formed, and the attack of the elemental golem has come. (To be continued.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
