			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Fazak opened his eyes again, he saw Siegel sitting opposite him. The young man is looking at him with curiosity, just like a devotee is looking at the beauty, making people goose bumps. He tried to move his body, but he found that his body was not working and he could not feel his fingers and toes. A thick, long rope tied Fazak to a strong one, but he was still smeared with a rag on his mouth, and he could still speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't yell." Siegel said: "I don't think you are stupid enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I planted it in your hands." Fitzak nodded, then looked at the captive's eyes and said, "What do you want, let's talk. But please tell me, can I still live?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe." Siegel said: "It depends on whether you cooperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one-eyed old man nodded again. He saw the familiar furnishings around him and knew he was lying in the warehouse of the grocery store. It is full of various goods, and the walls are thicker than others in order to prevent rain and snow. This is a good place to interrogate and destroy, because you can find pliers, sickles and hammers next to you, and you are not afraid of being heard and shouting. There are also a lot of boxes and sacks here, and it is easy to put the body in. I am old and not a few flesh, and even filled a pocket, Fitzkary thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me who you are." Siegel asked: "To tell the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am Fitzak-Orest, I have always been very honest." The old man smiled and said: "I am from Deepwater City. I was captured in the Battle of the River and became a slave. Are you satisfied with this answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "You lie. Why are you not poisoned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I I have been trained in poison tolerance, it is a painful memory, the old man thought. A variety of poisons, such as vomiting, diarrhea, fever, nonsense, and a life-threatening, but never heard of people below the neck. "The gods bless you, I want to live this old and die for a while. How do I get poisoned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should not turn my things, try Take my identity certificate." Siegel said: "You should also change the habit of biting things with your teeth,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old, can't change Fazak shook his head. "Can I still have a chance to change it? If I let me choose again, I will avoid Macabu, and it might be a good idea to go to the Southern Alliance. The rich farmland, and the woman with big buttocks. It’s too late to say anything. In the orc’s grocery store, like a stupid broken doll, you can’t even scratch your nose.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to know, I didn't want to kill you." Siegel took out the dragon's tooth dagger and took it in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't want to ask other people's thoughts, too many lies and cover." Fitzk said: "You have a good dagger, know where to tie it." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel used Fez's neck, heart and navel, and said, "What advice do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heart, clean, and happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shouldn't die here." Said: "In such a city that smells bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where can I? I want to find a comfortable place, but I think about it. It was burned in the Battle of the River.” Fazak sighed: “What are you waiting for? The money is under the cupboard, but I will run when I take it, they will come.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are they?" Siegel poked the floor with a dagger, and easily made a small hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to know the information, ok, just ask me to use the excellent dagger to give me a good time." Fitzk said: "Now, the more you ask The more difficult it is, the strict tone of the slave masters, the generals’ management is not willing to talk more, the mouths are like the virgin legs, they must use more gold to separate, know why?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When is the person from Deepwater City coming?” Siegel asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak did not change color, the muscles of the face did not twitch, but avoided the line of sight, no longer looking directly at Siegel's eyes. "The army of Deepwater City can't come to the walled mountains. You can't see them in this life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel squats down and refers to Fitzak's belly. Said: "It is a miracle that you can live until now, but this toxin is still there. If you go on like this, you will die very long and very painful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know The old man said, "Give me a knife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not sure, I have an antidote." Siegel shook his head and pulled out a small one. The salt shaker shook and decided to continue to ask: "You haven't said anything I want to know. Who is the faceless, what is he doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Who?” the old man asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you say it, you can live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bad boy, you ask me Can answer the questions!" Fitzk's mouth is still very strict, nothing leaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you are a spy in Deepwater, and I know what the no-facers are going to do." Siegel grinned at the corner: "I am just I want to know how you connect. You see, even if you don't tell me, they can't connect, and naturally they can't get the job done, but my bounty is not one less? After you have already exposed, what are you still insisting on? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are in Hu. What?" Fazak squeezed a smile: "Damn, the stomach started to hurt." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. "Yes, then the pain will spread to your body, but you still can't move, you can only bear it silently. Until 8 After an hour, you will die.” Siegel shook the bottle and said, “After a while, even if it is an antidote, it will not cure you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, then I still have 8 hours, and it’s better to have pain than to be with a silly and crazy paranoia." Fitzak breathed with his nose. With a squeaky voice, it seems that the pain is hard to bear. However, he did not ask for mercy, and he was ready to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After a while you will cry, I can't take that risk." Siegel suddenly raised his hand and the dagger disappeared into the Fazak ribs. between. The red blood ran down Siegel's wrist and fell on the old man's trousers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the last words." Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gods have mercy, let him run away." Fazak finally prayed, hoping that no one should not appear in the grocery store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel slammed him in Frocke’s forehead, then stunned him, then pulled his teeth and fed the antidote in the bottle. Go on. After that, he tied Fazak's mouth with a cloth strip to prevent him from making any noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a hard old man who is dying and does not want to sell any intelligence. Siegel admire him. It was only because of mercy that the Raven Ravens attacked at first, but it was because of this pity that he discovered the true identity of the grocery store owner. Through the eyes of the raven, he saw the letter sent by the messenger, including the paper stripped by Fazak, without falling. At this time, Siegel knew that Fitzak was a deepwater city spy, and he would not even kill. However, it was an earlier matter to poison the bag. Siegel could not stop even if he saw it. Fortunately, he used the blood magician's paralyzing toxin, which is the bloody paralyzed tentacle's casting material. The average person who eats directly does not immediately detoxify and will die soon. But since Fitzak actually survived the most dangerous period, it took so long to start feeling abdominal pain, and Siegel’s antidote just happened to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the blood magician’s notes, skin contact with toxins only takes a few hours to relieve paralysis, but in the case of toxins, in addition to taking antidote Bloodletting is also essential, so it takes at least three days to recover. Siegel guessed that the faceless person might be the bloody knight Count Maxim, or at least related to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing a bag full of toxic powder into the stove, Siegel closed the door to the grocery store. He found ink, sulphur powder, glutinous rice gelatin, a group of cobwebs, candles, sponge pieces and a few eggs, and began to dispense the pharmacy according to the knowledge gained in the alchemy course. Alchemy can make a big difference when you don't dare to use magic. He wants to mix a dye that is not afraid of water to make a tattoo on his body. Blood magic has a method of making blood gels, which are commonly used for hemostasis, but they are also used as plastic materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
