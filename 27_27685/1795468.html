Let sniff under the nose, then put it back again - turned over. His movements are cautious, just like holding a treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are your mission completed?" Siegel asked. "Is this time asking me to repay you to help me kill the red dragon?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Dragon did not answer this question. He first looked at Siegel up and down and then nodded. "I am not as free as you are. You don't have any shackles or chains on your body. You can be the master of your own destiny. I have a master who needs to serve his will and goals."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bounded Dragon Curse?" Siegel uses the spirit of the eye to distinguish anything that can't be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't look, it has been broken." Green Dragon smiled softly. "Official introduction, my name is Alenoz Iggs, of course, this is also a short name, the full name is too long, sometimes I will forget. The owner of my service is like you, is a nephew holder. I guess you are holding the twenty-one, because I have encountered twelve faces before, and one hundred is Evan of the starry kingdom. If I am correct, please listen to it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel began to guard when he mentioned the twenty scorpions, the power of the elements gathered in his body, and his cursing spells were huge. The dragon is also unbearable. Jinlong first had the induction, glanced at the side, and then followed the dwarf king into the interior of the stone boat. William paused the chewing movement and looked at it from afar. The green dragon still has a harmless smile on his face and said to Siegel: "Your secret is also the secret of my master. It is safe for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The mage thought for a while, then put away the magic: "You say, it is best not to use riddles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK." Very unexpected, green dragon It is easy to agree to this request. "I can't mention the owner's name, because it will be detected by prophetic spells, I hope you can understand. He has ten scorpions, one of the four remaining nephews in the world. You should Thank him. It’s his efforts that keep you in an uncontrolled life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t understand, explain it.” Siegel raised his hand. , ready to cast spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry about protective spells, the wind around them will blow away our words. Magic will only help our enemies." Green Dragon stopped him Then he took a sigh of relief and said, "Where do you start? Let me think about it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Start from the wall of the storm Everything is related to it." The green dragon coughed twice, seemingly clearing his throat. There is always a murky voice in his throat. "I don't know if you understand. The so-called storm wall is a precursor to the demise of the crystal wall. The world is very small, only one planet, a conceptual star, even smaller than some half-planes. Such a small crystal wall life Usually very short, they will eventually be swallowed up by the rule of destruction inward. The rules that are born in its life will re-integrate and create a new crystal wall in the form of an explosion. If there are more rules, then this Once the crystal wall will be stronger and more stable than the previous one, this is the process of world evolution, although cruel. But it can guarantee the end of the material world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If you run into destruction, you can only blame for your bad luck. Because the power of destruction is the sum of a world rule, people in this world cannot escape. Even if they discover new rules of the world, they will be destroyed immediately." The power of learning: the individual can not defeat the whole of this individual, a simple truth. Many exist to try to block this process, want to understand the secret of the birth and destruction of the world, The ultimate power of the cosmic cycle grows. Even if it is a god, as long as it is involved in the storm of destruction, the rules and forces he represents will be copied and studied, without exception, all buried together."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that only one kind of god can influence this process. That is the creation god of the world. They are very powerful, only need one thought, one hand can create a world. They will take advantage of the new crystal When the wall is born, project your own thoughts. Add rules to the rules to shape the results you want. Until one day, a creation god accidentally dies - he is killed by himself, absolutely no one can think of it. Accident. Before he died, he turned his power into something and threw it into the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have already thought of it. Those items are blind. There are seven species, corresponding to seven traits. This is a crystal wall that has been surrounded by a devastating storm. The power of the gods has long been cut off. Anything in this, even the soul that should belong to the gods. It is impossible to leave. The power of the God of Creation is the opposite of destruction. One of the scorpions, the ten-faced scorpion of my master, is the first to awaken. His strength is balance and prevention, and he blocks the advancement of the wall of the storm. Let the world survive the rest of the continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wall of destruction is not that simple. It is not a fire wall or a lightning storm. It is a rule. When it devours a continent, all the rules related to this continent are absorbed, and there will be no information left. So no one will remember. This is a fine detail, let me continue." Green Dragon licked his chest, then twisted his shoulder, his body muscles and bones rang. "The blocked destruction storm caused everyone's attention, or all the gods. In this process, the first one to be found was my master. Fortunately his role is to prevent the advancement of the storm wall if he is Interference, the world will still be destroyed, then the secrets of the remaining scorpions will always be covered up. So all the gods have reached an agreement that does not interfere with the operation of the world, does not affect the actions of the scorpion holders, if they learn the birth of the world And the secret of destruction, share it with everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Dragon looked up and looked into the distance. It is a pity that the stone boat is in the middle of the two continents, the farthest from the wall of the storm. Here is the wonder that the spectacular lightning destroys everything, and the majestic grandeur of the power of the world to destroy the power of a thin rule. Few hundreds of millions of people in the world can feel the crisis. They don’t know their luck and they don’t know their own misfortunes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, not all contractors can truly obey, some people have moved their minds. The god of magic and knowledge has the strongest desire to acquire secrets. Strong enough that he can give up the power of the godhead and the priesthood. He burns all the power, forcibly modifies the reality. Then he becomes a mortal and begins to touch the power of the scorpion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He has changed what he has learned, and the information is absorbed like a storm of destruction. It no longer exists. He found the biggest scorpion. It is a hundred scorpions, and at that time it has no will. So the kingdom of stars and the school city are closely connected, and the power of the scorpion is used to strengthen the national movement, which is one of his experiments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Completed his plan The first step, then he began to try to find other scorpions. There is only one way to break this deadlock. And my master made this choice. The power of the magic god is limited, barely can only cover a certain area, also Is a big piece As long as the scope of the storm wall becomes larger, then his power will be loopholes, just like a balloon that has been broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original storm wall Backward, the New World was discovered, is this the reason? Siegel thought of the "refuge" under the tear lake of God, and asked: "The world that was absorbed, the countless people who were destroyed, was to break through the cover of knowledge and the power of the magic god? The four sides, six sides and Eight-faced scorpion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Dragon looked at Siegel with amazement. Suddenly laughed. "Possibility, it is an infinite possibility!" he said excitedly, suddenly stopped, and his mouth overflowed with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay? Need a healing potion?" Siegel said quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Dragon swings his hand and wipes his mouth with his hand: "I am a pharmacist much better than you, forgot? I almost took you The medicine is boiled. I know that my wound has no effect on the healing potion, so don't worry about it. I remember when I first met, I was configuring the potion. At that time I smelled the smell of the donkey, but then the smell Suddenly disappeared, I am not sure. But in the end I decided to gamble and help you deal with the red dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Siegel is sincere Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the awakening of the four sides and the octagonal scorpion, I helped my master complete the plan of the expansion of the storm wall, but was killed by the existence of another world. Even The six-faced scorpion did not have time to wake up. It was destroyed. The enemy gradually approached, and even found the depressing power from the four sides of the scorpion, and made a terrible weapon. So the master had to start the plan ahead of time, and it was too late to wait until everything became perfect. Therefore, when the New World finally came into being, it left a lot of shadows of the old world, that is, the shadows of the dead. Fortunately, they can only survive near the storm wall in the northern part of the New World. Only there is their last refuge. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The plan worked, and the loopholes in the magical mantra appeared. Then Nexus and Knox came, the magic god's spell No longer a secret, the new mind control spells are learned by Knox. A large number of creatures are heading for the New World, and more and more fates are getting rid of the surveillance. The scorpion finally has a safe place to store. The owner avoids the gods. of The line, the last two scorpions were thrown over. The twentieth had its own consciousness, and fell to the deepest part of the sea in the middle. The twelve-faced scorpion successfully reached the New World. Many years later, you are the one that fell to the sea. The scorpion in the middle. You are not a person, Siegel, you are you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
