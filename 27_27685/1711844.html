			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to participate in your plan anymore, I can't continue to go wrong." Mana replied: "You let me kiss Little Maxim, from scratch Feet, I did it. You asked me to change his antifreeze ointment, and I did it. When he had to return to the south with frostbite, you told me that he could save his life, and I also believed in silly. Like him, but I am inferior, can only become his mistress at most. But he will not be in love with a woman who is also killed with the companion - I will not do what you said."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, she bowed and arched, and the feather arrow shot accurately to the gnome. An invisible barrier blocks the feather arrow and bounces it off. The gnome laughed and continued to move slowly, constantly threatening and stressing the two. He said: "Do you not kill? You have not always hoped that the old count will return to heaven as soon as possible. He also said that this is because he would not agree with you and his son anyway?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I didn't want to kill, I thought you were sympathizing with me, I was helping me." Mana's tears rushed, and she shot at one arrow and one at a glance, but all were in vain. Fitzak raised his hand and took a hand of Mana, and cheered her up. He said, "Run, silly woman, run faster. My feet are not enough, I can't walk. But you are shorter than this." The dwarf scorpion is much faster. Run it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one needs to run, because no one can run." The gnome said. His daggers shimmer, and the elements of fire gather above them, forming a dangerous vortex. Geerbao proudly looked at his own spells, and imagined in his mind that two people were burnt into a coke by the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he saw a figure coming out from Fyzak, a young human being, should be less than twenty years old, with a strange black Hair and black eyes. He also dragged a ridiculous cloak, not knowing what the long cloth would do in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right, no one needs to run." Siegel said: "Just make this stupid dwarf flatter, what do you still run? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarves hate people saying they are tall, but like to be exaggerated "rough"; gnomes like to be praised and smarter, but hate others saying they are short. Siegel has dealt with many gnomes, and with one or two of them is a good friend, naturally know the characteristics of this race. As soon as he opened his mouth, he angered the gnome, who immediately spurred the spell, converting the vortex of the fire element on the dagger into a burning ray and shooting at Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will also have this spell, and it will be faster and stronger than the gnome. The hot rays of the two sides collide in the air and then annihilate each other. A warm wind blew, this is the last trace of the two spells left in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome's nails clasped the long handle of the dagger, and he raised the first level in the other hand and read a spell. A few red-skinned, thin humanoid monsters dragged their tails out of the dirt, and they stretched their knees backwards, with long, thin limbs and ending with sharp claws. These inferior devils from hell are very primitive summoners of the caster, simple to control and easy to form a quantitative advantage. This kind of monster looks terrible, but their fighting ability is not much different from the newly recruited training. Inferior demons will rush toward the creatures they encounter, and try to tear the other side with their claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled a little and was not worried at all, because his allies were still lurking in the sea. With his orders, the giant squid suddenly rushed out from the water next to the bank, sweeping through the crowd with the thick tentacles. It's just that this huge weight is enough to crush the tiny devil into pieces, not to mention the squid's ability to coil and tear. Just a face-to-face, the big and the bad devils were knocked into fly ash, and returned to the hell plane. But the squid also painfully twisted the tentacle - Siegel made it stronger and at the same time caused the weakness of the defense. The counter-attack of the inferior demon was quick and intense, and three long tentacles had been cut. Siegel only looked at it and no longer cares, because in his calculations, the two sides will form a momentum against the child, although the inferior devil is dead, but the squid will lose the ability to continue fighting, only to dispel one way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana, who was reinforced, regained her confidence, and the burning pain on her face did not affect her focus on archery. Although she knows that she may not be able to achieve any results, she believes she can at least distract her. The bowstring is light and the feathers are flying, but this time it does not hit an invisible barrier, but directly through the gnome's body. In the astounding gaze of the shooter, the "Gnomish Geerbao" swayed and disappeared like a mirage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every gnome is an illusionist - someone has said this - their greatest ability is to make you not see that they are using illusion. Siegel immediately turned on the psionic vision, only to think that all the eyes were white, and there was a reaction of magical light everywhere. The gnome covers the real thing with a illusion, on the one hand to hide his actual position, and on the other hand to interfere with the opponent's magic detection. It's like the best way to hide a pinch of salt is to throw it in a pile of salt, and no one can tell if it is kept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
