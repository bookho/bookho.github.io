			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is internal consumption? That is, everyone has no need to invest a considerable amount of resources to maintain mutual deterrence. Just like creating twenty different weapons, I also prepared light, medium and heavy armor for different situations, and completely forgot the fact that I only have one body and one arm. Deterrence is necessary, but the deterrence of the School of Magic has changed its taste and has become an unrestricted internal friction. Since there is no normal time flow rate here, no one knows when this internal friction started, but it finally fell after the arrival of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he did was to have everyone have a second-tier pass right after half a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to do this by allocating daily questions so that you can distribute points more efficiently. This includes considerable negotiation and communication, but without threats and compromises. His efforts – and of course the invisible threat of the worm and the orc killer duo – made everyone ultimately willing to try and begin to rebuild trust, even if it was just fragile trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of this are obvious. The first is that everyone finally started to communicate, including academic and life. Although everyone is overwhelmed by the gnome of the rumor, but this change is mainly welcome. Communication brings exchanges, especially spell spells and spelling techniques. Although you can access the big library through the Sage Stone, although you can watch all the caster skills on the second floor of the Magic Tower, there is no greater help from the face-to-face communication. After all, knowledge is dead, and experience and experience are alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to get points on the second level is also discovered. The half-long person who completed this thing: he found that if the presenter can cast spells Approaching, reaching or surpassing its level allows you to score points based on how easy it is to spell and skill. Siegel cast the elemental corps, and the result was three times the number of calls from the second tier, and he scored nine hundred points in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally positive." Siegel scratched his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing he told other people, there is no cover. After listening to what he said, the half-dragon master rarely came over to pat him on the shoulder, and sighed and said: "You are really an honest person." Since then, the semi-dragon people have obviously a lot of enthusiasm. But this enthusiasm is only for Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering this method, the acquisition speed of a single integral is from an average of ten to one tens of averages - Siegel gets nine hundred at a time. But it does not mean that he can do this every day. This incident has inspired many people. Everyone wants to try to find more and more suitable methods. They all know that if it wasn't for Siegel to tell everyone that the rules of the School of Magic had been tampered with, if it wasn't for him trying to unite the power of the people and change the atmosphere here, no one would think or dare to experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the exposed score or the caster who secretly left the hand. A single nine percent is still a daunting record. Unconsciously, Siegel gradually became the kind of mage in the hearts of all people. The word "the strongest" is not many people willing to admit. Elf Anna has always let him try to push up this record, "This will help you continue to accumulate prestige," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, neither did it nor did it explain why. In his view, as long as his points are positive, enough for self-defense and time back, and then able to meet their own learning needs, then it is enough. He is not here to be the "rich man" with the highest score. If his score is the highest. Then everyone will worry about being abandoned by him, or called cannon fodder used. Therefore, he believes that it is more important to be strong in credit, and then through his own efforts, the desired results will eventually be obtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he doesn’t often appear on the second floor, and rarely goes to higher places. He clearly knows that his current accumulation is just enough for the third level. It is only an accident to be able to go to the top. He devoted most of his energy to the design of the Magic Academy Light God, the light god, the six-armed god, and the light god after the fit. His behavior falls into the eyes of others, and is also considered to be prepared to serve everyone, so he received a high evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s behavior has gradually changed the environment of the School of Magic, and new environmental facilities suddenly appeared next to the Magic Tower. It is a green grass that can be used for party conversations. It is dotted with colorful flowers, gray soft mushrooms and fresh cut tree stumps with fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the stump here, you can feel comfortable and relaxed, and have great benefits for meditation and contemplation. Siegel will sit here for a while or read a magic book every day. Or just be in a daze here. In terms of efficiency, this is pure waste, but it is slowly changing the atmosphere of the entire magic school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a change that I have made myself, and Siegel is somewhat proud of it. But at the same time, he is also very clear that if you can't achieve results in cracking the tampering problem, the current atmosphere is only illusory and can be shattered at any time. He devoted a lot of energy to the study of the lamp god, and also tried to work with others, hoping to solve this problem as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, Chanem and the Orc Saint can’t help. Learning to cast magic and mastering magic creation is completely different in two areas, so their task is to get enough points as soon as possible, and get to the sixth floor to see how the problem of the wild beast is solved. The group that studied the lamp god was centered on Siegel and the gnome Keke. The two people were equal in level of magical creation, and they appreciated each other, and soon established a brotherly friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My earliest magical items were inspired by the gnomes, earning the first money and gradually embarking on a path of virtuous circle." Siegel said "At that time, I realized that the creed's creativity and thinking activity are very high, and it is worthy of our human beings to learn more. It is a pity that human beings have a strange disease that cannot see low places, and there is always a truth that is always tall. Prejudice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, the gnome is the same," Ke Ke pointed to his own legs: "I am shorter than the gnomes, I understand what you mean. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have your legs been born and disabled? If not, I can give you back."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you. But I have been used to it, I don't want to change my current state. If I change my mind, I will first think of looking for you." The gnome Ke Ke smiled over the topic. He looked at the design in his hand and said to Siegel: "I have been thinking about a problem for a few days. Why is the lamp god in this place necessarily complicated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel blinked. "I don't understand what you mean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let me change my mind." Gnomes thought about it. Organize the language: "I admit that there are a lot of magic materials here. Even if it is a dragon-sized lamp god, it is not surprising. But the original intention of the lamp god is to serve, and for mass production, to help solve the repetitiveness. The work of a lamp god to create nine is actually much higher than designing a hybrid lamp that can cover everything from one to nine. Especially this does not seem to be a show-off technique, so It is difficult for me to understand the original intention of the designer. If I don't understand this, it will be difficult for me to correctly analyze the working principle of the lamp god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This doubt has also been crossed Geer’s mind, but he was quickly left behind by him. Now, after the gnome re-raised, it caught his attention again. The design of the servant lamp god is very complicated, or too complicated. Before Siegel cracked Lear's tampering spell, it was completely a brutal way of cutting off the attached area, and it was helpless. He has a worry. If the parts that connect each of the lights gods are cut off, they lose the ability to perceive each other and fit, is it a more dangerous tampering? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if you want to reach the top level? This possibility is very big. After all, the only way to know the upper level - in addition to relying on the integral hard pile - is to eliminate everyone else. At that time, the lights god can already fit together. After careful thinking, only understand the design principle of the lamp god, distinguish which is the original design, those are harmful tampering, but also do not hurt the repair of their own, can start to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obstacle in front of Siegel and others is the complexity of the lamp god. Many places are no longer pure technology, but an art, just like the Elven Art Institute. Simple text can be used to write a straightforward article, or to create a poem that strikes the heart. As an engineering creation. Obviously, the tiling is more efficient, but the lamp god in front of me is like poetry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf likes to do this, but it does not mean that the fire and the priesthood will do this. Siegel, Chanem and the orc saint know the truth: here is the god of magic, knowledge and the god of prophecy. There is no character in the kingdom of God without consciousness. It is reasonable to say that artistic effects should not be pursued in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of ability, the Kingdom of God does have such a level of knowledge and technology and manufacturing capabilities. "Maybe for confidentiality?" The gnome then shook his head and denied his own hypothesis. There are better ways to keep secret. For example, use the magic array to cover up, or completely prohibit the disassembly. This did not do so, giving people a cover-up temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coke, let's go straight to the idea. If you just start from efficiency, how should you design this lamp god - considering their ability to fit and split? Siegel said: "It is very likely that we don't need to understand all of them, as long as we can make sure that they can be used, and then consider how to reduce the collateral damage as much as possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
