			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element of fire under the command of Siegel lowered his body and ran to the ground. When it was said that it was too late, it rushed into the pursuit with the incredible speed and flexibility of the orcs. In the face of the axe thrown by the orcs, the fire element was volleyed with one hand, changing hands from behind the head, drawing an arc in the air and throwing it back with the other hand. Even so, it still has two hands empty and can attack. One of them wrapped around the orc's wrist, and the other took advantage of the falling dagger. When the orc who was taken away from the weapon was still yelling for the burn of the hand, the belly was pierced by a short sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs have raised their spirits and shouted the name of the Beastmaster. Their blood flows rapidly, their muscles swell, and their skin becomes hard. With the power of violent, these orcs are faster and more aggressive. They surrounded the fire element and struck the flame with steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of fire jumped up and easily jumped out of the siege circle. It violently twists the body in the air, giving full play to the advantages of four hands and one foot, and even attacking all orcs at the same time. But unlike the one-on-one offensive, the current behavior of getting rid of the encirclement means more, not focusing on injury. There is no such thing in the dwarf's infantry fighting skills, but the martial arts on the hands and feet are the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only one wrong body, the fire element has enough room to move. With the speed of the orcs moving, it has been doing circular motion around the opponent, facing an enemy as much as possible, and then giving full play to the advantages of multi-handedness. For a time, the flames and the arms flew together, the broken weapons and blood were sprayed in the air, and many of them had already been ignited before they landed. The five orcs that rushed to the front were thus strangled by the elements of fire. Their record was only to leave seven or eight wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is far from assessing the combat power of the fire element. It is much better than the standard element summoning spells. The flame implement enhances the shape and combat power of the elements, and the memory brand enhances the martial arts of summoning creatures. However, when the fire element uses the dwarf warfare technique, it still inevitably shows stagnation and error, which reduces the defense ability of the fire element to some extent. This will be the direction for the next step of improvement, but so far the fire element has performed well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the second wave of orc pursuers came up. They saw the situation far from the hillside. After all, the light of the fire illuminates the battlefield and is so eye-catching in the darkest hours before dawn. It is impossible to see it clearly. When the orcs have prepared, they will act together. There was no choice to fight melee with the elements of fire. They unveiled throwing weapons, including flying axes, javelins, and daggers. The orcs are throwing at the same time. Successively, a total of four rounds were carried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of the fire are moving hard, but the long-range weapons that make up the battle are hard to escape completely. Without the protection of armor, it is easy to be suppressed under the attack of long-range weapons, and the special structure of elemental creatures is difficult to have suitable armor available. Only some of the protective enchantments that can be applied to the item are suitable for elemental creatures. But in the current situation it is too late - and it will also affect the results of Siegel's ability to test elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By observing, Siegel learned more about the pros and cons of his own spell, and then issued an assault command. The fire element compresses itself as much as possible, reduces the chance of being attacked, and then approaches the enemy at the fastest speed. It hurts with injuries and pursues the fastest killing speed. Metallic weapons and flames form a body that collides in the air and makes a harsh sound. The fire elements and the orcs' screams come and go, and the mountain roads are constantly bursting with fire, making people feel dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not idle, he releases energy missiles far away. Attack enemies who are trying to get around the battlefield. Unlike the arrow, which slows down after it is shot, the purple-red light ball still maintains its initial strength when it is tens of meters away. They hit the orc as accurately as the eyes. Instead of concentrating firepower to kill an orc, Siegel spreads the damage and spreads the energy missiles, causing as many serious wounded as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the range limitation, the orcs have no good way to take the Master at a time, so they try their best to eliminate the fire element of the road. After paying more than 20 new deaths, the large fire element warrior finally couldnâ€™t bear the damage and collapsed in midair. There are still seven orcs who keep fighting on the mountain road. They extinguished each other's flames, gasping, and looking at the mage in anger. If they don't chase the team and consume too much physical strength, they will not pay such a large casualty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stands in the middle of the road. Smile to them. The staff crossed the mysterious arc in the air, and another identical fire element was created out of thin air. This is naturally not summoned, it is just illusion. The breakout battle has just begun, and he has to save his physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved his hand and the illusion of fire element rushed under his command. At the same time, the Master recites the spell of fear and uses the power of magic to further reduce the will of the orcs. This tactic has really received results. The chasing troops turned around and fled backwards, and they abandoned the seriously injured companions who were still mourning on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The counterattack is just right, the Master orders the fire element to defend on the mountain road, and he quickly walks around and leaves. The orcs will definitely send more elite warriors, and there may be witches to follow. Even without the power of witchcraft spells, the orc's armor warriors, combined with elite archers, are still a very deadly combination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Siegel has already won enough time for the civilians, they have successfully passed the narrow line of defense set by the Paladin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the order of Count Todd, there were five paladins and two pastors as the main force in the narrow road, and more than twenty mercenaries were also left. . The count gave them a reward of one hundred gold coins, half of which was paid to their trusted friends on the spot, and the remaining half will be issued four hours after the mercenaries clung to it. If you can still come back alive, send it to yourself. If you are unfortunately killed, you will still hand it to their friends. Each mercenary group has one or two people who can entrust the aftermath. The mercenaries measure the difficulty of the battle and think that the price is reasonable and they will stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was watching the battle at the end of the team. They all looked in the eyes, and when the Master passed, they cheered for him. A courageous mercenary came forward and asked Siegel to cast spells for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My aggressive spells can't last for four hours." Siegel tells the truth: "The same is true for the gain class. The only thing that lasts is that Illusion, what kind of illusion do you need to assist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenaries are facing each other and they donâ€™t know anything about spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a closer look at the surrounding environment and couldnâ€™t think of a good place for illusion. It was originally a narrow road in the valley, and it was blocked by temporary obstacles. On one side of the road is a steep mountain wall that protrudes outwards, which is difficult to climb; the other side is a sloping gravel slope. If you accidentally step on it, it will roll down and fall off the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of everyone, the Master thought of an idea. His spells can't help much in combat, but at least try to cover them to retreat. He took the dagger of the mercenary and cast a conditional triggering illusion on it - the devil's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some places, the spell that someone makes a sound through change is exactly this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, when you want to retreat, insert this dagger into the entity. Whether it is a scabbard or a corpse, you can trigger This spell. Inside is a very vivid orc screaming, able to yell and let them retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this useful?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be useful." Siegel smiled and replied: "At least let them mess up for a moment." Then he patted the mercenary's shoulder and told them the battle. The biggest truth: "Remember, always follow the pastor of the Temple of the Morning, they are the true guardians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet is waiting for him in the ranks Two people walk side by side. The group of people marched fast on the mountain road and struggled to survive in the increasingly heavy air. If you look back, you can see the gray cloud of lead gray on the north side of the wall mountain range, even the rising golden sunlight can not illuminate it. At this time, even ordinary people without magic-sensitive physique began to feel depressed and irritated, trying to avoid the dangerous mountain peaks. No one dares to rest at this time, and there is no time to stop eating. The elderly and children with poor physical strength were taken care of by rotation, and the knights separated their horses and carried the old and the weak. Under the command of Sir Bill, Evan and Siegel took the lead in starting to distribute dry food so that everyone could barely fill their stomachs while marching. At this time, you can't pay attention to eating hot and drinking. It is very good to have something cooked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original team was still in the morning sun, but at noon it was completely in the dark. The dark clouds in the north cover the sun like a cover, and everyone has the illusion that the night comes early. The mage looked up to the sky and used the power of the vision to observe the dark clouds. Sure enough, countless grievances hide in them, entangled with each other, bite and squirm, constantly consuming the same kind and growing. In the process, the escape of a large amount of magical energy, forming a jumping ball lightning in the sky. But lightning and grievances are tied to the limits of the dark clouds and cannot escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
