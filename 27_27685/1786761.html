			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three wolves come over to think about taking advantage of it, it’s just a matter of seconds, I don’t even have blood on my body. WwW.XsHuotXT.com" Evan Carrying the horse, put the two front legs on his shoulders, and looked at the breathless Ai Meng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the blood on your body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, the estimate is coming Revenge, there are fifteen, I have to put down the diamonds to solve the battle as soon as possible, these are the blood of the wolf, not my, don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry?" Ai Meng took the long stick and tied the end of the sling to the top, counting the amount of ammunition on his body. "After fifteen, it’s twenty-two? What the hell are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan spread his hand and clenched his shield and sword, saying: "How do I know this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were trapped in the middle of the road, with no obstructions around them. There are 22 wolves with red eyes shining around them, revealing sharp teeth and constantly making low screams. These wolves are not in a hurry to attack, trying to approach two people around the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan and Imon are ready to fight, they are very calm, they are people who have seen battles and dangers, being besieged by wolves will not let They panicked. But the horse that smashed the leg - now known as the diamond by Evan, because only the diamond crown is higher than the king - is also very calm, although lying on the ground, but it is always ready to kick self-defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See which one is the wolf?" Evan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, these wolves are carved out like a mold, and it's hard to tell." Ai Meng said: "Be careful, this time is not good." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If West...Je is here, he will clap and the wolves will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you brag!" Ai Meng grinned disdainfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, why are you coming back to me?" Evan said: "Is it because I have attracted you to some kind of trait that makes you feel uneasy?" So..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get out of the way, don't be passionate, I am coming back to find a horse." Ai Meng said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible. You can say that I killed the horse at the time, I remember very clearly." Evan recorded the movement of the wolves in his mind. Way and adjust your posture. Said with Ai Meng. The two of them leaned back against each other, and Evan could feel the body of Ai Meng shivering slightly - she was afraid, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are stinking all over the body, how can I come to you?" Ai Meng completed the warm-up by controlling muscle shake, and now she has entered the best The state of battle, then stopped shaking. "You have a big shortcoming, but you can never change it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you change, you might like me?" Evan continues Tell a joke, so that Edmont should not be too nervous: "Talk about it. I changed it immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a man." One voice, "Change?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Evan slammed his pants and yelled at the wolves: "Come, there is a skill here." Biting, I will never defend!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he rushed up. The wolf closest to him just started to move, and before he responded, he was pierced by the "bonfire". Evan kept on foot, slanting through the first wolf corpse and inserting the sword into the waist of another wolf. Cut it apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolves moved and turned, facing the face of love and squatting. Prepare to charge. At this time, Evan turned around and used the round shield to knock off the wolf next to him. He returned to the original position in two or three steps, and back to back with Ai Meng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, I calculated it right, and I really have time to come back." Evan sneered: "Beauty, I won't let you get hurt!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You really have time to spare." Ai Meng has a back and feels more at ease. However, the wolves are able to withstand impulsiveness and expand the scope of the circle backwards. They heard the sound of wolves moving in the distance. The sound of one after another is getting closer and closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's find the opportunity, let's go first. I and this horse will attract you to the enemy." Evan said: "This group of wolves seems to be looking for me. It should be safe from me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you were besieged, isn't you dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan laughed loudly: "Ha! Just rely on these wolves." What's terrible? I can pack them all in a few minutes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, what am I leaving?" Ai Meng said: "Leave You can poke your cowhide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of black shadows floated from the top of the distant hills, accompanied by a little red light. Evan said to Emmon: "Do it, sooner or later, you must reduce their quantity, otherwise you can't protect the diamond."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Diamond? Good name, I like diamonds!” Ai Meng quickly fired a stone bullet in her hand, shattering a wolf's chin and quickly loaded the second one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wolves rushed up, the stars shone, the metal's reflections and the red bloody eyes continued to flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of the road, Siegel is moving fast. The smell of wolves in the cold air can be smelled from a long distance. It was a bloody, cold-smelling taste, plus the frequency of wolves, I am afraid that Evan had a big trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keigel couldn’t help thinking, how could there be such a big wave of wolves in a place so close to the village? There are very few villages passing by, and each size is small, and it is impossible to resist such a wolf. They should have been invaded long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no village requirement to kill the wolves, as if they have never seen a wolf. They continue to raise livestock, plow the fields and grow the grain, and ignore the danger. Did the wolves never appear before, are these just happened to move from the field? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He estimated the distance and thought that he could not see his own light from the direction of the village, so he used his flying skills to fly himself and extinguished it. bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of weak stars and spells, Siegel can see two people who are being besieged more than a dozen miles away. There are nearly a hundred wolves rushing up, and there are some strange varieties. The auras they reflect are more powerful and more evil, just like...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thinks of the beastized person he met in the bull rhinoceros, the creature of human blood and animal blood. They generally have three forms, animals, humans, and mixed forms, and each form has intelligence, enough to organize a coordinated siege. But Siegel still feels that several beasts still have no ability to coordinate such a large number of wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his eyes farther and finally found the commander. On a bare stone hill, three huge creatures are screaming and calling the beasts in their voices. In addition to the wolves that have already rushed, there are also wild boars, bobcats, violent tigers and a group of black bears. If you let these guys join the battle, Evan and Ai Meng have no choice but to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can these beasts not pursue even if they run away? So the only way is to kill the commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out the dust of the star, and the other hand was the epee. However, with his command, the epee changed its shape and regained its defensive staff and he was tightly held in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spellcasting in midair will be seen, especially in the dark. Siegel thought for a moment, swooped down and landed under the rocky mountain, hiding behind the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a look, he finally knows what these three monsters are: a super large demon, a werewolf and a demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolf has only melee ability, even if it can regenerate it is easy to be restrained. The demon will deform, steal, and use fear to control the enemy, which is no threat to Siegel. The demon ghost is a little more troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a monster with powerful power, but always looks at the body and pretends to be like a ugly old woman. Many of the witches in folklore come from their image, which also explains their ability: cast spells, configure potions, and eat people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
