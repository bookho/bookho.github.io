			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not last more than two seconds, and then... died. , <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the crystal wall channel is a world ruled by high temperature and different dust. The fire element defense barrier is broken like a bubble under the scorching sun. Then, Siegel was shot through the toxic light. He only had time to open his mouth, but he could not make any sound, the flesh and body organs were ignited, and the skeleton burned clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he followed the silver line back to the body in the city of Mire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second encounter is deeply imprinted in his memory, even if he returns to a safe place, he seems to be still in hell. Under the feet are hot glass sand, air like flowing magma, yellowish brown sky full of dead dust, black mushroom-shaped clouds blocking the sun's rays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was so hard to stand up and his clothes were soaked in sweat. Damn, the goblin weapon, if it has such great power, it is impossible to conquer the world! For a time, Siegel had a deep frustration. The dwarfs wanted to bind the stones around the world's souls and throw them into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a full-defense sergeant can't hold on for two seconds, then no creature can afford the environment on that side. The goblin that can make this kind of environment has the strength to destroy the side of the crystal wall. The only thing that can stop them now is the power of the Holy One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to say the world's least believe in the power of God, Siegel can be counted. He saw that the dwarf saints would also die under the power of alien dust, and the wall barrier would one day disappear. At that time, the whole world could become...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! Siegel suddenly returned to God. At the other end of the crystal wall, the strength of the flame and the dust is much stronger than this side. So how does the goblin survive? Whether it is the dwarf or William, the other side of the crystal wall sees the goblin creature. This is not wrong. The dust has strong diffusivity and corrosiveness to living things. There is no reason to lose effect at the other end of the crystal wall, so there is a way to restrain this force, and it is just opposite the crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a spark of hope suddenly in the darkness of despair, and a glimmer of light illuminates the world. Siegel calmed his mind and he gradually understood why the dwarf always took such a stubborn attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are really messed up. Although the motivation to leave the world surrounded by the devastating storm can be understood. But they can't hide their failure to attack the "earth." The goblin will counterattack this as an enemy, and it must be an endless battle. They used weapons that could create dust and heat, and finally opened the door of the grain wall barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel immediately thought of the key point: Do they know that their weapons are effective? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he re-transmitted to the top of the Mora, and once again came to the Crystal Wall Barrier Hall with the strange eyes of the dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf saint still stands in front of the amethyst, staring at the constantly shining crystal wall passage. A violent flash of light emerged from the center of the crystal, and the air of shock and shock waves rushed out. The dwarf holy man raised the warhammer, and the light of divine power flashed. All flames and impacts are blocked and then forced back into the amethyst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Irene?" asked Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dust here is harmful to him, I let him go back first." The dwarf saint did not even return. Said calmly to Siegel. "You are not projecting this time, so don't go to the opposite side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The crystal wall channel can't be closed, isn't it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Only the force of the destruction of the crystal wall such as the destruction of the storm can melt this passage. Or there is a powerful enough God to devote all of his power to the wall channel. The dwarf saint said: "This world is bound to another world by the power of rules, and only the power of rules can destroy it. No god will make such a great sacrifice, and if the storm of destruction comes to Mora巅 This position means that the whole world has basically disappeared, and it will lose its meaning if it melts the passage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If time can be reversed back to twenty-four years ago, I will still make the same choice, that is, to open this crystal wall passage." The dwarf saint is outspoken. "I still think that our choice is correct, but the preparation is not enough. There are no gods on the opposite side, no magic users, so I miscalculated the strength of the other side. No dwarf believers have blinded my eyes. In this regard, I It has failed. But now with the cooperation of various gods, plus the Star Kingdom and the Masters Association, everything has hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mentioned twenty-four Years ago, why was this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because that is the point at which the wall of the storm is starting to approach again." The dwarf saint said: "The original was to stop the storm." The power of the wall began to decay, the balance has been broken. A slow demise began to approach. I can't watch the dwarf die, so it is imperative to get through this wall. If not, the next generation of dwarves will I can't see their children born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Holy One, the wall of the storm will be destroyed within 150 to 200 years. this world. But this is the side of the dwarf saint, and Siegel will be suspicious to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various forces that will destroy the world, constantly eroding the walls of the ocean, the land and the scope of the storm; the terrible weapons from the goblins; Alien visitors. What can you do in this world? It is to find ways to get the "door of the door" spell, and then leave with the people around you; or pretend to be dumb, after a hundred years of their own, which is a flood after the death; or struggle to survive, from A bloody path in the thorns of death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few minutes ago, Siegel felt that the Dwarf Saint admits that he made mistakes and sincerely apologized is a very important thing, but now he is gone. This kind of thinking. Whether or not you apologize, you can't change the serious situation you are facing now; whether you apologize or not, will not let Siegel put aside the war on the dwarf. He and the dwarf can work together for the same goal, but it does not mean that he and the dwarf must become the same interests. The gods have long understood this rule, so they will join hands at the Dwarf King Conference, trying to promote their own attempts in the form of gods, and let humans join their ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of divine power, Siegel wants to satisfy his own human needs, is it not in vain? So when he looked at the dwarf saints, his eyes were no longer the image of the dwarfs, but the rock-like power of the gods, a magical power, a complicated spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed at himself and suddenly felt that it was a silly thing to get angry at "a spell", especially this is a dwarf spell that condenses them all The race is stubborn and incompetent. Does the saint really have emotional fluctuations? I am afraid that only when they face their own compatriots, or when they do things that are consistent with the teachings of their gods, they will have "emotional" fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just talking to a high-intelligent light god, Siegel thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You block the attack of the goblin, the federation will find a way to solve the problem of the dust. We currently lack high-level spells, so we can't create a strong like annihilation black hole. Spell. Even if it is assumed that dissociation can work, its efficiency is low and terrible, not a long-term solution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarf Saints nodded: "I They also sent messengers to contact the wizards of the elves, maybe they will have a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you let the elves provide high-level spells to the federation?" Still do not give up, want to try it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can coordinate the federation and elf talks, others cannot guarantee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still and the past In the same way, Siegel had long been mentally prepared, and nothing was sad, just remembering it in his heart. Dwarves and elves have their own reasons to protect their wealth, and the Federation is no exception. A request is not the only way to get something. Climbing a tree of knowledge doesn't have to wait for someone else to hand the ladder to the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to know how the dwarf is defeated. It is best to have a little detail. I also need to know the details of the weapon used by the goblin." Er said: "I believe that you can spread your perception to the opposite world. The harsh environment is not enough to let the power of the gods die, so you must have enough information."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good Siegel, I will tell you." The dwarf saint said: "You must always remember that the power that can stop the goblin from the wall channel is only God, so Even the Master should be awe-inspiring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
