			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the king of the prairie..." Kerry’s voice was so weak that it was like a tired traveler who had not rested for days and nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel's spell erases the anger, uneasiness, shame, and entanglement that he produces while clearing the suggestive technique in his mind. It is these forces that have enabled him to maintain the power of the Frost and Blood giants, and now disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His victory is undoubted, this duel can finally be finished, and outsiders can intervene. Mesera immediately ordered the soldiers of the Jackdaw tribe to help the King of Khan and send it to healing. Then she checked the situation of Siegel with the Knights of Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Siegel has become awkward in front of everyone, even if Janet does not know that he has such ability. I have to say that this respect has caused many people in the Jackdaw tribe to doubt - they all remember the night of the dragon attack, it was such a knight riding on the dragon's back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If other people appear like this, I am afraid that they will be shredded by revenge. Fortunately, Siegel was the one who killed the warrior, and to some extent became his umbrella. People talked a lot, but basically agreed that "this may be some kind of protection spell of the wizard." Then sigh the magic of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana did not care if Siegel became a singer, she just wanted to know if Siegel was still alive. Now her lord adult is frozen in ice, and the ice-cream is running through the "freezer" and his chest. Mana squatted on it, observing through the twisted and smashing ice. The bright eyes are shining in the eyes of the cockroaches, and the soul fire is still burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smashed the hand that was exposed outside the ice into a fist, then stretched out his thumb and made a few gestures indicating that he was still alive. Mana broke into laughter and quickly pulled out her own sword and cut it. The ice cubes broke into pieces and pieces fell. As soon as she approached Siegel's body, she picked up the obsidian dagger and carefully cut it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quick, take the brazier!" Mesera gave orders to the tribe: "Let the doctor come here to stand by."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her young maid said with a hesitant tone: "Physicians are now going to the king..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them Come over! Just say this is my order." She thought for a moment, added: "There should be nothing wrong with Kerry. At most, it is excessive fatigue, and here is only life-saving."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid should have screamed and rushed from the crowd to the direction of the long hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not in danger. He escaped Kerry's slamming and heart fatal wounds by turning into shackles. The viscera is much more fragile than the bones, so he will adopt this method in an emergency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undead creatures are generally not afraid of cold - they have no flesh and blood, no need to keep body temperature so the cold does not hurt much. After being dug out of the ice, Siegel pulled out the ice rifle stuck on the broken rib. I left it aside with a lingering fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Kerry is not aiming at the heart but the skull, or by this weapon to break the spine, Siegel is also difficult to survive. So close to death, fortunately he was able to see Kerry's attack in the end, so as to make the right response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked down at the scorpion on his chest and found that the number five was already on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A five-second warning can also be used to see things that haven't happened yet. Even if you can use it once every few days, this kind of power is extremely powerful, but it is only one face in the blind. Siegel is no longer the fledgling little mage, and his magical and magical items are close to three digits. There are more people who have seen it, but none of them can be compared with the scorpion. If each side represents a kind of power, then who made this item? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icegun is known as an artifact, can make flying ice crystal fragments, can also freeze opponents, but in the eyes of Siegel and the power of the scorpion It’s a long way off. The spirit of the Masters of the Masters Federation is capable of replicating the ice and the guns, but they can't make twenty-faced scorpions anyway. Even in the hymns of the great shrines, those powerful and wise gods do not have such power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that the foreground of the eye was shaking. Quickly return to see. It turned out that Mana saw his stupid stupid hair, thinking that something went wrong, he shook a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she is allowed to continue, she will fall apart if she is not killed. Siegel activities the mandible, letting the hail fall from the big hole in the chin, and then you can speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't shake. I can't die." Siegel said: "But my bones have broken several, you go to the doctor to have some splints and clean bandages. I am still in the state of the bone shelf, first correct the broken bone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana quickly nodded, the knights of the city of Mithal heard the order and split up . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missella came to Siegel, leaned over and picked up the ice gun, and then said with a puzzled expression: "Siegel, I I heard that the whole thing, you are trying to stop the sending of the elves to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is only part of the reason." Siegel replied: "I It is found that Giant Kerry has signs of being controlled by his mind. His decision to send troops is based on this. I have no other means of repelling magic. This is the only way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Mesera frowned. "You are not saying that the Holy Land will suppress magic. Is it safe here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's my fault.” Siegel admitted: “My understanding of magic was too superficial at the time, and some of them took it for granted. Now I can only say that although the suppression of magic spells is still strong here, it is not foolproof.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it’s a manipulative spell, that’s really awful, why Made out.” Mesera snorted to the ground and said to Siegel: “I will go to see Kerry and resolve your misunderstanding. You two can’t continue fighting.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she gave a slight gift and then turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like her." Mana said: "I think this woman thinks too much, always feels something hidden in her heart, not easy to get along with."西 <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said to the Cavaliers: "Messella is a very intelligent woman. Such people are rare on the grasslands, so get along. I always feel uncomfortable. Janet has said before that if it is in the starry kingdom, most of the aristocratic women there are like this. It does not show how special she is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mana pouted, leaned down to help Siegel dock the broken bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones in the squat state are very simple and require almost no expertise. Moreover, Siegel found that the plasma pattern of the spleen has the function of sticking bones. As long as the patterns are aligned, the slowly moving plasma can create its own appeal. Avoid breaking bones again. Siegel tried to do something and found that the problem of dealing with daily actions was not big, which saved him the burden of fixing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being sure to stand up, he changed back to normal body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain came up at this time and he immediately lost his balance. Fall in the arms of Mana. Several knights and seven-legged generals lay on the tent and lay half-lying, concerned about the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and said to them: "Don’t cry, I’m just hurting the wound. It seems that my muscles and internal organs have also been injured. Instead of escaping from the laws of nature, flesh and blood still need to be rested for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go back to Heim, let Pastor Ryder give you treatment."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, it would be easier to have him." Siegel said, "The whole body hurts, it hurts me. Who are you going to give?" I take some drinks? The best of spirits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give!" A huge shadow covered Siegel. Kerry’s big hand handed over a wine bag. Mana's hand touched the hilt and the whole body was tight and ready for strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Giant Mountain is full of bruises and smells of medicinal wine. Some of the mud-like things were smeared on the wounds that were cut by Siegel on the chest and abdomen, and many of them were squeezed out of the gaps in the bandages. Behind him, some of the heads of the grassland tribes were looking at the brain, and the anxious physicians were kept behind and could not go forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
