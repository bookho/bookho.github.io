			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other saints have left the world, and the influence of divine power is declining. All of this, Siegel feels very clearly. The rules that are represented by the ministry are still - the sun, the earth, nature, death, etc. - but there is no support for the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the magic god, all the priest's divine power is disappearing, and the effect of relying on divine power is also dying. Soon these pastors will find that their words are not as moving as they used to be. Their powers are not cured even by the bruises. They can no longer maintain the glorious image of the temple. In fact, they can't even make light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that has been strengthened is the beast, and the wild age is coming again. The wise race relies on its own power to make totems. From that time on, various gods have become the helpers of civilization to defeat the wild. When God retreats, the terrible creatures that have been suppressed for a long time have once again had room for activity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has begun to hear all kinds of prayers that are not meant to be given to the magical gods. Most of them start with "God, why is this?" . God left, but the rules did not go, which made Siegel really understand the relationship between the rules and God. Even if there is no elf god, the elf will exist, because the power of existence is far greater than God, so the creation god and other gods are not a concept at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A magical god that has not yet completed the fusion of the fire, has become the only true God in the world?" Siegel can feel his fire is booming Although it is still far from being able to form a new fork, it is strengthening after all. Every fire is a prayer, a belief, and an identity, far from being a simple power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to better assume this responsibility, Siegel concentrates on the matter, and things must be done one by one. The first is to hold the shadow of the dead. The patch is complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he made his hand was to let the Stars carry the secret. It is completely impossible to repair the tactics to no loopholes in a short period of time. Siegel has neither sufficient capacity nor so much time. What he has to do now is to rely on "brute force" to block the shadows of the dead. If a peaceful circle can't keep them quiet, then use five, ten, one hundred! The secret nuclear power will be suppressed with the greatest strength. Even if the shadows of the dead know that everything in front is false, he can only, must and always see fake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, it will still be broken by the shadow of the dead, after all, the other party can try it without endless until it finds a loophole. Siegel is not seeking perfection now. As long as he can stand up, he will achieve his goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the law began to take shape, he immediately left there and came to prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own clones are still lying on the ground, the body curled up, and the bruised wounds have solidified with the dust. With a little finger, Siegel regained vitality under the influence of divine power. He took a sigh of relief, as if the drowning person could breathe again, greedily expanding and contracting the lungs. After the energy began to circulate again, the clone recovered its perception of the outside world, and quickly got up and squatted on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed his throat with his fingers and vomited hard, and Siegel waited patiently. In a short while, a round thing fell out of his scorpion, and after it was wiped clean, it was found to be an old ten-faced scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I was studying the barrier, this scorpion suddenly appeared in front of me and drilled directly into my mouth." The clone said: "I heard That person said, hide, don't be found, all the blind people are destined to be together! If you are lucky, you will understand everything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then I contacted the ontology, but found that it was very difficult to transmit information, and there were obvious obstacles to communication. So I knew that it was wrong. After swallowing the scorpion, I used all the power to cover up its existence. Within a few minutes, the sneak attack of the saints Come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took over ten scorpions, he felt his twentieth scorpion in intense heat, like a stove, he did not know Why is that. In fact, the only person who understands what is going on is no longer there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has not seen the body, he already has this hunch. Still losing money is a god, there is no one who is imprisoned is more alert. Turner's ability to analyze the human nature and situation far exceeds the scorpion's Siegel, throwing the scorpion out before the saints of the gods have yet to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scorpion spread out from the fist to the four sides, trying to ease the impact of the elements brought by the magic god. Siegel did not close his hand, but slammed it up and down. He didn't want to use spells. He didn't want to use the precise method to open the layers of fog, find the key nodes and then carefully open them. He didn't have the patience at all. He only wants to open it here with arrogant power, what is the reason for him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every punch is similar to an elemental surge, and all the rules that make up the barrier are shivering. The cockroaches became more and more dense, and gradually became a messy wave. Waves and waves are superimposed, and after the layers of power are pulled up, they finally exceed the limit of the barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a loud bang, the entire land was as heavy as a punch, and countless rocks and mud were thrown into the sky, and the earthquake stretched for more than ten minutes. Siegel created a large hole on the barrier that could never be healed and then flew in. He had no other purpose, just wanted to make a decent grave for Turner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nucleus that once brought him misleading can no longer stop him, and the fog that hangs inside the prison is also blown away in the explosion. Siegel quickly found the place where Turner died. There is blood on the ground and a complicated footprint, but there is no Turner's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can also smell the residual power of the gods from the air: the elves, the dwarves, the hunting of the mother of the earth and the trial of the Lord of the Morning. When they get together, Turner has no way to resist it. Death should be a matter of moments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no traces of fighting here, but also illustrate this from one side. Although the footprints here are very messy, each one is very light, not the kind of force that is left in the battle. What are they doing here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a spell called yesterday's illusion, the Masters Association and the Federation do not have this spell, but the Art Institute of the Elves does. Its original purpose was to help the elder elders remember the past, but Siegel could use it to do things that the elves couldn't do: go back through the whole thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the blood on the ground, trying to condense the power of time rules, Siegel used the magical magic of yesterday to reproduce the history of the place. What can happen is some fragments, vague and no sound. But with keen insight and precise reading lips, Siegel has pieced together some facts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner knows that the gods are going to start with him, this time he has no chance to escape. There is only one purpose for the gods, that is, the ten-faced scorpion, and Turner will never let the gods succeed. Through the balance of the ten-faced scorpion, he knew this when the magic god was born, and he also got news when he predicted that the priest left. It is predicted that the ministry will impose the most restrictions on him, and the action of absorbing the New World in that year is to break the rule of prophecy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t leave the jail, but there is still a way to send the dice. This prison can only imprison him, but in order to allow the blind to stabilize the wall of the storm, he opened the way to some of his abilities. After studying these passages for a long time, Turner found some points that could be used. Before the sacred sage arrived, he handed the scorpion to the sage of the outer Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity that time can’t come again, everything can only die.” After doing all this, Turner sat quietly in the middle of the prison and used all his power. Get up and fake a scorpion. It has exactly the same breath as the real ten-faced scorpion, and it can also emit white light that counteracts the damage of the storm wall. However, it uses the vitality of Turner, which can only last for a few days, and then it will become a waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner exhausted his power and was unable to resist when the Holy One arrived. The bow of the god of hunting shot through his heart, and death was rapid and painless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the gods found the false scorpion and were immersed in the joy of victory. In order to better study the scorpion, they also took away the body of Turner. Now Siegel has no way to make a grave for him, because there is nothing to bury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You killed a lot of people and saved a lot of people. Finally, the person you saved killed you." Siegel looked at the scorpion in his hand. Standing in tears before Turner’s last blood. "I know that if time comes again, you will still help us the holders of these scorpions, you will still make the same choice. I just want to know if you are willing to continue to help the people of this world? Those gods, but the group of deserters! Coward! Traitor! Robber! I don't want to be like them, nor will they be like them. I want to keep the world, because the shameful bastard has abandoned the world, I don't; on the other hand, I want to be God left his own humanity, and my defective humanity hopes that I will stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
