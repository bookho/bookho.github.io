			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is not always calm, the sudden torrential rain swept the entire area where the line of sight was, the wind swelled and the waves tumbling, the waves crashing on the stone boat The bang. WwW.XsHuoTXt.com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the island is the same as the island’s unsinkable stone boat, without fear of the storm in front of it, but it has become the most terrible of the surrounding fleet. enemy. Once you accidentally hit a stone boat, it is only a result of the ship destroying people. In addition, the water flow near the island is even more unpredictable, and there are often terrible darkness and whirlpools. Therefore, the royal fleet of the Star Kingdom spreads under the command of the captain and seeks ways to hedge. Wait until the storm passes and gather again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves are stable and do not shake in the wind, but they also leave the deck and go to the lower level to escape. The Dwarf King has ordered that the entire non-sinking boat can be submerged under the surface of the water, and only a few tens of meters of depth is needed for protection. The wind and waves will not affect the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the deck was emptied, only Siegel was still standing in the bow. He frowned, letting the wind and rain hit his face, and then ran along his neck; even if the mage's robe was soaked, even the boots were filled with water, he still did not leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he has encountered a sea storm in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Soth, for more than a decade, I have been to and from the two continents, and the ocean has become a part of his life. He has learned to recognize the weather and avoid the bad. The power of the storm. The old captain gave his own talent to him, and he did not live up to expectations, and he was able to make the sailing smooth. So, a big storm without warning is appearing out of thin air in front of Siegel? He does not believe it anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain is mixed with the taste of the elements, and the traces of the spell hidden in the thick water vapor are vague and barely identifiable. This storm will definitely be the result of spells, but who has such a strong mana? Siegel has been watching the ship, but he can't find the source of the spell anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dwarf ran over and yelled at Siegel against the whistling wind: "Mr. Shi, fast-forward cabin, we have to dive!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go on, don't worry about me." Siegel took out his wand and drew a circle in the air. The winds that flowed around him stopped and gathered in the middle under the power of the spell. Until it condenses into a super-large gas element. Siegel walked into the element of qi, suspended there, and then vacated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf was blown down and rolled two turns on the slippery ground. Then stop the figure. He spit out the rain poured into his mouth, then shook his head and looked for the nearest entrance into the interior of the stone boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the huge island is like a whale that sucks up the air, and the head is pressed down. It was under the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm became more intense, and the fast moving rain clouds rubbed against each other, and the lightning was excited. The black lacquered sky will suddenly be illuminated by the thunder's white light, and the sound of rain and wind will be covered by the roaring sound. Siegel c cruises in the air, trying to find a ship that wants to approach a stone boat. He had a feeling that Evan was on that ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stagnation of the stone boat suddenly shook, and a lot of bubbles accompanied by the scarlet blood y. I don't know what kind of creature this huge island has hit when it sinks. A long time, Longwei never sprinkled on the stone boat, and all the marine life that wanted revenge was scared away. They escaped and brought direct threats to the surrounding ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frigate of a Royal Fleet was cut by the dolphin of the arowana, and the keel of the vessel was severely damaged. The bottom of the ship began to leak. In this storm condition, they only sink a result. The captain immediately announced the abandonment of the ship, and the sailors jumped into the sea with things that could help float. They prayed for the mercy of the god of the storm, but they did not know that the storm was not caused by the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees, summons more than 20 elements of water for assistance, and informs the nearby ship to rush to the rescue. Water can cause eddies and calm the water. They dragged the sailors and let them gather and go to the nearby Royal Fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another ship suffered an impact, but fortunately it was the side. No bones and bones. The gold flagship saw that things were moving in the direction of disaster, and it blew the dragon horn. This is a huge horn installed under the bow of the ship. It is made of the pharynx of the ancient dragon and has the effect of deterrent aquarium. The low voice spread throughout the four fields. A safe area without creatures has also formed around the gold flagship. Other ships approached it and enjoyed the waters without biological disturbances, but still maintained a relatively safe distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for item locating, all prophetic spells have the same result, and even the spells of the communication class can't work in this environment. "Very good, if this is not artificial, it is strange!! The storm does not stop, it seems that nothing can be found!" Siegel changed his strategy, waved his wand, and the power of magic listened to his call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element of gas quickly became bigger and soon became like a storm. The seawater is sucked in, the thunder is sucked in, and the energy of the surrounding elements is all attracted. Siegel controls the model of the elemental aggregate, through which it feels the power structure of the storm. Such a large range of magic is impossible to control elements to every space, and there must be a pattern for c vertical. Although this pattern resembling a magical array is hidden by squally showers, it still reveals signs under the disturbance of the elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is not predicted that the spells are disturbed, Siegel will not be so troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interior of the stone boat, Lear was sitting cross-legged in his room, holding the teacher’s stick and thinking about it. His will is associated with this storm, c rushing into a lonely boat among the oceans. On the boat, Evan is waving a long sword, using the magical power to constantly smash the incoming waves and clear a path for the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The obsessive guy, after getting a hundred scorpions, is really amazing." Lear frowned. "The research has not been completed, you should continue to sleep, And the scorpion must be separated." He casts a spell in the room, and everyone who can fill the ship can detect it. This is one of his unique abilities: casting a avatar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bachelord Faranis's ultra-long-range spelling is similar to this, as long as the magic pet can reach, it can be used as a starting point for casting. Lear went one step further and he was able to cast spells as long as his prophecy could be observed. How big is his spelling distance? The entire Old World and half of the ocean are within his control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement between the gods does not allow the gods to directly interfere with the situation of the scorpion holder. But this agreement is leaky. The god of knowledge and magic fades the godhead and divine power, strips it into rules that cover the whole world, and then descends with the body of blood. Is Lear a god now? Obviously not, so he can conquer the blind. research. But if he casts a spell, it is easy to use the power of the original magical god, and the caster is essentially using the power of his own legacy. This is very risky and easy to touch the agreement and is blocked by other gods. Must be careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he can only stay away from Evan’s position and create a wide range of storms. It is also possible to exert an indirect effect. The direct influence will only be given to other gods and will be directly blocked. This is a big risk, but he recently peeked into the future and found that if Evan was on a stone boat, he would strengthen his connection with the scorpion, and it would be even harder to re-separate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who leaked the position of the scorpion, and let him find it?" Lear has been very strange about this problem, but it cannot be traced back by all means. Segment history. The owner of the ten-faced scorpion is closely monitored by the gods. I have never left his d's house, certainly not him. The fate of ordinary people is not difficult to check, so the history that cannot be traced back makes him suspicious: Has there been a spontaneous awakening of other nephews? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear controls the storm to blow away to Evan, but only the big waves can really threaten the ship. In the squally wind, the captain only dared to raise the spinnaker of the bow, so that he could get the power to meet the sea. It was not enough for them to survive from the turbulent waves, but Evan actually opened the waves with a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this power? Is a sword-mediated magic? Lear found that this power is very similar to the pure force field effect, and there is also a trace of the ability to eliminate the elemental structure. In the years of studying the scorpion scorpion, it has never been found to have such qualities. This makes Lear's curiosity and desire to explore stronger, but only the dice and the user can be separated from others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not. The ten-faced scorpion and its users have long been caught and studied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant elemental polymer produced by Siegel on the sea caught the attention of Lear. "A giant storm element, what's the use? Without predicting spells, you can't find Evan's position, ready to look like a headless fly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Siegel closed his eyes and cautiously. In the beginning, there was not much interference with the storm at sea, but instead focused on the role of the spell in the storm. The wind swayed his robes, and the thunder fell from his side. The rain smacked his body from all sides, and he did not move in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
