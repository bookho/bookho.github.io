			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Siegel said the phrase "Can kill you to the old age," a shallow smile. But the next moment, his smile was replaced by a thunderous roar. "Death!" The power of truth, with the power of destruction and demise, flew to Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leer’s stick of the ** division, spit out the word “death” from the throat. The two truths collided in midair, and the power was comparable. The exact same spell structure cancels each other out, breaking the spell back into pure elemental energy. This energy has nowhere to escape, and it can only spread in the air and on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confrontation of the Power Word lasted for a while, and Siegel and Lear found that this would never beat the other side. Two people, like mirrors, transform spells at the same time. One shot four arrows, one shot the Austrian fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is the form of energy developed from the foundation of the element, and the other represents the common pattern of all spells. They have the same goal, and they all have the ability to ignore the protection of ordinary spells. Only the power to isolate all spells, such as the anti-magic field, can stop one or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-pulse arrow exudes the radiance of iridescence, which is unusually smashed when it is crossed in the air; the Austrian fire is between silver and gray, and it is more understated. . The two rays continually meet in the air, or pass by, or smash and collide. Siegel and Lear dodge while calculating or predicting each other's trajectory. The distance between the two men is more than 30 meters, and the fingertips are not fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, neither of them has been injured, and no one can help. Single-source single-shot damage spells are not difficult for them to hide. Even if they are not agile, there are various spells that deflect rays. The two of them are fine, but the energy beam that is deflected can not disappear. For a time, the School of Magic fell down, and the magic towers, gardens, and semi-buried dormitory houses were smashed by the fish. The explosions raged and the fragments of the impact flew around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomish Keke rolls the wheelchair hard and hides himself next to the magic tower, avoiding the direction of direct impact. Fata itself has good resistance, and the spell ray has not been reversed until it touches the wall. So the gnomes cling to the magic tower and put themselves in this defensive layer. He wanted to go back to his room, but it was too dangerous to cross the battlefield. The only good opportunity was given up by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to stay to help Siegel, after all, Siegel has just saved his life. Both repaying and revenge can be accomplished by attacking the sudden appearance of the old mage. He was confident enough to find a chance to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Keco, you are not dead!" The voice of the dwarf rang from behind the gnome. His legs were still shaking a bit, and the petrochemical sequelae did not completely disappear. It takes a while for the numbness caused by insufficient blood supply to the legs to fade, not to mention the effects of complete petrochemicals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, are you dissatisfied with the fact that I am alive?" The gnome was careful to guard, and his fingers were on the scepter who could launch the Thunder. The dwarf shook his head quickly: "I am not malicious to you, but I feel that you are very lucky. I have already understood that the high-level things of this magic tower are not what I can blend. If you are good, you will be the most important thing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome nodded and looked behind the dwarf. "Are you down from the Magic Tower? Half Dragon and the Mage Master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They both studied the crystal ball on the fifth floor, but the half dragon I couldn’t hold it, and fell to the ground like a dead lizard. When I came down, the worm master worked hard on the crystal ball.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok!" The sound of the half-dragon man sounded up, but there was always a feeling of weakness in it. It opened its wings and glided from the spiral staircase of the Magic Tower. When it reached the bottom, it was awkward and quickly reached for the dwarf shoulder. The dwarf has always been steadily weighing the following, but it has fallen to the ground with this help. The semi-dragon and the dwarf rolled into a ball and slammed into the gnome's wheelchair, slamming the axle. This is good, all three viewers have become inconvenient to move, can only look at each other with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half dragon man took the lead and climbed up. He saw the body of Elf Anna at a glance: "Who killed her?" He turned to ask the gnome: "Is that the old man who fights with Siegel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that he is called Lear, I always feel that this name has some impressions, do you know?" Brow and answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can answer his question. How can an old man who has long been buried in the country be alive and kicking? The flow of time carries its own mystery and elegance. Who can find out beyond the people who can take their time out of the horizon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the two legendary wizards has entered a new phase, they all understand that single-ray spells can't hurt each other. Siegel took the lead in making a move, and his hands were pressed on the ground to combine his elemental power with the earth. Although it is impossible to summon the earth element warrior, the earth element is still in control of the environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a trembling of the feet and they stood up and grabbed each other to stand still. Even the magic tower was shaking, and it made a loud rumble. After a bright yellow light flashed from the surface of the magic tower, the surrounding foundation stopped swinging. However, the power of Fatah is not enough to stabilize the entire school of magic, the cracks of the earth continue to appear, and the entire square begins to be torn apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time was late, a fault rift suddenly appeared at the foot of Leer, and a lot of gravel shot like an arrow rain. Lear smirked and shifted one step to the side, and the sleeves waved away the gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel naturally does not make such a simple attack, he constantly uses the strength of earth elements to oscillate the ground, creating pits, rift, stalagmites and stone pillars. The constantly rising earth wall seems to be a fist that is waving, and when it falls, it fiercely rushes to Lear; the crack of the squirting acid will suddenly appear, and the old Master is not ready to attack; from time to time there is a thick muddy ground. Or the quick-slipping quicksand, opened his mouth and tried to swallow the pl. Although it is not possible to summon the earth elements, Siegel uses the entire magic school as an elemental creature, using his own extraordinary elemental maneuvering ability to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille tried to fly, but there would always be a stone rain attack from the sky. The giant named Earth constantly waved his arms and formed an endless offensive. Lear knows well, and simple avoidance cannot solve the dilemma at hand. So he began to shoot the spell and shattered all the nearby earth and stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a battle between the Thunder and the Earth. The lightning rang, rumbling through the sky, and the electric phoenix frantically tore the stone fist into a big hole. Lear supported the defensive circle that climbed the thunder snake, and the blue arc that caused death was like numerous long whip, breaking the sandstone that was trying to get close. The roar of the roar was deafening, and the three spectators tried to hide inside the magic tower. But in order to protect himself, Fata has closed the entrance, and no one should knock on the door. The gnomes, dwarves, and half-dragons had to support the force field shield and barely support it in the shadow of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need to continue to work hard, can't stop! Siegel screamed and forced the earth to obey his orders. If this is not a kingdom of God, his control will be stronger and the offensive will be more fierce. This spell has not reached its peak, so you must continue to increase your power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This hurts me!" Lear’s voice came with thunder: "You must be stronger and stronger!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can't have time to confront him in words, and generally speaking, people will fail. The earth element control encountered a bottleneck, and he already clearly felt the hindrance of the magical school of the gods. The land here is not as thick and heavy as the main material plane, and it will reach the edge of the space after drilling down 100 meters. Therefore, the power of the earth is limited. If you simply use the power of earth elements, just like a strong man has only one paper sword in his hand, it is impossible to exert its power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, add the fire element! Siegel raised his right hand and shook the dirt above, igniting a black flame. He recited the spell and re-inserted the hand into the dirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big earthquake trembled, and all the attacks stopped in an instant, just as time was still. The rift no longer appeared or expanded, and the fist of the stone wall was fixed on the way down, and the mouth containing the acid snorted twice, but no signs of launch were seen. The dwarf asked: "Is it over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more violent explosion occurred in an instant, and the large ground was directly smashed. The entire square became a crater, and the lava took over the ground and the sky. All that will not burn will be melted, and those that burn will become the gray dust mark in the bright yellow background. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine student rooms half buried in the soil were directly blown out, rolling in the air like nine milky white eggs. The magic tower radiates a bright yellow light, and the fire reacts. The ring is already hot. Before the nine eggs were cooked, they flew to the magic tower and hanged like a bunch of grapes. Shenhuo protected them all, and at the same time protected the three people who took refuge at the bottom of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
