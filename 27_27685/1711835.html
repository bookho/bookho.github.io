			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arena is an inseparable part of the creation of Macabu, which is essentially the place where orcs sacrifice to their racial gods. In other cultures, the arena may bring different meanings, such as the display of courage, skill and strength, and the team sports project can reflect the spirit of cooperation and synergy. Humans have also developed the arena into a warrior's contest of martial arts, which will give the final winners a knight status. But in the orc's arena, there is nothing but bloody death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Siegel came to Macabu, he had never been to the arena, and he was worried that he could not stand the cruel scene in the arena. Listening to Fazak said that the arena of Macabu is the closest place to hell in the world. When there is a large gladiator, the body can cover every inch of the ground, and a large group of flies are densely covered with layers. It will rise like a black cloud, and people who enter the corpse may be killed by odors and flies. The screams of the orcs and the half-orc audience are deafening and can be heard clearly throughout the city. The gladiator will not stop until all the orcs' ** are met. Once there was a slave fight that was too fast and too early to catch more than a hundred of the labor slaves in the city into the arena. Their fights were unobservable, and the former orc warlord slammed and ordered 30 hungry wolves in the arena. The crazy killing and eating performance took five rounds before finally satisfying the audience. Fortunately, it’s just early in the morning, the daily routine of the fighting will start in the afternoon, and Siegel can just pack a quiet area. The orcs like to sit closer to the battlefield, the better, so there is a circle of "packages" under the stands, the terrain is slightly lower than the venue, so that the blood in the arena can flow into the "package". Siegel chose the nearest package from the slave rest area, claiming that he wanted to serve the host, and came over to clean the environment in advance, and no one was allowed to bother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven stays outside the door and acts as a sentinel. If there is an orc witch offering, he will immediately call the alarm through the soul link. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has to configure the instant potion, it can only be done in the key space to minimize the risk of being detected. This leaves little room for the pharmaceutical operations he can use. The space key can't leave the distance of the scorpion, and the scorpion can't leave Siegel's body too far. So even after opening the space, Siegel can only shrink his shoulders, elbows can not reach into the space. All the powders, reagents and alchemy vessels are concentrated in this small space, which puts a great test on the control ability of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use the spell of the Master in other places, relying on the idea to operate the alchemy equipment can greatly reduce the difficulty of the work, but not here. The detection magic is always running, and the Master's hand can't work through the space door. Siegel puts slow motion as much as possible and carefully operates in a small space. There are more than twenty kinds of materials that need to be blended together, and no mistakes can be made at each step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body foundation laid during the exercise of martial arts helped Siegel’s busyness, whether it was precise movement or agile reaction, he was in the alchemist Eric on. Two hours later, he finally completed the preparation of the pharmacy. Although there was only one cup of finished product, it was enough for Siegel to perform a spell test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the last dragon tooth dagger, Siegel scraped a small piece of debris from the sacred crystal and put it into the potion. Siegel watched it carefully and emitted bright light in the potion, and there was a constant wave of magic emanating from the reagent bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key space can isolate energy fluctuations, so it will not be detected by the detection circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about five minutes, the fragments of Yan Lingjing completely disappeared, as if they had dissolved. Siegel knows that the sensible medicinal agent does not dissolve any substance. It is reasonable to say that it only works with magical energy. He looks at the reaction bottle with suspicion, waits until it stops emitting light, silences, and does not want to understand the situation. What is the reason? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensible medicinal cessation of luminescence means that the magical fluctuations disappeared, so Siegel took the reagent bottle out and closed the key space by the way. . It seems to be a change in the surrounding environment. Five black smoke is like an open finger, and it is suddenly drilled from the mouth of the reagent bottle. The palms are separated first, then they are broken into fists, and they change into twisted faces of rolling grievances. This gathering of grievances went straight to Siegel, and the Master responded quickly, immediately starting the power of the scorpion and turning himself into a scorpion. The black smoke passed through the body of Siegel, failed to find a gap that could be broken, and immediately split into five strands, penetrated the wall and ceiling, and began to wreak havoc in the arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screams and crying came from next door, and then I heard the sound of the chain swaying. Most of the arena slaves are limited by the ankles and handcuffs, and are separated from each other except for training and performance, lest they kill each other and cause the slave owner's property to shrink. Fortunately, with this mechanism, the chaos did not break out immediately, and the killing was temporarily stopped. But Siegel knows that under the guidance of the violent violence of grievances, those shackles can't last too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
