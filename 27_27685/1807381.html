Something, said to Master Shelley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the meaning of staying, the Masters Association is bullying to your nose." Master Shelley also summoned a few helpers to lift the view Test bench below the star tower. Many of these long-established test instruments are still very good, and Master Shelley wants to move away - no one is trying to stop them anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Back to Heim's collar and federation, there will be enough buffer space between you and the king, and everything will be discussed. Otherwise, face to face like this. Under a command, are you obeying or hard-top?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, and he still fully agreed with the statement of Master Shelley. Leaving is the best solution, but not necessarily the safest. Siegel has a concern, from the concerns of the Masters Association. The Masters Association did not mention the secrets of the nucleus, but simply mentioned the magic spaceship and the transmission array. The meaning of this is self-evident—that is, Siegel wants to understand the implied truth and then decides for itself. How to say to the king. This plan will definitely be sent to Siegel here. The Masters Association and Lear certainly know this. They certainly don't expect Siegel to blindly see the embarrassment, so they are also very likely to think of his current response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the move you want to leave the city may be part of their plan. But put the whole thing in tandem, lead yourself with the things of Sir Bill and the orthodox, then turn around and use this thing to force yourself away. What is it for? If you don't understand this, Siegel will not be relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, will you be a lord when you go back this time?" Zucker leaned over and asked carefully: "Can you ask for your piece?" I want to bring Winnessa on the road and return to Heim."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Winnesa, who?" Siegel’s mind is like a It seems that there is any inspiration: "Wick, there is nothing wrong with women. But what is the sentence you said before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You?" The Orc apparently stumbled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going forward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be a good lord?" Sike scratched his own In the back of the head, he said, "This is what Winissa said. She said that I should also be a lord and manage my territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel The ground hit the head of Jack's forehead. "砰" sounded. This is how he expresses his excitement with the courtesy of the half-orcs. "It’s my greatest fortune to bring you. I want to understand what is going on. With this, I will give you a piece of advice. Any woman who lets you manage the territory instead of being free and happy will eventually let you It’s boring. Right. You keep picking up, I’m going to the library.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Library is not far from where Siegel lives. A few minutes later he came to the iron-clad wooden door. The servant who was wiping the door nails whispered and said: "The Marquis is an adult, no one in the laboratory, you moved. You can't move the Royal Library! We will lose our heads!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not here to move the book, I check the information." Siegel went straight to the history book of the kingdom of stars, and then began to read from a specific chapter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many records that are not visible outside, especially those related to the supreme rulers of the kingdom, as well as those about policy, nobility and rebellion. The secret of the lord. The information that Siegel was looking for was related to the previous Master of the Master, how he rose. And because of what went on the road to rebellion against the flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is a folk saying or a record of the Masters Federation, he is a madman with a feverish mind to let the kingdom act according to his ideas. Most of those crazy and unrealistic thoughts come from the devil's temptation, which leads to the world becoming purgatory and the kingdom becoming a ruin. The wise king vetoed his proposal and only allowed him to pilot in his own territory. But this person is greedy, paranoid wants to change the world, thinks that his territory is not enough to reflect the effect, so he began to attack his neighbors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is caused by this. Afterwards, with the help of the undead army, this mage lord has repeatedly won many battles, and his enemies are all looking down on the wind. With the intervention and help of the Temple of Dawn. The king's army finally reversed the disadvantages of the undead ocean on the battlefield and stood firmer step by step until it began to counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king wanted the lord's head to be brought to justice, but the Master's Association hardened the king's orders in the name of the Protector. At this point, the association was driven out of the star city. The position of the Royal Master's Adviser was also cancelled, and the Temple of the Morningmare came into being. After more than a hundred years of experience, as the school city matured, the Masters Association returned to the political circle with this new form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters Association is so kind? Since the Masters Association decided to tear up the agreement between the federation and the federation, and to block the spells and magical knowledge, Siegel knew that the association was still a utilitarian political organization. Will it simply give up the original relationship with the royal family for the promise of “protecting and helping all mages”? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must have an inside story. By looking at the information of the Stars, the Siegel saw the other side of the matter. The rebellious mage lord, Earl Hood, is a self-taught aristocratic mage. His expertise lies in the spell of the dead spirit and the call of the soul. He secretly learned these spells and didn't even know his parents. When he was sixteen years old, because of a traffic accident, the carriage of his parents fell down the cliff, so the title of the count became his. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always wanted to resurrect his parents, and this information is evidenced by his and the king’s letters. But relying on Necromancer spells can't resurrect one person, only turning them into jealousy, zombies, or ghosts. And the temple is not willing to perform difficult resurrection spells for this unbelievers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he managed to continue the spell experiment from various ways, and also came to Wang to meet the king during the period, hoping to get the support of the royal family. According to the records of the royal family, Count Hood wanted to collect vitality from the living to achieve the effect of the resurrection of the spell. At this time, the Masters Association made a statement to the royal family: "This behavior is evil and cannot be supported."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even returning to his territory, Count Hood is still facing A huge pressure. The surrounding territories are often harassed by his magical forces, and the farmland and pastures that the undead creatures pass through are quickly poorly harvested and even become unrecognizable. He wants to conquer the world with the power of death. Thus bringing the dead souls to the world - there is so much news, and the reality proves this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how Siegel reads, there is a feeling that Count Hood is being rebelled. In the end, he chose to join the Masters Association, an organization that he had not waited for before, and then let the association shelter him. What kind of conditions did he use? Why does his Necromancer spell have a youthful potion or a potion of life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Masters Association does not yet have a record of this matter. But with the information at hand you can restore part of the truth. The Earl of the last Master, Lord Hood, had a good relationship with the King. He also had good accomplishments in his own spells, but he also encountered the same embarrassment as Siegel and was forced to leave the capital. after that. Things didn't develop as he thought, distance not only created a buffer, but also became a hotbed of distrust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, starting with a series of small border frictions, it eventually evolved into a "rebellion." In fact, Siegel now feels that this rebellion needs to be quoted, and things are not as simple as they thought in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to be a lord? The simple wish of Zucker is not so good. Siegel has not yet returned, and the surrounding of Heim has become less peaceful. The giant Kerry of the Jackdaw tribe has sent back a message. At present, they have no intention of attacking Deepwater City. Instead, Deepwater City wants to expand its own territory. Just north of the Walled Mountains, the Jackdaw Tribe found a salt mine from the orcs and grabbed a large grassland. For the time being, I have already had enough. In addition to those tall and beautiful buildings, Deepwater City has nothing to attract the people of the Prairie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if Siegel goes back, I don’t know what will happen! The method used by the Masters Association on the last Master of the Master is very clear, that is, to make him a lonely, lost territory, lost friends and family, and lost everything he had. When he only has spell knowledge and abilities, joining the Masters Association is the only option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is different from him. Count Hood is not a sergeant, which means that he can't leave the door of the outside world. However, Lear is not a fool. He naturally wants to keep Siegel in the world of thunder walls with more meticulous and intense means. Until he admits to lose. There may be no problem with the short-term departure. Once Siegel really decided to leave, the preparations of Lear would be revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it’s not a good idea, Siegel is probably already on the road to the trap and still doesn’t know. The only way to make the king absolutely believe that he will not betray. It’s always staying with the king – it’s even safer than sending a proton. Think about it, Heim is at the other end of the sea, and all the faster ways to reach the ship - whether it's a magical spacecraft or a transmission array - are actually the works of Heim's lead Siegel, so once West It is simply too easy for Geer to isolate the starry royal family from the control of the New World. Now there are many very young knights in the Star Fortress. In fact, they are the protons sent by the various lords and nobles, and they are showing their loyalty to the royal family. What can be done as a Heim collar with the most powerful military strength? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
