			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard master did not make any difference from the last time, and still looks like a man. She will grow her hair in the back of her head and wear a pair of chests. However, her weapon was replaced by a green longbow with a silver silk decoration, and the waist sac was full of complex magic enchantments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her, there is also a tall, strong elf man with a blond hair, handsome facial features without any weather, when seeing Siegel Full of joy. His eyes flashed with light, and his fingers were like playing a musical instrument, tapping a long stick made of twisted brown branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s temptation asks: “Master Lia, when did you have a boyfriend?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my father!" Lia kicked Siegel's calf and introduced him to him: "Alamir. I have a surname. He is a druid, sometimes weird. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said quickly: "I am very sorry, I still have difficulty distinguishing the age of the elves by appearance. If you are offended, please forgive me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is nothing, I sometimes can't remember the human appearance, they change too fast." Alamir's voice is as sweet as music, but in his voice There is a majesty that cannot be rejected. From all angles, Alamir is like a person with power and wisdom, and must not be underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I listened to my daughter and saw a dark-skinned human being, so I was very curious." He looked at Siegel with great interest. Look, then said: "I have to say, you are very unique."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liya quickly explained to Siegel: "My father likes to see rare creatures. Such as three-horned deer or six-legged frog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alamir laughed happily before saying: "You will say this to you." The child is frightened!" He tapped the stick on the ground, and the surrounding grass grew rapidly, twisting and twisting together to form three small stools. The French tree next to it hangs down the paper and sets up a short table in the center of the stool. A group of birds sent acorns, pine cones and raspberries, and then sang and flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people sat down and shared a few fruits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you coming to the Elven Forest at this time?" Lia asked, "What happened to Heim? I remember you not long ago." I have come to the letter and said that everything is fine. But why did it suddenly appear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at Alamir. The latter smiled and said: "Siegel children, here under the protection of the power of nature, you can speak freely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel takes a deep breath Tone. I adjusted my emotions and said, “This needs to start when I set foot on the road to adventure.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf and the father listened carefully to the West. Geer described the entanglement between him and Knox in a clear voice. The accidental encounter of the goblin camp, the night shadow of Ximu Town, the spell trap of Longshi Cliff, the town of bacon and the ghost of Makarbu. Leah knows some of the stories, but this time Siegel tells the whole story. When he talked about the magical red magic tower in the hub, he even took a look at the well-informed Alamir. Looking at Siegel with fear and astonishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Islois also has the sorcerers of the Knox Commonwealth. They have been eyeing them here, so they will send people to monitor the people who enter and exit the Elven Forest. Siegel said: "The half-elves want to set out intelligence from me, or simply want to kill people - but this does not affect the outcome - the Elven Forest is a hindrance to the Knox Association."西 <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel paused for a moment and sighed: "The current situation, Knox Commonwealth has taken a big lead, their spells, grievances and Undead creatures work together, and no living thing is cheap, but it is not the most terrible - most people know nothing about their plans, no defense, and their purpose is hidden deeper. Clues. But if they wait for them to launch an attack, it is estimated that everything is late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Leah interjected: "Can they break the elves?" Forest? Every tree here stores a powerful spell energy, as long as the elf . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp surviving, we will be able to adhere to fight on "<br <br /> & nbsp />;"The Knox Commonwealth spells are probably suppressed even by the survival instinct." Siegel added: "The three mages would rather eat themselves and die than leave the room."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long silence under the French tree. The sound around it is also quiet. The bird stopped singing, the squirrel no longer ran, and even the leaves swayed with the lightest amplitude. Alamir thought with her eyes closed and sought answers from the philosophy of nature, but naturally let him learn from mortals. So he opened his eyes and said seriously: "Siegel's little friend, you are also a mage. Tell me what you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Nod and slowly talked about my own opinions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undead creatures are different and unpredictable, ordinary weapons can't hurt them at all, but I believe that under the power of the priest of the Moon Temple, all the undead are not too cheap. Wraith is a big problem, their quantity and mobility will create numerous loopholes on the defense line. Although the evil spells can keep them away, the power of the spell cannot last forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the elf does not want to fall into a situation of fratricidalism, it is necessary to shrink the line of defense and place the residents under the protection of the Temple of the Moon. But if you can't attack, the Knox of the Knox Association has a way to deal with the gathered elves. They can safely cast spells beyond the range of the bow and arrow, and after all, they can level the elf forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think the key is to deal with the spirit of resentment." Siegel said: "As long as you can overcome the problem that the flesh and blood will be controlled by the body, you can Bring back the disadvantages on the battlefield. The races that are not afraid of being controlled by the spirit include the undead, elements, golems, and mud. Although there are some unique creatures that are resistant, the dragons are defeated under the siege of the spirits. Come, they have no reason to succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You forgot that plants are not afraid of being controlled by the spirit." Alamir said: "But let the plants move. Fighting in battle, even with the help of the power of the French tree, it still seems to be a drop in the bucket. But our elves, especially the druids, can never use the undead as a defense."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't know how your ability to control the mud?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid shook his head and said: "In the Elven Forest, the mud It is difficult to form a scale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel takes out the element runes Heart, four elements each, placed in front of aramil. "This is one of my cards, the elemental rune guard, a long-lasting elemental summoning. Although they can resist the possession of the grievances, there is no advantage in the face of the mage's elemental spell. Maybe the elf's caster I can solve this problem, I will tell you the secret of the spell - as far as the dwarf is concerned, I will explain it to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can guarantee you The spell is only used in this war." Alamir picked up a core of the instrument and looked at the dwarf rune above and frowned. "We can't use the dwarf runes. Do you still have to find a way around?"<br />< Syler nodded and said: "From my standpoint, I prefer to use the Golem. Their magical resistance is useful when dealing with Masters." I am a mage, but if I encounter a magical figure that is not afraid of magic, I can only use the martial arts of my warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cost of making a magic image Amazing, it is not a short time to form combat power. Alamir said: "In this elf forest, our elf has a powerful silver demon. The ten mages have been used for three years to complete. The threat of the congregation is close at hand, how can there be so much time?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a turnaround from a disadvantage." Siegel paused for a while, struggled for a long time before finally making up his mind and said: "There is still one There are ways to gain an advantage: don't passively wait for Knox to join forces, and the elves can take the lead in attacking and assassinating these evil wizards. When their number of casters drops to a certain level, the battle is naturally avoided." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know that we won't do this." Elf Lia said: "There are no assassins in our elves, and we will not take human life by inference alone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This I understand." Siegel nodded. "I also think this is not appropriate, but it is my responsibility to say it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elf Druid appreciates Smile, this smile can then Youse was covered. "Knox Commonwealth is now integrated with the Masters Association, and the Masters Association is closely related to the Masters Association and the City of Learning. The three caster organizations are united to have more power than the Elven Forest, and the Golem is also Unable to resist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
