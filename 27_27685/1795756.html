			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel resisted pouring the red wine from the handle to Lear’s face – it would flow like blood, covering him slightly upturned Lips and smiles, but meaningless. WwW.XsHuotXT.com Siegel raised the glass, swallowed the wine of the red and sour, and then got up and said goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t go, Siegel, I have something to ask you." Lear grabbed the stick of the teacher and used it to support the body. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it related to the affairs of the Star Kingdom? Siegel stopped and turned around. I was excited for a while and almost forgot about it. Xuecheng’s view of Aaron’s move will greatly influence the direction of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear did not say this thing, but pointed to the door: "I am not familiar with the terrain here, can you send me back to the school city?" On behalf of the prepared room? Or near the Star King. Thank you for your help, Siegel Division."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a game? Siggar’s anger turned into a smile and sent the old man to find a cabin. He turned and walked to the lounge of King Aaron, where it was very conspicuous, and only the guards of the king who had the duty to perform duties outside his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Confederation, the leader of Heim, the royal Earl of the Star Kingdom, Siegel Squid, seeks to see His Majesty the King." Normally the equivalent of the Duke's title "The title should be placed at the end, but before the king's squat, Siegel, according to Janet's prior notice, will bring the title of the Royal Earl closest to his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King’s Guard looked at Siegel and said coldly: “The King’s Majesty needs rest, and he will inform you when he wants to see you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the new game? Siegel took a roll of yellow parchment from his sleeve: "This is the decree of His Majesty King Aaron, giving me the title of Earl of Heim. So whether or not I have the honor to see His Majesty the King, you should also use the Earl. The adult, not the word 'you', calls me. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king guards silently, as if nothing has been heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to me, if you are willing to turn a deaf ear, I have no opinion, but do you really understand my self-introduction?" Siegel took out his wand The two guards immediately placed their hands on the hilt. "Ha! I thought you didn't know what it was called magic. What is called a teacher. I only have one request. Go in and pass it on to see if King Majesty wants to see me. If he is already resting, or really don't want to listen to me. I Turn around and go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guards are still deaf, and their eyes are fixed on Siegel’s wrist with his wand. If you really want to cast magic, you don't always need to use your wand with your active wrist. Just need to spit out the magic word from the mouth, it is enough for Siegel to take away the lives of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when the teacher was about to lose patience, the door opened. Another king guard stood up and said, "The King's Majesty just woke up. I hope to see the Earl of Heim. You both take up the weapons and continue to stand guard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He then let the door open and asked Siegel to go in. "The Earl, please also put your wand away. This is before the king, there must be no excessive moves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, don't say Count Siegel When he waved his wand, it only made me feel at ease." Aaron's face was like wax paper, but it was slightly smeared with red near the lips and cheeks. He often coughs and then relies on potions with bitter taste to suppress it. Many times the potion will be sprayed out without swallowing, and he will continue to drink. His Majesty did not get up. Instead, sitting on the bed with a lot of soft pillows on the back. There is a low stool on the side of the bed, which is reserved for Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was not like this in the past. At that time I could stand on a golden battleship and command the wizards to use the fireball to sink the orc pirate ship. Now I am better than At that time, it was much more sensitive. The dwarf's non-sinking boat is like an island, but I can still feel it shaking slightly on the water. This little bit of shaking can make me dizzy! Can you imagine that I will become this look? "Sigel old friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, sat down and looked around. "I don't drink now, are you quit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there only this way left in the Temple of Dawn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Aaron said with a smile: "If I cut my lungs and use it." If regenerative is useful, I think they have already started. In fact, it can only be like this. Let's change the topic. Count Siegel. How are you doing at Xinda 6? I just woke up, just right. I want to hear the story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, His Majesty the King." Siegel thought for a moment: "Maybe I should tell you a message, I used to be your physician." Reese is dead, he died in my hands, and it paid a price for his bad deeds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Siegel elaborated on the murder The Temple of God and the colloidal template warrior of Reese. He omitted the situation about Evan, but still explained the fact that some blood magicians are coveting the blood of the king. Aaron lowered his eyelids and listened to his ears. If he asked him from time to time, Siegel would think he was already asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your experience is always full of legends, I have thought about your life." Aaron said: "Although I became a King, I am like a Like a disability, you are hugged, you know, if no one can help me, I can't even go to the throne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All kings need to go to the throne Thanks to the help of others, this is a history proof."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, but I know the difference in meaning." Aaron said: "Think later, I and Evan actually met you at the same time, at the banquet held in Ximu Town. Bill later told me about this. Your master is a capable person, capable, honest, and loyal. Yes, unfortunately, the most important family support and historical origin for the nobility is almost zero. Even if I want to promote him in the court, I can only come step by step. And his relationship with Evan is very close, it is the middle. The object that the minister is wary of. In fact, if you didn’t turn Heim into a big new territory, Bill is very It may have been the object of attack by the ministers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a nobleman of the starry kingdom, loyal to His Majesty the King." Siegel smiled: "But Evan is also the royal family of the kingdom of stars, or the title of the prince. Unless he becomes a rebel party, some of our private contacts do not constitute a crime, and those ministers are really unreasonable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron nodded: "I told them this too. Siegel, you come to me by name, not because of the title of the count or the name of the Master, but because of me and Evan. Bill. The jazz will definitely inform you of the letter, but I don't know what he will say. If you can, can you let me see the letter he gave you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel nodded and took the letter out to him. The original letter he burned with flames, now this one is counterfeit, the content is more peaceful. Aaron took a nose clip from the small bag on the bed and closed his eyes and began reading the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s better than I thought, Bill is a good knight, good lord." Aaron put down the letter and said, "Are you taking the paper and pen for me? I have a letter to Evan, you accept it for me. If I can't see him again, you can transfer it for me, can't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There is no problem, King's Majesty." Siegel took things out of his pocket, and as a mage always carried a sheepskin roll and an ink pen. The King's Guard moved a small table and placed it on the bed, and Aaron wrote on this small seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trouble you to cast a spell, I don't want this letter to be seen. Some things are inside the royal family, and it is inconvenient to pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will keep this letter until I don't know the contents of the letter until I have given it to Evan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Siegel took out the elemental aggregate, commanded it to grow bigger with a spell, and surrounded Aaron. Again, if there is a rainbow spell, it will be much more confidential than the elemental aggregate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron writes slowly, on the one hand, on discretion, on the other hand, to rest at any time. After half an hour, Aaron finally finished his work, took out the seal and stamped it on the letter, and sealed it with wax oil in the envelope. "Receive it." Aaron yelled again: "I know that Evan has always been a proud person, so don't give him the chance to see me. Just wait until I die and give it to him. Remember when he was young. Always bullying us with swordsmanship, the sons of the lords who accompany us to study, regardless of age, are not his opponents. However, although Evan is powerful, it can not withstand the siege of the children. As long as someone dares to bear the first strike Hurt, everyone rushed, even Evan couldn't run away. Hey, I hope he has learned the lesson and can be more intelligent than before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
