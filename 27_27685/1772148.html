			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you stupid or crazy?" Siegel said, "Stop this unwise offensive plan!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is quiet in the long hall, everyone does not speak, only the sound of the burning fire. Siegel stood under the steps, and the giant Kerry sat on the throne, and the two were opposite each other. Later, the new Khan of the grassland slowly stood up, and the huge body was like a tall tower, covering the entire hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, I expected that you would stop me. After all, this is not in line with your own interests." Kerry handcuffed the crown, which is a A ring made of gold, decorated with silver-carved bird heads. Compared with its master's hand, this crown looks small and weak, but it is like a mountain pressing the head of a giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, maybe you thought I changed, but it didn't. I still welcome you like the past, hug you, call you my Brother. I will entertain you with fine wine and food, and send you a blessing for the relief of a certain beauty of my tribe. But I am really listening to you now. I am the king of the northern grasslands, you are A lord of the South is equal to a tribal leader under my command. Why should I listen to you?" He lifted his right hand and pointed at the pale man with his eagle hook nose: "I have my own wise man." And he is serving the welfare of our group of prairie people, not as selfish as you are!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagle nose stands on the first step, Respectfully bending over and said with a soft smile: "Wang Shangsheng: The horse king on the ground is majestic, but the animal who grazes down, how can it compare with the eagle in the sky. What he can see is only the square. Ten miles of grass, and the king is concerned about the sky under the cover of the sky, all the life on the whole earth. The fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he turned his head and looked at Siegel with a dignified look, then said: "As for you," ', this title is the robbery of the world. You have indeed helped the Jackdaw tribe in the past, and will therefore receive the most warm hospitality in this long hall. But please close your mouth. Because the king does not want to hear Your rhetoric. We are warriors, we are eagle, we are the unstoppable force on the grassland!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at him like a tiger Its prey. Even if you can't cast magic here. Siegel is also not a bare-handed punch, and he has twentieth scorpions that are never affected. With only one thought, Siegel opened the vision and carefully looked at the stranger in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who I am, I was a colleague of the Masters Federation." Siegel said with a smile: "Where is your wand and scroll?" The magic necklace and amulet on the body have no effect in the Holy Land? As a Master of Deep Water City. When can you represent the interests of the Prairie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are purely filthy, Wang Shang, you have to be clear!" The man could not see the slightest panic, still exuding strong self-confidence, and Knox shared the sorcerer's ability to control emotions. "How can I be a mage, how can I sneak around like this hypocritical liar? What you do is for your own benefit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are a tempting, sulking thing, there is no place for you to talk!" Siegel glared at him, his eyes shining with magical light made him timid. Then Siegel said to Kerry: "I don't deny that my thoughts are for my own benefit, but also for the Jackdaw tribe! Only by joining hands can we taste the final victory in this chaos. The storm is approaching. We should reinforce the keel, tie the sails, and wait for better currents and winds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continue to wait? Wait for your currents and Sea breeze?" Kerry snorted and squeezed his fist. "Lorentz is right. Siegel, how many people do you have in Heim's collar, how many warriors can you have? You naturally need to wait, because you are not as strong as me. I have 20,000 cavalry, if mobilized. There are 50,000 soldiers who can go out. On this grassland, all the tribes are united and will take care of them. They can be replenished everywhere. You can attack everywhere. Why do the elves fight with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With them calm down than you." Siegel looked around: "Where is Mesera, why not come out to discourage you from this stupid idea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid? Do you dare to say this?" Kerry jumped off the throne's high platform and stood in front of Siegel. His body has become bigger than in the past, and the cold air has constantly emerged from his muscles. Form a crystal hoarfrost. Siegel looked very thin in front of him and seemed to be hit with a few punches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry took a moment and laughed. "That's right, I almost blame you. Siegel, you are using the elves to test my patience, see if I will lose self-control in anger? This is a good way, how do you think of it?" He waved at the maid and shouted: "Come on, come up with the wine and give my brother a moist throat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at the gram In it, the vision can see the changes in the magical fluctuations on his body. When the force of the ice appeared, abnormal elemental changes occurred near the head of the giant, as some spell effects were weakening. No wonder this eagle hook nose called Lorenz wants to discourage Kerry from calming down. I am afraid that the blood of the ice giants on his body will offset the magic they cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s outside the Holy Land, Siegel has many ways to dispel the power of Knox’s mind-controlling spells, even if it’s “euthanasia”, he finds The treatment and eradication methods. But the Holy Land suppresses all the magic spells, and seeing the situation, Kerry will not let people slowly check his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine is up, the dark red wine is like blood. Siegel clearly saw the magical aura, and the faint enchantment was swaying on the glass. I don’t know if it was from the cup or in the wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Kerry personally handed the glass to Siegel, Lorenz smiled and waited for Siegel to drink the wine. It is a great credit to be able to solve the Southern Master's lord here by the way, and control the Master's Union's spell lab in the city of Mith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he can use magical vision, can he still refuse the wine that the giant Khan Wang personally brought? That disrespectful thing is enough to beheaded. Although it is not as good as the thinking of controlling him, the result will be happy to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and took the glass, then looked at it and poured the wine on Kerry’s face. The red wine was frozen and fell to the ground to make a crisp sound. The wine glass was thrown into the brazier. The remaining water is quickly evaporated, giving off a sizzling sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the long hall took a breath of air and were at a loss. Kerry wiped the stains on his face with a big hand, and his face was very ugly. "Siegel. What do you mean by this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of the Master untied his cloak, threw it aside, and stood up. His hands are constantly emitting electric sparks, and it is as if he can still use magic. "I came to the northern grasslands from the southern territories, and returned to the world from the land of nothing. It is not for the debate with the fools. According to the rules of your grassland, under the testimony of the three spirits, the right one will stand, wrong. Will swear on the ground to confess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glared at the hooked nose Lorenz, his left hand slammed open. A green thunder was sent from the palm of the hand, and the loud noise stunned the entire long hall. Knox's sorcerer's eyes widened and he couldn't believe what he saw. How can someone use a spell in this place? How can the power of the element not collapse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will answer his question, and he will have no way of rushing lightning. With only one flash of time, the power of the plasma burned down the **, and the original rumor was now left with only a twist of distorted black carbon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribal leaders stood up in panic. Someone evaded backwards and someone tried to rush forward. Only the most intelligent people react in an instant, including the black wolf and the red sun. They made a glance at the surroundings, letting their men stop the loyal "helpers" who wanted to rush, and shouted: "No one can throw a weapon in front of King Khan, otherwise he will find a counter-argument!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides my father and my brother, no one dares to do this." Kerry squeezed his fist and the bones gave out the voice of Gragra. "Even if you can cast spells in the Holy Land, it is not my opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are really stupid and hopeless." Siegel taunts The look looked at Kerry and put away the lightning on his hand. Use the plasma on the skeleton to engrave. He can convert the energy stored inside into several spells, but in the Holy Land there is only pure plasma lightning that can actually be fired, and other spells will still fail. However, I want to wake up Kerry. It is not necessary to use a spell, and the fist is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel said: "Don’t say so confident, when did you win over me? The jackdaw king on the prairie, you are the horse The fart is full of brains, has already swelled to float up? Come here, I will replace your brother who was cut-and-hearted today. I will teach you the father who was burned by the dragon flame. Don’t think that With a broken circle on the head, it’s invincible!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
