			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great prophet Lear was even taller than Siegel when he was upright. The gray-eyed eyes seemed to be suffering from certain diseases, but actually It is because of the long-term observation of the time and the river of destiny. Www*xshuotxt/com can't see the emotions in his eyes, he can only judge from the expression that he is making a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was finally able to meet, Mr. Siegel." Lear first said. His voice is low and full of magnetism. It is a combination of a strict teacher and a kind father, and it seems to be a good old man who tells stories to children. "I am the Prophet Lear of the City, I am very happy to see you before the Dwarf King's meeting. Your legendary story is widely spread in the Masters Association and the City of Learning. I am drafting a book to record your growth deeds. To be honest, after I saw you, I knew that you were much better than your predecessor, the Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to what you mean, it seems to have seen The last Master of the Master?” Siegel asked in a curious way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, use my eye? Of course not. But when we are in the river of history, we pay attention to those important people and things in time. It is inevitable that I will devote myself to it. I always think that the spirit of the human being can be friends with the words in the book, even if they are separated for thousands of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Er agrees: "Reviewing the past can see the essence of the present and the light of the future. Is this the secret of becoming a master of prophecy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very The savvy young man is undeniably the most promising mage in the modern era. But you only say half right, predicting that the future is not so simple, the luck you need is actually more important than knowledge.” Lear’s face is smiling. Like a naughty child sharing secrets with his friends: "Oh, in fact, many times I am guessing, but I am lucky, I guessed it many times, so I became a master of prophecy. Don't tell them about this thing! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You laugh Master Lear.” Siegel scratched his head and said, “I have a lot of questions about magic and prophecy that I would like to ask you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are the apprentice of Faranis! The same temper as him! But you are really not the material to be a prophet. From your eyes, I know that you like certain results and solid facts, but you know. The world is not built on certainty and sturdiness. Come on, the young teacher, take me to the warmth of the place. You have been here for a long time, knowing where to sit down. Stretch your legs and expel the wetness at sea. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please, Master Lear here." Siegel led the way and left the deck with the old Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no fireplace inside the stone boat, it is said to ensure that the air here is not too turbid. For the use of earth elements dwarves are experts. But the gas element is not very proficient, so the ventilation system here has been criticized. The two divisions found a remote room, which should be prepared for a participant who has not yet arrived. The rune lock on the door could not help two people, they walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My nose always tells me the future: there is enough warm fur and comfortable seats here." Lear looked around and then looked around, then Pulling Siegel’s arm and saying: “Hey, the flag depicts the heads of the nine eagle. This room must be prepared for the wingers. But although they have wings, they fly very fast, but they always lick. I am late in the book. I remember that in the book, their ancestors, the giant eagle, always arrive at the battlefield when the war is coming to an end. It is slower than the dwarves, humans and even the halflings without wings. So we use the winged room. They won't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and said: "Maybe they will thank us after they know it. The stone ship is very wet and feathery. The wings will be uncomfortable.” He snapped a finger and gathered the water elements in the room, using the power of elemental aggregation to transform them into nature and begin to burn in midair. After burning, they turned into water and dripped into an iron basin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interesting way of casting, so that your accomplishments in elemental magic are as deep as the legend." Lear walked into the room and put the staff's staff On the side, I picked up a comfortable "Bird's Nest" sofa and sat down. He twisted his body. Sending a comfortable sigh: "I can finally rest, an old bone, bumping for a long time at sea. You can also sit down at Siegel, I think you have a lot to say."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But where do you start? Siegel was thinking about this in his mind as he sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a minute or so, Lear opened his eyes and said to Siegel: "Oh, I saw the future and know what you want. The Federation and the Masters Association, Heim and the City of Learning. You want Exchange knowledge and spells, exchange understanding and peace. Siegel, don't know if I said it is correct?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded: " Probably this means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I belong to the school city and a member of the Masters Association, so you come to me? Siegel, said Say what you want, what exactly is bothering you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sheepskin reel was taken from Siegel’s space bag, Part of the list of spells and books inside is what Sigel needs, and the other part is the missing collection in the Union Library. Master Lear took the scroll and looked at it carefully, then picked up the "never-out ink pen" from his pocket and wrote and painted on it. The sound of the nib rubbing the surface of the reel is clearly audible in this quiet room. In addition to this sound, there are only two people breathing and heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list was handed back and Siegel began reading. As his gaze continued to drop, the hand holding the reel was getting tighter and tighter. Most of the books needed by the federations were checked, and the high-level magic scrolls they needed were all crossed out. There are only two or three insignificant spells, such as a short message suggestion, a very ice s line, and a shredded hand mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel put down the scroll and looked directly at Lear: "Master, what do you mean by this? Can the Masters Association provide or need other exchanges? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this is the case." The big prophet squinted and said with a smile: "It is well known that the federation has just been reorganized and redefined." Charter and rules of procedure. You know, although it is still called the federation, but in fact it can be treated differently from the previous federation. I know that you want to open a new era. Lead the survivors of the original federation to rebuild on the ruins. As far as the Masters Association is concerned, you are a new organization, a new group of lawyers who have no established stable relationship with the Masters Association. Before you decide whether you can contribute to the promotion of magic and the common welfare of the Master, you are in a certain In a sense, it is not recognized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for not saying that we are an illegal organization." Siegel snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where there is an illegal statement." Lear smiled. "The Masters Association has never enacted any Master's law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The agreement between the former Masters Association and the Federation? Is the Association ready to abandon it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I won't use such a serious word to turn away, it hurts too much." Lear waved his hand: "Please give the Master Association a process, To judge the relationship and inheritance relationship between the new federation and the old federation. The federation we know is managed by the division's three giants and is headquartered in a group of mages in the Sanfeng Pagoda in Deepwater. And you. Clearly, there is no In the case of any of the Big Three, he set up himself, so..." He paused and said, "Can't a group call yourself a Masters Association, is he really a Masters Association?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously a procrastination plan to suppress the development of the federation by controlling the higher key spells. As more and more mages want to deepen the study of magic and need more spells, they find that only the Masters Association can provide them. In this case, will the Federation not be more and more biased towards the Masters Association? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long does it take for the Masters Association to complete this judgment and re-enforce the agreement with the Federation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This depends on the situation..." Lear said with a smile: "Many divisions are very busy. And your union is so far away, how can you usually pay attention? Unless..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless?" Siegel has frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless there is a Master who can work hard to study life with the Federation, this can deepen understanding. Of course, you can also send a Master to the Association. The Association welcomes All mages visit and learn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the current state, if the Masters Association arrives at the Federation, it will certainly cause confusion within the Federation. The title of "Seeing the Association of the Dead and the Master" has not been forgotten, and the resentment has not faded. The people of the association are not suitable for the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
