			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the meeting room, Siegel stood under the Three Peaks Tower and thought quietly. The Three Peaks Tower is a majestic building, a wonder that everyone can admire. When the city of Deepwater was not established, the mages who came here showed power from the wasteland, and powerful spells made the three towers rise. At that time, the whole earth was shaking, and natural creatures fled far away, watching everything that happened here with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three towers symbolize "authority, knowledge and heart", and the tallest tower in the middle is the "heart" tower. Every time Siegel sees the tower, he will think of the knowledge read from the book: "Understanding knowledge and gaining authority is just to better understand the heart." The idea of ​​the Masters Association is different from the old one. The "Mage Association" and "School City" on the mainland were dismissed as "too similar to the pastor." However, there are also many mages and scholars who agree with this idea, come to join the federation, and bring life to the three towers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel asks himself, what do you want now? He read a lot of biographical books about how the teachers grew up from the library here. He understands that only when he can stand the loneliness and study hard, can he become a teacher. But he also knows that in his heart, he is eager to take risks and go to see the world. The world is so big, there are so many things to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it better to go to the North? Siegel wondered. According to the process of the audition meeting, he knew that after a month there would be a large number of adventurers heading north to the savages and orcs. Among them are mercenaries, knights, and a large number of speculators and regular soldiers who subsequently rushed. But again, both the savage and the orcs will be alert, and the north will be very crowded and lively. It is better to leave as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strength comes from practice." Siegel made up his mind to think of the bachelor's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he stepped into the Knowledge Tower in the Three Towers and entered a huge, obsidian carved hall. There aren't any windows here, but there are some soft light sources around the magic. There are many bookshelves floating in the sky, moving constantly, moving in and out in the gray mist. The fog filled the entire hall space and looked up to the top of the tower. Here is a place to store a variety of books, apprentices and above can borrow and transcribe books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has been here many times. When he came last time, an old man in red robe received him and helped him find "Magic Protection". Shield and Protective Energy Foundation books. This time it was also the old man who sat alone in a huge stone chair and was looking at it with a Master Traveler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good day, old gentleman." Siegel said, "I am going to borrow some books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked up and looked at Siegel through the old reading mirror on his nose. After a while, he suddenly realized: "Oh, it was you. What do you need this time?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the geography and primary magic of the northern part of Deepwater City." Siegel had already figured it up before coming in. Borrowing here is expensive, geography is still cheap, only 1 gold coin for 1 day. The primary magic encyclopedia needs 7 gold coins for 1 day, which is not as cheap as those classified magic books - 4 gold coins per day, and does not delay learning magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked up at the bookshelf in the air and quickly looked up the relevant catalogue. After a while he said: "Sorry for the child, the primary magic encyclopedia is gone. I have a good recommendation for Northern Geography - "The Orc and the Sea" by William Eric."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also has a backup plan, he has to go Geography, then picked up the illusion and element related spell spell book. The old man looked at him and said: "Small Master, you should go to the authority tower. The road to the north can not go well, you need magical items to protect yourself, at least should also be equipped with a wand. If you travel, You also need a portable, waterproof and insect-resistant spell book. I have seen the sad thing that the Master lost his spell book, and you don't make the same mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Siegel nodded, and he also had this intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knowledge Tower is a library, study room and exchange room, which is always quiet. Unlike it, the authoritative tower is a lot of fun, here is the lab of the spell, the driving range, the magic items and the workshops of various pharmacy. As soon as you enter the tower, you can hear the noise from the top of your head. Fortunately, after the construction of the entire tower, after many times of magic reinforcement, countless magic arrays constantly absorb and weaken the damage suffered by the tower body, so even if someone exerts an ice storm in the laboratory, the downstairs will only hear the dull buzz. Now the roar of the tower is like a drum stick, and it is likely that a group of elemental masters are studying new methods of casting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp god is a blue-like magical creature that can change into the appearance of ordinary human beings. It has good intelligence and can communicate well. And this kind of creation has a keen sense of magic, you can find those bad customers who try to deceive by using spells. They have strong spell resistance and can cast spells to break the simple magic effect. The average person can't be arrogant in front of the lamp god, which also guarantees the safety of the authority tower magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Siegel enters the authority tower, there is a blue smog coming over, trying to wrap the young mage. This is a bad taste of the lamp god, always like to bully new people. Siegel can actually understand the behavior of the lamp god. If he is created, bound to it, and do a repetitive work for life, except for the dead spirit, any other creature will go mad. The god of lights is only because there is no complete soul, and their emotions are more like mechanical transmission structures, so they will not become hysterical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp "God" is nothing more than the creator's boast of his creative ability, an attempt to "go to God". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite sympathy for these poor magical creatures, it does not mean that they are rolled up and thrown out. Siegel gently waved with his left hand, and the magical energy drove a breeze around himself, blowing the blue smoke away. The lamp god immediately felt the level of spell energy possessed by the comer. Although he was only a trainee mage, he was still a member of the federation. It’s okay to make a joke. If you continue to slap it, you will violate the soul essence of the lamp servant and cause serious harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the blue smoke rolled and gathered in front of Siegel, and then showed a funny face. With a playful but standard pronunciation, he said in a word: "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wand, the wand to help me cast spells." Geer said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, a new mage needs his wand to release a spell that is afraid of people!" The lamp god is constantly twisted in the air, and then a bunch of wands appear in him. Above the head, around Siegel constantly rotates. "Long, short, straight, curved, all are easy to use; lightning, flame, sour, and poisonous are all defeating the enemy. Which hand do you use the wand?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought about it, the right hand still used a machete, so he extended his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Mr. left-handed. Your arms and fingers are so strong, it is very rare. I also saw the dice left by the sword. - Are you sure you are a mage instead of a warrior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel glaring at him, agile shaking his fingers, making use of spells is common Several gestures are flexible and accurate. This shows that he can let the magic energy reach the fingertips smoothly, without any delay, which is the basic requirement for using the magic wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, new mage, what do you want for your wand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Quickly retracted into the sleeves. Because many times I need to use my left hand to use the weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼..." The lamp god looked at Siegel again. Then, he said: "Is still able to quickly find out from the sleeves? How do you like the sneak attacking mage more and more now? It’s really a worldly trend, and people’s hearts are not old." He said this, taking one from the top of his head. A 30-cm-long wooden wand, then said: "Blood wood, blood wood, blood-stained wood, it is better to kill people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Geer took the wand and felt a burning and arrogant power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you cast a spell, it's sharper, faster, sharper!" Light God is a competent salesman, excitedly said: "And very cheap It only costs..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Change one, I don't feel good." Siegel handed the wand back to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut! Picky little devil." The lamp god brought another one and then introduced: "32 cm long, the hardest and heaviest ebony Wood. If you forget to bring a knife, this can also be a guest dagger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel reached out and did not feel anything strange. He casts a omnipotent servant spell, and the magical energy flows smoothly through the wand, without the feeling of stagnation. The wood is very hard, and it is like holding a hard awl in your hand. It is also very textured when you wave it. It is indeed a guest who can be beheaded as a lamp god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
