			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the hotel, Siegel saw that Sir Black’s dark horse was parked in the horse’s circle and leisurely chewed the fodder. When the horse saw the squid, Herod called two times and shook his head to say hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill heard the horse calling, pushed open the window of the room, and waved to say Siegel: "Come up and take a look at what I prepared for you!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel rushed into the house, he opened his mouth in surprise: instead of the original position of the oil lamp, there are now three weapons on the table: A squat, a machete, a long whip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first quickly explored three weapons and then took them one by one. The squat is made from the whole pear wood and is extremely strong. The squid uses oily buffalo tendons, which are easy to maintain and have good toughness. The winder is a spanner wrench that uses the card slot to tighten the chord step by step. This contempt is the military's standard equipment, I don't know how to flow it out, so although it is not new, it is still very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is familiar with the style of the scimitar, as many sailors and pirates like to use it. The blade is very light and can be bitten with your mouth, so you can free your hands for climbing. The curvature of the blade is suitable for both cutting the enemy and cutting the rope. The arc's blade forms a narrow, thin thorn at the tip of the metal that can easily penetrate the enemy's heart and lungs. The center of gravity of the weapon falls in the distance between the palm of the hand and the palm of the hand. It is very unique, so you need to get used to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two things are all expected by Siegel, that is, this whip is somewhat unexpected. The whip is black in shape and is made of strong jute. It is surrounded by a steel barbed ring at every other distance. It looks very awkward. The whip was slightly spread and some metal fragments were tied. This is three meters long with the whip, and it is heavy in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wanted to buy you a lightweight handcuffs, but when I saw this scornful, I changed my mind." Sir Bill said: "This kind of 弩It has more power in combat, and it can be aimed more accurately with both hands. But when your strength grows, you still have to learn to use the longbow. The technology of bow and arrow is able to use the skills of a lifetime."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The technique of the machete is different from the long sword, but you are very skilled with the sickle and don't have to worry about getting started. After using the machete, at least you will be able to work and open the road. Some. You still have to learn, little nephew." Jazz pointed at the last weapon and said: "This whip is found in the weapons store, a rare thing. A mercenary who ordered this thing did not I can come back alive, so this whip is sold out. I tried it. The whip is not light, and it has a ratio to the rope on the boat. I will not use this thing, just give it to your toy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"You deserve it. After all, the gains of this trip go far beyond expectations, and your role is not small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, adults I have to tell you something." Referring to the 'expected income', Siegel suddenly remembered the business, and described in a few words what he saw in the harbor: the battleship, the prince, the morning knight and the bald gang. After listening to Sir Bill, he was speechless and sat quietly thinking in his chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he said: "Don’t worry about the Masters, there are too many battles in the wild, no one has the energy to investigate, and you don’t have to mention this later. Things are fine. Whether as an adventurer or a knight, you must be brave, fair, modest, and cautious, and discipline your martial arts to protect the weak, but also protect yourself. There is nothing wrong with you, no need to worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill paused and continued: "You are still young, just a novice rookie, what are you, what are you worried about? When I am so big with you, I am practicing swords in addition to practicing swords. It’s like my brothers are stronger. I only have this way to go, and you are the same. When an adventurer lives a happy life, it seems to be beautiful, but it’s hard to kill. Don’t kill a thief in the wild, a little bit Don't worry about small things! You are my follower, I am your knight, you have to ask me first to play the dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel More worry, it is finally crossed this hurdle, After fighting well psychologically prepared. Although the work of cutting the ear of the dog's head is disgusting, the impact it brings is definitely not as good as ending a life by hand. Sir Bill looked at the young man and tried to remember what it was like to kill the enemy for the first time. He tried and tried again, and the memory was too vague. After hiding in the fog of heavy time, he couldn’t remember it—it might be that he deliberately forgot that history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of creature is the trolls? Is it so powerful?" Siegel asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a bit tricky, but as long as they don't flock, the problem is not big." Sir Bill said: "You remember, as long as you practice running, you can Less leisurely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the Jazz took out the weapon and went out. As a veteran adventurer, Tiger-Bill has his own way. He knows where to get the latest news and knows which way to protect the interests of mercenaries. After all, not all employers like to pay on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel picked up things, happy like a little bird, he went out to find a gnome, the day before yesterday he saw the grocery store sold in various models. . In addition, there are several grass man targets standing in the back of the duck shop, which is just used to practice shooting. I got these three new babies enough to make Siegel play for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next three days, Sir Bill was always a ghost, and he was rarely seen during the day or night. Siegel found that the jazz had specialized in tidying up his hair and beard, bought a new set of underwear, and was able to smell strange perfumes from him from time to time. Siegel will never be stupid enough to inquire about the whereabouts of the Jazz. He is using the "free and unlimited supply" of Yuya and the grass man to improve the accuracy of shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Siegel heard the sound of "Squid! Squid!" in the grocery store. He heard that it was a jazz and he rushed. Run back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a good chance to fight for it." The jazz was very excited and patted Siegel’s shoulder: "Small nephew, did not attend the royal banquet Well, you are blessed, follow me for this jazz long experience. Come, put on these clothes and see if they don't fit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel scratching his head I am somewhat uncomfortable with this sudden enthusiasm. It seems that every time the chief officer is ready to make fun of him, it is almost the same state. He looked at the cloth bag that the jazz had brought back, which contained a lot of finely crafted clothes, from trousers to shirts and jackets, and there were several styles. These clothes are made of thin fabrics that don't look strong at all. They can be torn and ripped by hand, but each piece is decorated with beautiful lace edges, and the buttons are also custom crafts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you wear these clothes?" Siegel picked up an almost translucent shirt and didn't dare to make more effort. "Can you go out wearing clothes? I think the wind can tear them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are not canvases, clumsy. And this is not for you outside. Wear it.” Sir Bill knocked on the head of the squid and said, “The evening banquet is held indoors. Don’t worry about the wind. You participate as my followers. After you go, concentrate on eating, don’t make trouble. Right. Go and find a hat to wear, your black hair is too rare, or low-key."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill has seen the squid holding these clothes for a while. It’s so funny. These near-transparent clothes are not the so-called upper-level people's daily dresses, but more like a special-purpose "collection". Even the characteristics that are broken and broken are also designed in a targeted manner. The only good thing about this kind of clothing is that it looks good, and it's cheap...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't eat dinner, it's best not to eat lunch." When Sir Bill left, hey Road: "Wash your face, clean it up, I will come back to you in the evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s late, then don’t worry, Siegel decides Or go to practice archery first, and inquire about some news from the ducklings. The gnomes of good deeds are eloquent, and they are beginning to talk about the etiquette about human banquets. The squid listened for a while and became more and more outrageous. He suddenly realized that the ducks must have not participated in such a banquet. It is estimated that he also heard about it from somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is coming soon, Sir Bill has already been sullen and ready to go. After Siegel hesitated for a long time, he still wore a chain shirt between his shirt and jacket. Without this layer of metal armor, he didn't have a sense of security and always felt awkward than naked. At the same time, he also bought a round leather hat from the 陂 duck and spent 5 copper plates, just to put the black hair under the hat, no one can see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squid took the horse and proceeded to the banquet hall in accordance with the instructions of the jazz. The gathering was held to celebrate the signing of the agreement between the Knox Association and the Chamber of Commerce on the transfer of interest in Ximu Town. It was this name that made Siegel think about it several times. Under the supervision of Prince Andrew and the supervision of the Church of the Morning, the two sides completed the negotiations at an alarming rate. Knox Association can purchase any land in Ximu Town at a price of 3,000 gold coins per mu, with a total area of ​​no more than 50 acres; all required building materials must be purchased from the Chamber of Commerce. On this condition, of the 11 seats in the Ximu Town Council, the Chamber of Commerce had mastered 6 of the 9 seats and handed it over to the Knox Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
