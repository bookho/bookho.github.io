			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people stopped and the elf knights were dismissed. Then the horses ran freely, some went into the woods to play, and some stopped on the grass and ate. The elves took off their helmets, all of them were beautiful faces, and it seems that the word "beautiful" was created specifically for their race. The caravans of the caravans were self-defeating, quietly took out the dry food, opened the water bladder, and gathered themselves aside, as if they were isolated islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can you be disappointed?" said a voice. Siegel looked at the sound, and a figure emerged from the smooth mirrored stone, and then an older elf man came out of the shadow. He wore a plain green robes, with no decoration except the sacred emblem of the elf god on his waist. The elf waved gently, and a star of light flew around the flames and turned into a table of food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other elf nodded and bowed to him. Leah introduced to humans: "This is Salisbury, Salif-Homerien, Starlight God." The priest of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone eats, then rest." He said: "This is really shabby, after all, it is too far from the hometown of the moonlight. If You can go there one day, and we can entertain you with the courtesy of the real elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is already very rich!" Siegel jumped up first. He ran to the table, grabbed the bread and jam on the table, and said, "Jazz adults, adults, look, there is real fruit wine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Who is this young man?" Lia stood beside Bill and asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My new followers." Sir Bill swayed his hand, then squinted his head and replied in the ear of the elf: "It’s a funny little bitch, and understanding. Very high, will become a good boy in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the same as you?" Leah glanced blankly at Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s much better than me." The jazz saw some embarrassment after seeing the elf’s expression and decided to change the subject: "What do you do to the Cloak Avenue?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This question is still asking me to answer you." The Sally priest was speaking. He walked slowly and motioned that Leah and Bill would take a walk with him. Three people walked slowly around the grass in the hills, and the grazing horses consciously gave them space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a recent sinful desire, I foresee a new force here, but the scene is blurred." The priest said: "We came to this land." I heard the news of the trolls. The morning knights cooperated with us and locked in the identity of these trolls. I guess the foresighted evil forces are them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What are these trolls?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know where they came from, the only thing I know is that they have a priest of the murder god. This makes these creatures particularly dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill took a breath. The trolls he had seen on the battlefield, it was the enemy mercenary. This huge, horrible creature with the right weapon armor can often be a key force in determining the battle. The trolls have a strong ability to recover, and the sword can be recovered in a few minutes, and they can also eat flesh and blood, restore physical strength, regenerate the body, and even become stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This creature is mostly mentally retarded and can only rely on instinct to live most of the time. But they will obey the stronger kind and become a warrior with amazing power, which is difficult to deal with. And if you can become a pastor, especially a priest of the murder god, then the power of killing will make them even more powerful. Sir Bill can't imagine how to fight such a horrible combat machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a harbinger that this troll is planning to convene his men. The evil forces are gathering, and their position and purpose are hidden in layers of fog. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no hurry The heroic warrior, the time is not yet." The priest smiled and refused, and then said seriously: "I just hope that this news can be known to humans, so that the townspeople can prepare for prevention. We can not understand why the morning church does not have Strengthen the defense of villages and towns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, I probably understand." The priest said: "So it is the knight lord who is responsible for building the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The castles were never prepared for the general public. . The jazz wants to say it, but he knows it will only make the elf look even worse. It is not that the elves are malicious, but this long-lived creature forms a more harmonious and continuous culture, and the human civilization seems to them to be just getting started, and then full of chaos and contradictions. Human beings have enough ability to learn from various civilized races and try to change them, but in the eyes of the elves, they lack patience and do not master the essence. They are only superficial imitations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, Leah once told me about you. He described you as a human with a sense of honor and embarrassment. I can hardly imagine these two. How quality can appear on a soul at the same time, and only humans can do it.” The priest went on to say: “The Visa of the Hubburg is not friendly to our elves. He forbids more than three elves from his team. The territory appears, and we can only express regret and respect. According to God's guidance, the trolls are now hiding in the viscount's territory and secretly accumulating power. Someone needs to inform him that we met you. I will write a letter. Letter, explain this in detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am willing to help you," said the Jazz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, don't pay attention to my old man now, I will go there to attend their party." After that, he left Bill and Leah. Going alone to the stone table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sits on the floor, happy to eat and drink, he never thought that he could eat such a sumptuous meal on the road - maybe this is the benefit of coming out of adventure Let's go. The food prepared by the elves is very fresh, and the delicious ones cannot be described in words. Whether it is fruits and vegetables or desserts, it becomes the most beautiful enjoyment. Compared to the sternness of the driver's exquisite faces and elegant gestures, the free and easy Siegel is more popular with the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people with black hair, tell your story," said an elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Siegel talked about his life, especially describing his life at sea. I don't know why, those hard work and terrible hardships have become exciting stories on this occasion, and those happy times and pleasant feelings are more concise and sublimated. In short, Siegel is full of happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salif the priest did his side and listened carefully to the story of Siegel. Young people are not on the scene. He treats everyone as the same audience and sings the songs of seafarers. Coincidentally, one of the elf knights used to be the gaze of the elf ship. He heard the song and sang it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf’s voice is beautiful and twirling, and Siegel’s voice is stunned, and the two sing together sing a different style. After the song was finished, everyone was applauding. Siegel was embarrassed to scratch his head at this time, but he was very proud of his ability to show off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, child, your voice comes from the depths of your heart, with the resonance of the soul. You will be a great person." The priest said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will be a good knight?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This I can't answer, after all, the Cavaliers are just a road, a kind of life. You should know that power comes from the soul, from the inner belief in faith. As a Starlight priest, we pay more attention to the goals and conditions of the elves themselves, not to the fate of humans or other creatures in the world. But I feel the same happiness and self-confidence as the elves from your songs, so I will say more. Two sentences. Or I said too much, or this is actually a fateful arrangement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...I didn't understand." Siegel Said directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell you a secret, funny child." Sally said with a smile: "In fact, I don't quite understand this kind of prophecy." The gods acted with their mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the meeting, everyone ate for a while, and the sleepiness came up, and they went to sleep. On this blessed meadow, peace and tranquility, the earth is warm and soft, the breeze caress, and everyone quickly enters the dreamland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Siegel woke up refreshingly and found that the elves had left, leaving only the Liya who knew Mr. Bill. The elf is still there. She is standing between the jazz and the accountant, and the two men seem to be arguing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you say that I am doing something unruly?” The accounting effort made himself look righteous: “I will give you the cost of the guard, relieve your responsibility and obligations, and you are free to pick up other tasks. What is this? "No?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why do you want to change the route and transport the truck north to the direction of 'Xinlin'? What benefit did the elf give you last night? Let you do this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea’s face, she knows the story: the elf knight found the rare soil in the bag the night before, so the priest hopes to Buy these goods. After a little thought, the accountant proposed a safe hiding point and a high price of 5,000 gold coins. The elves agreed, so the trucks went to Xinlin, where there was an elder's outpost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to regain control of the caravan, McCarter must have to drive away Sir Bill. So he thought of the early termination of the employment contract with the Jazz, so that Bill had no reason to interfere with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is something that happened after you left, and it has nothing to do with you." The accountant said: "Let's split up."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Jeff-Golden Coin of your Chamber of Commerce will be mad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't matter to you or me." "McKate finally said: "Mr. Mercenary, what else do you have? I am going to take the caravan to the new forest of the elves. You will not stop us?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz is angry, but he is not a robber. "Elves, hey!" He sighed for a long time. According to the Knight's honor and code of conduct, in this case he can only find the owner of the goods or the manager of the territory, and only after permission is allowed to arrest the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravan quickly turned to the north, and they were walking in the elves' territory on this road. Security should be guaranteed. There are left Sir Bill, Elf and Siegel, and they continue to head west to the hub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill is thinking about things all the way, everyone is not too anxious, so riding is very slow. Siegel is still being asked to exercise, and the amount of exercise is almost doubled. Leah looked at the young man with great interest and carefully observed his training. Just three days on the road, the elf has already noticed the extraordinary of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your flexibility and growth rate are the best I have ever seen in humans. Only a few elf sword masters can be beautiful when they are young." Lia wants I thought about it, and then I said to Siegel, "Do you want to learn the scimitar technology?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she said, she jumped out of the horse and pulled out the scimitar at the waist. Siegel will be the target, and the wizard's machete martial arts will be displayed. I saw her figure combined with the characteristics of hummingbirds, butterflies and cheetahs, moving with the wind and following the trend. Although there is only one machete, Siegel feels that he is surrounded by a blade, and there are swords and swords everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it was only a few breaths of time, Siegel still felt very long. After the elf received the knife, Siegel picked it up and said, "I want to learn, I want to learn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I actually want you to teach He." Sir Bill also said this: "This little nephew has not yet grown up and is not suitable for my two-handed sword style."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we can't On the road, the wizard can't practice while walking, or go to the hub for a quick time." Leah said: "Have a few days there, I will teach him the basic part."<br /><br />&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Lia asked Siegel to take her horse, and the two shared, which greatly increased the speed of the trip. Leah did not forget to introduce this martial art on the road. She is a ranger, can move freely in the jungle and grassland, has a high affinity between animals, masters a good bow and arrow and scimitar martial arts. These martial arts come from the long-term exploration and improvement of the elves, which combines their comprehensive understanding of natural forces and magical powers, and adapts to the agile but delicate body of the elves. Although Siegel's body is very flexible, it is impossible to really play the power of this martial art like a fairy. Leah's biggest idea is to get young people to get inspiration from this technology and integrate it into their martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must also learn Elvish." Leah said: "Many shackles and moves are passed down in the form of elf poetry and cannot be expressed in human language. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
