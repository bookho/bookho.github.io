"?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be." Evan does not deny it. "The Masters Association secretly built a magic tower opposite the Crystal Wall Channel. I hope that I will preside over the completion ceremony there. The tower named Flame Sigh will bring the end of the Goblin and become the starting point for the occupation of the crystal wall. To a certain extent, just like your starting point fortress.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “To some extent? The starting point fortress has never been the starting point of occupation and invasion, but the starting point for exploration. Siegel shook his head: "Don't say me first. Can the Masters Association guarantee your safety?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most basic, don't worry about it." Although you have not received the invitation, I will take you with you if you want to go. The union will be very important to me, and the school is also, if possible, you will stop the opposition."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this what the people of the school say?" Siegel frowned and looked at Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan long sighed and said: "No, don't need them to say. This is obviously not? You and Lear's opposition, the Federation and the Master Does the opposition of the association have any good influence on the whole kingdom? Every suggestion made by the Masters Association is opposed. Your suggestion, the school city can always find various reasons. The goblin nuclear bomb has been hit. Wang Cheng is coming, the disharmony between the two factions has slowed down the rhythm of the whole kingdom, so it must be terminated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think so?" Geer said: "Also. Let Leer give up the pursuit of the blind man, I can give you peace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We? Siegel, what are you? Meaning, I am not a group with Lear.” Evan said more quickly, obviously anxious: “I have a hundred scorpions, you have twenty scorpions, we are together, aren’t we?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I made a mistake." Siegel said: "I just want to remind you, law. The association is still very dangerous, for you, for me, and even for the whole starry kingdom. Before the goblin weapon enters our world, it has not been clarified. You must be very careful. When the missile is launched, you and me All in the Star Fort, if the magic ship does not discover the trajectory of the missile, we may all die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know this. But the Masters Association also needs I declare a full-scale war against the goblin. They still need my king, not what they do.” Evan obviously has his own ideas, “And I am on your ship, you can definitely ensure my safety, isn’t it? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence sounds no problem. But it would be strange if you delve into it. Evan believes that the Masters Association needs the King, so it is not the Masters Association; Siegel's spacecraft can guarantee his safety, and can put responsibility on the head of the Association, is this suggesting that Siegel did the whole thing, Is it a blame for the Masters Association? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker may be unintentional, but Siegel is not comfortable listening. The king has not officially accused him. What can he say at this time? Explain, counterattack or ignore it? Siegel was silent for a while, and gave way: "Leer... The conflict between Lear and me is concentrated on the blind, and the contradiction between the Masters Association and the Federation is difficult to resolve. The association has seen several deaths and has violated the agreement. The death of the Federation's spell reel. Evan, this thing is very difficult to deal with, are you sure to mediate this matter with the authority of the king?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't I?" Evan reached out and said, "I can give my scorpion to Lear. At least this will ease your relationship. Anything can wait for the goblin. After the dust settles, say now. It is important to focus on the overall situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a step back and could not hide the disappointment on his face. "Wait until the dust settles? You let me down, Evan. Even I know that Lear will not give up, you want to wait until the dust settles. I am not so easy. I will not give any nephew to Lear, even if it is You can't do it either."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that my nephew?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course But I can't watch you make mistakes, I won't let you give it to Lear." Siegel replied. "The scorpion is one with you, and Lear knows it well. If he uses any means to influence the scorpion and affects you, what should he do at that time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I want to say that Lear should make concessions, not me." Siegel slowly shook his head and said: "Besides the Federation asking for assistance to be rejected, I, we have never asked him anything, is He is constantly trying to take away my things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's my thing." Evan smiled bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does he rely on? With his own merits and long hours of work? Is he older?" Siegel snorted, "cannot encourage his greed." Otherwise, this thing will never end. The system of learning the city is good, with professional skills to ensure the level of the lord's ruling territory. But don't forget, you need skills, not greed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but sometimes I know it is right, but I can't do it, or can't do it now. The situation forces me to compromise at some point."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compromise and balance, that is the ability of the ten-faced nephew Turner, not your one-sided scorpion Evan! Siegel shouted in his heart, but suddenly some thoughts came out. The rules of the hundred-faced scorpion are the ultimate, and for Evan it is the ultimate in swordsmanship. In the past, Evan was never afraid of challenges. What kind of ghost is compromise? Even during the period when "double kings coexisted", Evan did not fight because he did not raise interest himself, rather than being subject to situation or difficulty. Even in the face of a hundred waves, he has only one sword in the past, and there will never be any compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it because his character has changed because he has not worn a scorpion for a long time? Siegel had this kind of question, but he did not dare to experiment. If the scorpion is returned to him, the result will be compromised before his character has returned, or the matter has nothing to do with the scorpion, which makes Lear easy to get a hundred face scorpions? Siegel does not want to take the risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers the picture he saw through Aaron’s memory. In the basement of the Star Fort, those complex magical arrays light up the scorpion, releasing its power to some extent. It is difficult to determine whether Lear has mastered the method of igniting the scorpion, but if someone can crack it, the magic of the past is the most likely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Evan were in silence, and neither of them was willing to speak, or even look at them with gaze, and the scene became very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan, I am not just your friend, actually I am your brother." Siegel said: "You...in fact, you should not be Asian." Lun’s brother does not have the pedigree of the starry royal family.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What are you talking about?” Evan frowned and was very puzzled by Siegel’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel told Evan about the story told by Turner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan tried to interrupt Siegel several times, but he resisted it, but when he heard the last one, he suddenly angered and knocked heavily on the table. a bit. "Enough, you actually believe this, this is the propaganda of the Orthodox Church, it is a lie! Don't say this in front of me! I am the king, Evan Star, not Evan Scorpion!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does this have to do with the Orthodox? I just tell you the truth, I am your brother, I will only help you, will not hurt you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember, you asked me to find a scorpion at the time, not yours, I don’t know the existence of the scorpion." Evan put his hands on the table, 瞪Siegel said: "When there is no scorpion, I have nothing bad. Good health, normal thinking, and rapid progress in the sword. What did the scorpion help me? I have a relationship with the throne and it has nothing to do with it. Now I have no scorpion around me. Isn't it also good? All things are slowly calculated. The only trouble is that you and Lear are two people, because of the dispute that this scorpion happened! You said that this hundred scorpions are mine, then I give my freedom. Now I want you to return the dice to me, this farce is over. The kingdom needs to be united and unanimous, and the peace can only be achieved after the elimination of the goblin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the palm of Evan’s hand, Siegel’s mixed feelings, he already knows I hired myself somewhere. The propaganda materials of the Orthodox Church must be mixed with the saying that Evan is not the blood of the royal family. Lear is likely to use the name of "smart spirits of intelligent magic goods", "swearing people" or "non-blooded people" to smear Evan. Some of these things seem to be scornful, and Evan will not be in the heart. But if Siegel mentions brotherhood in front of Evan and uses the scorpion as an example, these words will become daggers and stab the heart of Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Sir Bill was in the Orthodox Church, and Evan looked at Siegel’s sentiments and forgave him with the privileges of the king. Now, from the Siegel mouth, I heard something that only the core members of the Orthodox Church know, how can we not cause Evan’s suspicion again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
