To learn all the things, the twenty-faced scorpion will pave the way for you, because it represents diversity and possibility, and is the foundation of all forces." Turner simply sat down, across Stonehenge and Siegel. Speak: "I don't know why this power will be associated with the number of twenty. Maybe there are more advanced forces and rules in management and constraints. Every brother I will be happy for him, as long as he Be able to be born and grow freely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Green Dragon said that you are trying to steal twenty and twelve faces and let us out of God. Control?” Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the last thing, but I will tell you." Turner grabbed a handful of sand from the ground and watched them slowly from the fingers. slip. "The gods are greedy, even though they have different ways of acting and style, but greed is common. In order to satisfy their greed, the god can even give up everything and bet on everything. The god of magic and knowledge wants to understand that I set it down. The equilibrium net has broken my strategy. At that time, I have set up a lot of traps. He understands that he can't break the agreement between the gods, otherwise it will eternally dissipate in the multiverse world. The god of magic and knowledge has been carried out. Deep thinking, found a loophole, and then gave up the godhead and divine power, approached us as a mortal, trying to find out the secret of the blind. The hundred-faced blind man was taken away by him at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was the balance agreement that I had set before that other gods could not stop and could only watch the incident happen. I knew that he would come again. The magic god is becoming a mortal Before, use your own power to cast spells over the world to make sure you can use prophecy to locate any item. I can't let that happen, so I found one. Yes, we will use the new balance to eat the world next door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world is so ruined?" Siegel shook his head and said: "You Do you know how many people have died there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner waved backwards and said carelessly: "I don't need to take care of them! Just a few of us Ok, everyone else is dead and how! This plan can be smoother, but the magical god who became a mortal discovered this through prophetic surgery. He set up many problems, which made it impossible to perform the original plan perfectly. At the same time, another crystal wall began to counterattack. They...they killed the octagonal scorpion holder Chiola, causing the cracks in the process of the rule to be merged. Those who have not been absorbed by the storm wall That's how it is - you know, normal world destruction can't keep so many ghosts, let alone possession and possession of all kinds of thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I heard this. Siegel has done most of the things in tandem, and understands why the lingering shadows of this world are smarter and more difficult than the lingering shadows collected by the Nass. The wall of the storm is used to assimilate and eliminate the rules. If it can't completely clear a certain rule, it will cause various "mutations". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you know the writer - the name I gave to the ruined Walled Aborigines - they made a ring that can locate other scorpions ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the Eight Faces! Have you found it?" Turner suddenly became very excited. Jumping from the ground and rushing toward Siegel. But when he approached Stonehenge, a huge force bounced him back and then pressed to the ground. Siegel wants to help, but is still being bounced off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner’s face is on the floor, his mouth full of sand. He waved his hand, squirting dust and stones, and shouted: "I have done it, I will not go out! Don't go out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the voice fell Putting on his strength, he let go of him. Turner put his hands up and re-sit. He also does not care about the newly contaminated dust on his face. Instead, he eagerly asked Siegel: "Have you found a ring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, so the eight-faced scorpion will be found, everyone has found it." Turner suddenly laughed, from the low laughter to the heavens. laughing out loud. His laughter did not stop, and he had been echoing in the valley for more than five minutes, and was eventually replaced by a burst of weeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His emotions are always so ups and downs, which is most likely caused by long-term imprisonment. Siegel thought he was very pitiful and said: "Do you know how to release you? Who is this Stonehenge? Who designed it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"I will definitely think of a way." Siegel said: "I will let you out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you know what to put out, The consequences, I am afraid it will not be so confident." Turner licked his lips. With a weird smile with some evil spirits: "As long as I leave here, the power to maintain the balance of the storm wall will be broken, everything will be destroyed. I know that you are anxious, twenty faces, but not yet They will die, but not today. Not now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They? Who are they, do you mean those gods?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner’s eyes widened, a natural expression: “This is still to say! We are born, we grow, we want to be free. If you want to be truly free, you need to The guys of our strength are all packed up! Let them go to the world to die together, let the devastating storm turn them into nothingness, and at the same time wipe out the traces of our departure. Twenty, I know that you are a mage, you will definitely be in place now. Go through the spell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. You now find the ones with the scorpion, and the holders of the twelve scorpions, and then you take them out of here. I need to send a signal to me before I leave, and then you are free. I will do the finishing touches, there will be nothing that can follow your footsteps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you want to ruin the world? Kill the two continents and all the creatures above?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mainly those gods who know our existence, They must die, others are nothing but collateral damage. The world has long since been destroyed, I have been supporting it, not letting the walls of the storm close. They have lived for a long time and should be content!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't agree, I can't accept it." Siegel shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You won't kill anyone?" Turner snorted and seemed to be somewhat incomprehensible: "For those who want to imprison us, study us, and finally What are you still hesitating to kill our guys. Are they damned, and it is not natural for them to face their original dooms?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... ..." Siegel hesitated, then said: "I mean those innocent people, they are alive, and have not come to provoke us. Should they die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "They damn it eight hundred years ago!" Turner stood up excitedly, pacing back and forth, waving his arm: "I blocked the wall of the storm, I saved the world, everyone should thank Me. But what do you see later? The gods in various names, research, discussion, investigation, learning...the means are different, but the motives and purposes are the same, greed and selfishness! Those innocent you said People who live well, they send faith and spirit to the gods all day long. Quantity, help is abuse! No one is a good thing! They are jealous, accomplice, shouldn’t they kill? Shouldn’t you die?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They are unintentional... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not stupid!" Turner screamed, and the entire Stonehenge and nearby grounds were shaking. "Why do you want to talk to them, they are them, let's be we! Have you seen the second black-haired and dark-eyed person? There are only a few of us in the world, only we are living together! The eight sides are made into rings; When I was born, I was swallowed by the wall of the storm; I sacrificed myself on all sides and became the four obsidian daggers and crucified the New World. Now we have four of them! If you have the heart, bring them together, others What do you want to do with life and death! They have their own gods. If they want to live, they will ask God! If the gods really care about the life and death of this world and their followers, they should come to me eight hundred years ago. It’s not to imprison me!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything started from that time, starting with the gods who want to take away ten scorpions. For God, the scorpion belongs to the alien artifact, and the power of the creation god level does not belong in this world, so whoever gets it is who. They have long been accustomed to this kind of thinking, and they didn't feel that something was wrong. It is like human beings seeing the ants on the ground carrying food, dig a small pit on the ground and create obstacles for the ants. The person who digs the pit will not think about the ant, and God is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time only ants have their own special abilities, which make people check and balance and survive. But the most basic survival is obviously not the pursuit of ants. If it is threatened, it must solve the threat, otherwise it will not be able to live with confidence. Therefore, the ants decided to eat the beams of the human settlements, let the houses collapse, and kill the people. As for who else is in the house during this process, whether there are children, cats and dogs, etc., are killed together, and they are not considered by the ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
