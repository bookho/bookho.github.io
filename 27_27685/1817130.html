			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think of magic as a means of changing the world like planting, commerce, murder, art, etc., you can create magical priesthood, then use long swords. In theory, it can also support the gods, which is the so-called sword god. But the conditions it needs are very demanding. After all, there are so many weapons that can be used, so why must it be limited to the sword. In most cases, the production of the god of war will be more common, and will absorb the power of the beliefs of those who fight with the sword, thus hindering the generation of the sword god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that after the God of War leaves, he will be able to stand out from the sword and be ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your fire is urging by the power of several saints, and the belief of the inhabitants of the kingdom of the stars is very complicated. This power is very Difficult to control, I suspect that you are not clear now, or can not completely think independently." Siegel said: "I suggest you not to use such power, calm down. At any level of power can carry out the sword game, no It is necessary to stand on the edge of the cliff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, I feel good, things you said will not appear on me." Evan Hand over the broken magic sword, the fire can not burn the rune on it. "It's a good sword. I saw the entire royal collection, and only this sword may hurt the body of the saint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can And you are lowering to the mortal level, continue this battle." Siegel can clearly feel that the fire of Avon is constantly swaying and will be extinguished at any time. Such a fire is the most dangerous, and it can do many crazy things in order to survive. Siegel knows that his fire will rebel every time he drops, trying to influence his thinking. But if the fire disappears, I am afraid that the strength of struggle will be even greater! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s good. Can’t go all out to call it a real fight? Unfortunately, my swordsmanship doesn’t reach one hundred, otherwise you can show it. To the real peak of swordsmanship.” Evan sighed and said: “But I have a feeling that when the fire is enhanced, I can complete the achievement of the peak!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you crazy, open the war at this time? Your kingdom will not be, the world of the wall will be dragged!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, I only need a little fire. Anyway, the world will soon believe in you. You will be able to add it back soon. What is the loss?" Evan said: "You can save the world, those fires are you." Deserved. I only need one point to ensure the stability of my fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So when all the dust settles, how do I divide your fire?" In order to control the priesthood, Siegel has already reduced the fire to the lowest. Once again, it means the disappearance of the priesthood. Whether it is magic or knowledge, it is indispensable in saving the world of the thunder wall, so Siegel will never further dilute its power at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you worried about the time? Can rest assured, it only takes a few minutes." Evan pointed the sword to Siegel, confidently: "Let you see what the swordsmanship of ninety-nine is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waited for him to start showing, and immediately used the spell to stop the time. He didn't want to fight this anymore. Evan now has no brains at all, and the greed for the fire has made him lose his normal heart. It is also this point, Evanda can not reach the peak of swordsmanship. Is the sword technique that can only be played with the fire of God a real sword? That is obviously a magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel is ready to cast spells and temporarily ban Avon. As for the venue, it is enough to use a spell to create a scorpion, or to use a parade to control the cloning of a cloning. When the world of the thunder wall was saved, Siegel came back to release him and slowly solved the problem of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Evan’s eyes to be bright when time lags, his sword is still waving, and the speed is getting faster. Although it seems to be very laborious, Evan does adapt to Siegel's change of time. The spell of the seal was launched in Evan, and he was opened by a sword! However, in this moment, Siegel saw the collision of the rule seeds, and the rules attached to the broken sword strengthened the function of the annihilation element, so it caused such a strong suppression of the spell. The good news is that this swordsmanship is still under certain rules of the crystal wall. The bad news is that Sigel can't immediately find out its weaknesses in a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword seems to be unremarkable, but it has become its own rules, even forming a rule field in a certain area, it has become Not good. Siegel pulled two steps in a row and opened the distance according to the wizard's habits, but Evan's movements were as fast as they were, and several flashes were chased up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple sword can be used by Evan to such an extent that it is amazing enough. Siegel knows that his swordsmanship is not an opponent of Evan, and he will soon find a flaw. So the only way is to make him busy, even if there are flaws can not catch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-in-one arrow of the elemental aggregate has a limited effect when it is close to the body, even if Siegel does not dare to stick his finger in the sword, how to Use four-pulse arrows? However, there is another use of the polymer, which is to form a "toucher" behind it. The four elements and positive and negative energy, as well as the nine tentacles representing time, space and divine power, continually attacked Evan as a Hydra. Although all the attacks were blocked by the impenetrable swordsmanship, Evan couldn't help but grab the flaws of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan, the last warning, if you continue this way, I can't control the situation!" Siegel has touched in several encounters. When the sword rules are seeded, the learning ability of the twentieth scorpion is working, even if it takes up a number. Evan's swordsmanship is endless and powerful, but Siegel continues to learn and comprehend in this process. Although not as perfect as Evan, with the help of the squid's nine tentacles, he began to grasp the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what you forced me." Evan said abruptly, and then his body shrank and suddenly disappeared from Siegel's perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Evan appeared behind Siegel and still kept the sword up. Siegel’s body was smashed, with a slanting wound from the waist to the opposite shoulder. The three tentacles also broke down with the sniper and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four forked gods swayed for a while, turning into only three forks. Evan used his strongest sword to take some of the fire from Siegel. It is by relying on such swordsmanship that he has wounded the bodies of three gods through three saints, each collecting some divine power. Now he has re-applied his skills and taken some power from the body of the magic god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the power of the gods, the wounds of the body heal immediately, but the state of Siegel is very bad. The fire of the fire of the gods began to hang their own dying struggle. The first problem was more than 10,000 secondary brains. They all felt the sense of crisis in life and death, so they began to send help signals to Siegel's ontology, seriously affecting Siegel's thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, all the magic on the entire continent began to confuse, the portal system failed at first, and began to bring some messy things to the world of the wall. The city of Mith, where the Temple of Magic is located, is the most stable, but the farther it is, the worse it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel weakened the consumption of transmission, so a large part of the portal became the door to the outside world. The creatures from the outer domain broke into the thunder wall world. Their strengths are strong and weak. The weaker ones, such as the ordinary guards, have enough power to deal with the bad devils. But as an ordinary citizen, foreign creatures are difficult for them to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several areas of bad luck that were discovered by powerful foreign creatures, which led to disastrous results, until the strongest players at the ** division level were forced to Suppress it. The areas connected to the inner boundary are saved even with the rescue. After all, no one can fight against endless elements or positive and negative energy attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel strives to gain control, but he knows that the only way is to regain the fire, stabilize it immediately, and complete the integration as soon as possible. He gave orders to the deputy brain to let them "close their mouths and serve," and on the other hand clenched the dust of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan unplugged the fire from the blade and tried to absorb it in the palm of his hand, but the fire that belongs to the magical priest is not willing to enter a person without magic ability. So I am constantly resisting. Siegel raised his hand and used his power to pull back the fire and ordered him to return to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the kingdom of God is unfolding from his feet, even if this will continue to consume divine power. Evan's swordsmanship can form a regular field, but there is still a gap from the kingdom of God. After being shrouded, he can only stick to himself, and can no longer control the fire to prevent it from leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the hand flew away, and Evan was mad: "It seems that only defeating you completely can sublimate my sword!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The so-called complete defeat is killing me?" Siegel absorbed the fire back, finally spent the most dangerous moment. "Avon, Evan, I realized that you are too far away from Biaren. Not about your strength and means of governance, but your temperament! You can afford it but can't let it go. How can people who don't know how to get it? Victory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
