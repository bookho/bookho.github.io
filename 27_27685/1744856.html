			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel improved the elemental grammar for the dragon, others were busy. By preparing the wedding of the lord, Fitzak established relationships with many merchants in the South and continued to pass the message to Janet. At the same time, he finally trained some of the homing pigeons and prepared to establish communication links with Sham Shui Po, Moura's Donkey, Ximu Town and Hubburg. To do this, he needs to hire a credible servant to take care of these pigeons, both to be able to write, to be good at finding problems, and to be loyal enough. In short, this will cost a lot of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The production of the Zeeshan Gold Mine is sufficient to meet the cost of the territory, but there is not much left. When the castle is established and everything is on track, the power of the gold mine will be revealed. Zucker settled in the gold mine with the villagers in the village, and they have now adapted to the life of the miners. This kind of life is simple and straightforward, and Siegel is not afraid to give them higher rewards. They can buy what they need from a businessman, or go to a pub in the city of Mith. The Orcs became the first settled inhabitants - of course, except for some of the guys who still struggled to fight and wanted to join the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana’s responsible patrol has already begun the field’s guard work, and at least the boys’ riding is enough to run. Heim is not a big place, and the cavalry can turn all the villages around for a long time. In addition to killing a small wolf, the patrol has no other record. Because of her relative leisure, Mana is now taking time to train more new recruits, especially to teach them the skills of archery. At the request of Siegel, Moore also began to learn basic swordsmanship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet has the most things, and when the Lord focuses on magic, she needs to support the entire territory of the big and small things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation in the South is very calm." Janet said when she said to Siegel, "The Uther family has not had any movements, even the wedding. As usual, it seems that no one is dead. But I investigated it and found that they are hoarding food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it going to fight?" Geer looked up and looked at the kitten's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is this possibility." Janet said: "They may not wait for the construction of the city of Mith. But I can't determine the number of troops and their offense. Time, unless I investigate it myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, that is completely unnecessary." Siegel said: "I have a way to ensure their offensive time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet will bring a pretty face. Curiously asked: "How are you sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will send the wedding invitation to them, it will be fine."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to this issue, Janet will be nervous, sometimes shy to find reasons to leave. Sometimes the topic will be opened. But she already wanted to understand the relationship between the wedding and the war, knowing that Siegel was preparing to protect her. In this regard, Janet did not know what to say, just prayed to the Mother of the Earth, hoping that Siegel would win forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wedding time is advanced again. The invitation has been sent out, but there is not even a Southern lord who wrote a letter in addition to the gift from the Hugel family. Siegel has understood that the war will come to this nascent territory, but I don't know what the reason will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of how the war started, Siegel knew how it would end. After determining the wedding date, he concentrated on making magic scrolls to prepare for the rest. Few wizards participate in the war between the lords, on the one hand to avoid excessive attention from the power of the temple, and on the other hand because the harvest is not proportional to the cost. Hiring a mage is a high cost in itself, and the cost of paying for the magic items they use in the war can easily lead the bankrupt. Only a big lord like Earl of Todd is likely to ask the Master to help. It is only the king who really knows what role the caster can play in the war. Like the southern Uther family, their family history has not participated in wars of sufficient scale, and lacks understanding of the Master's means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this situation will soon be "improved." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a four-story tower in Mire City on the drawing, consisting of a castle of two hundred meters square and a courtyard of three hundred meters wide. The first floor of the castle is ten meters high and is two meters taller than the surrounding walls, connected by narrow passages. The dwarves used a lot of runes on the outer wall to make it extremely strong. Whether it is siege equipment or ice fire energy, it is very difficult to cause real damage here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first floor of the city of Mith was not completely completed. The interior kitchen, showroom, servants and guards were not yet capped. Only the hall and the staircase leading to the second floor were available. Siegel’s bedroom and study are on the second floor, and there is also a platform that can be used as a gateway to the magic tower in the future. But the Magic Tower still stays in the Master's vision, and he doesn't have enough knowledge to make architectural-level magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Siegel said. Although the castle is still a prototype, it is already possible to hold a wedding. Fitzk has been secretly preparing in the spring, hoarding a lot of materials that can be used for celebrations. The original plan was to be held in the winter, when Siegel and Janet met for the first anniversary. It’s just early summer, and time is too hasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Siegel has repeatedly asked for it to be held as soon as possible, and Fazak is only the result of the fact that young people can’t stand it. According to the custom of the mainland, the wedding needs to be presided over by the elders of both sides, or under the witness of the pastor. Siegel is an orphan. The only one who can be called his elder is Sir Bill, and he is far from the old continent, surrounded by a vast ocean. Elint looked at Siegel like an elder, but he was a dwarf and was not suitable to preside over the ceremony. There were no elders in Janet, so Fazak had to ask the two about the invitation to the pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go and ask Janet." Siegel said: "I have a special situation. No gods will correspond to my prayers, and I am still a mage, so this It doesn't matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet hopes to have the priest of Mother Earth to bless them, so that the marriage will be more solid and firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting from the order of the lord, it took only a week to prepare for the wedding. Residents of the Territory became witnesses to this wedding, and they also enjoyed a large enough meal. It includes a variety of meats, vegetables and wines. This day will be a holiday for Heim, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wedding preparation is very hasty, and the unfinished City of Mith is not the perfect place to hold a wedding. Elinette was stunned by the things of Mora, but his son came to congratulate. He is a warrior with superb martial arts. Siegel once played with him in martial arts training, knowing that he could not achieve absolute victory, so he prepared to put him down with mellow wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elegant Lia, Giant Kerry is too far from Heim, and can’t be reached anyway before the wedding. So Siegel wrote a long letter of apology for them, explaining the cause and effect of the choice of marriage. They are invited to visit the city of Miele in the winter. Because the castle was built at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim has no pastor, so the final ceremony is Fitzak, at least his age is enough for this role. The ceremony was very simple, and Siegel and Janet were announced to be husband and wife after they exchanged their tokens. The inhabitants of the territory witnessed the wedding of the lord, but expressed concern about the marriage that did not have both parents and no witness to the gods. They are worried that this marriage is not blessed and may not last long. But on the wedding day, no one will tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the ceremony, the city of Myrtle was in a carnival, and all the people who came to congratulate were well received. Siegel also spent money from the Mola to the circus team, they shuttled between the tables. Performing entertainment such as fire-breathing, tossing, and stilts. A small band of five people played on the side of the table, and the songs were mostly songs of joy and harmony. The residents of Heim’s collar rarely see such performances, they only think that they will be very happy today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the outer courtyard of the city of Myrtle, the table and the drunkards are everywhere, and Mana and Zucker are holding the guards to maintain order. With the joint efforts of both, the half-orcs on the alcohol will be taken away and go to "somewhere that will not hurt people" to sober up. These heavily armed fighters shuttled through the maze of food and joy, noticing that many eyes were watching them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, how many southern spies do you say outside?" Janet replaced her long skirt and changed into a very close-fitting short coat. . Looking down from the narrow window of the Mire City Tower. Siegel replaced the breastplate with the help of Moore and threw the dress for the ceremony. In a moment he will appear in front of the crowd wearing this new armor, in order to show more of his knight lord's identity, to cover up the part belonging to the wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid a lot." Siegel let Moore tighten the belt on his waist. So that the clothes fit better. "The outsiders who are not drunk and rarely talk to each other are mostly spies. They have been dressed as merchants for several days and have looked at the entire Heim collar."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
