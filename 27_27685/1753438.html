			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been nearly two months since I left Heim’s collar. Once again, I saw the familiar city of Mire, and Siegel’s feeling of returning home for a long time. . This feeling is produced every time he sets foot on the deck of the Lucky Sos, but it has never been as clear and moving as it is today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the South, the snow here will melt soon after it falls, and only the ice will appear on the ground sooner or later. Near the mine, a lot of slag and gravel are used to lay the road, so this section from the ore boulevard to the city of Mier will never look muddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people walked because Siegel had to observe the fortress under construction. The ore boulevard was cut off from it, and the stretched walls wrapped the sacred peaks and the striated mountains and then spread to the outer walls of the castle. Every 100 meters, there is a protruding arrow tower with space for the archers and spearmen to rest and hide. However, this is the appearance, in order to conceal the real purpose of Siegel: in the tower, he asked the dwarf rune master to secretly create a rune that protects the evil, and prepared a magical enchantment for dispelling and suppressing the dead spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then these towers are connected and can work together with the elemental absorption matrix of the City of Mystery to form a defensive whole. On the side of the city wall, Siegel is digging west and north through the cover of the striped mountain mine, with the intention to connect with the southern sentry post of Mora. This is a secret passage, whether it is to deliver supplies or to mobilize reinforcements, or even to make a way to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big project, and the cost required to directly drain the output of the gold mine. After the castle was built, Janet did not even add any furniture, and the dwarf runes became the only decoration in the building. Silver cutlery, brass candlesticks, silky velvet curtains and soft cotton quilts that are common in southern lords are not seen in the city of Mith. However, there are many furs from the northern grasslands. They are used as carpets and tapestries. The giant Kerry also sent the entire bear skin, which was laid under the main seat of the Lord's Chamber of Deputies, showing a different style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of such a cost is very obvious, the construction progress of the "Arrow Tower" and the city wall is much higher than usual. Many masons and construction workers under the rule of the South came to Heim's collar when they were on a winter break. Earn some silver coins here. Although there are complaints about other lords, there is nothing to be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet issued a letter to the lords of the South in the name of Lord Siegel, again saying that the cutting of the walls of the Ore Avenue would not prohibit the caravans from accompanying them, nor would they Additional city gate tax is imposed. The attack on the Striped Mountain Gold Mine forced Heim to make such a defense. This is the right that the lord exercises in order to protect his own interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, the Uther family led by Hero was the target of the public, and their failure in the battle affected the status of their leader. Although no other lords really want to challenge, the rumors of war began to pass between the southern lords, and some small frictions on the border line appeared from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone has the ability to see the signs of things. It will be found that many rumors actually come from Heim's Colle. Through various channels, Fitzk and Janet helped merchants, troubadours and unemployed travellers help release smoke bombs. They attracted everyone's attention to the Uther family so that their territory could develop undisturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Siegel does not allow any racial discriminatory decrees to allow all races to settle here equally. But he also made a strict order that no racial customs and habits would override the lord's judicial and law enforcement powers, which would ban lynching and clan jurisdiction. This makes some old-fashioned and traditional races uncomfortable, but there are more residents who are attracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigger’s mage status and the army led by Mana and Zuck are powerful guarantees for the realization of this decree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire territory is mixed, the proportion of human residents is less than half, and the half-orcs become the second largest race. Then there is the gnome. Some of the dwarves of Mora came here to practice the elements of their rune while practicing the elements of the Rune Guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rhett came to Heim’s collar, although the tall golem caught the attention, many people put down the work at hand to watch him, but there was no What rude things happen. From the outside, the clay figurine Ryder is much more refined than the earth element rune guards, but most people can't distinguish their essential differences. Coupled with the Lord of the Lord, they are speculating that this is a new type of soil element worker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder feels relieved a lot, he tries to greet the people around him. You can also get a warm response. Siegel took him to the city of Mire, where an open space was reserved for the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, someone wants to build a house by themselves." Rhett replied: "All hope is growing and creating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees the golem . Some don't worry about it: "Do you know how to use money and exchange goods with each other?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone is not stupid." The laughter then reached out and held it with Siegel. "Someone likes this place very much, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at the magic image and measures the open space left to him step by step, then squats and examines it carefully. The soil, use your fingers to pick up the pebbles inside. I started working on the ground. The mage thought for a moment and felt that it was more appropriate for Reid to adapt to the new environment and to deal with the people around him. Excessive interference can only kill the characteristics of the priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took Leah through the gates of the castle and into the courtyard of the city of Mith. The first step of Moore informed the people in the castle of the return of the lord, so Janet had already waited in the yard. Her lower abdomen has been slightly raised, wearing relatively loose clothes, looking at her husband with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind her, Capricorn licked a "lollipop" in his mouth and was looking around curiously. After the two pupils of different colors have been examined every corner around them, they can look at the front with confidence. Siegel frowned and hurriedly picked up Janet's hand and asked, "Nothing happened recently? Why is Capricorn so nervous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jenette snorted, then took the dragon girl’s hand and said, “Everything is fine here, but Capricorn’s sister is worried about the children in my stomach, so she is always alert to the situation around her.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister?" Siegel made two screams from his nostrils: "The Capricorn looks young, but at least..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet secretly squeezed Siegel’s hand and interrupted him: “I am Leah’s master behind you? Moore just told me, so you The room will not be ready until later. But please come to the meal first. We have prepared the meal according to the elves' habits. I don't know if it suits you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Everything is simple," said Leah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel holds Janet’s hand tightly. Take her into the castle. The five fireplaces in the hall are burning, and the warm flames bring a hint of spring. The three servants are busy, bringing the food prepared in the kitchen to the table. Although the plates used to hold things are just ordinary ceramics, every food is carefully prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now the belly is getting bigger. Is there any feeling of discomfort?" Siegel took Janet to the chair, laid the cushion for her, and then Sit down: "I have already found a pastor who can help you treat the disease and nurse your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you left, Heim brought An elf priest named Albert Allen, the mother of the land. After I and Fezak's retention, he has decided to stay. I originally wanted to build a small temple for him, but he was He refused. He said that he would use his feet to measure the kindness of Mother Earth, instead of staying under the ceiling and become a living statue. He often blessed the village below, but returned to the city of Mire every day. I am for him. A room was arranged at the station."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is good," Siegel said. It seems that the priest of the Mother Earth is not the kind of person who likes to compete for the believers, but closer to the practice of practice and down-to-earth work. This is a good thing for Heim, and should find time to meet him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The things in the Territory are hard for you." Siegel said: "After I come back, you can safely raise your baby."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves Liya also nodded and said: "This is the first child, the body is still not suitable. So be sure to recuperate. It will be easier to have more than a few times in the future."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have a lot of eggs at a time, can you save a lot of effort?" Capricorn pouted and said, "Humans are really troublesome."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet is flushed, and Leah seems a bit embarrassed. Siegel suddenly noticed that there was only one man sitting in the lobby of the lord, and it was really inappropriate to discuss the problem of having children. So he hurriedly opened the subject and asked, "Where did Fyzak go? What are they doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
