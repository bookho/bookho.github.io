			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel believes that Mike and Mana will arrange the defense, so I went to Fazak first. After the return of Siegel, the old man said: "Now I am relieved," and then I woke up, so nothing was explained. Now when Siegel was looking for him, he just woke up and finally recovered his mental state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It took only a day to solve the battle. It seems that the song is sung at all." Fitzak smiled and his face was around. Unfolding: "Lord Lord, you don't want to leave the territory for so long, you can't live without you here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to." Siegel helpless Smiled, but still promised. The Southern Allied Forces was stunned by Siegel's quick and precise combination of punches, and with the words of Sir Brown, the advantage was handed over. If Siegel came back two days later, Felton’s catapult began to work, and the wall of the city of Mier was not necessarily long. He told Fazak this idea, but the old man did not agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have more thoughts in the city of Mire than imagined by outsiders. Even if the walls are lost, the residents of the castle can also evacuate along the secret road. Castle There is also the test ground of the Masters Federation, as well as the magical elemental array, and the Capricorn. How can they possibly occupy the city of Mire?" The old man then said: "I don't know anything else, but I know the whole The city has spent nearly 700,000 gold coins, but the building materials supported by the dwarf Elinte are worth more than one million gold coins. Is there such a scale in the castle of such a cost, except for a few kings?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My money is so happy, I can work hard for you." Siegel said: "After this battle, there are still many things. The distribution of spoils, production The restoration, reopening the business road. The Morah’s squad will soon be closed and enter the combat alert state, which will have a great impact on the merchandise on the first line of the Cloak Avenue, and may even change the commercial status of the old and new continents.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still such Feeling?” Fazak licked his beard and thought about it. “There is a price for all the ore, gems and metal products in the New World.” The price of all the ore, gems and metal products in the New World will rise. It is good news for us. And the fortress on the Ore Avenue stands still, and the caravans who participate in the coalition’s territory want to pass it, they should collect the tax.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You remember to let Brown The family provides a list of caravans with whom they have a close relationship. In addition to this, the city’s tax is collected.” Siegel said: “But don’t worry about this, don’t start comparing it in a month or two. Ok. Do you understand what I mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak nodded and immediately said to Siegel: "Now can't lie down, I have to hurry up. Busy, don't let Brown's kid take more. The dead horses will also be used. Now it's still fresh and quickly processed into a meat sausage. The gnome Dingbao recently invented a new thing called canned food. It is said that you can save food for a long time and you can catch up with the Master. "There is a bag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He always has new ideas." Siegel said with a smile: "One-eyed daddy, you have to pay attention to your body, miscellaneous Let's find someone who is young and strong, and you should raise it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, I have already found a few smart people who can write People, I will show you a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the news of the victory of the war. The residents who were hiding in the basement cheered in unison and praised the heroes of the lord. Sure enough, as one-eyed and old-fashioned, many people began to sing the song "One-Day War." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to start celebrating like this, but there is actually something important to do: clean up the bodies on the battlefield. Whether it is cremation or burial, you can't let them expose the wilderness. Not to mention the terrible smell, the threat of the plague is real. Fortunately, there are two pastors in Mire City. Their magic can reduce the chance of plague and prevent undead problems caused by a large number of dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene stood on the wall and looked at the battlefield in front of him. He seemed to be able to hear the sound of various blade strikes. The deafening charge horn, mixed with people's shouts and horses humming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these sounds are not part of this battle, but the history buried deep in his memories. Coming to the New World, I went to the gem clan relatives of Mora. Then step by step to become the second speaker, he is about to forget the battle experience in the old continent. He used to lie to himself, perhaps relive that feeling in his adventures, but now he finds that the real battlefield is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves have their own tactics, but few are willing to improve the tactics. They are too proud and too stubborn, just like the mountains that stand tall, and think that they never need to change. However, the strong mountains will be affected by snow and water, and gradually change into another form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the closure of Mora, I don’t know if Siegel clearly understands the meaning. He is a dwarf, and he can't say many things, even for the brave. He has a vague hunch that the West Dwarf and Siegel are together and can do great things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closes his eyes and prays to the god of the dwarf, hoping that his clan will prosper and hope that his friends will be safe. He looked to the walled mountains and prayed for this great mountain to bless all the dwarves. Between the two, Elinette presented a vague picture in his mind. It seemed that Mora’s cockroach vacated and floated like a cloud. It rose higher and higher, and rose higher, until it left the New World and left the world. The dwarf patron saint has been blessing the mountain until it is introduced into its own kingdom of God and lives with other dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an illusion after all, how can you fly like a huge city wall? Elinette shook her head and thought she was really old. He left the wall and saw a dwarf riding a lizard coming from the north with the flag of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Siegel is in the library, talking to the half-elf Idis. As an exchange condition to support Heim's collar, Siegel must share what he knows about the Knox Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please tell me, is there no Knox magic tower built in Deepwater?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The half-elf shook his head: "The Casper Master has always had this idea, but it has not been approved by the Lion King, and it cannot be carried out. In order to prevent the new magic tower from interfering with the Three Peaks Tower, it is a perfect one who can not refute it. Reasons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic towers they have built have powerful mental effects. Do you know this?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis faced the question but did not answer the question: "The Masters Association was separated from the Masters Association and came to the New World for research. Although there are some academic differences, the two are connected through a transmission array. Actually it is still one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned. I don't know why this matter will be brought to the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knox Commonwealth was not established on the first day, they are also an ancient organization that has a history of nearly a thousand years. But since 500 years ago Trying to be removed by the association through spiritual control and becoming the actual leader of the Masters Association. It was a terrible mage battle that allowed Knox to understand that the mind-controlling spells had fatal flaws. They were unable to win. Since then, They went underground, hid themselves, made a gesture of disappearing, and never looked for trouble until now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"School City is for the King and the Lord The service is actually part of the Masters Association, just like the Masters Association. Most people don't know the connection, only the management mages who participate in the board and the talents they recognize know the secret. Every once in a while, the Masters Association It will split once. Every time, people who are more radical and more active will be sent out. It is to constantly update the concept, ensure development, and absorb dangerous elements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel probably understood the meaning of Idis: "The Masters Federation has long had some precautions against the Knox Association? It was the arrangement of the Masters Association that agreed to absorb its membership. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the risk prevention you mentioned, it is possible to control the possible events within the Master without any external influence. We also need to know Knox. How to re-emerge and improve the mind control spells to such a level. This is not simply a question of right or wrong, but more importantly to inspire other disciplines and enhance the power of spell spells."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nass." Siegel thinks that good and evil, right and wrong are more important than spells, so interrupted the words of Edith: "Naceus wants to collect and make the soul of the soul. And Resentment is a resource. Knox is their thug and vanguard.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis stood up suddenly, then slowly Sit down, his thoughts and gods are outside, and it takes a while to recover. "It doesn't make sense. Our world is still expanding. How many years has it happened in the New World? How can it lead to Nexus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
