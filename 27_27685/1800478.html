			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the suspension of the star, Siegel changed into a form of shackles. Hey, the iridescent radiance of the elemental polymer lingers on his gray-white bones, but the black flame burns in the eyelids. His spells cover the silver line above his head, and the silver line of the star is also invisible. Then he came to the exit hatch of the spacecraft without carrying any weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am attacked, I will return directly to the astral, and you will do the same." Siegel said to the star: "Because you return I have to delay for a while, so during this time you have to do one thing: to destroy the person who attacked me. But the first task is to return to the astral, so if the time is not enough, then forget it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, does the goblin really attack you? Can I destroy them all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War Is the last resort, have you forgotten? And this is all in the plan.” Siegel patted the door and said to Xingsuo: “Open the door.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When the door is open, the spotlights on the outside are all on Siegel. If it is not his squatting state, I am afraid it will squint directly. Is this an attack? Siegel shook his head and expressed disappointment at the extent of the gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a gathering of 3,000 goblins outside, and the stars were carefully counted when they landed. They hold a variety of slogans, some welcome, and some say go. Many goblins are noisy and even fight. Siegel's knife, blood, also smelled the smell of death. He became more convinced of his own inference and then walked down the ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stepped on the ground, although this was not the first time he stepped on the earth's land, he still had to sigh like a model. Use his own complicated and difficult to reverse zenith star language. Siegel said: "This is a small step for me. It is one of the zenith stars..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A white light flashed. A bullet was shot from six hundred meters away. This is a weapon specially designed for long-distance killing, and its stability and lethality are amazing. Siegel's long-range defense shield took effect immediately, but still could not block the bullet. When the gunshots finally came over, Siegel’s half-skull had been shattered, and the soul fire in one of the eyes was extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has long been prepared to have several versions of protection spells against the firearms attack against the goblin. However, for the sake of effect, he did not use a spell, but only the most basic protective long-range weapon. He is acting. Because of his understanding of the goblin, it is very likely that this problem will occur in the first meeting, so it is weak to show the other side in terms of personal protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblin began to stir up, some of the goblin guns that protected the scene aimed at the crowd, and the other part aimed at Siegel. The skull that lacked half of the skull was swaying and barely raised his hand to point in the direction of the attacker. The star cable immediately lifted three electromagnetic guns and began to launch without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the distance is very close, there is no need for multiple transmission acceleration to increase the power, so the star cable can open 30 shots in one second. The goblin with the sniper rifle was directly smashed, and everything in his three-meter range was destroyed. After that, the star rope disappeared out of thin air when the goblin did not understand it. The "Zenian Star Man" who lacked half of his head was also lost in the vision of the goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like a fantasy, only the crater that remained at the 600-meter landing site still tells the truth: The Zenith Star has come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn. Who opened the gun!" Bald Jingjing frequently screamed: "How is the scene done, even this little thing can not do well! Check, Let me find out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researcher went to the video and hoped to find out the truth. However, the goblin that was shot was hidden outside the lens. After the counterattack of the star, the only image left was very vague, only the cloth towel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Find the fragments of the body, you must find out who it is!" The bald goblin is not arrogant: "This is provocation, this is war! Prepare the nuclear warheads." "Get the army ready!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't call, where is the Zenith star going?" The dark brown goblin licked the cigar, his eyes sparkling behind the diffuse smoke Luminous: "Give me the weapons of the top stars, and the videos when they disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, using the power of the Miereng nuclear and energy focusing lenses, Xingsuo also learned to create elemental interference. Lightning ice and flames move randomly around the electromagnetic gun. Even if the goblin has other means of detection, it can only receive unresolvable results. There are still four elements on earth, so Siegel believes that such an approach can be successful. He has done his best with his own knowledge, and believes that Goblin can't figure out how to solve it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation report was quickly placed on the table in front of the goblin giant, the content is very simple, all are "unknown." Only the weapon action mode column reads "The effect of live-fire impact damage, the power is similar to the booster rocket, but it will not explode." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The real impact, the warhead? The warhead!!" Bald goblin picked up the muscles and threw the report on the table: "Why is it unknown? He is not launching." A lot of hair?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researcher rushed to answer: "The witnesses on the scene used metal bullets on the naked eye, but they quickly disappeared without any debris. Leave. This gasification technology has never been seen before, if there is still an opportunity, maybe it can be better analyzed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, Except for a broken body and crater, nothing left?” The dark brown goblin smashed the cigar onto the head of the second-class goblin, and the ash splashed: “Analysis of their hull, analysis of the cockroach "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hull is surrounded by a messy energy field. We analyze the electric field of the electric field, and at the same time, the ice crystals with cooling effect are randomly generated. Although a lot of photos were taken, the perspective line did not penetrate the outer shell of the spacecraft. "The sample."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another researcher said: "The shape of the zenith star is very strange, and there is no organ cockroach that should not have the ability to move. Our The theory is that either it is a very clever robotic technique, or the Zenith star has mastered the energy-enhancing spirit and got rid of the shackles of **."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A thin three-page research report will soon be available but no Goblin giant is satisfied with the report. The female goblin tore the report and shattered it. The thick tongue shouted hard: "What about the countermeasures? How to deal with the Zenith star, how can you not mention a word?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, the zenith star's spaceship is unscathed, and the shackles of half of the head disappeared. I don't think they should have anything." When the silent goblin spoke, the other goblins were silent. "I think they will reappear. So I have to decide what to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblins have an unnamed tacit understanding in their eyes. form. "Don't hide it." The dark brown goblin picked up a new cigar and slammed it on the table as a stick: "Get the strongest equipment, let's come!"<br /><br /> On the other hand, the stars who returned to the astral are indignant and have been talking about the bad words of the goblin: "They will hit you when they come up. It is really bad and can't be broken any more."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hahaha, don't be angry, it's all in my expectation." After consuming a heavy astral projection, Siegel returned to its original state. "You just didn't forget to use illusion occlusion when you countered, and there is no flaw in the method of calling the power of the element. It is worthy of praise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I am really Happy.” Xingsuo immediately forgot the unhappiness and began to pick it up: “In fact, I have already discovered the goblin with the gun, and why didn’t you let me destroy him first?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than one?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, too? I found out a total of seventeen goblins using long guns, ambush from all angles, and the farthest hidden is 900 meters. How did you discover the owner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't use my eyes but thought of it with my brain." Siegel said: "Xingsuo, although you have tough The force, but I hope that you will exercise restraint, it is best to use it only if I agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good master, no problem." I feel that this should be divided, so I promised it. "What do we do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is going to the earth." Siegel said: "I don't expect good results this time." Even more fierce than the last blow. You have to be prepared to be attacked. In fact, even if you are beaten, there is nothing. It is just going back to the astral world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
