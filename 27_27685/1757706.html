			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary retreat of the enemy gave Siegel a time to rest, although Mana and Zuck asked Siegel to take over the command of the army, but the Master shook his head. Did not take it for granted. He needs to be familiar with and master the situation before he can speak, otherwise it will cause confusion on the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days ago, when the alarm clock in the city of Mier was ringing, the entire army and people of Heim heard it. They remember the meaning of the bell, and rushed to the castle to take refuge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenette is holding her big belly and standing on the high platform to announce that as long as there is a strong force to pick up a spear or an axe, they have to help guard the wall, otherwise they will roll Go home and deal with the enemy yourself. She opened the treasure house, dumped the stock, and handed the fine weapons to their hands: a long handle, a dagger, a dagger, a sword, and a mace. Teenagers have a studded leather jacket, and adult men are assigned to protect the body's locks, armor to protect the legs, and helmets that only show their eyes and mouth. When properly equipped, some of them even seem to have a few warriors – especially if they rush from a distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not stand on the wall as a target, that is the job of the Scarecrow!" The archer Knight Mana took over the command and gave training to the "new recruits": "Give me all the time, be careful with the dark arrows and the flow arrows. How many people know how to throw and shoot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides several hunters, some like to be in the bar The person who drew the dart stood up. Mana gave the javelin and other items to them, and let these people lead several teams separately for rotation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet also gives women and children something to do. People who are too young to fight can be responsible for lifting water and caring for the fire, and preparing hot food for the soldiers. Several old women helped the statue of Reid to care for the wounded, and the earth goddess pastor Albert Allen also got several assistants. Both pastors are lone rangers and have no experience in leading assistants. Soon, these women just did some work of dismantling and washing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak has a lot of assistants who can help look after the warehouse, distribute items and run errands, and I don’t know what to do with them. The old man adapted for a while before he coordinated the work of all the helpers. He thought about it and arranged for a few ingenious children to go to the armory, where they could help install the feather arrows, which is to flatten the feathers. Then mounted on the arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two gnomes who found Mana under the recommendation of the 陂 duck, who proposed to fight. These two people were able to hide themselves with illusion, and the technique of using the crossbow was really good, so they were arranged in the weak place of the castle as a guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle has been going on for a few days. Some people have successfully passed the most difficult initial stage and started to have the courage of the soldiers, but many people have not been able to come over. If it weren't for the protection of the city walls, the city of Myrtle had already been broken, and Siegel had no chance to stand on the wall to review his team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several orcs from the north are stunned by the chest wall. It wasn't until Siegel patted their shoulders and took out their own wine bags to share with these half-orcs to calm them down. The Walled Mountain Range has now spread the things that Heim has led, and many of the wandering orcs are dragging their families to the south to come here to find the happy life they yearn for. After discussing with Janet, Zucker took them in, greatly strengthening the number of half-orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This orc is only eighteen years old, but it is already a prime year compared to humans. Siegel looked at his burly, muscular, after wearing a lock, holding a shield and a short gun. And the elite knight of humanity can't see the difference in momentum. If he drops the shield, picks up the sharp knife behind him, and then screams the name of the beastmaster, the orc can become stronger and the lethality will reach a new level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also found a half-elf shooter, wearing a human knight's breastplate, do not care about the squid's family emblem. He has a pair of yellow eyes, delicate skin, golden hair tied to the pony tail behind the neck, beautiful like a girl. However, Mana said. He is an experienced shooter and it is very good to use a crossbow. Maybe after a period of training, he can stay as a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak came out of the castle. Moore took care of him. I can see that the age of the one-eyed dad is too big and I am beginning to falter. However, the old man kicked Moore with a kick and shouted: "What are you doing, go to your host to serve!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not be so constrained, Siegel said to Fazak: "Get it slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to ask you, who is the master this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" More than half a year ago, according to your instructions, we will be William Uther Released and reached a settlement with their family. Two months ago, Viscount Uther sent us a message warning that there was a conspiracy against Heim. Then, the Uther family and the viscount of the Kami The border friction, the two families Chen Bing confronted, so they did not participate in the coalition." Fitzak talked while resting, so that the original book is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have observed the enemy's flag and found that the highest hanging is the Hall family of the Westphalia. But they only have the title of the baron, but the territory is just a small Small out of the harbor, plus the grassy beach that can only grow reeds, it is reasonable to say that there should be no strength to put the flag on top of everyone. According to previous information, the Baron of the Hall family is old, and the new generation has only one son, called the fee. Lund, martial arts and strategy are not good. But this is old news, trapped in the city, the news of the South can not be worn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you caught the captive?” Siegel said: “Especially knights, jazz, people who can participate in their combat meetings?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak shook his head and explained Road: "The basics of climbing the city are killed by the half-orcs who are anxious, and we dare not go out to capture the captives. After the ordinary militia surrenders, in addition to the lords of their own family, other flags and family emblems are I can’t recognize it, I can’t help it at all.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To know the situation across just fine. "Siegel sighed. He looked at the army across the mountain and suddenly had doubts. What was the situation of the checkered mountain checkpoint, and who was defending there? If the enemy is attacking the whole line, how can there be enough people to defend all corners? He was about to ask questions, and he heard another screaming voice outside the wall shouting: "Siegel, you have the courage to throw a fireball, do you have a courageous duel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd looked down the wall, marveling at each other's tall figure and strong armor. The bald bear wrapped himself in a special plate and looked like a moving fortress. There is no family emblem on the armor, indicating that he is not a nobleman. Everyone guessed that the purpose of his challenge was to be able to be sealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He certainly did not make such an attempt in the past, because his armor was covered with grooves and scratches left by the battle. This is his reliance on provocation. In addition to the experience of battles and strong armor, the weapons in his hands are even more horrible: a giant long-handed axe with a length of two meters, made entirely of steel, with a sharp axe blade The arc of human fear. He opened his face mask and glared at the high wall of the city of Mire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that a fool?" Fazak snorted. "Not in the wild, why come to the Cavaliers?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana apparently observed more things, and said to Siegel: "The Lord Lord, don't bother him. It is not a knight at all, not qualified to launch a duel."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought for a moment and said unexpectedly: "No, there is a benefit to fighting." He turned his head and said to Moore: "You run fast, go Look for Janet, the core of the element is coming. And tell her, rest assured, and have me outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young waiter nodded and turned away without a shadow It is. Segal stood at the head of the city and carefully looked at the situation outside, especially those enemies hidden in the ditch, and remembered their position with heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell all the knights, stick to their posts, and prevent the enemy from attacking." Siegel said to the horsewoman: "This may be the trick of the enemy to attack the West." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bears see no response on the wall, and they are more energetic. In the words, they describe Siegel as a shameless villain, a slutty slut, and a weak The foolishness. It also mentions the female knight, Mana, and says that Siegel is a coward hidden under the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This shameless bastard!" Mana picked up the longbow, pulled out the feather arrow, raised her hand and shot. The bald bear did not have time to react, but his armor protected him. Only a audible sound, the feather arrow was bounced off, leaving only a pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be angry, Mana," Siegel said. "His armor is very heavy, and your arrow can't be shot."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what he said is too ugly!" The female shooter took a few deep breaths and finally calmed down under the comfort of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
