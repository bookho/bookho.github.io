			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cook was scared to hurry behind the table and slowly moved to the back door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you will do stupid things, civilians. Pulling out the weapons to the defending lord, it really is a spy." The three men also took out the sword. The finished glyph is surrounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is justice within the protection of weapons." Siegel stepped back, letting the tables on both sides cover their sides, and then the wand from his left hand Sliding out of the sleeves and stopping in his grasp. "There is power within the range of magic," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up! Come on! You two fools!" The knight yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything happened at the same time. The public face attendant picked up the glass on the table and smashed it. Siegel escaped. The wine spilled on the wall and the cup fell into pieces. The fat knight rushed from the other side and slammed into the table without slowing down, making the space occupied by Siegel quickly smaller. The knight’s arm slammed, and a vague silver shadow shot at Siegel’s thigh. The tip of the wand glowed, and a small bolt of lightning hit the silver light and slammed it onto the ground. It was a dagger, and it was supposed to make Siegel unable to act. Now it can only be inserted on the floor and trembled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three are too few, I need a whole dozen." Siegel smiled and seemed to be back to the top of the Mora, facing a large group The dwarf child's charge, such a scene seems to have met. The knight turned over the chair and held a long sword in both hands; the public face waiter was about to bypass the table, and surrounded him from behind, he also took out a dagger; the fat waiter slammed the table and used it as a car, pushing Squeezed to Siegel. But when the music of the Elf Machete began to sound, it was no longer a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel jumped to the side of the public face, and used the foot to smash the chair and kicked the knight, so he had to take a long sword. open. A strong light shot out, just stunned the eyes of the public face. Although Siegel has not mastered the blinding spells, the dazzling effect is still very easy to manufacture. Not everyone has learned to stay calm without being able to see things, let alone defensive and offensive. The dagger was thrown freely, and there was no point at all, and the long sword of the attendant was waving wildly. Siegel swept the sword with a machete and was blocked by the hilt of the hilt, scaring the swordman to rush back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet hides in the corner and throws the stool toward the battlefield, hitting the fat waiter. However, her lack of strength, just let the guy yell and yell. When he wants to run over and grab Janet, the knight will reprimand him: "Damn, concentrate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;长剑朝西格尔Piercing, blocked by a machete, giving a crisp sound, then the tip of the wand. Thanks to this dark room, the brilliance created by magic is extraordinarily bright and extraordinarily glaring. Siegel was ready to squint, but his opponent could only suffer from glare. They will immediately raise their hands to protect their eyes and then reveal an unguarded void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel cuts the arm of the attendant with a machete, a wound from the shoulder of the person to the elbow, and the blood quickly stains the broken sleeves, and the sword is also drop on the floor. When Siegel saw that he had temporarily lost his threat, he drilled under the arm of the fat servant and killed the last person. The knight is not good at seeing the situation, and is busy going backwards. He passed through the stove in the middle of the house and took a mushroom soup pot and poured it over. Siegel quickly evaded, but was still poured, mushrooms and meat pieces fell from his body, wolf. The knight chased the enemy and picked up the firewood. Siegel waved a machete and opened the firewood. Mars was splashed and flew around. He kept on his feet and progressed in an orderly manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on me!" The knight shouted. The fat waiter swooped over, his eyes full of fierce and crazy eyes. Siegel hesitated a little, and the scimitar was wide open from the neck of the attendant, leaving only a wound that had turned and bleed on his chest. The fat waiter was not grateful to Siegel for his mercy. He stretched out his arms and held Siegel in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squeezing, the blood flowing faster from the wounds everywhere, but the fat servant did not care at all, and he only had the same thoughts in his mind. Another person grabbed the dagger with a hand with a thumb and quickly stabbed in the direction of Siegel's eye socket. Siegel is angry with himself, actually will be merciful to the enemy, still thinking about the kindness that does not hurt his life? This is already a life-and-death fight. It is no longer a friendly discussion with the giant Kerry. If you have a little reservation, you will be worried. He is not retaining his strength, but with his heels on the knees of the mammoths, the steel heels smash the bones, and the fat waiters are brave and can only bark and fall. When his arm was loose, Siegel's scimitar pushed outward, bent down and took off from his arms. The dagger that had been stabbed tried to keep up with Siegel's direction of movement, but could only be tied to the thick arm of a bloody waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fast chase! He will lead the patrol." Siegel yelled, leaping from the ground, followed by the hotel. Just as he stepped out of the gate, a silvery light pierced his belly. The knight is hiding in the doorway, holding his breath, waiting for someone to come out. At that moment, the bright sunshine outside would affect the people who came out of the dark room, making it difficult for them to see the surroundings immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword stabbed in the lower edge of the breastplate, heading toward Siegel's kidneys and intestines - that would cause the most painful and slow death. Siegel was unprepared until the dwarf's gold belt was uploaded, and he realized that a weapon had just taken his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword slipped open, and Siegel felt a sharp pain in his waist, but he also understood that it was only a bruise caused by the impact and would not be fatal. The scimitar crossed a horizontal arc in the air and cut the throat of the knight. Then there was another knife, which opened his arm with the sword and ended the battle. Siegel and other opponents fell, still have a lingering fear, holding the wall with his mouth and gasping. Then he looked at his waist: a blue scar on the side of the body was slowly swelling, and there was a big gap in the gold belt. Although it has not been scrapped, it will definitely affect the effectiveness of this magic item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a good life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid!" He yelled at himself and reminded himself to remember this lesson: "This can't be done anymore," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he heard the sound of a groan from the horse, and it seemed that someone was talking but could not hear clearly. Siegel was alert and guarded in that direction. Turning around the corner, he saw a person trapped in his hands and feet, stuffed with a cloth in his mouth, and looked at himself with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and the man all stunned and they found each other. The guy who was tied up was Jeff-Gold, the blacksmith who Bill Sir recruited at the hub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you in this place? Where is the jazz?" Siegel took out the dagger, cut the rope, and took out the cloth in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank God, Siegel, is the true God who sent you to me." Jeff licked his cheek, where all were beaten by fists. Bruise. In addition to here, his teeth are also a few fewer, one eye swollen quickly can not open, the whole body clothes are ragged, the exposed skin is all whip smudges. However, Jeff's spirit is still good, and his strong body that he used to train is still supporting him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The jazz has nothing to do, he is fine." Jeff said: "I mean he is safe, but it can't be too good. I come out. Acting for him, but I made a vow not to disclose the information. Only for you Siegel, I can say a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not received for a long time To the news of the jazz, where is he now?" Siegel hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s five days away from here, and with many people, you don’t have to worry about safety.” Jeff stood up and squeezed a smile: Little Master, can you get me some wine first, then let me have something to eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel holds Jeff's shoulder and takes him across Passing the body on the ground and walking back to the hotel. Janet is licking the cook's hair and holding her throat with her dagger. The old woman kept yelling: "Forgive, forgive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Siegel came in, Janet hurriedly said: "I found that he wanted to escape from the back door, going Report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff looked at Janet and asked Siegel, "Who is this, the maid you bought?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s much closer than that." Siegel replied. Then he introduced Janet: "This is Jeff, I have told you about the blacksmith of Sir Bill, who is your own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little girl Let me solve this problem.” Jeff said with a smile: “It’s useless to kill her, a dead old lady, let me talk to her.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet retracted the dagger and released the bride's hair. Jeff spread his hand in front of Siegel and asked for the latter's wallet. He put a piece of the overturned table, sat next to it, pulled out a gold coin and banged on the table, and then said, "I have not come for the first time. Silk Hibiscus is not the first time. But who is this secret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
