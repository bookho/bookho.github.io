			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian in the elf mouth finally arrived here two days before the celebration, which made everyone feel very happy, and Siegel finally saw the last of the team. One member. It was an unusually tall and burly person with a very strong body. He even squatted on the upper body, with the wind and snow, climbed the entire snow-capped mountains, and did not fear the cold outside. The man had a tattoo on his chest, a black mark of the wild god - a thorn decorated with cockroaches and blood. The barbarian has short, tan hair and a very strong face. His eye sockets are deep, his eyebrows are thick, his nose is high – in human terms, it exudes mature charm. This is completely different from the barbarian image envisaged in Siegel's mind. He has always thought that the barbarian is a very primitive tribe. The people there may live like half-orcs. They are all hunters or fishermen. They are strong but not trimmed. How can it be so handsome and handsome when the weather is blowing in the wild? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian is carrying a large bag of animal fur, a gift for the dwarves, and a special product for them. The dwarf banquet again, welcomes the arrival of friends, and introduces Siegel to him at the banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a Jazz apprentice. Bill recommends him to join our team. How do you think he is?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The young man is very strong! But why are your hair and eyes black and dyed? The gods are on, I have never seen such a strange appearance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was born like this, they said that I was blacked by squid." Siegel talked about his life, and several people heard it for the first time. Everyone listened attentively. The whole story, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must be an indication of God's extraordinary appearance, and you must do something extraordinary - just like me." Express blessings to him. At this time, he looked at the two companions next to him and read some meanings from their eyes. He said: "Oh! I probably understand, you seem to have agreed to him to join, and I am left? Is this absolutely no problem!" He stood up and clap his hands, rubbing the oil on the leather pants. Rubbing, it seems that I have to prepare for a fight. Siegel is ready to fight, but I didn’t expect the barbarian to be thirsty. He ran to the other end of the table and took a bowl of soup and sipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he dried his mouth, he said after a sigh of relief: "After everything has to wait for food, you know that climbing is too physical." And I haven’t eaten for three days in order to vacate my stomach. Don’t worry. I’m going to eat with me, let me see your meal and say.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short life is afraid that things are not too big, and loudly on the side: "He not only eats a lot, but also drinks better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't drink too much, and have a business after dinner. I have already thought of a good idea!" said the barbarian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is very curious about what the barbarian thought of this time. He always refused to pick up this topic when he was eating, and waited until he had eliminated two whole roast sheep. He also said mysteriously: "How can we measure whether a man is a real man? Only on the battlefield! I believe that the dwarf's vision is not wrong, your martial arts must reach the standard, it will not be too hard. But there is also a battlefield. You need to wait for your conquest, come with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the barbarian took the protagonist and left, he also looked at Elinette. Leah was very curious to want to go and see, but was stopped by the barbarians, saying that it is not suitable for you, this is a matter between men. Leah immediately understood their thoughts and said with annoyance: "You never have any serious ideas!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the elves think, the pedestrians are going Ji Yuan. Unlike other places, this facility in the dwarf city was not built to serve the dwarves. A male dwarf with a stable life is very loyal to his wife, attaches importance to the family, does not go to that place to get "cheap entertainment"; and the appearance of the female dwarf bearded beard is not welcomed by foreigners, and naturally can not work here. So you rarely see dwarves go to brothels, they prefer to drink or fight. Only those stray dwarves who have no family and family – considered to be the lowest and least valuable part of the dwarf – will come here. So at the top of the Mora, the main customers of this occasion are local foreigners, plus businessmen, mercenaries, and other ethnic travelers. For them, watching all kinds of bearded short fat people all day is a painful torture for the eyes. They need to seek spiritual comfort, especially to re-visit the beautiful curves and appreciate the beauty. Therefore, with the permission of the dwarf clan, some human settlements in the city have opened pubs to provide exclusive services for men. Most of these places are expensive, which is why the barbarians called Irene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He won't come is his loss, we can have a good time." The barbarian said: "just do a post-meal exercise!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel is not a hairy boy who doesn't understand anything. He is a seafarer after all, and the other customer group with the largest service. He heard many rumors, various stories, and even jokes about this place from his companions on the ship, but he never experienced it personally. In a complex mood mixed with tension, jealousy and excitement, he was picked up by Diou in front of a three-story building. The lowermost layer of the house is masonry structure, the middle layer is wooden, and the top is a small roof platform. Actually, a small pavilion is built, with the artistic style of the stars. The windows here have a strange reflection, and you can't see the scene inside the house. Siegel knows that it is made of wire glass, it is very strong, and it can also seal the sound. It is an expensive material. Building such a house in a dwarf cave is not easy, and the builder's luxury and financial resources are everywhere. Siegel noticed that the wood of the house is the silver silk of the old continent. It can reflect the dark silver-white halo under the candlelight. It is very popular among the wealthy merchants and nobles. It is very rare to use it in the brothel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire building was cleaned up and there were no signboards. Only a large red lantern was hung in the doorway, silently attracting customers. Siegel was pulled into the gate by the plateau people, and suddenly felt dry and dry, because a tall, pretty woman turned around the corner and smiled and stood in front of him. The woman wore a loose, transparent flesh-colored silk coat, revealing white skin like milk and a beautiful and touching gully. She has a long black hair with a wavy roll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Elsa", she took a deep look, her clothes sway like a willow, and the air was filled with perfume. Her voice has a singing rhythm and slowly said: "Welcome, what are the two?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is a strong man, this is a rookie!" The plateau barbarian laughed and pushed Siegel over: "Do not talk nonsense, your task is to squat him down and hold the wall out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady covered her mouth and gently held the "novice". A soft, delicate touch wraps around Siegel's arm, followed by a tingling sensation of hair. She said in a delicate and soft voice: "What we are pursuing here is to satisfy the guests, I hope that you will be able to linger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the strength of the arm is small, Siegel felt that he was following the uncontrollable force and went inward. Turning the screen, he came to a room decorated with a pool in the center. The pool was surrounded by mosaics and various patterns of flowers were placed. The cushions and pillows were placed on the ground. Some girls are here, either lying on a soft cushion, or swimming in the pool, or sipping a hookah or playing chess. They didn't mean to rush around, just lazy to enjoy life and create a comfortable atmosphere. Various women's portraits are hung on the walls to outline the appearance and moving curves. The room is dotted with the unique smell of the old mainland, the smoke is lingering, accompanied by beautiful and soothing music, but Siegel can't see where the player is. He just feels stunned, and everything around him is illusory and ethereal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The girls here are well trained and proficient in various techniques." Elsa said with a sullen face on her shoulder. "They are all gentle and beautiful, obedient and sensible. I don't know what type you like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question has not really been considered. Siegel’s brain is like a stagnation, and he doesn’t know what to say. On one side, he saw Elsa's blue eyes, like the reflection of the moon in the sea, which made him more nervous. He finally said a word: "Your hair is black... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dyeing, do you feel beautiful?" Elsa fiddled with her hair and put a strand of hair on her lips and said, " Or, start with me? I can give you a quick introduction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also...well..." Siegel nodded stiffly . At this time, he saw the plateau barbarian from the other side of the screen, left and right, holding a gold and red two long hair beauty upstairs, not forgetting to siegel's mouth, and thumbs up to express blessings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Siegel was wearing dark circles and lazily squatting on the breakfast table. Despite the delicious mushroom meatballs and jam bread in front of him, he didn't want to lift his fingers. And opposite him, the plateau barb Dio is happily biting the whole ham. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you are an adult, Siegel." Dio said: "Now you know what a real passion. Knowing these can only understand life." Siegel’s tired head didn’t lift, and he’s screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
