			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should fight for the help of the dragon," Earl Todd said at the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second day of the arrival of the dragon. The messenger who went to the Mage Federation for help has not yet replied, and everyone is still trapped in the Black Blood Castle. The situation was worse than before. After the dragon incident, the orc who had been returning to the north suddenly became interested in the castle where the dragon landed. A thousand soldiers surrounded him and launched a tentative attack. Under the command of Sir Bill, the counterattack was rapid and deadly. Arrows, falling rocks, and kerosene fell in order, and in the end less than a hundred orcs escaped. But this can be like smashing a horse's nest, with three times the previous force entering the warning zone of the castle. They used the plundered "prisoner of war prisoners" to act as a coolie, patiently constructing a bunker and gradually advancing. Such a savvy play was unheard of, and the effect of the Black Blood Castle was greatly reduced. Although the loss of the orcs is still greater than the sacrifice of the Black Blood Castle, the "war damage ratio" is within the tolerance of the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill has suggested that mountain cavalry attack, attack from the cliff, or raiding the enemy's head. But Count Todd vetoed the proposal. It is a mountainous area. There are a lot of ambush orc archers on the hillside. There are only a few attack lines that allow the lizard to act suddenly. It is too likely to be shot. And now dispatching a mountain knight, it is easy to expose this trump card, it is likely to affect the safety of His Royal Highness Prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sitting at the conference table thought: mainly worried about the last retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the dragon can ignore the blow of ordinary weapons and unfold the cleansing of the orcs. So there was a proposal from Earl Todd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moss is not going to help this." Siegel shook his head and said helplessly: "I will approach her, she will Look for various reasons to ignore me, such as sleeping, sleeping, and sleeping. I am afraid she wants to sleep all the time until I die. Maybe she feels that she can get rid of the task and get back to St. Joseph without any effort. And the reward of the Dragon Spirit. If I can know what she wants, maybe it will be possible, but she is not willing to communicate now. Fortunately, she has not thought of letting the orcs rush up, or has no intention of destroying the city walls and the like. Maybe The pride in the dragon's bones is the only reason that prevents her from thinking like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to say. You should find a way to get the woman." Evan said with a smile: "Trust me, anyway, she is sleeping, this is the biggest hint. If she rides, everything will be solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence caused the presence The approval of everyone except Siegel. In addition to the elusive temper, strong strength, and ethnicity span, Capricorn is indeed a beautiful woman. It's easy to remember the type. Everyone in the Black Blood Castle, one counts one, has eaten the closed door of the Dragon Girl, so they always talk about the enthusiasm of 撺掇Siegel’s “making” the topic of 黛. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think the direction of your discussion is somewhat biased." Siegel was indifferent to Evan's ridicule because he knew if he had an expression. Even if they just turned a blind eye, they are encouraging them to continue to play on this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I think the opposite is true." Sir Bill said in a serious way: "We should have noticed a problem. There are many dragons in the sky, and silvery gray. More than three, why choose from two...two female dragons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan laughed at the table, even Todd The count couldn’t stop him if he tried hard. Segal shook his fingers, and a glass of red wine was moved to Evan, shaking gently, and the cup was aimed at Evan's face. Under this threat. Evan tried to hold on to the smile, and the action of drinking in the end cup was hard to slow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although there are some difficulties, the combination of man and dragon can produce offspring." Pastor Cooper is still a warm expression, but language It’s amazing: “The combination of the Lord’s Lord’s music and the kindness of the people will give blessings.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan can’t help it anymore,噗The red wine was sprayed out, and the candle in front of it was poured out, polluting the food on the table. He coughed loudly and tapped his chest hard. Even the very serious Sir Bill had a smile, only Count Todd kept knocking on the table: "Attention to the meter. Pay attention to the meter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel I feel that I have to come out to speak, otherwise this matter will be too much trouble. "Your words are too whimsical, but lack the support of practice. The orc's encirclement has already taken shape, and it is too late to slowly draw the dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gave him a look, but he also knew that he would not repent. So he looked at Count Todd and said, "Do you still remember the prophecy that was tampered with: the dragon is aided. The enemy agrees, we should discretion against it. It is good to keep the current state. The dragons go to the north, do not know the implementation. What missions, but from the scale of their dispatch, they can infer one or two. Only the war between races can make them as enemies. Before the end of the battle, the alliance between the rush and the dragons is likely to attract new enemies."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just your guess." Count Todd interjected, "In fact, no one can be sure which sentence is true in the revised prophecy, which sentence is false. If I It’s a common-minded mage, and it’s sure to mix the truth with lies, so that it’s easier to be convinced. And it’s better to win an ally than to become an enemy. Can you deny this, Mr. Master?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and was silent. Master Lear’s prophecy, the lies of the synagogues are together, forming a fog that no one can see through. The more you want to distinguish between reality and illusion, the deeper you will sink. It's like sailing in thick fog. The squad is trying to find a reef that could cause the ship to die. But the longer you stare at the fog, the more likely it is to see the fog as a reef, the eyes blurred, and the mind become dull. , so you must always rotate. Furthermore, there is always a limit to the vision of mortals, and no one can peek into the picture of the future for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Master who is proficient in prophecy is very rare. Among all spell types, Siegel has the worst grasp of the divination and prophecy spells, unlike his use of elemental spells, he can also make improvements according to his own mind. Knowing that you are not good at it, then try to avoid it. Siegel no longer thinks about the prophecy of Master Lear, but re-focuses on the orcs who besieged the Black Blood Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven Baron stopped at the top of the castle's highest tower, and the black eyes passed through the mist in the mountains, and the situation on the battlefield was unobstructed. The orc formed a dense little spot on the hillside, and made a simple tower shield with the wood removed from the flatbed, and slowly moved to the mountain. These orcs are not careful, they will relax sooner or later, and then they will be killed by the archers on the castle. But the orcs are also very smart. They move as carefully as possible during the day, and in the evening they will use the dark cover to suddenly move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also why the number of fighters in the castle tower is scarce - they are resting and raising their spirits to fight the night. In order to have enough lighting. A lot of pine oil torches are being made in the castle. After special formulation, these pine oils will not rise in the smoke when burning, and the lighting will be longer and harder to extinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs have their own response. The Black Blood Castle is not close to the valley, but it is not the end of the walled mountains. There are still towering peaks on the other side of the valley. Some orcs are climbing up. They carry heavy pythons, made of iron-set pear wood and the strongest animal ribs, with a range far beyond the average sling. Even a strong orc must use both hands and feet to pull the bow open. The giant cymbal uses a hollow iron mesh. When flying, the air enters from the tip hole and leaves from the tail end, so the 弩vector will rotate in the air and emit a unique whistling sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These elite scorpions are the killers of the orcs. In a dark environment, humans must ignite torches to fight the orc attacks, and the people around them are the best targets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no special weapon. It is difficult to attack the orcs on the opposite hillside, so now it is only possible to rely on a temporary erection machine. The paladins who can come to support and defend the prince of the prince are not defensive war masters, they are not proficient in siege weapons erection. Because the lords of the original Black Blood Castle were still in the dungeon, the local craftsmen did not work hard. They also concealed their identity from the people of the morning temple and hid the real siege weapon technicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few apprentices are busy in the castle, so the trebuchet created is of little use. Through the eyes of the transitional crow, Siegel saw that the siege weapons were smashing, not falling apart when loading, or crashing after launch. Now he understands why Count Todd ordered everyone to not easily fight, because the Earl of the Wars has long found that the soldiers under his command are not useful. Bodyguards and fighters are very different. This difference on the battlefield is fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel regained his gaze and thought about countermeasures. He has only the most basic architectural and engineering knowledge and does not contribute much to the current situation. By constantly discovering his weaknesses, Siegel gradually understood the true meaning of the Master: leaking from the adventure. Fill the gap in Fatah. At this time, everyone at the venue began to discuss the dragon thing, it seems that this became their only concern. Siegel felt very depressed and the chair underneath became unsuitable. He gently pushed open the unmoved meal in front of him, got up and saluted the count of Todd, and quickly left the meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
