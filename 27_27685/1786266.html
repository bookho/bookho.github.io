			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter from the elf was placed in front of Siegel by Alfred’s hand. ●◆网. The envelope is red like a maple leaf, decorated with golden veins and fine lines, and sealed with a green holly leaf. The whole letter is scattered with the rich flavor of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the person who sent the letter?" Siegel licked the envelope, but the holly leaves were tough. After he took the letter opener, he took out the stationery inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A sentiment sent by the Elf Ranger, he left and could not retain it." Alfred said: "The messenger Wearing white and brown clothes, carrying a longbow and a short sword, the mount is a long-horned deer, and walking on the snow does not slow down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Siegel nodded and focused on the content of the letter. The letter was written by the priest of the Elven Forest Luna, which recited some words of the Elven Saint. Through various means, the elf believes that he has found an important stronghold of the murder god, and may be the concentrated place of the new big 6 black assassin. However, this stronghold is in the south of the New Grand 6 and needs to pass through the land of the southern lords until it reaches the southernmost coast of New Grand 6. Due to the influence of the Elven War, in order to avoid stimulating the nerves of the human lords of the South, the elves follow the advice of the saints and cannot send troops. They can only ask Siegel to assist in the investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel handed the letter to Alfred and said, "I will go personally in this matter, you can arrange it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you really give it to an hired adventurer?" Alfred frowned and said to Siegel: "There are many jobs in the territory that are looking for a job." People, many of whom have good reputation and good abilities, are willing to accept the employment of the lord. As for the southern lords, you only need to send a messenger to solve the problem, or you can let Mana..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to go in person, I am afraid that others will not do well." Siegel said: "Don't worry, I can always use the transmission array to come back, you can also like The last time I went to the Bull Rhino Tribe, I reported it to me every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The murderous god’s stronghold is definitely full of danger, you must never go by yourself. Alfred asked: "Do you have the right person for the Lord Lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is Siegel thought of it first. He is the best man of swordsmanship in the city of Mire, and he also has a hand in hand with the black assassin and has some experience. But he is "Your Majesty," and he is a ghost every day. I don't know what is busy, is it appropriate to call him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana is loyal, but her ability is more focused on the military, has not heard of any specialties in adventure, or put it in the overall comparison of the general manager of the city of Miele it is good. Capricorn is the deterrent force of the city of Mith. Can't move lightly. And since returning, in addition to bullying Isaac every day, the dragon girl is crawling somewhere to sleep. Mystery can make a lot of elements to make her happy, and even a mysterious smile hangs when she drools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His squats have several good young knights, but most of them are loyal and martial arts. They are more of a fighting ability while riding, not a walking adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage Federation has a lot of talent, but unless you have the experience of dealing with black assassins, it is easy to lose your life when you face the enemy. If you are looking for someone, the guard is the best choice, but Siegel thinks that Wendy is scalp. The first reaction is to avoid it far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideas presented by Alfred seem to be a good idea. Siegel thought about it and said to the butler: "Look for the best team, especially the experience and ability to detect and remove traps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will do well." The butler nodded. "Do you need to be anonymous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The letter is in your hands, you organize it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfred turned away and Siegel fell into meditation. Exclude the possibility of the Elf Saints error or the elf setting a trap, which is currently the only clue to his black man. Since Janet lost his whereabouts, he tried every means to find it, but most of it fell into the sea. Occasionally there are one or two plausible messages, but in the end it is just more rumors and vague descriptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening comes and the shadows grow. Winter nights are cold, and Janet is outside. Segel sat alone at the table, and his mind was a map of the southern territories. Before the start of the Elven War, the dwarf closed the walled mountains, except for the underground passage of Heim. Where else can I travel on both sides of the mountain? The black man attacked the Elven Forest and ambushed Siegel on the shore of the Tears of God. They must have their own methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also less interested in the information collected through the trade route. Because for criminals, criminals such as bandits, bandits and assassins are closer to their lives, and they are never the lords. Siegel has concealed the smugglers countless times, and even forged the documents himself, helping the Soth to evade the inspection of the harbour tax officials, so that they can escape the inspection of the port officials in Ximu Town, so it is not difficult to understand that their investigation work is in trouble. the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he has to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got up and left the study, the door was closed under his spell and connected to the magical enchantment of the castle. The Master closed his eyes, communicated with the protection enchantment, and soon found Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is wearing a training suit, a coat made of thick cowhide, and is playing against an old man in the training room. They held a blunt sword for training and wrapped them on top of them to increase their weight. Evan was sweating, and the old man opposite him was calm. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Siegel decided to resume the sword training, he changed the castle room to the training room, and also used it as a showroom for various weapons and armor. It is more private, not like the training ground in the courtyard. Evan also took a set of keys here, but who is the old man opposite him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a serious old man with a very thin body, but with amazing strength hidden under his skin. He is about fifty years old, the white head is as short as a scorpion, and a pair of deep eyes are trapped beside the straight nose. When he saw Siegel appearing, he licked his lips and put his sword on the ground with his hands, a look of alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel? Look at your robes and you know that you are not training." Avon said: "Come, I will introduce you, ' The old hunter 'Viplin Clark's Viscount."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel heard Evan said this person, just when he talked about the starry kingdom swordsman. Palin Clark was once the father of Evan. That is, the last king was a bodyguard, and later he became a cognac young man from a strong British knight. It was a curse against the king, blocked by loyal guards - this is the recorded history. Although he recovered his health later, his body shape could no longer be recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the size. He stood in the king's guards and looked like a cognac rotten fruit, affecting the view, so Evan's father made him guard the palace. In a round of hunting, Pai Lin once again blocked the danger for the king, and personally smashed a violent gryphon. So I got the title of "Old Hunter". However, he was less than thirty-five years old that year, and he could not be called old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not feel insulted at all, still loyal to the royal family. When the king was injured, Pai Lin was not around, so he was rumored to be a lucky star that could help the king to eliminate the disaster. When Evan and Aaron were arguing over the crown, Pei Lin disappeared. How could he see him again in Mier City? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an old man with a dead face, and the skeptical look makes Siegel feel awkward. If he has been like this, it is no wonder that the King drove him out of the Guards. The king is not a hedgehog. He does not need the guards next to him to slant the spikes all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you take me with your headgear, how can you be recognized?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. Master Lin Lin recognized my bonfire and thought that I was a scavenger who picked up my belongings from the body and challenged me. We fought one. Then he recognized me," Evan said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, Viscount Clarke." Siegel said hello to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man just nodded and still said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Siegel is the royal count of the starry kingdom, and everyone is standing on the land of Siegelheim, whether as a guest or Aristocrats, behaviors like Palin are very rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel snorted. Said to Palin: "What kind of use is your bad education and temper, except to discredit the king?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a baron, I am a Viscount. There is no problem in the etiquette just now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was the Earl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
