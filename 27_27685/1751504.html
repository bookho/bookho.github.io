			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry trio is close to a relatively dispersed formation. The cavalry on both sides glanced around from time to time to investigate the situation nearby. Siegel stood up from the saddle and shouted: "The knights of the grasslands, we are not malicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are tall and strong, the pier distance The ground has a distance of more than two meters, the muscles of the legs are well-balanced, and the horse's back has a solid curve. The carefully combed bristles shake around the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavalier is wearing a brand new inlaid leather armor, and the long gun in his hand reflects the swaying of silver from time to time. Fully armed, they look heroic, majestic and powerful. They were tall and confident, and they were like an unbeaten god of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which tribe are you?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the territory of the Jackdaw tribe. What are you doing?" The general language of the fat knight is not good, mixed with a serious dwarf accent. However, Siegel can understand as long as he concentrates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are friends of Giant Kerry, come here to see him." Siegel said: "Please tell him Siegel. The squid is here, and the squid The master, Elf Lia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat knight looked at him with a surprised look, and suddenly his face burst into a smile: "You are giving We guide the mage in the rich land!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other knights also smiled and put away their weapons. "It's really black and black eyes! It's this person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that he is not two meters tall, it doesn't look like it!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and shook his head and said to the knights: "If you can, I want to see Kerry soon."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem!" said the fat knight: "I am Bob Stu, the vice captain of the third cavalry, and I am responsible for patrolling today. See you really. It’s a great honor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel followed the cavalry, their speed was not too fast, so they could chat a few times on horseback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Bob’s allegation, Siegel knew about the post-war battle. The black wolf princess came to the land with a team, defeated the local wolves and leopards, killed the lizards that could be petrified, and finally successfully placed the tribe here. After the return of Kerry. They have successfully captured three wild horses and greatly expanded their strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are goods from both the East and the West, and the living materials of the Jackdaw tribe have been supplemented. According to Siegel's instructions, they found silver mines on the walls of the city walls. However, it is different from what Siegel expected. Kerry did not eventually mine this silver mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chiefs and the Walled Mountain Ranges have reached an agreement with our nearest human lord, Baron Wilkester Cecil of the White Bird family, to hand over silver mines Give him mining. Our jackdaw tribe can do 20% of the net profit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good idea." Siegel said "As long as the Baron Cecil is able to abide by his promise, he will be able to pay you silver coins on time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is an honorable person." He has always followed his promise." The cavalry deputy captain said: "Look, we have arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jackdaw Tribe is built on a piece of treasure. On this vast grassland, a low hill is slightly higher than the surrounding, and a silvery river passes by him. This is the snow from the walled mountains and will not stop all year round. Due to the moisturizing of living water, the hills also show a hint of green, which is rare in the early winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribe built trenches and barbed fences to protect many of the houses in the middle. At the top of the hill at the center, a large, triangular-shaped penthouse is under construction. Bob said that it is the temple of the Three Spirits, with three walls. The three corners of each side represent a group of souls, and the center of each wall will be painted with the ancestral spirit, the spirit of war, and the emblem of the spirit of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the exit of the house to the hillside, you can see a large stone pillar, which is the marble that was transported from the wall of the city wall and was helped by the dwarves. What it looks like now. The priests of the Jackdaw tribe will paint on the stone pillars to record the major historical events of the tribe so that future generations can continue to learn from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people approached Nestor and entered the city from the arch bridge over the river, just passing through the trenches and fences. The people who live here are rejuvenated, and they stand tall and talk loudly. The thick voice is rippling on the vast grasslands. Many people who wore fine chain mail saw Siegel, stunned, and suddenly jumped up and shouted "It’s a dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are The warriors who fought side by side with Siegel on the day of the Red Dragon attack have now become elite warriors of the Jackdaw tribe. Siegel jumped off the horse and hugged it with a few familiar friends. The scene of sharing the dragon meat together in the same year is still vivid. Now talking about this memory is still full of happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come with me, King Kerry will be very happy to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They walked up the stairway paved with stones, lined with stone pillars that were being decorated. Kerry did not live in a large triangular house, but built a residence on the mountainside. Like everyone else, his residence is just a long house made of stone and mud. The outside room is used as a place to receive guests and hold meetings, and in the middle is his residence with Mesilla. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no decoration in the house, just a double-sided steel shield hanging on the door with the emblem of the black wolf and the jackdaw. Two sentinel sentinels stood in front of the gate, and the armor and the sword in their hands were known to be the standard that the castle blacksmith often built. Their swords are squirted, and they are in front of them, reflecting the sun's rays along with the polished mirror-like plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry rushed out of the house and laughed after seeing Siegel. "It’s so happy to see you, it’s too unexpected!” The giant was almost happy to jump up and quickly greeted Siegel, saying, “Come in, look at my son!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I could not see the Black Wolf Princess and their husband and wife. Siegel and Leah handed the horse to the tribe to manage and followed him into the longhouse. The interior of this large point is long and wide, and the four large stone pillars support the towering arched roof. The pillars are rich in patterns, depicting the beauty of nature with rough lines and colors. On the wall are the furs of various beasts, and below are the cabinets that store the food and wine. Two rows of tables and chairs filled the gap between the columns, and they were gathering before Siegel came in, so the table was filled with savory grilled meat, sour cheese and mellow wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines in from the east-facing window and illuminates it. The brazier in the middle of the room and the torch on the table are not extinguished all the year round, so the room is extraordinarily warm. Mesera took her child and smiled and looked at the mage who came in together. The other people in the room also stood up and beat their chests with their fists and shouted "Welcome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry gave Siegel one by one, some people have already known, and some are new tribal leaders who joined the jackdaw. They looked at the Master very curiously, knowing that this was Kerry’s fighting brother, and they showed a friendly and respectful smile. Kerry squeezed the crowd around and brought Siegel to his wife and children. "Let's take a look at my child, Loma.chenko."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little guy is not afraid of life, looks at the wizard with round eyes, then stretches out Pink little hands. When Siegel was about to hold it, he stuffed his fingers into his mouth. Later, Loma swayed his neck and looked around, feeling that there was nothing particularly fun. So he drilled into his mother's arms and decided to go to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Janet is pregnant too, I will soon be a father too." Siegel said: "My child must be more lovely."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whatever you say!" Kerry said, "My child will be the king of the prairie, as long as the place where he can ride is his territory." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Loma screamed, it seemed a little impatient. Mesera smiled and said to Siegel: "You must have important things when you come here. We will go to the back first. The children are a little hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Kerry touched his child's cheek with his thick fingers and said, "Go, go eat it later!" Then he called Siegel to sit down. His chair is on the third-order platform at the end of the hall. It has a special large seat and a towering chair back with white wolf skin. The wood carving image of the ice crow appears on the top of the armrest and the back of the chair. But Kerry did not sit in the chair, but took Siegel to sit down at the long table and ordered fresh meat and wine to entertain his brother. These on the table let all the generals move outside. They will not waste and will continue to eliminate food outside the longhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry, this is my elf master, Ms. Lia from the forest." Siegel introduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
