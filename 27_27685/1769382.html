			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel relaxes the body, connects the power of the tower to himself, and the magical power enters his body. A hot feeling came from the finger holding the wand and gradually penetrated the whole body, just like being soaked in warm water. It was very comfortable. He closed his eyes and began to use the tower to "see" the situation around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he is the tower, the giant of the hub, all have a panoramic view. He saw the city surrounded by the elves, and the soldiers on the arrow tower were in stark contrast to the refugees struggling to survive behind the walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refugees who escaped from the war and did not live in the city, can only find a place to live between hungry horses and thin cattle and sheep. The men who had some strength went to the barracks and tried to participate in the forces of the hub of the hub, in exchange for a straw bed. But even the rations of the guards began to be insufficient. The guards of the military camps could only harden their hearts and drive away these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without farmland and land, the city itself cannot support itself. There are people everywhere, very noisy, they are pleading first, then shouting, and finally only **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three places in the entire hub for ample food: the lord's kitchen, the storage room of the Master's Tower, and the camp of the elves outside the city. Using the vision of the Red Tower, Siegel saw that the lord was chewing the figs in sorrow, and the hot soup and bread from the servant did not enter. His eyes helplessly aim at the direction of the elves, not knowing what to think about. The current lord is nothing more than a young man who looks thin and dull. Even under the heavy guards of the Cavaliers and the Castle, he may still feel unsafe, so he wears a chain shirt when he even eats. However, his shoulders are too narrow, and the chain shirt looks loose and looks like a warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storage room in the Master Tower is now free of people, and the food has been stacked on the ceiling. There are no servants here who are responsible for cooking and tidying up the dishes. The mages are all taking their own food and simply processing them with magic. Drinks are more popular than vegetables and meat, and the wizards love drinks that don't interfere with thinking and fill their stomachs. In this way, they can spend a lot of time discussing magic. Hiding behind the protective spell of the tower, there is no concern about what is going on outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower’s vision extends out and continues into the Elf’s camp. Since the other side also has a magician, a layer of shield like a cloud blocks most of the line of sight. So Siegel can barely look at the outline. He can see the ancient trees of war walking around, planting saplings; he can hear the music that sounds in the camp, and the elves are praising the bright moon of heaven with beautiful songs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a weird war, the elves are studying art, the wizard is discussing magic, the lord is in a daze, only the war refugees are more than just. The good end of the field is gradually becoming a forest. The elves will change the continent for hundreds or even thousands of years. But what about those who can't wait for the change to be completed, can they wait to die? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like blocking the mouth and nose of a prisoner with layers of soaked paper and slowly killing it. In fact, it is not the piece of paper that murders, but the chain that binds the hands and feet of the prisoner. The ultimate failure is the prisoner. The winner is the elf, but the smile on the dead body and waiting for the next prisoner is only the chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these chains, there are conspiracy, interests, calculations, and weaknesses. Compared with the Elves, the Masters Association, Knox and other lords, Siegel does not feel how different he is. He is also a part of the chain. Only he wants to break other chains and let the prisoners have a chance to struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mobilized the red-red minaret, trying to connect to the tranquility array in the courtyard, but the crystal ball told him that the so-called tranquility array did not exist. This is definitely not right. Siegel used the magic wand to borrow the power of the peaceful circle. The magic tower had no reason not to enlarge the effect of this array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned and concentrated, ordering the magic tower to obey his instructions. The pulsation of magic is like a heartbeat, and waves are uploaded from the crystal ball. Its heartbeat and the wizard's heartbeat are combined into one, achieving perfect synchronization. But there is no way to communicate the peace of law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a problem. Siegel temporarily regained his attention from the core of control and carefully thought about the secrets. He is sure that all the magical arrays outside will connect the control nodes here, managed by the crystal ball. Just now he was able to completely manipulate the protective enchantment of the Master Tower itself, and was able to command the tower to mobilize elements to counterattack. But you can't use the Knox Commons related spell function. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a layer of protection here, only the members of the association know the secret? This is not impossible: the common association has been a secret society for hundreds of years before, they are used to hiding themselves, and setting double protection is a means to effectively protect themselves. Siegel is not sure about re-controlling a common association magistrate. Those who are good at manipulating other people's ideas must also be proficient in ways to protect their own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To guess the secret language is a delusion, but the foundation of the entire control core is based on the soul of the soul. This is a special field of Nexus, and the common meeting only gets superficial fur from the void will. Siegel has seen the overall technical structure of the Yanshen Crystal, which is much more complicated and sophisticated than the array of the hub control room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to find a way to bypass the secret language and directly control the sacred soul system - Siegel puts the wand on the base of the crystal ball, closest to the location of the soul . He infiltrated the power of magical fluctuations and began to analyze the connection between the Yanshen Crystal Array and the Crystal Ball Control Hub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control ball set by Knox is a mixture of two systems, both the control part of the common spell spell of the Federation, and the secret of Knox. Magic emblem. If there is no secret language, there will be no magic energy that will be introduced into the enchantment of the inflammatory soul system. The magic tower naturally cannot call the power of the peaceful circle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the way in which the security circle control hub is portrayed is very similar to the resistance of the plasma array line, whether it is material or brush style, it is said to be the same . This kind of benefit is obvious, and it can be guaranteed that the control of the tranquility array will not be accidentally affected by ordinary magic, which will help to hide the secret. But the downside is to give Siegel a certain opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knox Association’s mage did not pass the plasma engraving, and could not directly operate the plasma circuit. Only the encrypted common law array can be used. Geer doesn't have to be so troublesome. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage transforms itself into a form of resistance, and introduces the power of the plasma directly into the control core of the tranquility array to circumvent the steps of verifying identity. He is like a defensive line of defense, directly occupying the capital of the enemy. With the support and help of the FDC, he quickly came back from the rear, shielding the secret language and completely controlling the red crest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he discovered the uniqueness of the Red Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red spire of the hub. It can be integrated with the towers of Ximu Town and Macabu, and it can be vaguely felt that there are two unfinished red towers in Deepwater City and Merienburg in the south. Siegel's thinking can be moved through these towers, and everything can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection array used in each tower is the same, but the hidden Knox array is different. Hub Fort is happy, Creek Town is sad, Macabu is angry. The unfinished Deepwater City and Fort Myers are not fully confirmed, and Siegel infers from the incomplete information he feels that it may be thoughts and fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every emotion has a basic spell to support: mad laughter, sorcerer, violent, fox scam and panic. It is impossible for Siegel to distinguish one by one, and it is impossible to remember the composition of all the ruins in a short time. However, he knows how Hubburg uses the ridiculous laughter to arrange the tranquility array, and believes that these tactics have a common design idea. So knowing the basic spells will be effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the emotional matrix, Siegel also discovered another role of the tower: attracting grievances. Starting from the Mackabu in the north, when the squad resonates, the grievances of the northernmost land can be summoned and controlled by the legion to participate in the war. This is a force that cannot be underestimated. The amazing amount and strong possessive ability can quickly destroy the army of the soul. Do you know if the information you provided to Elf's father has attracted the attention of the elves? If they don't have targeted protection, then they have to suffer big losses now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Siegel wanted to manipulate the local peace circle and use the sneak attack to attack the elf troops outside the city gate, thus dragging the Knox Commonwealth into the Elven War. The quagmire. But now there is a better way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a half-red crimson spire that is built outside of Sham Shui Po. It is still growing with the power of Yan Soo Crystal, far from reaching its fullest power. The emotional array here cannot be used, but it is not a problem to mobilize the grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of action must be fast, and Knox can't be brought back. Since he can see other places from a core control room, others will definitely see themselves. Siegel recalls the environment around Deepwater in his mind and thinks about where the elves may be stationed. The pointed ears are to plant trees here, so the fertile soil along the river will be their first choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All thoughts are done between the electric and the flint, and then Siegel concentrates on the will to resonate with the magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-red spires all begin to shine under the filling of magical power. Like a lighthouse, navigate for the spirits. Here is the biggest sacred soul crystal, which can be provided to the grievances to inhabit and wash away the grievances that become the shadow of the dead. The grievances that entrenched in the northernmost land quickly descended south, but the first ones to arrive would be those from the walled mountains. They used to suppress the black blood fortress. And almost caught up with the troops where Prince Aaron was. When Siegel invited Ryder, he did not find traces of these grievances. In fact, they were always hidden in the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
