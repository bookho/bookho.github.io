			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon, an ancient creature with wings and a lizard, built a huge body, strong body and powerful magical ability. Weiming. The oldest dragon is one of the strongest creatures in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times, even "one" can be omitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claws, teeth, and tail are the weapons most commonly used by dragons, and then different dragons can spit out different types of dragon flames, including flames, lightning, acid, and ice. . If you encounter a tough enemy, the dragon can also release talent spells, most of which are associated with their elemental characteristics, and the rest are thought-controlled. Some mages believe that the ability to control thoughts is based on Longwei and is the pressure of higher organisms against other creatures. This is a very rational statement. However, there are many irrational legends in the world, especially in some stories where the dragon is scornfully described as a "spitfire lizard." Those who believe in this kind of story, with the dream of "Dragon and the Dragon", all become dragon snacks, without exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when three silver-gray dragons suddenly left the big forces and rushed to the Black Blood Castle, almost everyone was scared. The priests of the Temple of Dawn, relying on countless trainings, immediately recited the spell and cast a full set of protective spells. These include a blessing that enhances fear resistance, a devout shield that enhances defense, a spell immunity that prevents mind control, and a gain spell that enhances the ability of the Paladin and the Mountain Knight to fight. There are seven or eight flashes of light on the prince's body. Protection is the enchantment of dead spells, the protection of the damage, the energy resistance of the protective elements, the hidden guards that let the enemy ignore the target, and the brain is displayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cousin of Cooper stood next to the prince, and held up the holy emblem of the Lord of the Morning, and sang a hymn. A translucent shield visible to him around him rose, and all the close creatures felt uncomfortable, just wanting to move away quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lizards are barely standing up, and the dragon has already landed before leaving the open space. The huge body with fierce impact crushed the stone bricks on the castle courtyard and the gravel mixed in the mud and splashed around. Hey ashamed on the wall. The 20-meter square courtyard can only accommodate one dragon's body, and the other two have to stop on the tower. The sharp claws pinch the stone exterior wall, just like the ordinary human paper cups, squeaking. One of the dragons sighed with contempt. Then smash the tail to Cooper Pastor. The anti-bioshield shattered like a fragile crystal hood, and a gust of wind swept across the walls of the city. Prince Aaron stepped back half a step, and Evan held out his hand behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the pastor of the Lord of the Morning, you must not let go!" Pastor Cooper is in danger. Raise the holy emblem high. A spell of golden spells floats in midair, emitting the energy of flames around. If the enemy takes an aggressive behavior, the Holy Emblem will launch a fierce counterattack and throw the flame at the attacker, not endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't make trouble!" The dragon in the courtyard screamed and then slowly deformed in the eyes of everyone. He turned into a human middle-aged man, about 40 years old, tall and straight, gray and white, a pair of grim stars exudes fearful majesty. Although he only wore ordinary linen robes, he had no weapons in his hands. But the people present have a feeling that if he wants to, even the bare hands can tear the strongest armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dragon name is too long, so you are allowed to call me Zanggeweier." The man transformed by the dragon said: "I belong to the Platinum Dragon, It is the blood of the royal family of the metal dragons. The magic of the mortal is hard to affect us, the weapons can't wear our protection, and the armor can't protect you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The light of the Lord of the Morning is not the power of the mortal. You must not act rashly," said Pastor Cooper. After his shield was broken, he did not know what kind of magic to apply protection for a time, so now he can only rely on one mouth to negotiate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zange Weil did not pay attention to Pastor Cooper. He sniffed his nose and sniffed his gaze, looking as if he was looking for something. This ignorance made the surrounding knights feel more stressed, and their hands sneaked into the hilt. There are several impulses to pull the weapon out slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd is very nervous. He knows that if the Cavaliers pull out their weapons, they will inevitably turn into a big battle. If there are only three dragons, then the life of the castle owners may be victorious, then what about the other forty more in the sky? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Prince took a deep breath and walked out from the wall of the paladin who guarded him, standing on the steps leading to the courtyard. Holding the hilt, he said: "I am Aaron. Stars III, in the name of my ancestors, the prince of the kingdom of stars, the heir to the throne, now the black blood castle is under my jurisdiction. All metal dragons are friends of the starry kingdom, you three What is the price?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A roar was uploaded from the sky, and the hovering dragons seemed to be impatient. The strong Longwei put it in and out, as if you took a shot on the shoulders of everyone. Some people have been beaten down; some people are swaying and twisting; some are not moving, as thick as mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one that is completely unaffected. Siegel walked out of the tower with a wand and didn't seem to feel the oppression of Longwei. He doesn't know how to win in the face of the dragon. I think that even the easy-shaped ones can't hold on for the long time under the siege of fifty super-large dragons. But even if it fails, fight with your master, brother, and lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet knocked hard, but Siegel’s spell casts the door lock completely, and it’s impossible to break the door. Although her intention to fight is clear, Siegel thinks this is not a kitten fight, so the cast spell locks her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to breaking the game is under the prince. Siegel thought that as long as the prince was cast a spell, so that he had the opportunity to escape the dragon's awareness, then Count Todd would see hope. He will let His Royal Highness try to break through, which will drive the whole battle: Evan will definitely follow along, and Sir Bill is also likely to be a guard. Then the wizard came back to look for Janet, two people either hiding in the castle or getting into the mountains. In this way, most of the people Siegel cares have hopes for life. As for the count and the pastor, they should all stay, as the bait after the break and the dragon to fight to the end. Compared with everyone, die here. This is already the best solution that Siegel can think of. But the key is to release the spells quickly and urgently, but also to balance accuracy and concealment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst case did not happen. When Siegel appeared, Zanggewell brows and the dragon in the sky no longer screams. Quietly hovering around the castle. The other two platinum dragons on the tower jumped down and changed into two young women in the air, and they landed on the ground and stopped at Zanggeweier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair of women look very similar, all with long white hair and shawl. It has a metallic white skin, a strong, slender nose, and a pale red lips. Their eyes are different, one is a light green eyes; the other is a different color, one is amber and the other is sapphire blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the one we are looking for." Zanggewell nodded to Siegel, and someone at the venue focused on him. The mage did not know what this was, so he did not relax his vigilance and always treated the three dragons with a guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Slightly wait, don't move." The three dragons that turned into human figures said in unison. They recited a spell in their mouth, but Siegel felt that it was neither Master Magic. Nor is it a pastor's deity, not even energy fluctuations. The mage felt a little itchy on his right hand, looked down and saw a soft white smoke rising slowly. Although it is smoke, it has no smell and does not cause touch. It just slowly forms a shape of a dragon in the air. Siegel glanced at it and recognized that the faucet was in Lonclaja in the passageway of the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's mouth formed by the smoke opened and closed, but there was no sound coming out, at least they could not hear it. The three people who were formed by the dragons bowed their heads to listen carefully, and nodded from time to time. The whole scene is a bit strange. No one can dare to move in the pressure of the dragon. For a time, the Black Blood Castle fell into absolute silence, leaving only the wind blowing the flags and the robes. Fortunately, this scene did not last long. After about three minutes, the faucet of smoke formed turned around and turned to Siegel. "I said I want to thank you," and then disappeared. The three "Dragons" stood up, and Zanggewei looked at the two women standing behind him, frowning, and said a few words in a rushing and vague language. Siegel studied the Dragon language, although it was mainly studied for the study of magical spells. Not very proficient, but I can also know that although Zanggewei is a dragon, it is not a dragon language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it." Zanggewell suddenly said in lingua franca. He turned and said to Siegel: "Human Master, according to the instructions of our ancestral spirit, you can choose one in the Chimer Canyon or the Holy Mountain. In your lifetime, it will be yours. Territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Siegel watched the dragon with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because this is the instruction of our ancestral spirit Lonclaja, nothing more." Zanggewei said with some impatience: "Come on, Don't delay the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at Sir Bill, but the latter doesn't know where these two places are. Maps are a very cherished resource. Just as Giant Kerry never knew the detailed topographic map of the North, he rarely saw the map of the world. Fortunately, there is a person who has mastered this knowledge: Prince Aaron is the first heir to the kingdom of stars, and he has the most detailed map of the world in his education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
