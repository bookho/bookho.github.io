Sorke sighed In one breath, then said: "Compared to Aaron, his performance is much better, but compared with his father, there is still a big gap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"He is still young, has enough time to learn and grow, we are all like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly understand this. But the problem is His enemies have not been updated, and they have not weakened at all compared with the past.” Salk said: “I believe that you understand this truth. Victory is not about potential, but current strength.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a kind of sophistry, but it is not entirely unreasonable." Siegel said: "But who are you talking about? I don't want to continue to guess the riddle. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it? The old king is such a son of two, Aaron Evan’s feelings are very good, and the kingdom’s eyes are going to be smooth and rainy. Then, on a trip to the New World, Aaron’s body is severely damaged and his life expectancy is greatly shortened. His Majesty is also thinking about whether Evan will inherit the throne. He knew that Evan needed to be trained and trained, and he had made a series of plans for him. At this time, an accident of hunting led to the death of the king, and even the important script had not been released to declare the world. The whole kingdom must be drawn into the civil strife by the contradictions of the two princes. Who can benefit from this matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Either one is possible The people who boarded the highest throne in the war are all suspects. Do you want to explain this?” Siegel shook his head and said, “This is a possible thing, but it’s actually implemented. Too complicated. Even if someone thinks this way. Who can guarantee the execution of the entire plan? I can't think of someone who can do this. And what about the evidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "How can such a high execution force be possible?" Leave evidence. Marquis adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what you said is just one side of the word. I admit that these things are very coincidental, but only to this extent. And let's go around and the final question to be discussed is the assassination of the conspirators. What did you do to make them hate you so much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Loyal to the kingdom, this may be my only good quality. "Salke smiled and twisted his hands together: "Who do you think led to the handover of the kings of Aaron and Evan?" Who first put this thought in the mind of King Aaron? The old king has this will, I will realize it, and also avoid the division of the country. This reason is enough for me to be the object of being killed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I admit that you are worth killing if this is an honor." Siegel nodded. "I can promise to protect you." But there is a prerequisite: this thing must be prepared for His Majesty. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What would he do according to your understanding of Evan? Strengthening the defense of the palace, or deliberately numb the enemy, ready to kill them all? Seriously, I think the latter is more likely. How to say it again, now more like a swordsman, and he will only start after the enemy appears. This is an excellent quality, guaranteeing that he will not hurt innocent. But this is not the safest for a king. The Orthodox Church had existed for a long time, and several attempts were made to kill Evan during King Aaron. But since no assassin had the opportunity to see Evan, he did not believe that there was such a sting. So after he ascended the throne, he did not immediately raise the butcher knife for this organization. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Evan did not raise the butcher's knife, Sir Bill can live to this day. Siegel began to dislike the words of Salk. Is it a king?" Must be despicable and suspicion? Although history has proved that integrity and despicable coexistence, the king of trust and suspicion can do longer and better, but... Evan is obviously not the same.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least, the former guards must know this and let them be vigilant. Siegel said: "The wiki must also be alert, he can find out by someone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is detected? "Sorke shook his head: "The Marquis, if you still believe in the intelligence dealer, then I am obviously wrong to come to you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has no way of judging whether he is telling whether it is true or not. This is not like a magical spell. It is even more troublesome than a legendary spell. "Who You can't keep going, you can hope if you are alive. Siegel could only avoid this problem and said to Salk: "To that day, if you can't find me, come to my study, or go to the magic ship." These places can protect your safety. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although murder is not a fun thing, it is also a life adjustment for Siegel. He can take this opportunity to calm down and think about where he is still doing enough, and whether there are loopholes. At that time, I am confident that I can break through the layers of defense to the assassin in front of him. Presumably, the technology will be very superb. There is still a lot of curiosity about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Sorke had guessed, His Majesty’s imperialism was not so much in his heart, but rather to comfort the general manager of the war. The guards of the palace have stepped up their defenses and strengthened their patrols in various places where they enter and exit the Star Fort. The result has passed a few days, nothing has happened, and everything is even calmer than in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this calm, the Master's Association of Goblin Conquests was finally sent to the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel got a copy of the book, the ink on some of the above places is not completely dry, it can be seen that it was written in a hurry. This plan only uses less than 2,000 words to eliminate the goblin. In summary, it is “causing a melee between the goblins and letting them destroy themselves.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is a way that Siegel thought at the beginning of studying the goblin. Even if no wizards secretly shot, the goblins have long pointed the weapons of the destruction of the world to each other, and will immediately counterattack if they encounter an attack. The weapons they reserve are enough to destroy the earth dozens of times, so this is the easiest way to eliminate the goblins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the whole earth will be completely covered by the dust, and the toxic cloud covering the sky will cover every inch of space, and no trace of sunlight can be cast. All the plants will disappear, and all the animals will become dead bones. For hundreds of years, even thousands of years, the earth will become a completely dead world, and there is no longer a condition for life to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very difficult for Siegel to accept. In order to win, can you lower your means indefinitely? According to the history of the goblins, they are just because they always do it. Siegel did not want people around him to become a bottom line and become a utilitarian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the destruction plan of more than 3,000 words, it is the core of the Masters Association program. They also know that the world of the goblin hit by their own nuclear bombs has no living value, so they set their targets on other planets of the goblin wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They proposed a world transformation plan. Using divine power, elemental power, and magic, of course, the magical spacecraft is not indispensable. The Masters Association is prepared to change the Earth's satellite environment so that it can be adapted to human and other ethnic living requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves, dwarves, humans, and other races will have new living areas, of course the orcs do not. The biggest difference between the goblin wall and the thunder wall is the breadth. It has countless stars. Unlike the wall of the thunder wall, the stars in the sky are just the projections left by the wall of the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are enough planets to colonize, the only problem is just the goblins blocking the entrances and exits, and these goblins have placed weapons on each other's neck. . The Mage Association paints a world that is large enough, and even the magical array that makes the environment, the breathable air, the soil that can be planted, and the potable water is ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seemingly beautiful plan, but Siegel smelled an unusual taste. Being able to support such a plan is not something that can be done with a few magical arrays. The most important thing is that the Masters Association is not written in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only relying on the Urgen nuclear to provide enough powerful energy, those magical arrays that transform the weather and geological level can only work; only rely on the magic spaceship to be able to Going to the planets for colonization; only by erecting a more powerful continuous transmission channel can a large number of people be transferred to the colonial planet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a problem that one or two secret nuclear cores can solve. Siegel had calculated that if he wanted to initially carry out the plan of the Masters Association, it would take at least ten Secrets to be able to establish a stable small environment for the original pioneers to use. Then the number of nuclear cores will continue to rise, and the more initial quantities, the faster the environment will be transformed. In order to complete the engineering of a planet within a hundred years, at least two hundred secret nuclear cores are needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good poison!" Siegel put down the plan and his teeth were tight. He can think of the pressure that comes after it, and whether this secret can be given or not. If you don't give it, countless shackles and shackles will follow, and there will surely be people who will help in the dark and completely smear Siegel's reputation. Although this will not reduce Siegel's own magical power, it is likely to cause him to lose the help of the outside world, and even the control of the Masters Union will decline. The buzz does not hurt people, but it is enough to isolate people, and the Masters Association is playing this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
