			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone thinks that the residence of the three-eyed warlord Lund is surrounded by a barracks in the center of the city, this awkward orc has been at his flagship. Remote control command. This technique is a good way to hide his whereabouts, and it is very annoying for the ambitions who want to seize his power, and the diehards who want to avenge the last warlord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this also caused a certain lag in his command efficiency. In normal times, Lund uses a tough military law to stipulate the mission that each unit must complete. Death is the only end to the violation of the order. This method worked well, but in response to the unexpected incident, Lund found that he was out of touch with the troops at once, and saw that the city was in a double threat of chaos and fire, but lacked immediate command. So he ordered his ship to land immediately, and returned to Macabu with his most elite and trusted men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way to the port, he found a man waving a flame warhammer, wearing a squid cloak at the shipyard for sabotage. He immediately understood the purpose of mankind, and immediately ordered his men to prepare for the battle of the sea, and personally aimed. This warship, named No Trace, was blessed by the Beastmaster and, like its masters, believed in secret operations and sudden cold arrows. The hull rarely reflects light, and the magical ship on the hull always exudes spell fluctuations that neglect its existence. The giant python on the deck has also been specially modified to greatly delay the speed of sound transmission, which can cause the sound to be unsuccessful and the effect of the arrow first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel just rolled over the ground, the mud hit his cloak and armor, and then slammed it on his face, making him look embarrassed. He looked at the black ship at the harbour with a lingering fear and did not dare to relax. The ship is still quiet, seemingly calm and dangerous. The mage knows that he has encountered the most difficult enemy to deal with: always hiding the murder, always surprise, always low-key and cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s still a fledgling, Siegel’s growing up is no longer a danger because of impulsive impulses. He always remembers that his purpose is to destroy the shipyard, not to confront the orc army or the strong. So he immediately squatted and hid behind the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under the squat, don't look up!" Siegel shouted in the orc language. "Be careful to attack the city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the reason for the port, the black ship is slow and does not seem to be moving. Siegel, who is familiar with maritime affairs, understands that this is just the illusion caused by the current, and there should be tensions in the mood. The enemy has already stared at him, and the giant scorpion that was not sent is prepared for him. If not, are those flustered fugitives better targets? Siegel recalled the scenes of the previous battles. When dealing with the double-headed trolls, they didn't use spells. Then the people on board should not know that there are still casters. The mage thought for a moment, using wool again as a casting material, he had to perform a more elaborate illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hides behind the box and creates an identical self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although both are illusory, making static objects and mimicking creatures is completely difficult, not to mention the illusion that makes the illusion look alive. . His forehead is constantly sweating, his eyes are not afraid to squat, and all his concentration is devoted to the control of the spell. The magical energy flows through his blood vessels as the heart beats, causing a subtle effect on the stability of the spell. It is difficult to notice these details in peacetime. After all, who will listen to their pulse all the time? Siegel took a few deep breaths and controlled himself to calm down. In his eyes, now there is no other than magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black ship launched an attack again, and a smashing arrow shot the pile of goods hidden in the Siegel. Lung's mouth showed a cruel smile, and he was confident in his power. "I thought it would be safe to hide behind a wooden box? Even if it is a stone wall, I have to shoot it for you!" He did not choose the box center, but aimed at the box relatively far from the black ship, because the orc warlord looked too Many "curious cowards" know a lot about their psychology that they are afraid of death and want to know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The box contains more than a dozen bottles of wine, which are smashed together with broken wood and broken wood. A black shadow flew over Siegel's nose, and red wine, sharp pottery and wood chips slammed into the side as rain. Siegel was shocked, but with great perseverance, he controlled the fluctuations of the spell. When he said that it was too late, he waved his finger and ordered his phantom to rush to the open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master does not believe that there is only one bow on the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the second and third hairpins came together, pinching the phantom of Siegel one after the other. This is the moment to test the Master's "acting skills." Like the marionette, each of Siegel's fingers is commanding the details, and the spell he recites in his mouth maintains the stability of the entire spell. I saw the Siegel Phantom take a big step forward, avoiding a giant scorpion, but was hit by another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel still dared not relax the control of magic, and used the remaining light of the corner of his eyes to observe the surrounding situation. Half of the box he had hidden had been shattered, but the remaining half still obscured the view of the black ship towards the shore - and vice versa. Thanks to an elf master, Siegel learned a simple battlefield organization from her, including the techniques of hiding and ambushing, which was chosen to be in a hidden position. However, it is still not taken lightly. The first suspected enemy is a self-consciousness. Siegel estimates that the three-eyed warlord Lund will not believe in the effect of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, it’s a slap in the eye, nailed to the left shoulder of the Segal phantom. The spell fluctuated again, but fortunately, it was not necessary to create the illusion of "corpse flight", and the control difficulty was reduced. Siegel made his body look even more horrible, and at the same time tried to satisfy the orc's "aesthetic point of view", bloodier, more miserable, and better able to satisfy Lund's appetite - lest he continue to stay here to "fill the knife." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be satisfied with his own results. It seems that he does not have to waste his arrows on the body. The black ship gently turned a corner and floated to the mooring pier. The pier is less than three miles away from here, and the running is instantaneous, leaving little time for the fugitive brigade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master does not dare to use the warhammer of fire, he does not want to provoke the anger of the orc warlord. He marched forward and waited for the wall of the third shipyard before waving to the people behind him to catch up. In the place where Sanfa 弩 汇 gathers, the illusion slowly disappears, and the experience and understanding that can be brought to Siegel will remain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There can't stay here." Siegel said to Zucker: "Through the shipyard, advancing to the left wall, you can see here. Pier. This place has a docking dock in addition to shipbuilding, so you have a dock. You are optimistic about the people behind, let us go on board."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half Orcs Nodded, he finally waited for the news. Several gladiators also breathed a sigh of relief. If Siegel continued to do nothing to destroy the dock, they would immediately rebel, hacking the human wizard and then appealing to the orc warlord, maybe there is still a way to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female shooter Mana ran over and it seemed that she had survived a hard battle to survive. She has cut wounds on her legs and arms. Until now, she has not had time to dress up, and there are still blood flowing down. Her hair was burned, and now there is only a short cut, and the wolf is very embarrassing. She now has only one orc's short sword in her hand, and her arm is still on her waist. There are ten or so feather arrows in it, but there is no longbow to launch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Mana asked: "Why do you know my name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Siegel stunned for a moment, only to remember that he has always been a fake face, or easy to be a one-eyed look, or a "semi-finished" face. It’s been a long time to disguise, and the Master is forgetting that he has several layers of skin. To make a long story short, he replied: "I am Siegel, who bought you with a dragon tooth dagger in the slave market." Siegel did not notice his own mistakes and continued: "What about the other people? Shipyard Destroyed a few?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Mana snorted, but Siegel’s stern eyes made her wake up: "The Earl of Maxim The alchemist is going to arrange the magic array, and it is estimated that there will be results soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, a shipyard has not been destroyed until now. Siegel shook his head, but also knew that it was not a time to compete or show off. At least one archer in the team is also good. He handed his long bow, including the feather arrow, together. Later, he placed a piece of Yan Jingjing in the potentine potion and threw it in the direction behind him. If the orc Lund sent troops to catch up, maybe this thing can slow down their pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mana, watch the chase after your temple, don't fight, don't fall behind." Siegel said: "I went to the front to find a good ship." "Before you don't understand the real plan of the Piaget and his party, he still needs to be careful to guard Mana." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female shooter wants to stop, but still goes to the end of the team. Siegel rushed to the front with the urging of the half-orc. There are three ships parked in the berth of the dock. One is obviously a loading ship to and from the river. As soon as it leaves the sea, it will be overturned by wind and waves. The other is a cargo ship, which looks like the shipbuilding process of the starry kingdom. Unfortunately, the stern and the place there. The rudder was burned and, at first glance, it was known to be a masterpiece of the orc pirate. The last ship was a dual-purpose warship. Forty ships were placed on either side of the hull and are now in a stowed state. The ship has two masts, but only the sails are hung on the eaves, and the main masts are bare. Now is not a critical time, Siegel believes that he can use the deputy to drive the boat out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
