			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning sun appears particularly late, not surprising in the winter in the north. The smoke from the bacon town is covered with smoke, and it is not scattered in the air for a long time. The town is full of flesh and blood and the burning of wood. This burning and taste will last for a long time until the snow falls in the sky and cover them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel climbed out of the waste cellar, in case he still maintained the form of zombies. The common wizard's spells let the orcs kill each other. These powerful guys have no intention of staying in the fight, so they are either dead or surrounded by dead people who have no hope. After a night of chaos, the town is finally quieter. In addition to the burning sound of the house, even the sound of the sound is rarely heard. Siegel wandered through the ruins, stepping on the soil mixed with blood, and carefully avoiding the broken limbs scattered around. Until the surrounding smell made him unbearable, he chose to use the sputum form to shield it. While walking, Siegel collects weapons and equipment. Although the orc's blacksmith craftsmanship is very general, he still found a delicate long sword from several dead captains - seeing work should be a trophy of a looting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s goal is clear, that is, the House where Knox is a sorcerer. Except for the orcs who were deliberately released, there should be only one place where there may be living people. Siegel wants to ask what kind of plans the Commonwealth has, whether they are allies of the Masters Federation, and whether they can cooperate in the next step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is still a distance from the house of the witch festival, Siegel has already felt the huge energy fluctuations in front of him, and he is also in the vision for the first time. Found colors. In the black-and-white world, a purple-red flame rises slowly and stops burning in the air. It emits light that can penetrate walls and dirt. When the light shines on Siegel, he has a feeling of intimacy and yearning, which is very rare for the scorpion form. Siegel thought about it and opened up the etheric vision, so he re-visited the cloud of grievances above his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud is still there, but no painful face is tumbling inside, it seems that it is just a black cloud. The fuel of the purple-red flame is the dark cloud, and the faster it burns, the faster it will surpass the dark clouds. At this moment, a spell of voices began, and the dark clouds formed a whirlpool, rushing into the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel followed the curse and found the past, and surely saw the common-headed bald sorcerer casting spells. Like the skilled craftsmen, the blacksmiths will carefully look at the long swords they made, and the sorcerer carefully controls the burning of the flames. The purple-red light is getting brighter and brighter, more and more concentrated, and gradually lowering the height. When the clouds of grievances burned out, the flames immediately went out and became a piece of brilliant ruby, falling in the hands of the common sorcerer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid disturbing the person’s casting process, Siegel stood by and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Success, this must be the most perfect inflammatory soul crystal." The sorcerer carefully looked at the jewel in his hand with a loving eye, just like a parent. Looking at a newborn baby, the expression is not disturbed by the outside world. Siegel made a snap, and the crisp snoring finally caught the attention of the sorcerer. His expression was first shocked and then relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You come so fast, I really didn't expect it." The sorcerer said: "It seems that the master has foreseen my success, so I sent you here." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the sorcerer recognizes me as another person, but there are others who can become jealous, or is that person originally awkward? Siegel thought about it, just use this misunderstanding to explore their true thoughts, but the language should pay attention to some skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and simply replied: "Success is inevitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But the quality of Yan Ling Jing is unparalleled, Master Kasper will be happy." The man spoke while throwing the ruby ​​in his hand. Siegel grabbed it agilely and put it in his hands. He can only feel the powerful magical energy, and the etheric vision can also see the core of the gem that beats like a heart. They seem to be sealing something in the ruby, and then injecting the energy of the wraith cloud so that it activates and moves. However, Siegel couldn't see how to use this ruby ​​for a while, nor what the power inside could do. He just followed the words of the sorcerer: "Yes, the amazing quality, the master will be very satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please be sure to explain this to him It is a tribute from his humble student, Sado."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The will of the master will be carried out, and the red flame will shine through the universe!" said Sergeant Sado: "There will be a second sacred crystal in the city wall, and the red tower will stand up."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you choose the target?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Blood Castle." Sado bowed his head and said smugly: "Gathered there. With enough corpses, it is very beneficial to use the Soul Ghost spell. And the quality of human soul is higher than that of the orcs, and I am confident that I can create a more perfect soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fortunately, there will be no expression on his face, or Siegel will definitely show flaws. When he heard the Black Blood Castle, he already knew that the other party was an enemy. There is no problem in the orc's town to display killing spells. The battlefield situation is complicated and cannot save those slaves. Although helpless, Siegel can understand. But what is the fortress that destroys mankind? This is already called a traitor and a traitor. Siegel inferred the purpose of the Knox Brotherhood. They seemed to use all means to make the whole situation more chaotic, let the killing continue, and then collect the Soul Crystal to build the Red Tower. Siegel doesn't know what the effect of the Soul Crystal and the Red Tower, but he can't watch the Sorcerer go to the Walls, because Janet and others are probably in the Black Blood Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to find a way to leave him, Siegel thinks. Based on his own inference, he tempted and said: "This is the end of the tears of the wilderness. Can you guarantee that a few orcs who have fled the desert can cause the turmoil here?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tears of the wilderness?" The face of the sorcerer suddenly showed a look of alert, and the wand was caught in his hand. "Who are you? Tell me your name!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know my name." Siegel replied. He understands that pronouns should be used more when questioning, because the actual nouns are easily destroyed and disguised. It seems that the battle is inevitable, but Siegel still has to take advantage of the first mover. He secretly ordered the blind man to use the ability of the undead to transform and transform himself toward the zombies. The sorcerer was attracted to the attention, his vigilant eyes caught a curious look, and the Raven Barron was quietly approaching from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am one of the four, I cross the boundaries between life and death, both the long sword in the sun and the fire in the dark." He began to make up his own, and slowly paced, quietly getting closer to the sorcerer. "On behalf of the master, I thank you for your masterpiece and reward you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie!" The wizard raised his wand and the red light gathered at the tip of the wand: "Go to death, Then change the Yan Ling Jing to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel ordered the raven to launch an attack. The original plan was to spur the flame down to interfere with the movement of the sorcerer. But when he noticed the high-handed wand, he had a new idea in his heart. With only one hand, Siegel threw the ruby ​​back and then squeezed an ugly smile with a rotten face. The sorcerer said more: "Really, I will reward you with a happy death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it doesn’t take a long time to say a word, For a spell duel, it can have serious consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical energy quickly merges into a raging flood, and soon it will rush from the sky. At this time Barron was closer, and his shadow crossed the eyes of the sorcerer, causing him to look up. "Awakening Master!" He immediately understood the other's abilities. The raven's claws pierced the sorcerer's wrist, stuck between the wrist and the metacarpal, and cut several tendons. At the same time, Barron's sharp squats into the back of the enemy's hand, inserted from the middle of several phalanxes, and precisely cut off the muscles and blood vessels. This is also the benefit of Siegel's transformation into a skeleton. It is very familiar to the structure of the human skeleton, especially the structure and movement of the hand. It is this kind of "just like the palm" that allows Siegel to accurately command the action of the raven. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand of the sorcerer was bloody, the finger was involuntarily released, and the wand fell. He resisted the pain, and he quickly caught the wand with his left hand and took the spell to Siegel. A large net of flames enveloped the space near Siegel, and it was almost impossible to run away from the legs. However, it is estimated that because of the concern of the immune cold injury, the sorcerer chose the flame magic, and this is precisely the opportunity for Siegel to counterattack with the flame weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large net made up of flames has no entity, it can't be picked up or opened with weapons, but it can be touched by flame creatures. With the special design of the instrument, Siegel can use the element summoning spell very quickly. Although it is only a few small fire elements that are not the size of a fist, they can open the corner of the fire net and leave enough space to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master is rolling over the ground, and can't escape the scope of the Fire Network. At this time, the sorcerer had already opened the raven. He had five more holes in his right hand. Now he can only tremble on his side, and there is no way to cast spells. The Knox Synagogue is best at mental control spells, but it has no effect in the face of undead creatures such as scorpions and zombies, which makes Siegel a big deal at the beginning of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
