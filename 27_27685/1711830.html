			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next," Half-orc auctioneer volleyed a whip: "A healthy male accountant who can write a calculation, eighty gold coins!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slave market was finally reopened under pressure, and even the warlords couldn’t really ignore the demands of the generals. The slave trade association rushed early in the morning, shutting up a string of slaves into cages, set up a high platform, and let a big-name auctioneer concentrate on selling. When asked why they were not divided into several stores to trade separately, the Chamber of Commerce just smiled and said nothing. Siegel probably guessed what they thought: to make the momentum bigger and show their strength to the three-eye Long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this idea must be lost. Siegel looked at the soldiers around the auction house and thought about it. The basis of the slave trade is that the orcs continue to win, so they rely on the warlords, not the other way around. Fortunately, the "death squad" of Deepwater City arrived today. If it is shipped directly to the dock one day in advance, it is not good or bad. If it is two days later, it is difficult for Siegel to predict what twists and turns will be encountered in the slave market. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nobody wants?" The auctioneer saw that everyone was not interested in an old man, so he shouted: "With a gnome, he is an accountant." You can help errands and manage your accounts. You can also let them perform tumbling and singing. When you use the whip to pump up, he rolls round and good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After finishing, the auctioneer twitched the whip and smacked it on the gnome's arm. Siegel could see the anger in the eyes of the dwarf, but under the threat of being re-raised by the high whip, he had to tumbling on the stage and making a funny scream. Siegel raised a hand and shouted in the orc language: "Seventy gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The starting price is eighty gold coins, one-eyed. The auctioneer pointed the whips to Siegel and said with a smile: "You don't have a good old man's ear, 80 gold coins start!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel refers to There is a cage behind the auctioneer, where a yellow short-legged dog is arrogant. "When you whip, the dog is screaming, apparently the pet of this gnome. With the dog, I give a hundred gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The orcs around are laughing, and some are spitting on the ground. "You are too cheap. A trained dog is worth 30 gold coins. Do you want to buy all the one hundred gold coins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Geer simply ignored these remarks, and if they wanted, the bidding would be. At this time, the orcs are obsessed with fighting and robbery. It is useless to write a slave that can be counted. If it is a young female slave, it is different. Gnomes can neither go to the battlefield nor go to bed, but they can only waste food, so Siegel is not worried that someone will bid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auctioneer is exhausted, but the audience mostly sit on wooden benches and drink, and some slaves are responsible for handing the cured meat. Those real buyers are the orc centurions, both ambitious and not short of money. Siegel saw long swords, flying axes and daggers, and several people wore armor under the cloak. They are still mainly watching the excitement, and the goods in the back will really attract their interest, especially those who are burly and strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody bids, Siegel bought "accounting", "gnome" and dog with one hundred gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the no-facer, the entire team is a total of seven people - the dog is just a mount, not counting - five need to buy. They tried various methods to get into Macabu, but after paying two lives they could only choose to be sold. If it weren’t for the orc’s front line to transport the looted loot to the rear, they couldn’t even use this method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be like a slave, they discarded the exquisite armor, the smooth weapon, and threw all the supplies in the desolate ice and snow. The faceless said: The old man is an alchemist who is responsible for making the bomb of ignition; the gnome is his assistant and the pastor of the god of illusion, responsible for disguising these bombs. The old man with red beard is the count, and he and the two remaining assassins are responsible for the defense of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two Confedition mages, but one died from the long bow of the orc patrol, and the other foot suffered from frostbite, and basically could not walk. The use of flying was discovered by the witchcraft, and then the chasing of the wolf cavalry was brought. In the case of a last resort, the count let him fly south. As long as the dead is alive, no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next lot, a warrior," the auctioneer shouted. The old man and the gnome could not attract everyone's interest. The scene was a bit cold, so the half-orc auctioneer changed the order. "Look at this muscle and teeth. It is a healthy slave. After you buy it, take it with you. As long as your gold medicine is enough, he can stop you and kill the enemy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which first bid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three hundred." An orc with a big yellow tooth called, everyone looked at it and stopped paying attention because he The armor of the body is broken and the owner does not have any money. "Three hundred and fifty." One is like a black bear, and it is a hair, occupying a huge orc who has a two-person position to increase the price. The chain armor of this man is pieced together with multiple sets of armor, and it is placed on the body indiscriminately. The black body hair is drilled out of the chain buckle, like a weed. His weapon is a huge steel mace with a lot of bumps on it. Siegel saw the sinister look from his eyes, and estimated that he bought the warrior slaves not just for war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Add one more." A female orc with a huge chest shouted loudly, her eyes were more intense. Several orcs laughed loudly, and the auctioneer gave her an annoyed look, but did not reject the offer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs are the poorest races on the entire New World. They have neither gold nor commodities, they only have looted teams. There are very few people who dare to come to the orc to do business here. Even smugglers need to be brave enough. So the orcs hoarded a lot of gold and silver coins that were looted, all thrown into the slave trade and wine. The price of slaves is high, but it is nothing for the orcs. After all, their money is also robbed. If you keep it, you can't eat it, you can't drink it, and you can't buy anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a lot of money is also an act that highlights the strength of the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four hundred," Siegel raised his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four hundred and fifty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Add one."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thinks that the addition of a female orc is a mess, and she will soon make the violent orcs around her angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to make the scene confusing, Siegel thought, it would be serious to end this ridiculous auction early. "Six hundred," he shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This price slows down the entire auction, which is close to the upper limit of a slave warrior price. Unless he can show the skills of riding or archery again, as an infantry, it takes a long time to earn back the cost. The auctioneer intends to let the slave warriors perform martial arts to raise the price, but the warrior is smart to pretend to miss and throw the wooden sword on the auctioneer's stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally Siegel bought the slave at the price of 630 gold coins. When he dragged his head and stood with the old man, the gnome and the dog, the old man whispered to him, "Tim, you shouldn't provoke the auctioneer. It's not wise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just can't get used to his ugly face." The young man spit on the ground and replied, "Reassure, I have not hurt him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man shook his head and felt that he couldn’t talk to the stupid guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several auctions, there was a young human woman, "a newlywed lady of a lord", who was photographed for a high price of five hundred gold coins. This woman's chest and ass are big, the appearance can only be considered average, but the orc will not serve her as a princess, only let her continue to give birth, so the face looks like it will not care. She was crying when she was pulled up, and she burst into tears when she dragged it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill has said that no one can save everyone in the world, even God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the bloody knight Count Maxim. He was originally a brown-red hair and eyebrows, and the same color of the beautiful beard, but for the sake of this action shaved, so that the head is like a smooth egg. He is already in his fifties, but he still insists on practicing riding and swordsmanship every day, so his body is still strong and he does not lose to young people. So he was tied to a triple shackle like a young soldier: feet, hands and neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A strong warrior, experienced, on the battlefield, the five half-beast talents were captured." The auctioneer took the count and a whip. He shouted loudly: "And he won't seduce your female slave. His old one has no other ability besides picking up the sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl is still moving It is as if the whip has not hit his own flesh, and there is no blood mark on the back. It seems that the old man who is locked up is still a dangerous person. The thick, thick arms and broad shoulders on his tiger's mouth, coupled with an unruly look, make him look like a bad training. Beast. The auctioneer took a few more lashes and the count did not wrinkle his brow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it? It is a hero." The auctioneer shouted: "Whether it is placed in the arena or used as a meat target, there is a great future. Starting at four hundred gold coins, how do you see it?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned and felt that the auctioneer had some changes. He said that it would only increase the price of slaves and light the sails of Siegel. Didn't the faceless person have already discussed with him? These slaves can't fall into the pockets of others. Now how do things start to develop in a bad direction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five hundred gold coins!" There was a half-orc screaming, he was wearing a scales, and there was a yellow short cloak behind him, which looked strange. On the cloak, one eye was painted with red paint. This is the red-eyed general Ruger, one of the confidants of the three-eye warlord Lund. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dared to bid with him for a while, the scene was cold. The auctioneer frowned and hesitated to hold the whip. I don't know if it should be sipped. He stared at the one-eyed old man and looked at the young slave. His stomach is still hurting. He was just beaten by the wooden sword to make him lose his ugliness. He will not be willing to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Add one more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel really wants to kiss this female orc, Her shouting renewed the situation on the field. Several orcs laughed, and the red-eyed men rushed to the female orcs and began to punch and kick with her men. The female orc was not to be outdone, and the sticks that were as thick as the thighs joined the battle, and the scene became chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seven hundred gold coins," Siegel approached the front desk and said: "Seven hundred gold coins, please give me a deal."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auctioneer snorted and shouted: "Seven hundred gold coins, seven hundred gold coins, and there is no higher offer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Eight hundred gold coins, I value this price." No one expected that Count Maxim actually spoke, and was to increase the price for himself. "This price should be directly available for sale. I don't want to continue to visit people on this table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stared at Maxim and forced to rush Suddenly his thoughts were squeaky. What kind of idiot is this, and at this time there is still a look of pride. When shaving my eyebrows and beard, did I shave my brain? In the history of the nobility battle, the Earl's ransom must be at least 800 gold coins. Siegel understands the origin of this price, but now it is not a heroic battlefield, just an orc slave market, why is it still entangled in the problem of worth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was already someone shouting "seven hundred and fifty gold coins" on the sidelines, and the auctioneer looked at Siegel with his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eight hundred gold coins, give me a direct deal." The Master whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, no one will continue to follow up at this price, and the auctioneer will hand over the chain of the Earl to Siegel. The count is still standing tall, just as he is still a regular victory general. Siegel gave him a punch in his stomach, and he did not keep his hand. The strength of the use was even impossible for the giants of the hills. Earl wowed out and poured it into his vomit. "Old accounting" and "Gnomish follow-up" saw this scene, the expression on the face was distorted, and only the young warrior was called by Siegel, responsible for carrying the unconscious count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, a young archer." The auctioneer shouted loudly, the orcs cheered and whistled. The archers are most welcomed by the slave owners. They kill the enemy fast and are not easy to die. They are also better controlled, especially when compared with the knife and shield. Such goods will inevitably produce high prices, but the enthusiasm of the orcs will not be reduced because of the high price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel went back and found that this person was the last one to buy. The auctioneer seems to have forgotten the previous agreement and made the audience more excited with the passionate commentary. In the end, he suddenly waved his hand, calmed everyone down, and gave the "one-eyed daddy" a provocative look. He suddenly said: "And, according to my observation, this archer is still a girl!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he pulled the clothes on the chest of his hand and exposed the chest wrapped in the cloth. Although not big, it is indeed a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene was quiet for two seconds and the first offer appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One thousand gold coins!" This is just the earliest one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
