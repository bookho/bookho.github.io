			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with the use of spiritual vision, Siegel could not see the vents on the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is not formed by magic, but the defects of the eyes are caught, making people unable to detect." The gnome pointed to his glasses: "This This technique can be used to trick most of the spells. It is very clever. Only by using a variety of lenses to change, I can see some clues. But the vents are not big, I can barely pass, but your body size is difficult to pass." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can narrow my height, it's not too difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I am The person who arranges the defensive measures will set a spell to remove the transformation in the passage - you are likely to be pinched in a narrow passage." The gnome said: "And love is not here, I don't know the end of the vent. Will there be other traps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you don't have to go through the ventilation holes, I can dig directly into the mountain wall." Siegel touched here The mountain is just an ordinary rock and will have no resistance in front of the earth element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can this mission be a storm?" asked the gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Better not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then will dig through the wall as the last choice. I have seen many dungeons. There are many ways to prevent digging walls. It is difficult to prevent them from being there. The most troublesome thing is that only after entering the interior can you know which means they used."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, and Yao’s words made sense. He closed his eyes and placed his hands on the mountain wall, feeling the magical fluctuations around him. Behind the layers of rock, in the gap between the stone and the soil, the energy of the elemental enchantment is transmitted darkly. What is the spell? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master looked around and picked a large stone that could be caught in his hand and smashed it down the cliff. The vibration caused by the impact is transmitted to the mountain, changing the distance between the stones, and the magical array has a slight change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't try to resist or fix the change, it simply passed the signal caused by the change. There is indeed a raid that detects mining. And extremely sensitive. Even with the ability of the Earth Element Rune Warrior, there is no guarantee that the signal here will not be touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasional vibrations can also be used as accidents caused by falling rocks, but it takes time to dig through the stone walls. It is easy to trigger an alarm frequently, and no one will ignore such a signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no good way to dig in." Siegel said: "Although I can make continuous waves away from the cliffs. Even small ones." The tsunami hit the cliff and cover the excavation, but the risk is still too high."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t worry, think again." The gnome said: "Even if the magic defense is very Powerful, but only a part of the system. After all, Shaq Manor is in and out, and people dressed as them are also a way of thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It takes time to observe, learn, imitate, are you sure we can get it?” Siegel stood on the reef, and the rising tide of water immersed his feet. He looked up at the cliff. The salty air around him made him feel like he was back on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jie, there must be other ways, don't worry." The gnome said: "Although as a mage, Naria's level is definitely not as good as you, but in the crack She still has a lot of protective spells and spell traps. We can go back and find out what other people found, and then come with Naria."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You are right." Siegel took a deep breath. He looked in the direction of the sea, stretched his arms to embrace the vast sea, and connected his soul to the infinite space. Siegel has never heard of the mother's call, the sea is the closest to her existence. He stopped for a while. I gradually felt relaxed and my mind was much calmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like the sea, although the vastness seems to be the same. But it always surprises me." Siegel extended his hand to Yao En: "Let's get ready to climb." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK, I can't climb myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong, what did you find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm not sure, come see me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel jumped from one reef to another, and the slippery rock covered with seaweed seemed to have no effect on him. The gnome is twisted and he is very careful to choose the road to move forward. Some of the gaps between the reefs have been submerged by the sea. He couldn't jump directly, so he had to choose a path that the short legs could pass. So it is much slower than the progress of Siegel. When he finally caught up with Siegel, the Master had been kneeling in front of a rock for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yao En panting. The trousers have all been soaked, and the drip is dripping down. "Jie, let me go next time, I don't mind at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I was too focused and forgot about it." Siegel snapped a finger and the water on the gnome's trousers immediately flowed away, and the clothes became dry and comfortable again. Then he pointed to the stone in front of him and said to Yao En: "You see, this stone is new. There are only a few seaweeds on it, no shellfish attached. In my opinion, this stone exists on the coast for no more than ten days. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome looked around and said, "It's not surprising that there are several such stones around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know the sea very well, like this, the high tide is overwhelmed, and the reef that is exposed by the ebb is the easiest to attach algae and shellfish. This is not a forbidden zone of life, so this is the current There is only one possibility, that is, the stone is newly created."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who will make a reef? It’s too laborious and useless." Yao En said Come here, suddenly understand. "This is the kind of stone that has changed from the rubbery inside the Tin Man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I think so." Siegel said "The distance from the cliff is quite far. Unless they set up a trebuchet, the colloidal corpse can't be thrown at such a distance. And you see, there are no traces of impact damage on other stones around. We have seen The gums are strange, sticky and heavy. No one will walk over the reef and put it here. So the only thing left is at our feet, in the sea."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right." Yao En said: "Since they can hide the passage in the cliff, why can't they do the same thing under the sea? There must be some kind of passage under the water, and Just near this new reef. No matter what caused the death of the gums, there must be a place to abandon the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are waiting here Let me go, I will go to the sea to see." Siegel patted Yao En’s shoulder and sorted it out. Under clothes, ready for launching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, don't worry." Yao En said: "Now the tide is rising, this reef will soon be overwhelmed."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, so if you don't go any further, you won't see the water when the water is deep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not because of this "The gnome scratched his face: "I can't swim."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel snorted two times, opened the space bag, and took out some materials for formulating the drug. . He prepares some semi-finished products in his own laboratory all the year round, and it is very quick to process when needed. The underwater breathing agent is a fairly common alchemy product, and Siegel used it to find a slate that interprets the writer's text in the Tears of the Tear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea water at high tide is much more turbid than the lake water, plus Yao En who can't swim, Siegel must be careful to move forward. He tied himself to Yao's waist with a rope, otherwise a gust of water might lose the gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the epee, turned it back into the shape of the defensive staff, and used its "immovable" character as a support to control the direction at the bottom. Two people, one big and one small, walked between the reefs and rummaged through each colloidal corpse that had just turned into a rock, but found nothing. When the two were preparing to go ashore, a dark thing floated in the direction of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yao En keeps popping up in his mouth, and he forgets that he can't talk at the bottom of the water. If it weren't for underwater breathing, the gnomes had been drowned many times. Siegel held him on the surface of the water, and the two men saw it clearly. It turned out to be a mass of glue wrapped in ice, and it was pushed to the coast under the push of high tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
