			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Star Kings are built on a large plain that was once covered by forest and has now become a dense house. In the center of the plain there is a huge rock protruding from the ground, with a radius of about one kilometer, more than thirty meters above it, and the top is quite flat. On the rocky hill, there are actually three clear springs. Any lord of some minds knows that building a castle here can make a thousand years of foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in addition to the starry royal family, no lord can stand here for more than 50 years, and still can see the different styles of architecture left by the past lords. If you don't rely on the efforts of the Griffin Legion and occupy the advantage of the air, the ancestors of the Starry Royal Family can only rely on the reserves and walls of the mountains, and they can't defend in the siege battle forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the rough fortified with wood and clay, to the tall azure walls that are now reinforced with dwarf runes and elves, the stars Star Fort overlooks the entire plain. It consists of a huge and ruthless main fort, steel arrow towers in eight directions, and four deputy fortifications that can be placed on the trebuchet. It is said that they communicate with each other by platform bridges, ground passages and underground passages, all of which can guard against the attacks of the most heavy trebuchets. There are also military camps, dungeons and barns, and even underground blacksmith shops and alchemy workshops. Legend has it that during the period when it was first exchanged with the Masters Association, there was also a magic tower. However, there is no Master now, and it has become the royal library, the star-gazing station and the guest room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was once an insurmountable fortress because of the existence of the Griffin Legion. Now that the royal family has two magical spaceships and established the Air Force, the place is even more majestic. unbeatable. However, because of the emergence of insurgents in the country, a magical spacecraft patrols outside, so there is only one ship left in the Star Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking from the sky is the bustling urban area that occupies the entire plain, mansions, gardens, statues, warehouses, and wooden house hotels and noisy markets. The most lively is the pub and the courtyard, one after the other. The citizens of the capital shuttled through the streets and alleys. On the one hand, they were proud of the residents of Wangdu, and on the one hand they tried to make a living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the city and the Star Fort, that is, near the rocky mountain. There are several huge temples. The place where people gather is the place where the faith gathers, so the morning temple, the temple of war, the temple of the earth, and so on will all be headquartered here. The Elf's Moon Temple and the Dwarf's Guardian Temple also have branches here. After all, the Star Kingdom cannot be regarded as a complete human kingdom, and many other races live here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-length people, gnomes are also very busy. They put together the temples of the two races and occupied a lot of sites under the rocky mountains. They always laughed and laughed in front of the temple, and they were as busy as the festival every day. But the temple next to them is the Temple of Death, the tomb park. The only temple of death in the entire continent is located here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the murder god stole the power from the death of the past, the god of death became a simple manager. Only the ability to mourn, no longer respond to other prayers. Now the entire tomb park is surprisingly quiet, and the Assassin Guild, which was previously entrenched here, had to move out for various reasons. So in the whole noisy star king, here is the most quiet and peaceful place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various temples that surround the circle guard the core of the Star Fortress, no matter which direction they attack, they must first face the defense of the temple. At the same time, the temple itself also acts as a magical barrier, and it is basically impossible to cross the king to cast spells on the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one temple that is not at the foot of the mountain, that is, the god of knowledge and secretness, across half of the city and the fortress. Once here was the hall of the magic god, and later changed the name. in history. The mages came here to seek knowledge and receive asylum, but after the Lord of the Master, the association left the king of the stars, and the school moved into the temple of knowledge and secretness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The library that claims to be the second largest on the mainland (in fact, the largest, but the second is for the royal family, only second) is in this temple. , ** divisions and even legendary mage can gain something here. The original federation can also get support from here, but now it has become a state of tit-for-tat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what they feel like watching the Federation’s magic ship flying in the sky all day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing the Griffin Peak, the Xingsuo began to land slowly and approached the direction of the Star Fort. If you can dock directly on the berth of the patrol magic spacecraft. Isn't it just right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be hard for him, it's the colleagues of the federation." Shelley advised. This time is the time when the "Birth of the Messenger" Peters is out. He has been watching the zenith star culture on the ship for a long time. What did not lie to the goblin is to shock him. As a painter and poet, exotic culture is what makes him love and yearn for the most. In order to be able to take away two books of the "Great Humanities History" of the Zenith Stars, he agreed to the request of the Marquis of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A well-worded letter was handed to Evan in a few hours. Siegel said very simple on the above, roughly because the ship is very expensive. If you put it outside the city, you are afraid. Evan ridiculed, and then a large stroke, allowing Siegel to ride horses in the palace, which is equivalent to him can take the mount directly to the platform of the Star Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this "mount" is a magical spaceship of 333 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw people on the platform, Count Todd as a military adviser, and Earl Samson Warren as a financial adviser. Both were royals. The important person of the meeting, it seems that you are still very popular, Lord Siegel Marquis." Snow Shell Master said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Todd has been shaved, but he is still bearded and bearish. The Earl of Samson Warren is in stark contrast to him, a little fat man. Standing next to the berth of the magic spaceship, the wind in the late autumn continued to blow, and the Chancellor of the Treasury kept rubbing his nose with his hand and rubbing his cloak. It was an old fur cloak. There was no problem with the length, but the bust and waistline were far from the same, so I always took care of the Treasury Secretary’s trembling body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magic spacecraft stopped, Siegel and the Shelley Master went down, and the Orcs were behind the guards as guards. "Long time no see, Count Todd." He first greeted the old acquaintance and then said to the Chancellor of the Exchequer: "The Earl of Warren. It is a great honor to meet for the first time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This honor is ours, the Marquis of Siegel, your arrival makes the king shine." His body is very low. The chubby hand was brought to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not hold his hand, but quickly took out a small fire element furnace from the space bag. In the scope of the Urn nuclear, this small stove can warm hands and boil water, just to the finance minister who is always cold. Siegel stuffed this thing into his hand, and the other party could only thank him for accepting it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the King's Majesty? I can't wait to see him." Siegel smashed his hand. Said to Count Todd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count was a staunch supporter of King Aaron, and he spared no effort to hunt down Evan. However, when Aaron handed over the throne to his brother, he also handed over the count of Todd. Evan was not very fond of Count Todd since he was a child, especially when he was always called Evan's illegitimate child. However, Count Todd has always been loyal to the royal family. After the overlap of the throne, he was also very honest, so even as a symbol, Evan would leave him in the position of military minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He usually doesn’t talk much, he spends most of his time doing dumb, but he is unambiguous at the crucial time, always supporting the idea of ​​His Majesty. Earl Todd knew very well why Siegel came to the capital. After all, Sir Bill is the viscount under his jurisdiction. If Bill is really a rebel party, he can't take responsibility. Therefore, the old county landed naked and led the way for Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, I don't talk nonsense with you, I will take you directly to see Evan. The scenery and allusions of this palace are time to listen slowly. You don't have to waste time at this time." He looked at the Chancellor of the Treasury with great depth and then took a big step forward. It is still a knight's sect, the general's prestige, and it is very good for Siegel's taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The berth was built in the past six months, close to the ground barracks. It’s a waste of time to walk through the barracks. However, there is no way to fly with magic in the palace, so it is most convenient to pass from the air bridge. The people who met along the way, when they saw the two military and financial advisors accompanying a young man to come over, they all avoided it. Although they have never seen such a strange face. But at first glance, I know that this is a bad guy. If you jump out at this time and point to the east pointing west, which finger will cut off which finger, maybe you will get one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Palace general manager Salk wears a large and comfortable golden coat, which is a kind of silk cloth that can keep warm and does not affect walking, much like truncated pajamas. Clothes, waiting under the steps of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome to the welcome, Marquis. The King is waiting for you in the study." He showed a narrow smile. He started to say: "The kitchen is preparing for a feast. Do you have any taboos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
