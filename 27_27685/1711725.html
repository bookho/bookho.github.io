			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of this banquet was quickly spread out, only the nobles and some important figures were able to participate, but all came from the surrounding towns to try to see His Royal Highness. People are very excited. Some unseasoned knights, such as Sir Bill, have come up with their identity after hearing the news that the prince will soon be westbound. If you can join your team as a guide, there may be a good turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the day of the banquet, basically there are people with faces on the head near Ximu Town, and those who think they have reached the standard are gathered at Elvis Manor. It’s so lively. As a follower, Siegel can't enter the center's ballroom, only in the corner of the manor, but this is exactly what it is. In order to be able to get the attention of His Royal Highness, and because of the recent covenant, they have prepared a large amount of food – even the attendant area is full of food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squid carries the plate and dexterously squeezes through the crowd, approaching the target. A five-meter-long table filled with dishes, warm barbecue and freshly baked bread scented, and a huge roast wild boar stared at Siegel, provoking the young man's food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘No better than this! The squid dine in a large ham, and slammed it on the plate, then stacked a few trotters and two spoonfuls of onion sauce. He held food and returned to the corner safely with strength and agility. Here he found an empty table with a clay pot on it. Siegel picked up the pot and smelled it, and there was a sweet wine with aroma. "Perfect!" He couldn't help but admire him with his trotters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a steaming hall in the hall, and the appearance of His Royal Highness is to push the atmosphere to the **. They screamed for the health of the king and the heroic blessing of the prince, just like the knight who shouted the slogan of battle, desperately rushing to the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn guards are very familiar with such scenes, they pray for the Holy Power, let the body emit a soft light, quickly calm the excitement around, and separate a Safety zone. Everyone involuntarily opened the way for the prince, quieted down and listened to the words of His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the party begin!" The prince took the hand of Ms. Elvis and said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the music and cheers are re-emerged, and there is a lot of laughter and laughter everywhere. However, Siegel could not hear the words of the prince. He had already started his own banquet outside the house. Siegel eats and chews and quickly fills the hungry stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, this table ushered in an individual, and he sat across the Siegel with a plate of seafood. The squid looked up and looked at the shrimps and shellfish that were common in the sea on the New World. He had already been tired of eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, friend, do you know how to eat this thing?" The man asked, holding a giant rock crab, curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel still has ham stuffed in his mouth, but he can't talk, but he puts down the pig's trotters in his hand, grabs the rock crab, and quickly uses his fingers. Find the seam of the carapace, use the smart, smash it and remove the casing. Then he has a flexible movement, which is faster and faster than using a special crab-feeding tool. The giant rock crabs have already surrendered in a few breaths, revealing the white and tender meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" The man was very polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eight use snow (no thanks)." Siegel had only the last piece of meat left on the plate, so he stood up and looked around, not found. A larger container than the plate in the hand. So after he poured two liqueurs, he had to continue to use the oily plate and kill the long table again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the plates were full of meat, and Siegel killed it. He noticed that the person at the same table had wiped out the rock crab and was staring at a multi-clawed lobster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Help people help the end. ‘Siegel thinks like this. He put his plate aside and put his hand into the person's plate. In the eyes of the appetite, it seems that in the blink of an eye, all the seafood is dismembered, just waiting to pick it up and eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you from the first time to the New World?" Siegel clap his hands and asked: "These things can only be eaten here, you must be Come for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel - squid." Both hands shook hands. They all found that the fingers and wrists of the other side were strong and powerful, but at the same time they did not lack the flexibility of young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan Bisig has a high head and a wide shoulder and chest. He has a golden shawl flying, and a pair of shiny pale gold eyes with a strong and straight nose is very handsome. This person has a short stubble and wants to be older than a squid. He wore a gray short trousers with a golden belt around his waist and black boots on his feet, which looked neat and spirited. Evan speaks with a heavy accent and is also interspersed with dialects near the East Lake Territory of the Starry Kingdom, but this does not affect the communication between the two. While discussing the food here, they brag about the ordinary young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so ignorant, what is the surname of the squid?" Evan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was born on the boat, just in the water tank of the squid, so I called this name." Siegel explained, then asked: "You What is the meaning of the surname of the golden sunflower?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, my father made me in the sunflower field, so give me this name." Evan is nothing. The answer is: "It's just a name anyway, I don't want to inherit anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, I understand, you are an illegitimate child." Siegel said: "But it's not bad, at least you know who your parents are. It's a good idea to try this trotters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan stunned, For the first time, he saw a guy who was completely insensitive to his origins. In the prosperous country, there has always been a very strict hierarchical system, and the pedigree and birth largely determine the height that this person can achieve in a lifetime. The civilians pay great attention to this method, carefully maintain it, and patiently look for opportunities to promote the class every time. Instead, the nobles are sloppy, often creating illegitimate children, leaving these people outside the system. Compared with civilians, even aristocratic illegitimate children without surnames can receive better education and resources, and their horizons are wider. But because they have no inheritance at all, they also rarely get the warmth of the family - especially maternal love, so they also suffer from another kind of pain. Their surnames will also be passed down, affecting them one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the higher the nobles, the more they feel that illegitimate children are damaging to the family’s reputation - ridiculously, no adult will rise up when making illegitimate children. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, do you like meat?" Evan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I have never eaten so much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then Waiting for me, I know there is a place that is delicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Evan stood up and slid into the hall. Siegel had wanted to stop him. The hall was not the place where anyone could go. There were servants of Elvis Manor, who would recruit the Guardian of the Alliance and throw out the low-profile people. Siegel originally followed Sir Bill, ready to sneak into the hall, but those sharp-eyed servants stopped him at the door and the plan failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worried for a while, Evan ran back, which made Siegel reassured. I don't know how this guy did it. Evan actually took a pot directly from the inside of the hall and hurried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is very nervous, for fear of being discovered by his servants. He squatted and watched, and the black eyes locked in every threat that might have attracted the guards to throw them out. Fortunately, at this time, the hall screamed loudly: "Your Highness will come again," and draw everyone's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come on! This is honey stew, I know the owner will definitely prepare this dish." Evan said proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bees in the starry country are the property of the lord, which makes the sweets made by honey a luxury that can only be enjoyed by the nobility. Ordinary people are only willing to spend a lot of money to steal a little honey from the beekeeper. The Dawn Church is an organization that has the right to breed bees in addition to the aristocratic circles. Sometimes they will distribute some sweet biscuits with honey on the praise day. Fortunately, the Soss had smuggled a can of honey, and Siegel sneaked a finger at the captain's direction. This incident was discovered by the first officer. In order to maintain the rules on board, the squid had a good fat meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now a whole pot of honey stew in front of Siegel, he was directly shocked. Evan likes to watch the new friend's shocked look, laughing happily. Siegel looked around, pushed the stool away, sat down on the floor with a pot and hidden behind the table. He waved to Evan to sit down with him so that he could enjoy the food with peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
