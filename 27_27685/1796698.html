			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright gold and silver decorated attire, light blue cloak, jeweled crown - squatting on the body, only the smile on the face and the waist The long sword is still the same. Www/xshuotxt/com Evan became king, or he officially took power and became the master of the starry kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him, the great lord of the morning temple, Aurora stood reverently, his faint light in his eyes closed, and his words in his mouth. Hands continue to rub the holy emblem on the chest. The things in the church have nothing to do with him, but it is his duty to protect the king's safety and to ensure goodness and light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the side of Evan’s body, always like to stand in the unobtrusive shadow is the court general manager Salk. He always looked like a human being, and he never made his voice except when the king asked him. When the king asked him, he would always be the first to arrive at the scene. He looked at the direction behind the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Majesty the King." After Siegel’s salute, he said, “I am very happy to see you again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What can be happy, I promised that you have not done anything yet, of course, your work has not been completed." Evan scratched his head and adjusted the angle of the crown. He still didn't adapt to the heavy things on his head, and always pressed his golden hair to the top. Evan laughed and laughed at himself: "All said that the king of a country is not angry, all actions are full of majesty, telling you the truth, it is all this heavy crown - I am like a long sword." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is good news. Your Majesty is good at using long swords and will soon be good at wearing a crown." Siegel replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Roll, you didn't talk like this!" Evan suddenly angered, jumping from his seat and smearing his face. Then he laughed and said to Siegel, "Don't face it, tell me. How much thoughts did you spend on compliments, how long did you think about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About two seconds." Siegel smiled and replied: "Congratulations on your throne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I The most thankful is Aaron. I didn't expect him to do that.” Evan took Siegel and sat down. Then take the crown off and put it in front of you, scratching your scalp. "H. When the king is so busy, the light is calculated to be written to the big lords, there are thirty, not to mention the influential aristocrats. I finally thought of a way to send Lear. Got. Siegel, tell me how you got hurt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A spell confrontation. Lear did not want to see Aaron hand over the throne, So I tried to stop it with a spell, and I went to stop him. I was hurt by it.” Siegel avoided the weight: “The advisors of the school have been assisting the lords for many years. The royal family is also inseparable from the assistance of the school. So in In this matter, I suggest to be cautious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan nodded and said: "I also heard that the association and the wizard association are now very rigid. Wouldn't it be necessary to exchange book materials?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. Where did he hear it from? This matter is only known to Lear, William, and himself, and the details are limited to himself and Lear. Has the big prophet been talking to Evan? What did they say and what consensus was reached? Siegel is a bit worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are careful, worry that you are too smart, compare them all." Evan snorted and grinned. "I can't order what the school or the wizard association is going to do. But I can open the Royal Library to the Royal Earl Siegel Squid. It's hard to find a spell book in it, but other books are not necessarily better than the Master. How much is the association. You give me a list, I can see if I can bridge the bridge. I can find a way to get some things for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know I won't be polite to you.” Siegel pulled out the scroll that he had crumpled, and the checkmark and cross on it were still clearly visible, just like they had just written it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After handing this reel to Salk, Evan extended his hand and said to Siegel: "My nephew."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the sound of the Thunder in the sky is a roar, then there is now a thousand lightning bolts in the mind of Siegel. What does Evan want to do? He had just received the blessing of the Lord of the Morning because he threw the donkey, and sat firmly on the throne. Does he want to go back, or is there another purpose? Siegel associates with a series of inferences about Lear. Did Evan exchange the nephew for unconditional support from Lear? After all, compared to the Heim collar. The Masters Association and the City of Learning are the more important kingdoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your." Siegel put his fingers on the scorpion and put it in Evan's hand. Once put up, the number seventy-four lights up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, you are the same person as Aaron." Evan suddenly said: "Master Lear suggested that if I give him a hundred face, He will make every effort to promote the all-round cooperation between the Federation and the Masters Association. All the Masters will devote all their loyalty to the royal family. In any battle, based on the Wang flag, they will resolutely execute all orders. Just give this thing to him."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your things, you decide." Siegel smiled and said: "No matter how you are not losing."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Solk listens! Now I know why Heim is rich in the world?" The manager laughed twice and nodded very seriously. Evan continued: "I told Lear that if Siegel gave me the hazelnut without hesitation, then it means that this thing is of little value. I believe in the judgment of Siguel Archmage, so use something of no value. Exchanging the absolute allegiance of all mages is actually an insult to the Masters Association. As a king, I will not do such a thing." He said, he laughed. "Seeing no, the advantage of being a king is that you can confuse and say what is true!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really want to see the expression on the face of Lehr. !" Siegel replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, his face is as calm as ever, nothing can be seen." Evan bites his lower lip, takes a deep breath with his nose, and then The words slowly came out. "Then I told him that using an object is not a loyalty. It can be exchanged for contracts, agreements or mercenaries. Wang Qi points out that the infidels are jealous! I said that as long as I represent the power of justice, then It is possible to play more and less, and to be invincible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan slowly rubbed his throat with his fingers, and the disappointment in his eyes slowly faded. "I want to understand. This thing is for you. As long as I speak, I can get it back at any time. But it is not so convenient to put it in Leer. The more important reason is that I can’t because of this thing. The Lord's favor." He looked at the great sacrifice Aurora, and then said: "Is it ah, priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Lord sacrificed and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan threw the dice back into the hands of Siegel, watching the light on the numbers fade out. "Receive, except me, don't give it to others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, a little crying and laughing: "So, you are testing me." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course!" Avon greatly acknowledged. "I will test you again and again, today, tomorrow, this year, next year. When you don't want to do it, or don't move, I will not let you go, and will continue to test you. As long as I am King, such an action will never end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you are the king, I am the count, you want to look like it!" Siegel Put away the scorpion and make a helpless expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect to be officially enrolled so quickly, so the things you promised to do for me should be as soon as possible." Evan gave a wink and his mouth shook. shake. "There is still something to tell you, so as not to cause any misunderstanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can ascend the throne, besides thanking Aaron, I would also like to thank the father. The intention left in my life changed my surname from a golden sunflower to a star, which gave me the legal basis for inheritance. In order to reduce the possibility of domestic turmoil, I asked Aaron to draft a will to confirm The true nature of the Father’s will, and officially respected me as my brother. I took Aaron to do this thing, although it was necessary, but my heart was not good. Aaron agreed, I also got what I want. The file, but I think I still have to tell you. Siegel, I am still Evan, not because I was a king..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I know Evan.” The Archmage also smiled bitterly: “How is it that the King is not good...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Fortunately, okay.” Evan He replied: "What is going on now is better than me and Aaron, and then I take over the Star Kingdom. It’s right. Lear has let me send it. Go, you have to help me refer to this, what should be done in this goblin kingdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know everything at all, the current proposal is only It can be a calm change.” Siegel told Evan about the discovery of a large number of dwarf corpses on his own territory, and also explained the situation in which Heim’s test goblin might use weapons. He did not have Elimott, who was at the tip of Timor, nor did he tell the two goblin rifles that Hem had taken. It doesn't matter how these weapons come from, what they can do, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to deal with them is the most important thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
