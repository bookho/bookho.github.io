			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers and Soldiers left, the mercenaries also left, the caravans, and the entire city of Myrtle suddenly appeared empty - except the walls were still Keep the patrol guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to hide the eyes and ears, Siegel let the farmer put on the soldiers’ clothes and still stand on the wall every day. The distant elves have better eyesight and can’t remember all The appearance of the standing guards naturally does not reveal clues. He also arranged for people to ignite and cook every day, so that the line of the zebra mountain to the city of Mier was not reduced. As for the city, Siegel exerted a lasting illusion, creating an active crowd in the pergola and courtyard to deceive the falcon's sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown avenue departs from the east gate of the castle and extends to the fields of the Ghost Fog. The oats there are mature and the farmer is constantly transporting the harvest back with the cart. Although the bread made of oatmeal is not as delicious as wheat, it is widely praised because it is the first harvest of food since the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trucks that come and go every day attract the elf’s sight and provide cover for Heim’s actions to bring troops and smuggle to the south. The elves are always tired of checking these trucks, but can only find oats, kale, turnips and cabbages, and occasionally find mushrooms and pears in them. There are no weapons, no armor, no elves that the elves have always wanted to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these secrets don’t know how long they can hide, I really hope that it will be forever. Siegel knew that when the elf finally realized, Leah would raise her long sword and take the elf army along this brown avenue. The heavy footsteps of the war tree will trample this new road, the huge arm is like a car; the forester’s bow and arrow shrouded the city; the druid will become a bear, a cheetah and an eagle, or use the vine to climb the wall; The fireballs of the mages fell like rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still remember the heroic attitude of Master Leah’s bow and archery. I wonder if he will use “speedy enemy” and “killing innocent” for me. Siegel squeezed the defensive staff and hoped that this new equipment would be able to withstand the magical weapons dedicated to the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope everything goes well, whether it’s Deepwater or Mire City. Siegel has already made the worst plan. If he attacks in the north during the elves, he can only surrender when he can't resist it. Janet can hide in the secret passage with the delivery headdress and go to the starting point to take refuge. Capricorn will guard the energy focusing lens and turn on the shield. Then destroy the entrance of the secret passage and block the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wall, an archer is untiring his pants and peeing out of the shadow of the corner of the tower. He is a cobbler. The usual job is to make fur and repair leather. Today it is his turn to pretend to be a soldier. It seems that he is very embarrassed, or it may be that the room in the tower is unclear, and the location of the toilet is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No elf archery comes over. Maybe I didn't find it, maybe I didn't care, but today it is the lucky day of the cobbler. From time to time, the elves will shoot some feather arrows without heads, and declare their strength in this way - I am outside your city, and you are all within the scope of my arrows. This headless arrow hits the body and it will hurt for a while, but it won't hurt. However, in this way, you can't use the scarecrow to deceive, you can only continue to pick up more cobblers, blacksmiths and farmers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked between the walls with a staff, an arrow tower to another tower. Residents will see him, and the elves will see him. He plans to appear three times in ten days. Then use the transfer spell to go north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it is impossible to resolve the battle within one day, and it may not even be able to win the game this year. For the safety of Heim, he can only delay the time of the war with the elves and make all kinds of illusions. However, he has no bottom in his heart, and he can only do his best to achieve good results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food, ordnance, population, weather, terrain, morale, as a lord, there are many things to consider. Siegel sometimes envied Kerry, and it was a pleasant thing to lead a soldier as easily as he did. But he has been instilled with various war-related knowledge by the bachelor Faranis. I think a lot, but I feel awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim has no experienced veteran in the field, all knights and generals have style and no experience. The elves have a very long life, and the most indispensable thing is the experience. This is not a good fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is working hard to prepare, especially for scrolls, runes, and other magic items. The fireball's wand is the one he carries the most. In addition to his own use, he can also be handed over to the warlocks in the mercenary group to bomb the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first war in the true sense of Siegel's participation. He doesn't know what role he should play as a mage lord. He went to the historical data to find it, and wanted to know what the mage lord before him did, so I have a reference. After all, the one who once shocked the entire starry kingdom was not allowed to be contained until the morning temple was personally involved in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in his pile of papers, his records are only a few words, a brief description of his life, and a list of major events. But all the situations about combat are blank, and there is no record of words. This is not in line with the rules of history, only to show that the Masters Association deliberately concealed the truth of that period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is information in the King’s Room or the Moon Temple, it’s not going to help. The more you know, the more you know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the thirteenth day, Siegel kissed his wife and first went to the underground library of the Federation, where he only sent a transfer to the Walled Mountains, black blood. At the foot of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rune of the Wall Mountain Range is still running, blocking Siegel from directly transmitting to the Black Blood Castle, so he can only use the phantom to pick it up. The castle is still no one, and even the half-orcs scattered in the mountains are far away. Nothing else, just because of the black ash that the wind can't blow on the mountain on the east side of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow left behind after the burning of the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resentment is the shadow of the soul, the two are just the difference in personality, the other aspects are the same. They can all become the soul of the soul, as a carrier of energy. In the state of grievances, this kind of contained energy is the secret of their extremely high success rate. If it is burning, it can also cause great damage to the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forbidden character array is thus broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel came to this "graveyard" of grievances, and it was far from a cold. The power of the elements becomes turbulent around the cemetery. Negative energy is much greater than positive energy, making people feel tired, sleepy, and dizzy. On the other hand, the banned array of the Wall Mountain Range is repairing itself. The heavy energy from the earth is constantly coming in, trying to "evaporate" the black material on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom screamed uncomfortably. Do not want to move in the direction of the Wraith Cemetery. It is a creature made up of magic and is very sensitive to the elemental environment. Siegel calmed it a few words, then jumped off the horse and walked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is full of signs of corrosion, like a strong acid rain. Leave large and small caves on rocks and soil. The nearby vegetation is all dead, leaving only the decaying gray empty shell from the leaves to the rhizome, which becomes a powder when pinched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approaching, the feeling of exhaustion of the body is more obvious, just like having not rested for a few days and nights. Siegel’s self-esteem is good and still suffers from this level. I hope that the orcs will be weakened as well, so the battle will be much easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This layer of black matter is connected to each other like a viscous grease. Magic hands and mind shifts can't change its shape. Siegel walked up cautiously, and his feet were soft and sticky, and he didn't imagine slipping. That will have no effect on walking and running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he began to climb on the Graveyard, and kept paying attention to the changes in the ban. This huge array of runes throughout the city walls is designed to be the top secret of the dwarves. The west dwarf knew a part of it in some way, but none of the words were mentioned to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are just mavericks and have never been traitors of dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the Rune Array is amazing, the closer it is to the top of the mountain, the greater the resistance it receives. But this resistance is not from the power of the elements, it will not turn into fireball, lightning, ice and the like, but it will trigger a variety of events. I don't know why the fallen stone, the rift hidden under the foot, the sudden avalanche, the turbulent air without warning. Sometimes there are all kinds of strange creatures that disappeared mysteriously after driving the climbers. I don't know where to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is very skeptical that this is not an ordinary rune, more like the effect of some kind of divine power: distorting reality with will. According to the Master, that is the effect that Prayer can achieve - thoughts, things. If the dwarf really uses the runes to achieve this spell in a wide range, it is really shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
