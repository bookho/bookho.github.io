			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does Siegel mean by "the things are not that simple?" I am afraid that people present at the time cannot fully understand. As a mage, Wywood thinks of magic in his mind, thinking about whether the goblin will have hidden spell power; Mana is a knight, she is thinking about how the goblin solves their melee tactics, she thought of installing under the "gun" "Sword" idea; Fitzak is thinking about how to get more information from the dwarf, and how to lurk into the goblin world; Janet is thinking for Siegel, why the dwarves secretly tell the story of the Goblin kingdom, they What is planned in the dark? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different people think differently from different angles and come to different conclusions. From a warrior to a mage, from a civilian to a lord, from a civilian to a lord, from the sea to the shore and then soaring into the sky, crossing the void, his thinking width is much broader - he is thinking about how the dwarf failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seemingly simple question implies a lot of information. Although the sergeant William went deep into the world of the goblin, it was already after the defeat of the dwarf battlefield and began to retreat. He did not see the scene of the battle. The state of Mora was strictly confidential about the battlefield, and even Elinte could not say it. There are currently only two pieces of goblin weapons in front of Siegel, and he needs to use these two things to derive the goblin tactics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Alchemy Explosives - Named as Explosives, Siegel thinks - Pushing metal warheads to strike, better killing than bows . Since the mechanism of winding the crossbow is abandoned, the use of the power of the explosion and the method of discarding the shell can achieve burst shots. The guns in the hands of Siegel already have the mechanism to install the magazines. It is clear to the Master who has made the crosshairs. This is one of the signs of the "continuous" mechanism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet is much smaller than the 弩矢, and there is no need to worry about the toughness and longevity of the chord, so the shooting ability of the goblin's burst gun is only affected by the size of the magazine. - There is also the loss of the temperature of the explosives on the overall structure, Siegel wrote down his own ideas in the notebook. Because the explosive produced an instantaneous explosive force, the gun swayed so badly that the hit rate was poor in the continuous shooting state. So the inevitable result: more shots must be used to make up for the lack of hits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel imagined that the goblins in the mountains and plains used this kind of weapon, and the metal bullets smashed through the raindrops in the storm, and then shuddered. It is only by driving away from the metal array, and it must be driven by the power of the Peruvian nuclear level to protect the mage. Other spells or wizards who provoke spells can't stand a continuous blow. If they don't want to escape, they either collapse or die because of weak mana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the goblin obviously won't have that little skill. The formula of explosives is very subtle. If you increase the dose, use it directly to attack? The adventurers use an alchemy prop called a blast. Deals a little damage and great noise, hurting the enemy's ears. Explosives are much stronger than blasting stones, and their impact and flame can be directly fatal. And from the number of bullets, the dynamite can be mass produced. A bullet also refers to a few small children who are picked up by the head, but if it is a pile of fists, even a room full of explosives? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more powerful the things need to be put on the mechanism, the dwarves use the trebuchet and the heavy artillery, their power Siegel has seen it with their own eyes, even Longshi Cliff The elements of the Golem are unbearable. From the current results, the goblin kingdom has withstood. And win the battle. Siegel can only assume that the ability of the goblin to deliver is much higher than that of the dwarf, just as the explosive gun is much stronger than the crossbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a purely remote contest. Range, rate of fire, and power become the most important indicators. Martial arts and battlefields are dead, and it is no wonder that the dwarves will Disastrously." Siegel talked to himself and continued to write and paint on paper. He doesn't think that the war is over to this point, things will never be that simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet's lethality is large, but it will still be blocked, such as the earth. Dwarves are good at digging, they will definitely take advantage of the power of the earth. Or use the underground tunnel, or use the ditch that can walk to approach the enemy, smooth out the disadvantages of the range, so that the power of short-range combat can be played out. Siegel is familiar with the set of dwarf tunnels. They are also well aware of their construction methods and construction speed. So how did the dwarf lose in this situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listed several possibilities on paper: the destructive effect of explosives on the tunnel; the simple hand-held weapon similar to the detonation blocking channel; the goblin has a higher The mobility, the dwarves dig pits can not catch up with the development of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good!" Siegel frowned, let the servant hand him a pipe, and use the fragrance of Ningshen to make his own thoughts. The flickering light flashed in the lab, and Siegel almost motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows very well that if you want to know the weapons and tactics of the goblin, you only need to ask the dwarf to ask, and you can understand it when you look at the battlefield. It is accurate and intuitive, but it also limits the direction and ability of people to think. Whether he can achieve it first or not, he is constantly imagining, using the power of fantasy rather than the power of logic to enrich himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty scorpions are flickering, and all the numbers are slightly radiant. Siegel’s thinking has become unobstructed, and results can be found in every direction. Countless possibilities are all in front of him – as long as he dares to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scorpion gave him the power of magic resistance, so that he could learn magic safely; the scorpion gave him a strong body, so that he could climb the top of Mora. Learn the dwarf Rune; the scorpion gives him hidden power to avoid danger and encourage him to explore; the scorpion gives him the eyes of the spirit so that he can observe the subtle; the scorpion allows him to become a dead spirit, from The opposite of life sees the world, thinking absolutely calmly; the scorpion gives him plasma immunity, so that he can get in touch with the technology of hex. The twentieth scorpion creates all the conveniences for him, with only one purpose, exploring all possibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred scorpions represent achievements and peaks, and twentieth scorpions constitute countless worlds and countless possibilities. The most precious thing in the multiverse is the spark of wisdom. These sparks are scattered in vast and infinite spaces and in infinite time, scattered in countless realities brought about by countless possibilities. Not every spark can survive and thrive, and it can dispel the ignorant night and bring a gorgeous dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These fires scattered in the multiverse give a faint signal that makes the icosahedron glow slightly. Influence Siegel's meditation and help him think and deduct. When you are in the world of imagination, let the power of thought climb to the top and go straight through the cloud dome. That kind of happiness is indescribable. In this way, Siegel travels in the multi-cosm, talks with the masters of countless wisdom sparks, and integrates their thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action spans time, spans space, and transcends reality and illusion. Nature will be addictive. Janet was very worried about Siegel's situation and sent a signal of spiritual connection to him through the Raven Baron, which only sang Siegel from meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, it’s been more than a week, I haven’t come out?” Siegel touched his beard on his chin, and he’s already entangled in Hair together. "I think things are ecstatic, but fortunately I have not forgotten to eat." He smiled at Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to pay attention to the body, work and rest." Janet dragged Siegel's hand and slammed him into the bedroom: "I let the servant prepare for the heat." Water, you have to wash it well! I will also meet the residents of the territory this afternoon. Listen to their demands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been this time? It’s really fast.” Ming knows that he can be clean and tidy with just a few simple spells. Siegel still lets Janet do it and wash it for himself. While listening to his wife telling about the trivialities in life, especially the growth of Isaac, he is still thinking about the possibilities brought by Goblin technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is very difficult to go beyond the goblin in the same direction." When Siegel met the residents, he suddenly said to Mana. “It may not take long to imitate their alchemy formula, but that can only be leveled up. It takes a long time to try to lead them in combat, to test and test countless possible recipes.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana stunned, and after a few seconds I wanted to understand what Siegel said. She lowered her voice and reminded: "What should the conflicts between the two masters because of the dowry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did Siegel listen? He is still full of guns and bullets from the goblin. "Let them wait for a month. Calm each other and come back, that's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana nodded and let them back. When the next group was about to come up, Siegel suddenly said to the guard next to him: "You are carrying a cross with a cross, right? Give me a normal iron."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​the Lord Lord is immediately satisfied. Two businessmen are presenting in the hall because of disputes over the sale and purchase contract. Siegel controls the squatting in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is weight and speed, and the two together determine the power." Siegel uses the mind to cast spells to speed up the movement of the squats as much as possible. It vibrates at high speeds in a small range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
