			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, the orcs were still in the carnival. The generals boasted each other’s performances on the battlefield and used their words to downplay their enemies; the merchants were asking about slaves and spoils. The price, want to fight for the interests of their own leaders; the slaves continue to take food, and then rushed away before being cut off part of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who shouted "coward!" and the two orcs then wrestled. The other orcs laughed, letting the place let them attack each other, and handing a cup or chair from time to time. An orc pulled the human slave beside him and threw it into the battlefield. The unlucky slave quickly broke his blood and fell to the ground to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the fight progressed, the scene began to become chaotic, and the onlookers began to shirk each other. Under the curse of grievances, negative emotions are constantly magnified, and waves of anger, hatred, and arrogance come from all directions, engulfing the entire town. "Coward!" someone screamed loudly. "The traitor! Walking the dog!" Another voice rose again and gradually formed the main theme. Soon the whole town became a large collection of orc vocabulary, and many words could not be translated in other languages. Everyone becomes arrogant and blind, so no one can smell the dangerous taste. Everyone desperately vented the instigation in their hearts, using foul words and fists and teeth, until they became a big fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacon Town has become a real battlefield. Everyone, men, women and children, whether empty or armed, is pushing the ground meat that flocks to the accommodation area. field. Stones, wood and even manure and sludge became weapons. They shouted "kill the traitors!" and "for the power of the beastmaster!" When they rushed open the arsenal and grabbed the swords and swords, the slogan again It became "killing half-orc hybrids" and "killing orc idiots, we are the masters of the family." The slaves fled indiscriminately, but they ignited the flames everywhere in the town. The whole town is full of blood and fire, killing and fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original orc was imposed on other racial acts and reappeared on the orcs themselves on this day. Siegel observes all this through the eyes of the raven, just like a reef that is not moving in the waves, and is the only calm observer. He is glad that he is now an undead creature, and there is almost no mood swing. Otherwise, this madness will infect him like a plague and let him lose control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am still in human form, even if it is not affected by the spell, it will become crazy for this terrible situation, Siegel thinks. Many times he had imagined destroying the orcs and letting their evil deeds disappear from the world along with death. ‘This is a fallen race. Nothing can be done except evil. Let them all go to hell! Siegel always thought that he would harden his heart and feel happy to eliminate evil. But now he is witnessing the destruction of the orcs, but he has no pleasant mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, if not in the state of the undead, he might even have a tear for the orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thinks carefully about why he forms such a contradictory mentality. Is the so-called knight spirit? mercy? Still hypocritical? The advantage of being in the state of the undead is to be able to think extremely calmly. Only absolute rationality exists, and there is no impulse or anxiety to influence it. It took him a long time to finally understand that it was his remaining humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an enemy, Siegel will not hesitate to insert weapons into the heart of the orcs, whether it is using swords or spells, arbitrarily fighting or using intrigues These are all acceptable to him. But he will still shed tears and feel pain for the disappearance of life. There is a difference between fighting and slaughter. It is this difference that sets justice and evil out of bounds and makes people different from beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw General Kaka, he just killed a centurion, and the result was that the long knife was stuck in the crevice of the corpse. come out. A bumpy stone was thrown from the crowd and slammed into his armor, and the result was splattered. Several slaves picked up the burning pieces of wood and continued to throw them at Kaka. The scene was like a meteor across the sky. The flag of the heart was smashed, and some angry slaves ate the pieces. The fierce expression seemed to be chewing the flesh and blood of the slave owner. However, they soon got what they wanted. In the chaos, many orcs were pulled down by human slaves, smashed down the alleys, smashed and torn into pieces of pieces of minced meat. The humans who eat the orc meat seem to wake up. They are sweating and vomiting, and they rush to the orcs and half-orcs like violent beasts. Even the superb martial arts masters could hardly survive this scuffle, and they were soon besieged by enemies who were constantly coming in, and were trapped in the whirlpool of flesh and blood. General Kaka saw his two captains guards dying, and more and more people gathered around. He took out a talisman and lifted it up, yelling loudly: "Varadu mammoth!" With a burst of black smoke, General Kaka disappeared from the chaotic battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked on the sidelines, his power was simply not enough to change the situation, even if he wanted to take the opportunity to save the slaves who had escaped from poverty, but with his current ability, neither force nor mana could do this. He can't bring these people to a bloody road, let alone talk about how to cross the blockade of the walled mountains and return to the civilized world. The biggest possibility is that he enters the battlefield and will be killed the first time, regardless of whether he is an orc, a half-orc or a human. The shape of Siegel is too fragile, and he feels that it is easy for a weapon to break or break a bone. He is somewhat uncertain about the damage in the squatting state, and what effect it will have when he returns to the flesh and blood, but it will not be as good as ever. The most painful thing for Siegel in the whole incident was the inability to save those poor slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel thought this way, he saw a black smoke coming to the ruins of the pub. General Kaka re-emerged from the black smoke, licking his mouth and trying to hold back the cough. The amulet in his hand has become a fragment, and it should be exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The traitors are all traitors!" The general was excited and scorned: "I have to peel off your skin first, then cut off all the heads!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of orcs clamored for a close, the general immediately closed his mouth, and a pair of bright eyes were hidden behind the ruins of the ruins. After the orcs joined the chaotic battlefield, he sat down with confidence, opened his pockets and began to look inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven sneaked into the beam and sneaked down. I saw the general's small pocket full of various amulets, mostly orc style, but also there are dwarf and human-style magic items. Siegel noticed that the entire magical array did not affect Kaka, but it was definitely not because of lack of ability or Kaka is strong enough, but simply because the release of Kaka would lead to greater chaos in the entire wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keigel does not want to let him go, he can't forget how this vicious general used skinning to kill slaves. At the celebration party in the evening, it was Kaka who erected a peeling shelf and personally carried out this cruel punishment. As he started, he also educated other generals and commanders, and he wanted to carry forward the matter of skinning. Siegel couldn't forget the voice that was passed at that time. He could not tolerate the persistence of such evil. He could not wait for "justice in the future." He would judge the execution today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel quickly formed a plan in his mind, and then let the raven fly over Kaka’s head, causing his attention, and then falling into the secret door. on. After knocking a few times with the beak, Siegel let the raven fly away and go to another hiding place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vision really caught the attention of the general. He carefully walked forward and quickly discovered the secret door. Siegel made other preparations below: he sprinkled a few barrels of wine on the ground, and he lay aside and covered the half with a blanket. He thought that there was a flaw in the form of squatting in the disguise of the scene. For example, when the food here is not well preserved, the corpse has become a bone shelf only, and from the corpse to the cockroach, there is no smell of rancidity. Not true. So he untied the straps that bound the leather armor, relaxed the bondage of the body, and used the power of the scorpion to transform into another undead creature, the zombie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with 骷髅, this time it became a zombie to make him smell, and it is not difficult to use a simple spell to strengthen the rancid smell from the body. He also threw a dragon tooth dagger on the ground, deliberately causing the general's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret door was opened, and General Kaka walked down and held a hard-headed hammer - this was his spare weapon after losing the long knife. His gaze first saw Siegel, but a scented and completely immobile body quickly made him lose interest, and the wine here caught his eye. After a chaotic battle, he became very thirsty and needed a drink to moisten his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaka went to the barrel and saw the dragon tooth dagger on the way. The unique shape of the dagger allowed him to see the hunter, and even the wine did not matter, and rushed to pick up the dagger. The dragon tooth dagger is of excellent quality, both sharp and sold. General Kaka’s gaze was completely attracted by this beautiful weapon, so he did not realize that the zombies in the corner had stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will not be as slow and slow as a real zombie, he can even drag a rotten meat to make an elf dance. Without waiting for the thick charcoal to fly, Siegel had already held another dragon tooth dagger into the heart of the orc general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death!" The half body armor has no resistance in front of the dragon tooth, and Siegel can easily penetrate and easily pull out. He then stabbed the second knife and said in the orc language at Kaka: "Death, the villain!" Then the third knife, completely revenge for those who were skinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
