			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domain of honesty is a very useful spell, and the subject can only tell the truth or remain silent under the cover of the spell. However, in the current situation, more than a dozen fully armed orc warriors, staring at the axe, who dares to remain silent? It’s obvious that the end of the game is not open forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some determined people can overcome the effects of spells and lie to the lie, but they face the priest who is proficient in this spell. Just as many nobles have learned how to hide their swords and their stomachs, the pastor who uses honesty has the experience of observing and recognizing lies. Perhaps some spy masters can escape the influence of this spell, but Siegel can't pin their hopes on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor and the witch sacrifice have a firm belief in their gods, and they are more confident in their own spells, but the Master never uses such a mode of thinking. The secret of conserving spells has become one of the morbid pursuits of the Masters, and they naturally do not want to let the priests of various "true gods" know. Many wizards choose the Raven when they choose the magic pet, which is a well-known feature of it: it can speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic pet and the mage have a soul-level link, and can even be said to be two manifestations of the same soul. The words of the Raven Demon are what the Master thinks, and there is no difference between the two. Therefore, there is a secret among the Masters, using their own magical pets to evade the ability of the realm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This secret is only known to the Master, and even only those apprentices with magical awakening qualifications will be told so that they have a choice when creating a magical pet. Like the raven, the snakes, lynxes, and falcons in the devil have hidden secrets, and they can bring different conveniences to the mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven is not far away, just to help with the soul connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" The Witch Festival began to ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fazak's fucking (son) is Fazak, nickname is a one-eyed old man." Siegel's righteous answer. The empty space in his sentence was filled in by the Ravens. As for the witch festival, I didn’t hear it. It’s not for the Master to worry about it. Siegel only needs to make sure that it’s all true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing at the arena?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here to see the situation, then (instead of) later preparing slaves for General Kabu. Dedicating to the orc god in the arena, you can bless the victory of the frontline army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witch Festival Head, the orc does have such a tradition. The more blood sacrifices, the more blessings of the Beastmaster. He has always paid attention to the expression of "one-eyed old Fitzak". As a high-end one-eyed witch festival, when he saw another one-eyed person, he had a natural intimacy, and even he did not notice it. It is an alternative "people gather together". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened here?" Wu Wu asked: "Tell me all that you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is very clear about the limits of the ability of the domain of honesty, at most people can tell the truth, but there is no coercive effect of "and out." However, he still has to answer "sincere and fearful" and fear that his own falsehood is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what caused the thing (the blame), the ghost-like smoke began to drill into the human body. The slaves will go mad and start to be chaotic. (Never) It may be that my devotion to the orc god has saved me from being possessed until the army of the witch festival adults. Unfortunately, I just met the slave. Such a thing, it is very difficult to perform a fight in the arena, can only wait a while to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which slave do you want to buy?" Ask, let's finally determine the authenticity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel refers to the body on the ground and then says: "This is the half-orc I am looking for, named Sagak, the steel toe of the captain." He has provided me with information, and there are a number of good slaves in his hands. There are old and young, there are men and women, and they will perform in the duel. I want them to change their owners, so come here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Witch Festival nodded, he was very confident in his spells, knowing that Fazak in front of him said things. The arena is where the dead souls of the city of Macabu gather. There are countless gladiators who die here, and it is not surprising that one or two ghosts appear occasionally. Since the chaos here has subsided, there are other important things to be concerned about in the witch festival. The battle in the town of bacon caused confusion throughout the wilderness, and many orc forces were attacking each other, affecting the strategy of marching into the south. The besieged by the iron foot warlord also caused the situation to start to develop in a bad direction. The steel toe, as the chief of the iron foot, wanted to hand over the Kabu general of the double-headed wolf. The one-eyed witch festival only hopes that the peers who brought the message to the generals of the skin can restore the frontline situation to normal. The four warlords want to discharge the seats and should be carried out after the end of the looting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel had been prepared to pick up the dragon tooth dagger from the ground and said to the witch festival: "I used to be a good shooter with a dagger at the auction site a few days ago."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch festival stared at him, and his mouth snorted. Siegel smiled and handed the dagger up, then said: "Wufu adult, I have completed the transaction, this Sagq is dead, the dagger should naturally be dedicated to the beastmaster to express my reverence." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good." The one-eyed witch festival put the dagger on the belt and said to the orc captain around him: "Give the servant slave to this devout believer. Then check to see if there are any undead in this place, and then you can go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witchcraft turned away and the spells of the honest domain ended. Siegel will then hand it over to the orc captain, just like every human slave who knows how to survive in Macabu. "Captain, you see my gladiator..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I pick it up, I don't care about these things." The orc captain accepted the money bag with satisfaction. Then he said to his men: "Have you heard it? The witch festival adults asked us to find the undead souls hidden here. They gave me a detailed search. If you find a slave, you will give it to this human being, and it will not cost us!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beasts exclaimed with excitement, then they spread out and the two of them rummaged around. Because it is an arena, the three-eye Longte is now the owner here, so they dare not rob, but the drinks and food here have been paralyzed. Siegel called Shang Keke, with the same village to find half-orcs. There are more than 300 people in the stone village, and now there are less than 70 in the arena. Siegel surrounded them and used them to help them quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the orc patrol is still nearby, he dare not say more. After a while, many slaves came in and out, most of them were gladiators who could not contact the master for a while. The beasts, regardless of the three seven twenty-one, were sent to the Siegel side and soon gathered nearly two hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are half of the orcs and humans, but only a few have specialized training. There is no shortage of young women, but there is no woman at the age of childbearing. The reason is obvious. There are also some young and young girls in the ranks. The orcs are too lazy to raise "them", so they prepare wolves in the arena and let them perform the rest of the wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the gladiators have already accepted their lives. They only care about how many good they can eat before they die. The newly recruited slaves from the south side of the walled mountain range were ignorant, but the sticks and whips taught them to calm down. Only the people in the Stone Village, they clearly know the terrible arena, and some have watched the competition before, they will also cheer and excite. But when they were caught as slaves and became victims of the field, no one could laugh, and all of them were on the verge of collapse. If not handled well, it is likely to cause confusion and affect Siegel's plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Siegel’s intention was to arbitrarily set fire to himself and to create greater confusion with grievances at any time. But when he saw the scorpion half-orc, he thought of using the gladiator here to complete the task. There are also many ships in the port of Macabu, even if these people are not crew members, Siegel can use their own command to let them open the boat. As a person who can be a sailor and a captain, this confidence is not lacking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shut up, listen to me." Siegel picked up the whip, which was taken from Sagk. There is a five-foot-long whip that makes a loud bang in the air, like a thunder that is remembered in the ear. Siegel practiced the ability to use a lasso and a whip when he put it on. It seems to be the same level as the gladiator here, so you can pretend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you all belong to me, so give me a good obedience. What do you want me to do, you will do it right away. Today’s arena performance, no you Whatever it is, so I will lie down and rest. Let me see who is still standing, and everyone will not want to have food!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the whip Another sound exploded, all the slaves lying down and brushing down like a frightened chick. Siegel was surrounded by their eyes of awe and fear, and his heart was very uncomfortable. Even if you understand that you are acting, you still have some embarrassment. He resisted the urge to twist his head, still scared the slaves who dared to look at him with intimidating eyes until everyone bowed his head. Seeing the trepidation of several children because of fear, Siegel’s nephew almost shed tears. After the Orc patrol left, Siegel walked a little further, hiding his face in the shadows before dare to shed a tear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
