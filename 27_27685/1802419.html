The three children are not separated, but are placed together in the "Terror Fort", that is It belongs to Gallup and will soon be thrown into jail by the whole family and then die in the castle of the Grenade Hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to ensure the suddenness of the action, Siegel used the information obtained by the positioning, and simultaneously opened three transmissions, directly to the three children. Although more than two reels were used, it also avoided the possibility that the enemy dog ​​jumped into the wall after the raid was discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is very challenging the Master's ability to control the spell, and Siegel has pushed himself to the limit. He found that he couldn't do anything with one heart. If he didn't use the exact same spell, he wouldn't be able to maintain three spells without the support of the nucleus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the wiki, the "dogs" all arrived at their destination, and Siegel almost collapsed. The physical impact is not great, and it is inevitable that the headache is to be split. For the performance of the ** division, the king of the layman can only watch a lively, well-informed wiki but understand how difficult it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only need to be responsible for sending the past, can they get it back?" Siegel frowned and looked at the wiki. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very grateful to you, Marquis. The dog's noses are so strong that they will come back safely."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, don't stand here, everyone goes up. Wiki, you take the Marquis to his room, and then take a look around. He is here for the first time. Star Fort, if you can't find the road, you can only ask. Ai Meng prepared dinner, Siegel, come over to dinner together at night.” Evan finished, took Siegel's shoulder and put on the cloak. left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a deep breath and gathered the elemental energy at an extremely fast rate, then violently spread out to the surroundings. Affected by this action, the magical defensive array that was originally hidden is revealed, forming a colorful line in front of the **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by His Majesty the King, it was forced to transmit too many times, causing a loophole in protection. Siegel observed the spell for a while. Then wave your wand and add some lines in the air to fix the broken magical array. He added his own magic mark here and marked the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be time to fix it later. Many of the magical arrays here seem to have a long history, and some of them are now gone. Siegel said to the intelligence chief. “Can I live on a magical spaceship?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is your freedom, but I still have to take you to the room to see the tour guide’s duties. "The wiki bends over and makes a gesture of please." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel called the Shelley Master and Jack, who had been waiting in the castle hall. Go to the hospitality tower next to the main fort. There was once a room for the Chief Royal Master, and then the position was gone. It was then prepared for the hand of the king, and later the position was gone. It is said that this is not a lucky place, but fortunately, the world still needs a lord, a sergeant or a military general manager, so there is no problem with Siegel’s staying in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furnishings of the room are extremely gorgeous, and the floor is covered with thick wool blankets of gnome craftsmanship. After special treatment, there is no smell at all. There is a huge flower pot in the corner of the room. The elf's moonlight vines are covered with half a wall. If you clapping your hands, you can give off the shimmering illumination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls are covered with brocades produced everywhere, and gifts from some of the messengers and lords are also placed in the room as decorations. What attracts Siegel's attention most is the one left by the sorcerer Downton on the wall with a magical mark. As the last Chief Royal Mage. Before he left, he said: Wisdom is the conqueror of fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why he spent his time on the wall to leave this text forever, is it a irony of his own failure, or hints that the Masters Association will eventually re-form in the form of a school city? Conquer the fate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to this large suite, there are two other rooms on this floor that you can use at will. If you have other guests, you can also Here. Of course, this is definitely not as good as your magical spaceship, but the servants here will take care of your life intimately and will surely satisfy you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Ms. Shelley, which one do you like, I am afraid I have to live here for a while. His Majesty wants me to be a military adviser, and I have promised it." Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care. The one opposite the corridor will clean me." Master Shelley said: "You should have a lab on your magicship. Can't you let me use it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, not yet." Siegel shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, private lab." She turned to look at the wiki, with a nearly scornful smile on her lips: "The head of the loyal dog, I am bored. What can I pass the time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the intelligence manager did not change at all, replied with a hoarse voice: "This tower was originally the chief mage, so There is an old laboratory. It has been used for a long time, but the consultant who had been looking for the school has cleaned up the hygiene. It was also a thing ten years ago. The servant here should have the key, so it is impossible to find Salk, he There is always a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I know, guys, you are busy, I have to make up." Shelley slightly robes, Just like a lady walking towards her room with a skirt. When he passed by the intelligence manager, he raised his hand and touched his chin. The wiki body doesn't move, and there is no such thing as shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She likes me." Wiki said: "The Countess has not changed and has the same preferences as when she was young."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said: "Have you met her before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was young, I went to her house to be a guest - of course it was An unsolicited guest. She was newly married and was in a good mood. She found me but didn't catch me. Instead, she gave me a kiss and asked me to go to see her at night. At that time, she mocked her husband's expression. I remember very clearly. Unfortunately, I still have the task, I have to resist it." After that, the wiki sighed with a sigh of relief and a regretful expression on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel rolled his eyes. If you go, it will definitely not be a blessing, or a ghoul, or a spirit, it is definitely a shocking adventure. "Wikis, as the intelligence chief, you should know all the information about me, but I still don't know anything about you. I will work together soon. Can you introduce more?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is of course no problem, Marquis. My history is very simple, abandoned by my parents, the Temple of War adopted me, raised me to 6 years old. I always wanted to be a true pastor, so in addition to In addition to the Temple of God of War, I also went to the Moon God, the Mother of the Earth, and the Temple of the Morning God, but I did not feel the call of the gods. At the age of twelve, I went to the Temple of Death with the thought of trying, and learned to display for the first time. God, I was very excited at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the good times are not long, my talent in the magical skills is very poor, but on the contrary, it is extremely savvy in other places. I slowly learned to discern the truth by observing the expression of the person who missed the cemetery. Later, I helped the injured dog who was injured in the cemetery to find the current profession and decided to treat it as a lifelong career. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp;He said that when he was in the past, his expression on his face did not fluctuate at all. It was like talking about other people's things. Can't memories be touched by him? Wiki shrugged his shoulders: "Siegel adults, although today we are meeting for the first time, there are some connections between you and me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From me to become the Royal Baron At the beginning, should you have my information?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s earlier than that." Wiki said: "You already know that my group has a group. The hound dog is both a bodyguard and a commando. You are the military commander, so I have to tell you: in addition to the hound, I have eyeliners that are called birds around, various parrots with strange abilities, and special snoops. The cat of intelligence. Yes, Janet used to be my subordinate. She had to call me a teacher. But I always covered my face and spoke in another voice. She had never seen my true face."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, you are the wicked who almost sold her to the 妓+院?" Siegel’s eyes narrowed and the index and middle fingers moved back and forth, surrounding elements. The flow suddenly lags with his emotional changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you made a mistake. I have inquired about intelligence, but I have never operated that kind of place, and I have never done anything to sell people. Sometimes scare and scare." Novices can make them improve faster, nothing more.” Wiki directly looks at the eyes of the sergeant, as if a sculpture is watching another sculpture. "The kitten has never known that she is serving the royal family, otherwise she will not pick up the private life in the end. Using the money, she went to the New World to find the so-called freedom, which makes us very sorry. She should have better developed. But according to the rules, cats who can't restrain their own lusts will be chased by the hounds - whether the lust is good or bad. But we later found out that she used the other way to serve the royal family - such as marrying the royal knight - so this Something will not be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
