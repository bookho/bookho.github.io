			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were talking, there was a low roar outside the camp, and the two were immediately alert. Then they heard the footsteps getting closer and closer, accompanied by a snoring breath. Elinette took the weapon and he whispered to Siegel, "You go and call them all, it seems that the beast is close."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Pick up the tent and kick the companion's soles - this is the secret sign that quickly wakes up the companions in the camp. He had just finished this thing and saw a huge black shadow rushing into the camp and hitting the warhammer with a dwarf burning flame. The shadows and the dwarf rolled together, hit the carriage, made a lot of noise, and smashed the wheel of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the light of the campfire, Siegel noticed that it was a huge black bear, like a hill that would move. Its hind legs are thicker than Siegel's waist, and its claws, like the daggers, can easily pull scratches on the ground. It opened its mouth and exposed two rows of sharp, thick teeth, and a bad breath spread. The black bear skin is thick and thick, and the impact just made it obviously did not cause any harm to him. The bear shook his head and roared loudly in the middle of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You stupid bear, still want to eat me this dwarf? Come on! Let me break your teeth!" Elinte waved the warhammer The prestige said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel's flying knife came with the wind and inserted into the fur of the black bear, but did not see a drop of blood. He saw the broad sword at the waist and the other hand picked up the burning firewood from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black bear simply ignored Siegel, just staring at Elinette with his eyes. His eyes gradually reddened, and a lot of saliva spit on his mouth. The black bear stood upright and threw himself at the top of the dwarf. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene does not retreat, shrinking his body into a ball, like a steel ball, hitting the soft belly of the black bear. His strong thighs instantly exerted strength, like a lever, and picked up the huge body of the black bear. Siegel held a long sword and quickly rushed to the head of the bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A huge gap extends from the head to the chin. The black bear is irritated by the heavy blow and slams into the upper body. Siegel was bombarded with a strong force, and his training and armor protected him, so Siegel was only slightly injured. Elinette turned over from the bear's stomach and turned back and hammered on the hind legs of the black bear. When the bones broke, the beast immediately lost its balance, and the body fell and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf rushed out of the tent and quickly bowed and arched, accurately piercing the throat of the beast. The black bear struggled to get up and was rushed to the plateau to hang his neck. The barbarian made a roar, his arms muscles bulged, and he was strong like a steel chain, pressing the beast. Eilet continued to use the hammer to interrupt the limbs of the beast. Siegel took the opportunity to cut the belly of the black bear with a broad sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast struggled for a while and soon died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is weird, Elinte said: "I am so big, I have never heard of a black bear attacking the camp so crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian circling around the black bear, suddenly squatting down and picking up a wet ring from the body. He wiped things from the vest and then called Eilet and asked, "This seems to be something of your dwarf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene I quickly picked it up and looked at it carefully. There was a dignified look on his face. This is the armor of the armor, and the coat of arms is the Mola family. Did they encounter an accident? "Siegel, come over, help me cut this black bear completely. I want to see what he has eaten?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are The bones of the dwarf were found in the stomach pocket of the black bear, and there were few traces of grinding on it. It seems that the black bear is very anxious when eating, and swallows the bones. Eileen resisted the great sadness and tried to find clues from the body. Finally he picked up a section of bone and pointed to the section and said: "They were cut or opened, and then they were eaten by the bear. So they are definitely not killed by the beasts, but murdered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea went to the heights after the battle, and she just came back. She patted the dwarf's shoulder to express comfort, and then pointed to the trace of the black bear charge: "The footprint of the black bear is very obvious, are we going to see him in the direction?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I dare to feed on dwarves, or on the dwarf's site. I will completely annihilate them for revenge for my compatriots!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The cave of the black bear is not far from here, and it is hidden in the valley of the rock formation. Leah found the cave, called everyone, the bones in the cave, and the wreckage of some dwarf armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a male bear living alone, and I haven’t seen traces of mother bear or cubs around." Lia explained: "The bear is rarely in himself." Hunting at the entrance of the cave, there is no habit of dragging the body back to eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, these dwarves are killed and then thrown here. Irene is furious: "The sacred thing! The next 10,000 hells! Elf, can you trace their traces?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elf shook his head: "This should be something happened a few days ago. The activity of the bear has affected the traces around it. Now the sky is still not bright, I can try again after the sun rises."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf squatted on the ground, clutching the bones of his compatriots with both hands, and he was unhappy. Siegel untied the small shovel he carried with him, and found a piece of open space outside the cave to start digging the grave, ready to bury these bodies. The shovel of the shovel echoed in the silent night, and then the sound of sharpening the knife. Siegel turned to look at the past, Dio was sitting on the ground, polishing the curved blade with the stones he used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man threw a piece of oilstone: "Use this, the general stone is useless, and it will damage the blade."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You really have everything, really and Sir Bill a style." Barbarian grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now there is still a period of time from dawn, what are you doing in a hurry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Wait and see, let's get out soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, the dwarf stood up after a while, holding the bones in the shallow pit. "Siegel, you don't have to dig, just use the soil to cover it. Let's take revenge for them, come back and slowly clean up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lea Master Don't you have to wait until dawn to track the enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid boy, just just excited, I forgot the simplest thing. There are only watchtowers with dwarves stationed around. There must be more clues there. The good guys of the Mora family can't just die in vain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people returned to the camp, the dwarves also took time to sort out Good mood, began to issue a series of orders. He asked the driver to change the four-wheeled carriage into two rounds, allowing the messenger to ride to the top of the Mora, to mobilize the gem clan battle group as quickly as possible, and then return to the area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irenet with Elf Lia, Barbarian Dio and Siegel, fully armed, carrying enough food and water for 5 days, starting from here go ahead. They are careful, always in the shadow of rocks and mountains, hiding their body shape. After leaving the carriage, the speed of action has become faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They started their journey from dawn, had no rest at all, just ate some simple dry food during the march. By noon, the sun shone from the top of the head, and there was no big shadow around to cover the whereabouts. They stopped to rest. At this time, the watchtower has appeared in the eyes of several people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of construction, the observation view of the tower was fully considered, so it was built on the top of a hill, just above the heads of the four adventurers. . Despite the glare of the sun, several people found that the window of the watchtower was slowly smouldering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Molla family must have been killed. This watchtower was built without a chimney, so it is not allowed to ignite inside."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do we get there?" Dio probe looked at the terrain and re-slid down to discuss: "It takes a while for this height to climb up, especially you, Elinte." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This watchtower is relatively simple to build, with wooden doors on the sides, not like those on the plain that must pass through the underground passage. There is a road to the west of the tower. There are no rocks and plants to cover the roads, but we can use the special environment here.” The dwarfs arranged for everyone: “After noon, the sun will be covered by the wall mountains, so the tower is on the hillside. The west side is in the shadows, and the east side is still very bright. Even the eyes of our dwarves will not be able to adapt to this intense contrast for a while, so that the situation on the road cannot be seen. That is to me. Favorable moment, we can try to sneak up "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
