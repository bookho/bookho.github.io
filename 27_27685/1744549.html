			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have imagined how a dragon like you will live a life." Siegel put down the cake and turned his head to the direction of dripping: "Don't hide, I know you are invisible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Capricorn reveals its shape, and the huge gray-gray body lies on the heap of treasure. Its wings are closed, the tail is curled behind, and the belly is pressed against the priceless bed. Two different pupils were staring at the basket beside Siegel, and the saliva continued to overflow from the gap of the neat teeth, with the ticking ticking on the gold and silver. Even saliva has a fairly high temperature, although it is not enough to melt gold and silver, but it has been able to make them shine brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is very sure that he has just stood in the dragon's place, but did not encounter the huge size. When he used the wand to command the gem of the river, he also consciously swept the entire nest to check whether there were invisible objects, but nothing was obtained. What kind of spell did Moses take to avoid Siegel's investigation? The mage is very curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to eat something? I think you must be hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am I really want to eat something in your basket. It smells good." The dragon stretched his neck and slipped from the top of the treasure pile, but turned into a human form before landing on the ground. The skin of Capricorn is very pale under the radiance of the eternal flame, like a woman who is seriously ill. She walked barefoot to the side of the basket and squatted down, staring at the cake in the basket. Although anyone can see her desire, the dragon girl did not reach out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel fully understands her approach and knows that her guess is not wrong. Capricorn is a dragon that wants to overcome the impulses of the body and bring magic power to the limit. He looked at it quietly and suddenly felt that his approach was cruel. This dragon may not be able to do anything, but what is the practice of seduce her with food? It's like using a smart person to bully a child—although the child can easily burn the castle and destroy the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage bowed his head and said softly to Capricorn: "I'm sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;龙The woman still keeps her knees, but she looks at Siegel: "Why are you saying sorry, are you doing something wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes." Siegel admitted: "I want to trap you with food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Capricorn does not seem to be surprised. She said: "You are still the first to seduce me with cake, and it is the first one who dares to admit it in front of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also had Other people?” Siegel asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course. Killing the dragon to steal the treasure is not the dream of every human being?" Capricorn said: "But don't blame them, after all, big Some of the dragon's treasures are also obtained in the same way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an inextricable cycle, Siegel thought. "Can you tell me why you are no longer eating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I need a powerful magical power to leave the world." There seems to be no sense of confidentiality about this issue. I thought of it and said, "I want to go to my father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Taikoo Platinum Dragon?" Asked Ger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s a black dragon." Capricorn’s answer was contrary to the Master’s expectation, “My father lives on a flying castle, in a different The world shuttles back and forth. But I don't know why he left me in this world. Although it gave me a lot of good things. I also let the dragons of this world take care of me, but I still miss him."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that there are several people in the Masters Association who can open channels to other worlds. Why don't you go find them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I tried it." Capricorn said: "They can't do it, they want to catch me with the oath. The most annoying thing is that death does not recognize, so I burned them."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I admit, Siegel is sweating and thinking about it. It seems that this dragon must deal with it very frankly, otherwise it will be the only end of the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Capricorn stood up and pinched his fist and said: "This is the only way I can think of. A long time ago I asked St. Long Lung Craka, he is the strongest dragon in the world. But According to his spell ability, he can't reach the strength of my father's world. According to him, it is only a line. So I have to be more solid in spells. Every scale and every tooth should be purest. The power of the elements. So the food you brought to me is tempting, but I can't eat it now.” After the dragon girl finished, she glanced back and swallowed her saliva, and then asked: “This thing is called What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Honey Cake.” Siegel replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn nodded solemnly and said, "I remember. Let my father find me to eat later."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is sad to just pull his hair. He began to understand why the dragons would use the sacred sacred peaks to perfuse the sacred dragons, because it is indeed the most difficult place for Siegel. Not only is the Master studying the Dragon, but the Dragons are certainly studying the Master. There are two kinds of existence in the world that can completely restrain a mage: a stronger power than a mage and a mage's own conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil Master will fail under the power of Platinum Dragon. It is believed that the dragons all condensed with elemental energy will be extremely powerful for the restraint of magic. The sympathy of a good mage will make the dragon invincible. The only thought in Siegel’s mind is to help her and help this poor dragon girl who is also an orphan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his reason clearly told him that he could remove the word "poor". Even if she doesn't eat or drink, she is also a powerful dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master suddenly had an idea. So he said: "The only food you need is all kinds of elements? Can you pick a specific type?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss 缇 缇 nodded: "If you can Balanced absorption of water and fire four elements, that is the most ideal situation, but usually can not be so extravagant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have something here, Maybe it can help you." Siegel opened the space bag and took out the core of the rune element guard from the inside. As soon as it leaves the enclosed space, it begins to absorb the energy of the surrounding earth elements. He handed this thing to Capricorn. Placed in her pale palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, this magic item can attract elemental energy and may help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon girl carefully feels the energy from the palm of her hand, then sticks out her tongue and slams a slap-in ritual stick, swallowing all the earth element forces attached to the surface. Then she took a deep breath, her eyes seemed to suddenly light up, and she looked at Siegel with a look of sorrow: "The pure earth element is much better than what I usually absorb. This is the gift you gave me. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Siegel said with a smile: "I will be happy if I can help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will accept it." Capricorn replied: "But this does not mean that you can take something from me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head. He replied: "If these treasures are left to you by your father, I will never take them. But can you take a look at these two spell books?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't break it, I'll be a friend who has credit." Capricorn took another slap in the rune and seemed to like it to continue to attract earth elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Siegel thought about it and said, "If I can give you four elements of the rune, can you?" Help me a favor?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon girl thought about it and said, “I need to accumulate energy, so I won’t be too tired.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled, and he patted his chest and said, "Do not worry, I am measured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Janet has been waiting for Siegel at the foot of the mountain of St. Joseph. I saw him coming back from a sigh of relief. The mage still carried the basket in his hand and flew to Janet, then took out the honey cake and shared it with her. Passing a signal of happiness from Siegel's eyebrows seems to have done something remarkable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
