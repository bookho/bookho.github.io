			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel untied the rope from the old man, then held the skin and poured the red wine into the mouth of the one-eyed old man. Fazak swallowed in a big mouth and the long-lost cool feeling made the body feel a lot better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will not die, I have already given you the antidote." Siegel said: "I also came from Deepwater City, at first not Know that you are a spy there, and when I know it is too late to stop you from getting poison."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak looked up and weighed it for a while, I felt that I couldn’t solve any problems at this time, so I asked, "How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I left a pair of eyes on the ceiling to see It’s your secret letter.” Siegel said: “Even so, I must know if you are a person who can keep secrets and will betray me.” The Master thought of Lin Ke, who died in the cage, maybe the snow has already Buried his body. What is the last thing that person is going to say, sorry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing in Macabu?" Fazak asked: "Who is the person with the birthmark behind the ear?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and shrugged his shoulders. "There is no person with a face with a birthmark. It was made up by me. But soon I really need a ship to leave here. I think the whole thing is full of coincidences, especially when looking for you. There are so many grocery stores in Macabu, I have entered your home, and you are a spy in Deepwater."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am unlucky, I can't say anything coincident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master shook his head and he began to cascade the whole thing. From the Three Peaks Tower, he was left to attend the meeting of the Master and the Lord of the Deepwater City. The whole thing was very strange. He knew Makarbu for the first time from that meeting, knew the war with the orcs, knew the Cavaliers and opened up the lords. He went to the north, experienced adventures, listened to the thoughts of the blind man and the heart, and entered the Macabu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he chose this grocery store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When recalling the meeting, the Federation predicted that the sergeant and the bachelor, Mr. Faranis, stared at his eyes closely, and Siegel could not help but A thought: Has he foreseen this situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am not there, how do you get two thousand gold coins?" Siegel asked Fazak, but there was no way to answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to destroy the orc's dock, tell me what to do, help me." The wizard said: "I have no clue."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makabu has a total of six shipyards, except for one that is only used for maintenance, and the other five are constantly building warships. The three-eyed warlord has an endless expansion of the size of the Navy, but there is a serious shortage of qualified sailors. In the slave market, a slave who has been a seafarer, even if it is just a fat cook who can't sail, is five times the price of the most beautiful female slave. In order to be able to use the sailors to the maximum limit, the three-eye command no longer built a brisk plundering ship, but began to build a large ship, which in turn caused the price of carpenters and blacksmiths to soar. Siegel noticed this anomalous move and tried to explore its intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he couldn’t get close to the shipyard, where he was surrounded by the army of three-eye warlords. Every five steps there was an orc standing, whistling and patrolling. Know how much more. It is speculated that the new top three-eyed generals have at least 50,000 troops, and Siegel calculates that at least 3,000 people are moving near the docks according to the daily food shipped to the shipyard. Destroy the shipyard? Siegel has no such idea now, and his ability can cause a lot of trouble, but that's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can use his seafarer's ability to become a sailor, enter the inside of the orc, and incite rebellion or riot. This is a common thing in the territory of a new upper warlord, and it is also the beginning of Siegel's plan. But the three-eyed general is different from other chaotic and cruel orc generals who ruled their territory with orderly high pressure. The Witches and the Guards patrol daily and use the way of reporting each other in the army, so that all orcs do not dare to express any dissatisfaction. Among the orcs, the third eye of the legendary three-eyed general has been able to discover the clues of all rebellions, and the suppression is both fast and bloody. Siegel understands that it is too difficult to provoke riots under such circumstances. Unless there is a major turnaround, you can only give up the original plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that the bloody knight of the Deepwater City, Count Maxim, is coming to Macabu, and their purpose is to burn the dock. But I don't know where and how they act." Siegel said: "My speculation now." Yes, the faceless person you have to wait for is the Earl and his party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak looked up and looked up at Siegel. He has unloaded the disguise, and the eyes that were originally full of exhaustion and tiredness are now stunned and their eyes are firm and sharp. “Even if I still don’t believe you, but I can only act according to your plan?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said: “At least you have toxins It takes three days to get rid of it. Before that, you have difficulty moving, and you can't even control the urination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, can it be worse?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can." Siegel nodded and said: "You are dead, no one has found a connector, the orc continues to build a ship, and Deepwater City becomes a ruin." Maybe I can find a way to get out of here, but I can only watch the disaster happen. What do you think of this result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak is silent for a while, I finally agreed to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to improve is Siegel’s camouflage technology. Fitzak is rarely easy to accommodate, but he has learned this skill after all, much more professional than the Master. Although he can't do it himself, it's okay to tell Siegel how many materials should be added and what techniques should be used to shape the skin. They were busy for another three hours and finally made Siegel look more like Fitzak. As long as it persists for three or four days without being discovered, Siegel thinks that anyway, the true one-eyed dad can resume his ability to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Siegel’s money bag, don’t say two thousand gold coins, even if you double it again, it’s not difficult. However, in order to avoid the scene where the slaves on the dock were transported directly to the dock in the morning, Fitzkack asked Siegel to write a few letters, with some money for bribery, and sent them to several slave merchants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope this works." Fazak can only pray. The practice of the three-eyed warlord Lund is indeed prone to public anger, but Fazak does not see the intention behind this orc. Or is he hoping that those who dare to speak out will jump on the stage themselves? To be on the safe side, he can only look for slave traders who are hard-working in the background, and spend a lot of money to avoid being implicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need more money." Fitzk is always saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky began to fall snow again, this is the third snow after Siegel came to the orc city. Although the Heishui River never thaws, there are some thin layers of ice on the sea. Many boats began to return, they were difficult to withstand the cold of the sea, so they retracted to the river terminal for docking. The latest news from the wilderness, General Iron Foot was hit hard in the battle with Deepwater City, surrounded by a large army in a place called Sanwandi. The cavalry of the two-headed wolf is going to the rescue, but the peeling general Kaka is not moving. The reason is to protect the safety of the passage of the mountain wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knox Commonwealth is an ally of Siegel in dealing with orcs, and now they finally wait until their arrangement begins to work. For the time being, I haven’t heard any problems with the Black Blood Castle or other wall-walled defense lines. Siegel also prayed not to happen. His only hope is to turn Macabu's shipbuilding industry into ruins as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is gray, cold is afraid of people. Siegel put on a thick cloak and just about to push the door out, he saw an orc coming in. The guy looked at him with a deep scar from the left forehead to the right chin, just half cut his nose. Before he even spoke to Siegel, he used his left hand to pick up the "one-eyed old man" and said with a big mouth with a bad breath: "You are Fitzak, one-eyed old man?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was raised in the air, his eyes crossed the noseless orc's right hand, and he found that he did not intend to take out his weapon. He also noticed that the allegiance tattoos of the three-eyed warlords on the forehead of the orcs were definitely only recently made. Siegel guessed that this was an orc who had just turned his eyes, but he didn't know which force he belonged to. Siegel grabbed the orc's left arm, and his eyes noticed that his brow was slightly undetectable, and he knew that there was a wound in the place where he was caught. There is a great possibility that the warlords who are already dead are hammering their hands, only their loyalty tattoos are on the left arm. There is only one way to remove the tattoo, burn it with fire, and the wound of the nose without the nose has not healed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel put three fingers on his lips, then added one, and closed the "only" one. After the orc saw it, put him down, put his fist on his nose, and put up his little finger. This action gave him a sweat, but Siegel still sees it clearly - this is the faceless person who comes to the joint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
