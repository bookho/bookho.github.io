			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many dangers in volcanic passages, mostly hidden in the seemingly normal natural environment. Here is the intersection of ice and fire, always producing some extreme conditions. You may think that the snow that melts above your head will be cold and refreshing, but it is likely that it has been heated to the point where it can burn people. The ground under the feet, some places are only temporary calm lava, the surface looks very strong, but when you step on it will bake the whole foot. They also have to be careful about the loose stones, where the intermittent vibrations of the volcano increase the cracks between the rocks, whether they are hands or feet. The air here is the most dangerous killer, it is likely to take a breath, the toxins inside will kill you. Two people would rather be burnt, and also took off their tops, covering their faces and blocking their nose and mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salamanders kill the elements of fire at the bottom of the pit, which is a happy game for them. However, any one of them can only look up and see the shadow of two ghosts moving up. Compared to the monotonous taste of the fire element, the flesh-and-blood food is more liked by the salamanders. They will not hurry to start hunting, and Siegel basically have no way to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you go up, the lower the temperature in the air, the surrounding rocks are no longer hot and can't be touched, and the soles of the feet are much better. I don't know how long it will take for two people to escape. How far can two people run? Siegel tried not to think about these things and focused on what he was going to do. Pay attention to the disturbance of the air, be careful of the poisonous smoke, and Siegel constantly reminds himself that even if it is so bad, you must breathe a little bit, and you can't suck it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A salamander was overwhelmed by the struggle of the fire element, just to see the two men marching against the wall. The first thing after it turned into a body was to scream. Two groups of stowaways were found in the salamander group, and they were chased after four feet. Compared with elemental creatures, flesh and blood are more attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the things in your hand, you can't beat this group of salamanders anyway, running on the mountain roads, not their opponents. Siegel almost fell into despair. At this time, the mountain suddenly swayed and there was a gravel falling from the mountain wall. The lava at the bottom of the pit began to boil, and the bubbling bubbles caused the magma to be blown high. The salamanders looked at each other and quarreled with each other, but eventually decided to turn around and escape into the cave passage at the bottom of the pit, leaving only the fire element dancing joyfully in the lava. Siegel didn't feel like watching this dance. Even if he saw the volcano for the first time, he knew that something bad would happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wick!" The Orc yelled and then began to run wild, followed by Siegel. At this time, I have been unable to consider why this "just right" earthquake occurred. Even if there is further doubt in my heart, Siegel understands that it is the most important to get out of here to survive. The ground was shaking more and more under their feet, and there were a lot of erupting holes on the mountain wall, which increased from the bottom to the top. As long as it is sprayed, whether it is temperature or toxins can kill. Siegel rushed out of the fat, only two pieces of nails, just a light body. This and inferior material can lead to unstable spells, which involve energy and are even more difficult to maintain during running. Siegel took a deep breath and knew that he had only one chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and concentrated all his attention on the fluctuations of spells and perceived magical energy. The surrounding fire elements have an effect on his spellcasting, but the intense eruption of the airflow enhances the vitality of the gas, which is the only good news. When the volcanic throat began to make a roar of earth-shattering, even the sound of Siegel’s loud singing voice was completely obscured. The fat is consumed and the spells are barely finished. The gas element elf happily wraps around Siegel's limbs, holding his armpits, allowing the wizard's speed to improve in all directions—even if only for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has chased up a few steps, no wind resistance, only power, this is the power of magic. The poison gas will not be close, because it is only the purest air to get close, and the toxin and acid are the products of the earth, not the vassal of the gas element. The Musk half-orc stumbled forward. He took a poisonous cigarette and almost lost consciousness. Now he is completely supported by his strong will and physical fitness. Siegel caught up with him, stretched out the prisoner and glared at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This behavior makes the energy consumption of spells faster, but the Master doesn't care. He calculated that it was enough to run out of the crater before the spell expired. But then the volcano suddenly had a strong shake, and the whole mountain was shaking up and down. Two people were thrown up and slammed into the rock. The passage in front of them collapsed, and the last section of the road became a cliff, and at this time they were 10 meters away from the exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can you climb?” Siegel observed the rock wall, where there are pits and prominent rocks, and there are plenty of places to let go. His light body is still there, there is no problem climbing up here, the only thing that needs to be worried is the half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the idea of ​​throwing the half-orc, it just flashed through his mind and did not cause the slightest wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel climbed up first, followed by Mike, who only climbed three meters and found the problem. There are a lot of places on the mountain wall where you can settle, but there are not a few safe support points. In the volcanic earthquakes, the structure of rock and lime soil has long been unstable. Perhaps the spiral channel could be supported before, but the last vibration also became extremely unstable. Siegel grabbed the stone several times and stepped on a lot of gravel at the foot. The station stood unstable. This is still the effect that can be achieved with the help of light body skills. If it is a half-orc to climb, it is not unexpected that something will happen, and at that time, Siegel will bear the weight of two people. The mage does not think that he has such a good climbing ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel jumped back into the channel and took out some of his own hair in the eyes of the half-orc. If there is a spider silk as a casting material, it is the most ideal situation, so you don't have to endure the pain of plucking. However, the viscosity of the spider silk will affect the result that Siegel ultimately wants, and the hair may have a miraculous effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this can't be called a spider web, it can only be called a headband..." Siegel keeps hurting his head, putting The hair is shaking in the hands. He mobilizes the magical energy around him, carefully transforms the elements of the spell, and strives to maintain the stability of the spell structure. In just three seconds, the spell failed, but Siegel understood the missing elements of the spell: the material must have a entangled structure, at least enough curl, otherwise it will directly affect the final shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is straight hair, and Mike is also, where is the entangled curly structure around? Siegel stunned for three seconds, his brain spinning fast, his eyes searching. Everything around is shaking, like a cold patient is sucking his nose, ready to fight a sneeze - a deadly lava flame sneeze. Fortunately, the toxic smoke has faded a lot, and the situation of the gram has improved. Time is tight, there is no other way, Siegel thinks. He reached into his trousers and endured the pain and pulled out the casting material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never the next time." Siegel resisted tears and discomfort, and with the determination to succeed, began to mobilize magical energy. This time the spell finally came into effect, and a large piece of fine mesh like vines covered the rocky mountain wall, forming a two-meter-wide, eight-meter-high, stretched to the reinforced structure of the cliff top. Unlike the cobweb, it does not have any adhesion ability. Instead, it penetrates the filament into the crack of the rock, and connects the loose parts into a whole, sharing the force together. In this way, Siegel can find a stable support point, you can let go of your hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked up three meters and found that the chain around his waist was tightened, and he looked back and saw that Mike was still standing on the ground. He stared at the wall covered with filaments, his face stagnate, and hesitated to put his hand on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When are you still hesitating?" Siegel shouted loudly: "If you want to die here, just say it!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sucker! Jack!" The Orcs finally made up their minds and tried to climb up. Siegel stared at him to share his weight. They climbed and the walls disintegrated, but they supported them to climb over the crater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the volcano, strong winds are a living thing, whistling around them like wilderness and wolves, mixed with the sound of magma explosions and strong air currents. Together, loudly quarreled: "Run, run." Two people rushed down the volcano, specifically to pick where there is snow. There have been lava flowing out of the mountain to form a fiery river, so only the area covered by snow is safe. After Siegel is afraid that the temperature will increase, the snow layer on the entire hillside will be loose, and a large avalanche may form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the things they are worried about have not happened, the volcano has not fully erupted, only the part of the mountain top is shattered, smoke is coming out, and it is projected outward. Thousands of dark red flame flower clusters performed a slinger siege performance within a radius of three miles. Two people rushed down with a roll of belt, and everyone was covered with snow, like a round snowman. They fell more than four hundred meters and stopped until a hot spring lake. The two were cold and hungry, the sweat dampened the clothes, and they were frozen on the body. Siegel's hands and feet were constantly shaking, which is a sign that the body temperature is rapidly decreasing. If you don't want a way, they will soon lose consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing left to hide, only a huge empty deep snow valley. The water in the hot springs exudes a sulphur smell that must not be drunk, and this temperature can't go on heating unless you want to be cooked. But here is another important casting material: sulfur. Siegel walked to the side of Sulphur Lake, where the yellow crystals were everywhere, and the hand was a big one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
