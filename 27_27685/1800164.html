			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the original scale, the workshop area in the Rift Valley has expanded sixfold, and a large number of dwarves fill the craftsmen The vacancies of the manpower, the raw materials shipped from the wild land first appeared insufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the Mire Nuclear and Advanced Creations, the Rift Valley area of ​​Heim has surpassed the overall steel production capacity of the New World in the past – On the production of the top of the Mora. Various materials such as gold, silver, lead, tin, and copper are also being produced. If they are all made into money, the number will be large enough to directly destroy the economy of any kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Siegel has long understood the true meaning of wealth, he valued the value of things rather than exchange value. The gold and silver that Heim led were not used to make gold coins, and even almost did not flow out, but all went into the underground warehouse of Mier City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a stock of tens of millions of gold coins, which is still a very conservative estimate." The people in the workshop area have come to the conclusion through statistics: "If Adding gems and other rare minerals, the treasury of the Marquis of Siegel is worth at least 100 million gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel relies on its own transportation and smelting capabilities He has gained a lot of wealth, and his treasure house has become the dream place for thieves all over the world. For a time, the city of Mier was the place where the “treasure adventurers” came together. They tried to find the place where the hundreds of millions of gold coins were stored. However, all thieves understand that the enemy they face is a sergeant, and is the master who masters the secret nuclear, one of the strongest people in the world. Reckless action can only be killed by spell traps and guards, and only the most carefully planned plans are likely to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone did succeed. With the help of some magic scrolls and props, a halfling rogue named Foba found Siegel's vault. He thought that there would be endless treasures, but only the empty room and a portal with a rainbow of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel spent almost all of his gold and silver treasures to buy materials for making magical spaceships. No one in the world of the thunder wall can provide him with such a large amount of various cherished materials. It is only possible to connect the outer domain (outer plane) through the door of the outer boundary. He used the astral projection to safely reach the center of the outer domain, "gate city", to negotiate with the merchants here. The value of precious metals such as gold and silver in the outer domain is lower than that in the main material plane, but it is still a popular commodity, and it can be exchanged for scarce resources that the federation cannot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate goal of trading with foreign domains is not a resource, but a high-level spell scroll. Since each crystal wall has its own characteristics, there is no small difference in the composition of the spell. But it is better than guessing without a reel. Siegel issued a commission through a businessman from a foreign domain, hoping to find a world dominated by the four elements of "water and fire", and to purchase a high-level spell scroll from the mage of this world. These spells may be able to promote the study of spells in the Thunder Wall world, greatly reducing the risk of research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the halfling finds the treasure house. Siegel is in the outer domain, so the door to the outside world is open. Although Foba was cautious, he was still sucked in by the door of the outside world and thrown into the gate city. His adventure is another story, and when Siegel returned, he did not realize that there were uninvited guests here. It also directly closed the door to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the empty treasure house, another 50 meters deep is a huge hollow, and the lucky Soss is here for construction. In addition to excavating through the soil, only the precisely positioned transmission can reach here. Siegel arranged four super-large soil elements to patrol around the caves, on the one hand to prevent the accidental proximity of the locating speed, and on the other hand to eliminate the vibration caused by the construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cave is still within the scope of the Peruvian nuclear, so the makers of the gods and lights can work properly. Every night, Siegel will send parts and materials to the cave with a transfer spell, and the constructor assembles according to the drawings of the maker's golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire spacecraft has been completed, and now it is only left to awaken its self-awareness. Siegel came to the lucky Soss with a number of smart magic items purchased from the Outland, using them all as a casting material. Yan Ling Jing is also one of the must-have items. There are many people in the outer region who have lost their lives in the outer world. Many of them are in the hands of adventurers, so its price is declining. Otherwise, it is really difficult for Siegel to get such things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has created a blank lamp god, that is, the soul of the lamp god without any magical skills, only two requirements for it: obey the command of the manufacturer and Perceive and manipulate itself. Then Siegel began to combine this light god soul with the magic ship. He needs to go through every corner of the ship, let all the elements oscillate at a special frequency and penetrate into every inch of material. The control network of the elemental polymer and the energy delivery network of the plasma continue to operate during this process, which means that Siegel will repeat this process three to four times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spacecraft itself is a miniature magic tower, but the owner of the magic tower is not Siegel, but the light god that is about to wake up. The lamp god itself has no spell power, only Siegel can cast spells on it, and then the lamp god is passing the magic outside the hull. This is a very inefficient conversion process, but in order to make the whole ship a soul individual rather than an object. Only the ownership of all parts is given to the lamp god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of the entire spacecraft is completely confidential, and even the Federation does not know the composition of the ship. It is precisely because there is no help from the Confedition Master that Siegel himself cannot build a mana pool. He only has to retreat to the next level, using the variable modular magic map to simulate different spell effects. This way, even if Siegel is absent, the spacecraft can release light, repair, Master's hand, communications, magic missiles, electric claws, shields, resistance to elemental damage and secondary invisibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each element of the secondary brain is equivalent to a cast node, the ship has a total of 108 such nodes. The spacecraft's caster level is very low, and only one magic missile can be fired at a node. However, if the whole ship is fully attacked, it is theoretically possible to shoot 324 missiles at a time. It is not possible that all magic missiles attack the same target due to the angle of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel manipulates the elements to oscillate and keeps moving in the cabin. He stroked the ship like he was stroking his second child. The structure of the cabin is very "outside" style. The words and pictures inside are created by Siegel, using a cultural background called "Zenith Star". The digital system inside uses eleven digits and is represented by a mixture of numbers and symbols. This is the knowledge learned from the process of the "writer" using mathematics to explain words. Once the mathematical structure is changed, the logical structure is completely modified, and such a language is the most difficult to crack. Siegel designed the language to be a structure that could not be reversed unless it was all learned. Thereby enhancing the security effect of the magic spacecraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Siegel’s own use of this set of things is very difficult, let alone others. Fortunately, the knowledge of the Light God Control Center is infused by Siegel, and there will be no problems in the exchange of the two. Siegel slowly taught the various organs of the "body" at the heart of the lamp god, taught him how to manipulate his two hearts, and slowly learned how to resist gravity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an uninterrupted process. After five days of sleeplessness, you can exchange for the success of the final spellcasting. Siegel sees this process as a childbirth, and he already has a son, Isaac, so he develops the newly born lamp god in the direction of his daughter. In particular, this spacecraft was fired as a warship. Perhaps the female character can make its aggressiveness not too strong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the art decoration of the zenith star of the whole ship, only one room adopts the style of the wall-mounted continent. Siegel combines his two most affectionate locations, the sailor's cabin of the Soss and the main fort of the city of Myers, where the core of the lamp god is placed in a place called the "Myster's cabin". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apparent command cabin is another room, which is still a place to confuse and cast a blind eye. The real core is in the "Mystery Cabin". Only when you come here can you accurately locate it, and only accurate transmission can reach this place. Siegel teaches the core knowledge of the lamp god here. Also check the operation of each spacecraft component. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the full operation of the secret nuclear core, the core of the lamp god gradually replaced the consciousness of Siegel and took over the entire spacecraft. The anti-gravity array takes it out of the dock and floats in the middle of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All electromagnetic guns can be turned and the entire ship is fully armed. The Creativity Array, supported by the nuclear support, can provide unlimited ammunition. As long as it is not trapped in the void, the ship's endurance is unlimited. The only material that needs to be replenished frequently is iron, and the maintenance array on the spacecraft uses this common metal to avoid wear. Siegel has loaded enough iron for a hundred years in the warehouse, even if he encounters a big battle. After all, the spacecraft appears mainly in the form of astral projections, and its body is basically not worn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master. I want to change my name." The lamp god suddenly said: "You said that the lucky Soss sank in the shipwreck, so This name is not fortunate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not surprised at all, this state is the embodiment of the spacecraft's self-consciousness. "What name do you think of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xingsuo." The lamp god said: "The purpose of my birth is to lock the development of a planet, call this The name is perfect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name is still affected to some extent by the "lucky Sos", the core of the lamp god is still the will of Siegel For the highest consideration. Siegel ordered the star to smash the dock's bracket with a magical missile, clearing out an open space, and then landed steadily on the open space. After finding a comfortable posture "armpit", the two of them will conduct the most important tests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
