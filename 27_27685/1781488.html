			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet continued until late at night, and finally became a convention for fighting and competition. Siegel looked at the starting point of the outposts of the warriors to show martial arts, from time to time to give rewards. Or the wine obtained from the elf, or the dagger of the dragon tooth, but the most popular is the magic weapon that Heim is leading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic sword and magic sword, this is the latest assembly line product. All swords use the same magic lines that allow the holder to use the power of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of lightning as an energy attack is also considered. First of all, the technique of tolerance is easier when it comes to lightning, which can greatly reduce the cost. Lightning weapons can do additional damage when attacking metal armor, and are more practical. In addition, the light of the lightning weapon is instantaneous, not like a huge torch of the half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought a total of three such weapons, one of which was prepared for Moore, engraved with his name. The other long sword and the great sword were also handed over to Moore, and he was rewarded to the knight who started the outpost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If given by Siegel, it would weaken Moore’s authority at the starting point, and it would not be bright enough. So after handing over the magic weapon to him, Siegel excused himself from leaving the banquet scene and letting the outposter decide the winner himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Siegel leave, Evan also followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The west side of the Wall Mountain Range is much cooler than the other side. The great disadvantage of the magnificent plain is that the wind is stronger. The clouds in the sky were blown away, revealing the silvery bright moonlight, and the grassy ocean seemed quiet and serene under the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you not inside?" Siegel said to Evan standing next to him: "I thought you liked watching the scenes best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm afraid I can't help but mix, if it's a champion?" Evan's face, the tide red disappeared. It seems that in addition to Siegel, he also has ways to avoid the physical and mental damage of alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have time, give me a fix on the sword and see if I can add some magic effects." Evan said: "The sword in my hand." It has been used for a long time, and there are tiny cracks inside. I don't know when it will be damaged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me a look." Shot: "Are you a member of the royal family, can you change your good weapons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some weapons in the treasure house of the kingdom, but this sword I won the competition. I have been with me for more than ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalled his first participation in the Cavaliers, when he used Still a fake identity. As an illegitimate child, he has no birth certificate and pedigree, but he has good martial arts. In particular, the winner of the swordsmanship prize was the guardian of the Masters Association. It is to make him feel like he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way through, the winners of the top six swordsmanship will be at the end of the melee, deciding a winner. Many knights keep their physical strength wisely for victory, not easy to risk. Only he is full of blood. Constant attack, as if with unlimited enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally won the championship with one stroke, but Aaron recognized him and called his name. In the eyes of the public, he was canceled the title because of his identity fraud, and naturally he could not get the final prize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron understands that he has done "wrong things", crying screaming, and has been asking the king to kneel down. It is because it is the king. Only need to be more fair and just. The king stood up and announced that he would exchange weapons with the guardian's sword and everything on the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Braun from Lake Ontario gave his own sword and exchanged with the king. This sword is called "the bonfire", a refined weapon from the craftsmen of the Anlu Lake, which is now in the hands of Siegel. Although there is no magic ability, it is not a bad thing in refined weapons, but it is obtained after winning, so it is of great significance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This weapon is very interesting, how do you use it?" Siegel carefully observed after a while and said: "According to the truth, this sword inside Already broken, it should have broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be so mysterious, weapons are weapons, how can there be no damage?" Siegel thought about it, took out his own dust, and handed it over: "Besides this."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stardust looks unpretentious, and it has no edge except the tip of the sword. It seems that even cutting an apple will not work. In Evan's view, this sword is the ultimate pursuit of the swordsman. It purely reflects the essence of swordsmanship "unswerving stabbing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He danced a few times, liked it, but still returned the dust to the Siegel. "This is your weapon. I can feel the connection between the sword and you from above. You still focus on helping me repair the bonfire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel With a long sword, look at the reluctant Evan and sigh. "Well, I will break the case. There is a magic item design method, I have only ideas, no finished products. Just experiment with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What program?" Evan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Break the Devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is a sword for the "King of the King", it cannot Sloppy, some materials Siegel are not brought around, so you need to slowly prepare. Also need to be prepared to go to the team of the blind date, both to appear deterrent, but not to relax the defense of the starting point. In fact, when Siegel heard the name "Dio", he already knew that there would be no danger in this trip, but in order to surprise Moore, he decided to keep secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Moore’s grandfather Fazak is still here, and it’s best to give him the arrangement. So Siegel was rarely idle, and he went to the market of the starting point outpost with Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guide to them is the halfling Lille. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market is just outside the city gate of the bastion. From the morning, there are vendors selling phthalocyanine, onions and a bag of barley. Tribes from the wild grasses gather to sell the flesh, dairy and various herbs of the prey, from the hemostatic grass that can heal the wound to the Gloung root of the aphrodisiac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opposite them are some merchants selling weapons and armor, inferring from the price of yelling, these things are certainly not fresh from the blacksmith shop. Siegel swept his eyes. Most of them had experienced war. They might have served several masters, either from the battlefield or from stolen goods. However, people here are more concerned about the price, and the brown blood on the lock, the pit on the helmet and the arrow hole on the half body are not too concerned. The people here are very practical. Anything that can be repaired is a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can buy fresh grilled voles with a small amount of copper, and you can buy brand new buckskin gloves with a few silver coins. Siegel also saw a huge python skin, which was treated very cleanly. Take it back and you can put Isaac under the ground to make a mat. This thing only needs ten gold coins, and Siegel is even too lazy to bargain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille has a series of foods such as roast voles, roast rabbits, roast sheep eyes, etc., all the way has been filled with his own backpack, she thinks this is The happiest day of your own. It all comes from the generous Sigir. The Earl of Squid - she won't have to borrow the note to say the whole name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halfling is a race that is easy to satisfy and hospitable, and she is determined to give the Earl a gift. Because no shoes are worn, handkerchiefs are the most important thing for halflings - it is difficult for foreigners to understand this logic. Lille’s eyes looked around and finally stared at a good handkerchief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she spends a small amount of money, she is not at all distressed by price. After all, this is a gift for good people. The suspicious tears dripping from the corner of the eye must have been accidentally dropped into the seasoning of the barbecue. It will be fine to wash your face after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prince, this is the handkerchief I gave you." The halfling held a gift with a smile on his face. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned, and quickly took the piece of cloth. This is a black fabric that feels smooth and tough. When the light shines up, it seems to be completely absorbed, and there is no reflective feeling of leather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw this fabric in the black man assassin, how is it in the west of the Walled Mountain Range? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you buy it, can you take me to see?" Siegel worried about scaring the timid halfling, so he said with joy: "This is a good handkerchief, I want to buy more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
