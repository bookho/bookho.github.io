			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem safely descended from the fourth floor of the Magic Tower and waved to Siegel and returned to his residence. He did not appear for the next three days, and no one except Siegel knew what he was doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a change in things, and other students have begun to be careful. In order to avoid the collapse of the mutual aid that was difficult to establish, and to reduce the damage that comes with the upcoming battle, Siegel reported his plan to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am ready, I will start to adjust the lights in the near future. Explain, please come to my room together, so that the lights are gathered Together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?" The dwarf looked at Siegel and licked his beard: "How to make sure you won't be in ours." "Do you have hands and feet in the lamp god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prompt me, what kind of hands and feet can I do?" Siegel smiled and asked. "I am coveting your points or will you eliminate them? In any case, it is the most inefficient way to modify the lights god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarf I don't know how to refute it. Considering that he has received a lot of help from the mutual aid group, he finally decided to believe in Siegel again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem successfully splits three demented individuals whose intelligence level is only maintained at a level that can barely speak and barely understand the command. Using the power of Saint and his knowledge of the God of Glue, these three semi-mud, half-human guys filled the remaining three places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the lights and the room that belonged to them appeared, Anna’s face became unsightly for the first time. Although she tried to cover up, she could clearly feel the difference from the clenched fist and the bite of the mouth. She turned and wanted to return to her room, but was stopped by Chanem, who shrugged her shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Elf, in the wrong direction, should go to Siegel's house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I... I forgot to take things." The elf squeezed out an apologetic expression and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know who I am, and I know that I can recognize lies." Chanem said: "Moreover, go to Siegel to fix the lamp god. Good thing, why don't you go early?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem did not show hostility, naturally he was not influenced by Anna. Seeing this situation, Anna understood that if she wanted to go back to a safe room, she would have to take the initiative to launch an attack. But this can be dragged for a while, but it can't be delayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel opened the door to his room and welcomed everyone from the door. The gnomes and the half dragons took the lead and went inside, then the dwarves. The three foolish foolish geeks limped away and one of them slammed on the doorframe, but they also reached their destination with their respective lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the gaze of both Chennam and Siegel, Elf Anna gave up her intention to return to the room. She took a deep breath and adjusted her expression. Although it still has a smile, it doesn't look so easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to prevent the mutual transmission of the gods, the lead will be abandoned. Only the person who completed the transformation can leave the room." Siegel said to everyone: "Because of me I need to stay here to work, so my lamp god must be the last one. The sooner I leave, the sooner I can learn about the school of magic, so the sooner I go out, the better it is. At this time, in addition to arresting you, you have There are no other thoughts about the order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care." The gnome said: "I also know how to operate, can stay to help you. So I count down The second left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your assistance, but you should go before the three squats." Siegel said with relief: "Don't wait for me." Don't forget that I have already let the lamp god get rid of control. Although it is not long, it has advantages over you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomish Coke nodded , agreed with Siegel's views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semi-long people proposed that the woman is preferred, the others draw, but Chanem and the dwarf both object, so everyone is lucky. In the end, among the few people, the half dragon was the first, then the Chanem, followed by Anna and the dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone gave their "rich" points to Siegel and ordered the lamp god to stand by to Siegel and not to resist. Siegel took out his wand and mobilized the power of elements to oscillate time and space, forming an inner and outer time zone with the door of the room as the dividing line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smashed the outer time to the inner layer so that he could do many things in an instant. When the person inside leaves, it will inevitably pass through the slow outer layer, and the time will be compensated accordingly. When they walk out of a certain distance, they will catch up with the real time, so they can't detect anything unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, Siegel can save a lot of points and further strengthen their own strength. He dismantled the lamp god, mainly in accordance with the steps of the gnome, but also joined his own ideas and quickly restored the lamp gods one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, the restored lamp god must leave immediately, no more than twenty seconds, otherwise there is still the possibility of being reinfected by other lamp gods." The hands kept on, the mouth did not stop, constantly reminding everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half dragon was the first to go out, it seems that he is a little anxious, before the "Ms. Priority" style is gone. Chanem flew two daggers between his fingers and his wrists. They looked like butterflies flying around the petals. Siegel saw him and reminded him: "Don't forget to keep the number of nine people so that no new people will be born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this How could Anna not know what happened? Fortunately, the room is like a field, and no one can attack Siegel unless it goes beyond the rules of the School of Magic. So Anna directed the undead dwarf to cast a dead spell, but found that she could not gather elemental energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prohibit mutual attacks, here is the field of peace." Siegel shook his head at her: "Useless, your reaction is in my expectation." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lille will still come here, occupying the advantage of home, you will not be our opponent." Anna said: "I only failed The place is that I don't anticipate the development of outside spells. Siegel, you can actually prevent my mind-controlling spells, knowing that even the Holy One can do nothing about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You are already a dead person eight hundred years ago. I have already been eliminated. I don't know if it is normal." Siegel let go of Channheim's lamp god and nodded to him: OK, you can go. Control the situation, now when you plan, you don't have to play freely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I started to make the lights God restored the order here and removed the place that was tampered with." After that, he drilled the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows to hear this, Anna laughs: "What do you think these low-level lights gods can do? Where do they come to fix the magic gods? The shackles? You are too whimsical to start Siegel. If you stop, I will let you all leave safely!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since you said that we will fail, Why do you want to stop us?" Siegel smashed Anna's lamp god and did not hesitate to cut its outer shell. "In this way, your logical ability is indeed somewhat flawed. What state are you in the end, elemental soul? Spiritual? Dead soul possessed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Activate the spell." Anna sat down and said without hesitation: "Oh, since you are so confident, I will watch slowly until you fail. Do you think of the highest level to see the fire? Where is the passage? Covered by legendary spells, the district gods can't find it. You have this spell level, but you can't beat the magical beast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who said I am looking for a stair?” The movements of Siegel’s hands kept on, and he became more and more skilled, and soon he was removed from the spell of Anna’s god. "Okay, go. I sincerely hope that you can be a good audience, don't mix in. You have already died once, and now it is the next generation of the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, until now, not to mention Lear's name, what are you afraid of?" Anna recalled the lamp god, standing still in motion. "I will trouble you again later, this lamp god is out of order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s head is not lifted, and the light god of the dwarf continues to work. . "If you just want to, stand up and see if there will be something after the time has passed. Do you think I will not be prepared, let this happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Anna smiled and waited for a while, more than two minutes, her lamp god still did not move. "This is impossible. What you said is the truth. I will not be wrong. After twenty seconds, the lights gods will infect each other and return to the control of the spell. This is not wrong!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
