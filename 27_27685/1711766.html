			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster is called a green-footed snake, a magical creature that can draw lightning and use lightning to attack. Siegel read the material of this monster in the book, but for a time it can't be related to what is in front of him. He stood at the door, holding a short dagger in his hand, guarding the whole god, observing the action mode of the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still ambushes, despicable humans!" The monster uttered a word, and then continually made a string of sounds like screaming and crows. Straight into the cochlea. This kind of sound makes people's ears sting, the hair is upright, and the body is difficult to maintain balance. Siegel resisted and did not hold his ears with his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to hell!" The green-footed snake raised its body, and a flash of hair bursted between the two corners of its head, gathering into a rolling thunderball. Siegel smelled the lightning magic energy gathered in the air and immediately read the secret word "Schlac"! The wand hits his hand, and the magic gathers at the tip of the stick, pushing the surrounding rain away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can only emit small arcs, far from the intensity of the lightning beam, so you can't use the element to cancel the lightning attack of the monster. However, he can use the element to resist the shield, and this protection magic greatly reduces the power of lightning. As for the part of the energy that the shield can't resist, it can only rely on the body to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning shot, shield open, the two collided with a strong flash and dull thunder. The shield did not completely block the lightning, and the dissipated energy was blown away by the gravel, leaving a fine wound on Siegel. The kitten exclaimed, immediately fell low, and blocked his eyes with his arms before they escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel resisted the pain in his body, concentrated all his strength on his limbs, forced himself to rush out of the rain with the power of the will, and killed the green-footed snake. By the resistance of the scorpion, he quickly got rid of the effects of paralysis. The first few steps he took out would have a violent splash, but the next few steps have restored the level of the elf war dance, such as a little bit of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in order to resist these magics, his energy has consumed a lot, and now he is beginning to feel hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Snake also felt a force blocking the attack when it fired lightning, knowing that the lightning did not reach its maximum effect, so it continued to do so. Preparation for the battle. At the same time as Siegel rushed forward, the monster had already lowered his body, scribbling a circular arc on the ground like a snake, slamming his head and opening his mouth, like a serrated sickle from the flank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden scream in the sky, the giant man leaping down from the top of the broken tower wall, stepping on the green-footed snake with his feet Body. The monster body hit a fold, spewing a lot of blood from the mouth, and the wound muscles were squeezed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the opportunity to pounce on the chin of the green-footed snake, trying to cut off its most powerful weapon - the mouth of the full-length tooth. The monster's scales are tougher than imagined, and they are covered with slippery mud. The dagger was successfully inserted into the body of the green-footed snake, cutting a huge wound, but did not succeed in beheading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster won’t smash it, it slams its neck, and the huge mouth is under the hood of Siegel, and the strong bad breath makes people feel dizzy. The green-footed snake has the ability to swallow people, and few people can escape from its stomach full of stomach acid. Siegel hurriedly escaped, and with the spirit of the elf war dance, he escaped the deadly live swallow, but he was still bitten by the crocodile-like mouth. Two rows of fangs stabbed into the muscles, and the huge bite force almost tore off his leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet screams, she tries to restrain the fear of lightning and shoots the scorn in her hand. Yuya hit the monster, but only got rid of one of its scales. The kitten yelled and let Siegel run fast, while trying to load the bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant in the animal skin quickly came over to help, he grabbed the upper and lower jaws of the green-footed snake with both hands, and then struggling to pull out. I saw his whole body muscles cast like steel, giving a squeak like the winch on the ship. The green-footed snake had 12 legs on the ground and a scream in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teeth of the green-footed snake are razor-shaped barbs, which are used to prevent the swallowed creatures from climbing out and growing out. Still hurt. Siegel pointed his wand at the open throat of the monster and endured the painful curse. An icy ray hits the most vulnerable part of the monster's throat and freezes its esophagus. The pain in this heart made the monster unbearable, and it began to madly dying. Siegel was hit and fell in the rain. Even the brawny was smashed out by great power, but he sneered at the captain of the green-footed snake and actually pulled off three teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
