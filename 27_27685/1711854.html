			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel put down the glass in his hand and pulled out the pipe. A few people didn't talk, watching the mage quietly thinking in the smog. At this time, even the prairie who lacked patience was like a slow spell and a silent spell, and the action of eating became Sven. Only Kerry held his arms and smiled with a grin, and said, "Give me a good idea, just like last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Master mixes all the knowledge of the Old World he has in his mind and slowly searches for available clues. If it is to stop the "enclosure" action of the Jackdaw tribe, it is necessary to explain the overall situation to Kerry. I believe that this chief can finally adopt it, but this will affect his prestige in the tribe. Siegel can't be sorry for the brothers, and he doesn't want to see the battle become gorgeous, so he must find a way to achieve the best of both worlds. He sat and thought, then stood up and walked in the room until the fire in the pipe was about to go out. He stood still and said to Kerry: "You come to my study."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl did not say much, leaving the table to see his mother, leaving Janis to accompany the three northerners. Siegel pulled the curtains of the study, closed the door, and began to cast magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time the wizard casts a spell, Kerry will be very curious to observe, and this spell is obviously more shocking to him. Siegel used unusually precise illusions to outline the grassland terrain south of the entire walled mountain range, marking the hills, lakes and rivers. This is a replica of William's topographic map, which Siegel has long impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has never seen a map of the grasslands, and their tribes use approximate orientation and distance to form an understanding of the surrounding terrain. In addition, few people can learn how to draw maps. Most of these talents are still collected by the lords. When Siegel feared that Kerry could not understand the map, he used the illusion to form a crow's mark to mark their original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the location of Deepwater City, and then by identifying the relative positions of several rivers, Kerry marks several points that they are likely to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our tribes need water to grow, rivers and lakes. Red-day tribes need pastures, and their forages are always in short supply. As for the Black Wolf tribe, They have no special needs. Although they will find gold from the river, you can't ask every river to have sand gold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I already have Good idea. But you still need to know the situation on the battlefield.” The Master said: “Tell me what you know.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time for Siegel He is a newcomer to the tactical staff of others, but at least he is much better than Kerry in the overall situation and situation analysis. A qualified mage is not just the launch vehicle of the spell, he is far more than the warlock. It is the cradle of strategy. Constantly learning all kinds of knowledge to enrich yourself is something that every mage must do, including occultism, history, nobility, planes, architectural engineering, geography, and even more religious knowledge than some pastors. Power is hidden in the constant learning process, and every bit of accumulation can prompt the Master's progress in magical power. Especially the many deep spells, it is not just a combination of sound, gestures and casting materials. It is also a kind of understanding and transformation of the world by the Master. And this transformation is based on countless knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this feature, the Masters have more information and more thoughtful thinking skills, so it is easier to become a good staff than others. For the Master, simply applying knowledge to think in the battlefield is a work with almost no cost compared to making magic items. Generally no one will refuse. And the willingness to ask the Master as a staff member is at least a big lord. In order to maintain their strategic and tactical advantages, the compensation they pay is also very exciting. Many mages will look for opportunities in a certain period of time to help them accumulate the money they need to learn to master higher difficulty spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will naturally not charge Kerry. He has no such consciousness at all. One is a fledgling mage staff, and the other is a toddler tribal chief. They pointed at the illusion map and finally found a good goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are relatively remote places, and there may be no tribes, so you can avoid fighting and maximize your strength. Even if there is, it will definitely not be your opponent." Siegel pointed to the southwest of the grassland, away from all battlefields, and near a piece of land in the walled mountains. “There is a river flowing down the wall of the city. The water is not big. But it is enough for you to use. It is very close to the dwarf's defensive area, and it is not completely wild, so the possibility of large monsters is very low. The most important. The point is that there is a silver mine upstream of the river. There are also crystal stones in farther places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pointed at the map and replied: "This time there was a dwarf prospector who recorded the situation here. I have found Shakin. This information is recorded in the library of Mora, except for the dwarves. Outsiders know that when I was at the top of Mora, I was very concerned about the treasures hidden by the dwarves, especially the gold and silver mines. You can trust me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"These", Kerry stretched his arms and crossed the entire map with his hand, and then said to Siegel: "It is the real treasure. I now understand why the grassland tribe has been unable to grow and develop, why is deep water? The city can occupy the most beautiful land. I can only see the hills when I ride, and I am still smug about seeing myself farther than the flock, and your mage has long sat in the clouds and looked down on all the creatures."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is God who is looking down on all living beings, and your three spirits." Siegel said: "We are at most on the third floor of the house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, at least I am also The building is much taller than them.” The giant stood up straight and looked at the illusion map with his eyes. “Siegel, do you think there should be a king on the grassland, eliminating the barriers of all tribes? Everyone has Eat and have a horse ride."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage knows what he means and raises his hand to pat the shoulders of the brothers: "Come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them have been discussing in Siegel’s study for a long time, and the Master applied his own computing power to help the Jackdaw tribe to provide statistical supplies. The new plan went further and needed more food, but I believe that Trinity can make up the difference. Siegel also prepared a list for Kerry, which is some special animals and plants that can be found on the grassland, and some parts can be used as raw materials for alchemy. The price of the Masters’ acquisition of these things is very stable, but the main profits are earned by the middlemen. Merchants say that these are just some medicinal materials and raw materials like fur, which are very low in price, and after the list of Siegel. The Jackdaw Tribe will get more profit and grow faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, how can I thank you?" Giant Kerry said: "Even if you are a brother, you can't do this."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will also need your help." Siegel said: "I have a plan. You are the first person to know. I know that Deepwater City will be rewarded. I had this idea when some of the pioneering knights guarded the walled mountains.” Siegel pointed to the walled mountains, and the palms passed over every mountain, rift, basin, and cliff, and then clenched into fists. "There is a huge treasure hidden in it, lying quietly in the mountains and underground. It is enough to support me to spend all the magical learning. The dwarves are not used for a while, I use! But I need people, need guards, need to be able to turn ore into wealth. The way, just like the dwarves build the Morah's Donkey, I want a magical castle of my own. Learning from the history of the defensive chain of the built-up walls of the city, you must obtain the legal lordship to really start operations, otherwise it will cause the Mora Hostile, and Deepwater City will not do business with me. I am in a better position now, whether it is the Dwarf, the Masters Association, the Sham Shui Po Lord or you, all my friends and allies, isn't it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder you must go north, there is still this reason." Kerry recalled the scene at the time. Scratching his head, he said bluntly: "If it is not because the dragon attack can not be separated from the tribe, I really want to go to the walled mountains with you. I always thought that my father will live a hundred years old, my brother will become the next chief. I never thought that it would be me. Without a little preparation, I suddenly changed my identity. At home, I was the chieftain, and when I came out, it was the king. Although Mesera always reminded me, 'You need to be different', but I am completely I didn’t realize it, I thought that although the title has changed, I am still Kerry, but at most it is a giant who has lost a little. If it is not with you today, seeing the whole picture of the Northland, I don’t know how long it will take to understand what she said.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what you don't understand. You will listen to her, don't you?" Siegel teased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is right!" Kerry said: "Right, where did Janet go?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked a glimpse, but quickly returned to normal: "We were separated by accident, she is now in the Black Blood Castle." Siegel pointed to the map in the air, a highlight marked The location. "From the information I got. Her current situation should be very good. It is reasonable to wait until the end of the war is the most sensible choice, but I still want to go to the castle to join her early."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should go." Kerry said: "If I am separated from the Mesera, I will go if it is a knife and a sea. So, I will accompany you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
