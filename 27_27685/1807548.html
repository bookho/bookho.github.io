			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stayed in the Star Fort, but he took a period of sick leave for reasons of physical weakness. He told Evan himself to do a magical experiment - but it was also a scorpion - he was actually planning something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruler of the Star Kingdom wants to ask for the gods for the end of the world, and the news goes through some channels, and spreads into pubs, stations, and all A place where whispers and songs can be reached. Among them, the credit of the own intelligence general manager wiki, there is no shortage of temples to help. Evan’s first stop will be the Temple of the Morning, after all, he is the spokesperson of the morning god and the protector of humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, asking for the gods is not as easy as going to the Royal Garden, it requires careful preparation, even "rehearsal." Even if you are pleased to go to the blank, you can’t go down to be stronger than anything else! Moreover, the temple also has its own needs in the process, which inevitably requires prior communication and negotiation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time for the Stars to be buffered. Just like a giant who wants to wake up, he turns over and stretches, and the kingdom of the stars needs to be prepared in all aspects. Evan's chance to meet the local lords, from the members of the royal family to a large number of relatives, and then the general aristocrats and lords, Chen Ming Li, mobilized. After the events of the Orthodox Church, he also needed this opportunity to consolidate his rule and maintain his own circle so that he could cope with the challenges of the end of the world and the goblin war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the royal firearms policy has changed, and this needs to be explained again with the various lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, he also has to deal with the dwarves and elf managers, so that the consensus formed on the stone can not be truly implemented. The most important thing is to protect the barrier of the crystal wall. What happens to the goblin on the side can not affect this side, otherwise all the busyness is not meaningless? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel estimates that it will take a few months, enough for him to complete the cloning experiment, and to carry out the third plan. Although the cloning process is confidential, it is not too strict to guard against it. Earl Tod knows that Aunt Hugh knows that perhaps the intelligence wiki will be heard a little. As a sergeant who invented a series of things such as the secret nuclear. How can I get free, so I have to have a busy project, or how can I conspirate with Lear's attention? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What really needs to be concealed is the act of finding the gods of magic and knowledge, for which Siegel needs to leave the Star Fort. Go to a place where the gods are closely monitored. He is going to find the owner of the ten-faced scorpion, the owner of the Green Dragon Alenoz Igus, the one who can't name it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a meeting that has been reserved, and the other is a few people who know the secrets of the world. Especially he knows the scorpion, maybe the only one who can understand the usage of the scorpion. Siegel had long wanted to go, but he was not prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a certain extent, Siegel is afraid to see each other. If the Green Dragon is true, then Siegel is a man without a father and a mother. It is just a smart soul produced by a high-level artifact like a scorpion. It’s a strange feeling to know that it’s not possible to be a person, but it’s not so much that Siegel’s worries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods pay attention to the scorpion and the scorpion holders, they do not hide their desire for the secret of the scorpion. The god of magic and knowledge is willing to give up his godhead and divine power to obtain the mortal body, in order to be able to avoid the agreement with other gods, so that we can begin to study the mystery in advance. Although the scorpion is magical, Siegel does not dare to forget that the gods really care about the secret of the storm wall to stop moving forward. How to delay or even stop the destruction of the crystal wall. Or at least the opportunity to withdraw the power before the destruction of the crystal wall, this is really related to their vital interests, not one or two higher artifacts can be compared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the wall of the storm began to shrink inward again, which cannot but cause the attention of Siegel. Only the gods of the former magic have taken action, and it does not mean that when the destruction of the world is inevitable, others will not take it. Although the gods are limited by their responsibilities, they can never do anything that violates their duties, but for mortals, the power of God is hard to compete. Therefore, once the "common study of the storm wall to stop the secret" may disappear. The holder of the donkey will no longer have a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is the ability to study legendary spells, Siegel will not be so worried, after all, legendary spells use the power of rules, so they can work for the gods. He does not have such a means. Then you have to sneak in – especially on Lear – to get enough time. He arranged the affairs of the Star Fortress, and asked Master Shelley to help cover up. At the same time, he sent a smuggling sergeant Bill to return to Nautai Fortress to avoid the secret of the half-orc, and then he set foot on the journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must be light and simple, avoid towns and villages as much as possible, and pick those places that are inaccessible. Even if Lear could not find his position, it does not mean that Wikipedia could not detect his whereabouts. His own behavior may pose a small threat to the ruler, and the spy head was there but not stopped. After Siegel wanted to understand this, he had some caution on the wiki. And this mission simply did not use his help, so simply avoid his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ari Valley is in the northern part of the Starry Kingdom. If you leave the North Gate of the Star Fortress and walk along Sceptera Avenue for more than half a month, you will be able to approach Yari. The edge of the forest. The valley is in the middle of the forest, surrounded by steep rifts and flocks of beasts, and ordinary people simply do not approach the area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many bad legends here, especially the hugely-changing cannibals that continue to haunt. Some people suspect that there is a region in the forest that is cursed by the gods. Even a small ladybug may be distorted and become as big as a horse by the curse. In the songs of the troubadour, there is also the singer of the knight in this area. Siegel doesn't believe in the lyrics, because the fire-breathing dragons will never fly, and the result will always be teppanyaki, not heroism, victory, and dragon slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, apart from the songs of the poets, the records of this area are very rare, and both history books and local chronicles seem to be deliberately avoiding them. Siegel could not find more detailed information, only know the names of several towns on the periphery and the general direction of the forests and valleys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a **, he does not need to withstand the cold winds and fallen leaves in late autumn, and does not have to spend time on the feet to measure the earth. As soon as he left the magical depression area of ​​the Star King, he cast a shadow and summoned the phantom. Use the power of the film to speed up your actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the shadow creatures, living things can't see the shadows. Only a few people with keen senses sometimes have a body shake and a chill emerges from the soles of the feet. The feeling is that the coldness of the shadows - the coolness behind the neck is mostly the negative energy brought by the undead. Siegel traveled in this world without temperature. The power of elements in this world is like a shining light that constantly emanate from him. Shadow creatures are afraid of this kind of light, can only hide in the deepest corners, probe to explore the brain. They have sharp claws, a flexible body and a greedy appetite, and they cannot touch the light. They are born in shadows and feed on shadows. It will eventually merge with the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They make the scenery all the way into black and white, even the sun is just a pale round shadow in the sky, so there is nothing to watch Great view. It wasn't until the magic of the shadows was removed that the color finally entered the vision of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunrise of the Ari Valley, the eastern sky is dyed into roses and golden yellow, and is smudged with the autumn forest underneath it. Siegel rode on the phantom, staring at the radiance that gradually spread, and felt a touch of warmth in the cold. Dawn climbed the treetops and eyebrows, and even the phantom shadows of his knees seemed to be contaminated with a touch of golden light. The whole world turned from dark to indigo in his eyes, and then turned into green and bright yellow. Not far from the sound of the water flowing out of the ridge. Accompanied by the sound of birds and insects. Winter is coming, and many lives will end, so this final gathering is extraordinarily lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a deep breath and only felt the suffocation in his chest, and was filled up again. After returning the phantom to the film world, he held his wand in one hand and a long sword in one hand, walking in the forest. The outer area is close to the human settlement, and sometimes the nearby villagers will come here to pick mushrooms and wild fruits, and will secretly sneak a few traps. In order to capture small animals such as squirrels. From the position where Siegel is located to the east, there is a logging field. The sound of the chainsaw will disturb the animals of the ears, so there are few predators nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance. There is nothing special about this forest, but only those who are sensitive to magic and elements can be aware of it. If it wasn't for this, he wouldn't put down his vigilance. Siegel might not find the secret in the forest. Coiled among the thriving trees, those seemingly dry and low-pitched vines have a very weak aura of detective magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to combine the power of a spell with a plant is so good that only the elf's druid can do it. They have a way to change themselves into big trees. By spreading the root system to form a network, the entire forest can be manipulated. The magic in these vines is not sharp, but it can also be noticed by the monitor if it is often touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Golem, there is nothing to be vigilant forever, so monitoring the druids here will not pay attention to every wind and grass. Most of the time they are immersed in half-dreams and half-awake, similar to the mage's meditation, but unable to think accurately. They use images more to communicate, such as changing the pattern of colors and shapes, blowing the wind and hitting the rain, and sometimes with a variety of emotional odors. The dream world, known as the Druid, just doesn't know how to break a vine in their dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
