WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM "Don't worry, I will charge with you," he whispered softly. The other knights are doing the same thing, checking their mounts and weapons to make sure the man and the horse are ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel rides on the black phantom, protects himself with the Elf Breastplate and the Anti-Arrow Cloak. He is holding a defensive staff, a long sword hanging on the waist side, and two sacks next to the neck of the black magic horse, which are bursting with crosshairs and electric sputum. The other soldiers, except the one who replaced the staff with a shield, were basically the same as him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is still not bright, only a touch of glimmer of the East Sky. After waiting for more than ten days, the soldiers in the north returned, and the knights in the city of Mith were ready to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were a well-trained team when they left, and they came back with an elite army. The Heim-collar soldiers who were poured out of the blood of the orcs were preparing to harvest the flesh and blood of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel rides on the horse, clasps the reins, looks like water, facing the coming dawn. Just after a night without moonlight, the elf's luna may be sleeping, and the priest's power of the god of the moon is at a low point. As for the other elves...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the joint efforts of the elemental rune array and the energy focusing lens, Siegel began an uninterrupted harassment battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of elements continue to attack the elves. The gas element attacks from the air, the water element advances along the shield river, the earth element lurks in the ground, and the fire element jumps between the campfires. On the frontal confrontation, these elemental creatures are not the opponents of the Elven army. Whether it is the Ranger's bow or the warrior's knife and gun, these invaders can be quickly eliminated. But their goal is not the elf, but everything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroyed camps, burned supplies, all of which make the elves tired. The saplings that have just been planted are also poisoned. The plan for forest advancement has been continually delayed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Master suffered a major loss in Deepwater City, but the Masters Association took the opportunity to send a caster to the New World and even reopened the transmission to the Sanfeng Pagoda. The elves and the Masters Association are arguing endlessly. It is impossible to send all of their precious caster resources to the city of Mire. After all, all areas need a mages to sit down. Especially the Elf Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the help of the Magic Array, Siegel finally gained the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become the lion's lion, Alexander, secretly came to Heim's collar, which greatly increased the confidence of Siegel. Although the Lion King is very clear, he will not participate in the attack on the elves, but if the elf's caster wants to use the means of attack to attack the city of Mith, then he will not let the three-peak tower repeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this kind of preparation, Siegel felt that when he was fighting the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers the letter of Lord Uther received not long ago, hoping that Siegel can open the situation as soon as possible. Join the Southern Lords Alliance and drive away the Elf Invaders who are entrenched in the territory. He mentioned the recent appearance of the plasma on the market, saying that this weapon reversed the unfavorable situation of mankind in the battle against war trees, and kindly reminded Siegel to equip as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information obtained from caravans and smugglers is not the same. Most of the southern lords have no power to resist, and even have no money to buy supplies. . If they were not worried that the deduction of the caravan would result in the loss of all external communication channels, they would have turned into bandits. Siegel thought of the chaos that appeared in the various places after the defeat of the southern lord's coalition forces, which also urged him to solve the elf problem as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that worried him was Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days ago, Janet left Ides to leave the city of Gore and go to the Elven Forest. "Only where the natural forces are strong. Druids can cast spells better." Edith explained: "The city of Myrtle is undergoing war, and there are swords and flames everywhere. Just like a wizard comes to a place. Like the place where the elements are poor, the druids also feel the lack of mana in the city of Mire. For the sake of safety, I personally take her to the Elven Forest to complete the promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Siegel was hesitant to hear this, and Janet was reluctant to go. But the power of the devil is just around the corner, and God knows when there will be problems. Under Siegel's persuasion, Janet handed the child to the nurse to take care of, and had to follow Idis to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that no one will ever know. Siegel activities activities fingers. Look at them in turn and then close together. Only a flexible hand can use magical techniques - whether it's swordsmanship or spells. The power of the four elements is attached to the thumb, middle finger, ring finger and little finger, and then according to their own mind and spell. Gather on the index finger and become a complete spell and launch it. This is an experience that has never been seen before. It is like learning a sword that has never appeared in the world. It not only opens up the horizon but also enhances his power. In this way, he began to deconstruct the spell, starting with the simplest light, until the transmission. As the experience continues to increase, he will slowly embark on the path of the division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Lord, you can leave." The Knights of Kenki came to Siegel and awakened him from the magical thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open the gate," Siegel nodded toward the guards, while performing large-scale lightness exercises for the cavalry. "This time must be fast, the goal is still the ancient tree of the elves, don't fight with the elf archers, don't run straight in a stupid way, I don't want to see you being shot, do you know?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The cavalry replied in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is just dawning, the faint light on the river of the Shield River flashes with the water, reflecting through the morning mist. Using the silent runestone, the entire cavalry sneaked out of the city of Mire and rushed to the elves' camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third raid in a day. The first two were carried out by the half-orc, with his half-orc cavalry, using the moonless night, using the ability of the elves to have dark vision. Their team of half-orc cavalry trained for a long time, the cavalry and the horse match the tacit understanding, even if the eyes of the mount can participate in the battle. The first raid was prepared and only destroyed the perimeter fence. The second raid rushed into the camp, lit some tents, and figured out the layout in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent. Siegel left the elf with a four-hour break and personally led the team for a third sneak attack before dawn. The elf repaired some fortifications and prepared. But at the moment before dawn, there was still some relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fireball blasts the roadblock made by the elf and the box and the board. The horn of the alarm just sounded. Siegel exalts the elemental rune scepter, mobilizes the power of the entire territory's defensive array, and summons a large number of elemental creatures to help. They are the biggest but the hounds, the smallest is not bigger than the mouse, but the number is amazing. The sole purpose of these elements is to destroy as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rushing into the camp, they immediately turned left and threw a canister along the way. Everyone did not carry a torch, one is to avoid exposing the target before the raid. In addition, they do not need to prepare an open fire, because the fire element will help to complete the work of the subsequent ignition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp of the ancient war tree is in front, Siegel waved to the left and right, and the raid team immediately divided into two. The ancient trees of war are rushing up with heavy footsteps, and they are greeted by the smashing of the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow of the elf flew in and many knights were shot. The elves originally expected to see the scene of their fall, but did not expect these knights to insert arrows, still able to continue to fight. All the mass-produced magic armor of the whole Heim collar is concentrated on the raids, whoever wears the war. These armor greatly weakened the power of the Elf Arrow and reduced the number of Heim's death and injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Cavalier can only shoot one impeachment for each war tree. Then you have to attack the next one. The command of the lord greatly increased the coverage of the plasma. Siegel saw some Druids rushing over and trying to rescue the war trees with the drive away from the metal, and led the ten cavalry to meet. Use the shackles to block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't slow down, keep the mount moving!" Siegel used up the ammunition, so he held up his wand and charged. He screamed, and the staff made a circle in the air, and a fire net appeared immediately in front of him. The druid was stopped, and he had to change from the form of the beast to the human form, so as to spread the magic of dispelling. They angered the attackers: "Stop! You are the evil caster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no new eulogy, and Siegel snorted. The flame slammed up and blocked the druid's sight. Just as they recited the curse and called for rain. Siegel leaped from the fire wall with a phantom. The black hair and the black stirrups danced together and floated in the air. Look at it violently. Thought it was a black flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s whip is slamming and slamming on the head of the Druid. His spell can never be completed. The body that has lived for thousands of years will die. Other druids rushed up, or turned into brown bears, or turned into tigers, trying to shred him with sharp teeth and mouth. The phantom slammed into the ground and suddenly accelerated, flying over all the beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
