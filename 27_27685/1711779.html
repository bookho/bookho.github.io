			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are ready-made methods." Siegel pointed to the center of the camp and said: "Let each messenger take a dragon skin in the past, which is wrapped around the situation. The letter. For tribes whose positions may be wavering, it is better to give them a dragon tooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good idea!" Giant fist A glimpse into the palm of my hand, the haze on my face dissipated a lot. He then said: "How does it feel to be a dragon hero?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dragon is not killed by me, the green dragon is actually a wizard-shaped sorcerer of the dead branches." Siegel honestly replied: "I am just Lucky has only eliminated the death knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lucky? Not only lucky, but simple." Kerry said to him: "I can't be a cold ice gun." Used, so far only our piano family can use. You can pick up the gun, it must be allowed by the spirit of our ancestors, to protect you from the anti-hit damage of the ice gun. To be honest, I am very Envy you. The spirit of the ancestors chose you to save the tribe, not me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The spirit of the ancestors let you save the future of the tribe. One is you "The children, one of your wizards," Siegel comforted him. "If you don't have them, the Jackdaw tribe will not think of better results besides being annexed by other tribes. And only you can rush into the fire to save people. I don't have that ability, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Know.” Kerry shook his head, silenced for a while, then said: “The three spirits are always mysterious, and I still don’t speculate on their thoughts. The only thing to do now is to lead the tribe to recover as soon as possible. I still have a worry. You said why the Red Dragon attacked us, what happened to the death knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this matter, Siegel only guess. From the red dragon's behavior pattern to speculate his motives, it is obvious that he is going to kill, which violates the red dragon's habit, so someone will let him do it. At the time, in the camp, in addition to the Jackdaw tribe, there were many other tribal leaders who came to celebrate, perhaps one of them was the real goal? Siegel believes that if it is only a single goal, there is no need to mobilize the public to send out the red dragon. Several assassins or a few dead soldiers are enough. So the question eventually became: "Who wants to kill the savages on the grassland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need a list of visitors to find clues, but don't hold anything Expectation, because too many people have been burned to ash, they can't check their identity, they don't know who is dead, who is going to escape. Maybe there will be a dragon coming, maybe a different form, but the only certainty is that you just live, I will continue to face attacks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My warriors will protect me, I will protect myself and my family, they will not take my life." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I take a day off, I will examine the armor of the death knight tomorrow, hoping to find clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I am waiting for your news." Kerry said: "At that time, I promised you, whoever kills the dragon will win the contest. You won, so I am the chief of the Jackdaw tribe. Declaring Jarrell is not guilty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have forgotten that guy. Poetry How is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I haven't found him, I hope he survives and ran away. But the bigger one may be burnt to the ash. Kerry hated his teeth and said: "It’s all damn dragons, good holidays have become like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything will be fine Siegel thought about it. In order to boost morale, he said to Kerry: "You said that we cut the dragon and gave it to the people of the whole family. What is the idea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You never want to use the ice to shoot the dragon? I am afraid that the three spirits will be angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A black dagger was thrown into the giant, and he heard Siegel say, "Use this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry took the dagger and went to the dragon This is much more interesting than cutting any other prey. He kept as much of the dragon skin as possible, because it was a good material for armor. The dragon's teeth can be made into a good dagger, and even a short tooth can be made into an arrow. With the dragon tooth, the tribe can help cut, and the efficiency will increase quickly. The dragon's skin and flesh are separated, some are grilled on the fire by large chunks of the rack, and some are thrown into the water to cook - no one has ever done this kind of meat, can only fumble. Soon they discovered that the red dragon's meat is not afraid of fire at all, and how to roast is useless. And the big chunks of cooking are useless, only a small piece is placed in the boiling water to change a little. However, it is hard to beat the people of the Jackdaw tribe. They gather for the earth and set up a large pot for the harvest festival. They ignite the cow dung as a fuel and boiled a pot of water. The cut red dragon meat was cut into pieces and placed in the pot for a while before it was eaten. The women found the flowers and the garlic and made the dips. All survivors came to taste the red dragon's flesh as part of the mourning ceremony. After they had eaten the meat, they sang a lament on their shoulders, hoping that the spirit of battle can fairly examine the achievements of the deceased's life, pray that the spirit of the ancestors can accept the soul of the deceased, and hope that the spirit of nature can make them reincarnate. After that, they stepped forward and placed their hands on Siegel's chest, thanking him for destroying the enemy and thanking him for saving everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon was quickly dismembered, and a large number of viscera that no one knew were buried in a large pit. The result was that the place was not alive for more than a decade. The parts that can be used as weapons armor are piled up into hills, and the parts that can be eaten are placed in another pile. Later, the people of the Jackdaw Tribe found that the meat of the Red Dragon was basically not degraded, so they used the meat as a reserve grain for several years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel carrying a broth, chewing on the piece of meat, watching the giant Kerry busy. Everyone else thinks that the dragon's meat is not delicious, and it doesn't have any taste after drying and drying. It can only be swallowed after using the dip. However, Siegel’s relish was reluctant to stop. Janet took a dragon tooth and cut the piece of meat for him, then put it in his bowl. ‘It’s like feeding a pet’ The kitten thinks like this, but he will never say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was dyed red, and the blood of the red dragon was still trying to burn his flesh. It’s just that the blood of the Frost Giant’s blood is just enough to offset this heat, which allows him to climb in and out of the huge body of the Red Dragon. He came out this time, carrying three big meats in his hand. "Heart", Kerry showed them to Siegel: "There are three."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three hearts, indicating that the red dragon experienced after adulthood There are two additional age stages, which add up to 500 years old.” Siegel explained: “One heart is reproductive, one heart is breathing, and one heart is magic. The legendary dragon’s heart can make people Get unlimited vitality, keep youth and vitality for a long time, of course, this is nonsense. But the Dragon Heart does have other magical powers, such as the material of the spell or the potion. I suggest you sell it to the Master. The federation, they will pay a big price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? You made a mistake, this dragon is your prey, I can't sell it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take you the last time." Siegel has become tired of continuing to bear the title of the Dragon Warrior: "The dragon is the wizard of the dead nest." Killed, and the wizard is yours, not mine, so this dragon is cold Tribal property."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay, how do you care so much, we are all brothers." The giant grinned: "This thing has eaten a lot." Ok, why sell it to the Master of Deepwater City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s good for them to have a good relationship with them." Siegel thought about it and decided Still can't directly tell him about the expedition to the north of Deepwater City. Only by slamming the side to remind Kerry: "I am from the Deepwater City Masters Federation. Their motto is 'Knowledge lies in research, magic is exchange". So they are able to The tribes cooperate, and the unions have money and resources, especially the ability to mobilize large amounts of food and building materials. Their ability to make money is strong, and the wallet is very drum--this is something I have personal experience."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I listen to you, send people to discuss the transaction with them tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait until I look at the armor of the death knight tomorrow, and then send it to the federation. After that, I will go north and go to the barrier mountain to look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you crazy?" Kerry said: "The side of the mountain." It is the orc's territory. They are vicious and ferocious. They regard human beings as food and where to go. Even on this side of the mountain, there are tribes that are bought by orcs. They do not respect the spirit of nature and the spirit of the ancestors. A fallen life. They meet you and will kill you without mercy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The place I am going to is the Black Blood Castle, where is it still in the hands of civilized humans?" "The map of the traveler William is floating in the mind of Siegel. He has already made plans to go to the Black Blood Castle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Blood Castle, we all I don't want them to deal with them. It's all crazy people with abnormal brains. Kerry shook his head and said: "One time I followed my father to the Tricornian tribe near the Black Blood Castle and I was met by the patrol of the Black Blood Castle. Those people finally admitted that we were not the spies of the orcs, and then asked us to compete with them before leaving. I lost, but fortunately my father's guard has won enough victories before he can get out. I don't recommend you to go there. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Black Blood Castle is closest to the Orc's territory, and there are also fascinating views of the lava glacier. Said Siegel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I can't convince you." Kerry looked at the horizon of the north, where the figure of the walled mountains was clearly visible. The reason why the mountain was called the wall was to resist the orcs on the north side of the mountain, and the dwarves and humans built a series of fortresses. The line of defense from Mora Afterwards, heading north to the east, there are dozens of castles, such as Cedar Fort, Tunbao, Chimney Fort, and Huohu Fort. On the easternmost side of the line of defense is the Black Blood Fort.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
