			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a return to calm and order in the venue, and the mages re-sit back into the chair. I want to read the book. "Everyone is waiting for Siegel to go to the stage, but looking up, Wendy is still on the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female mage stared at Siegel, staring in excitement. It was not until the Master had a cough that she had come back. Her brain suddenly became blank, what should she say next? In an instant, she seems to have returned to the apprenticeship, because she could not remember the magic spell and was reprimanded, and she was restrained in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...oh..." She stuttered, the red cloud began to climb up from her neck, and ten nails swayed the table uncomfortably. She swallowed a saliva and said with the remaining courage: "The spell was amazing, I forgot what I was going to say. Next..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She hurriedly stepped down and hurry to find an empty chair to sit down. The person next to him handed her a cup of condensed tea, Wendy even forgot to thank, holding a cup and sipping a small mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, Siegel." Several wizards shouted that they were all young casters. The more stable, wise and powerful wizards remain silent for the time being, but they also want to hear what Siegel wants to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows that it is not a good choice to be on the stage now, so if you can listen to other people's ideas, it would be fine. However, since the matter has reached this point, he can't back down. So Siegel took the defensive staff and walked to the platform, and took out a large bundle of scrolls from his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, this is not a speech." Siegel said with a smile: "This is the drawing of the secret nuclear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗, the scene is a mess. The Master of the Mage has just demonstrated the power of the Urgian nuclear, and everyone is shocked by the level of energy that can be controlled. Who can control such energy, who is in the invincible position in the spell confrontation, no master is stupid to not understand the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten mages who participated in the manufacturing of the squad, joined together on the first day of the launch of the Peruvian nuclear, trying to push the composition of the array. I have to look at the book. <壹 As with countless attempts before, they can't fill the gaps in the design, and can't even think of alternatives. These people are the most feared Siegel people, who have been sitting quietly in the corner. It is also the only mage who is not excited by the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They glanced at the scroll in the hands of Siegel and shook their heads slightly. The reels that were taken out were obviously incomplete and the number was not comparable to the drawings used in their construction. Siegel certainly has reservations, which is expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be excited. What I took out is not a complete design, just a part, but this part is complete." Siegel said: "Myr The only thing that can be nuclear is to provide elemental energy. Without the Master's participation, it can't be completed with a burning hand spell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The scroll is the application part of the Mire nuclear. I call it the elemental pipeline. Through this elemental pipeline, all the wizards can connect to the Mire nuclear to obtain the elemental energy it provides. Whether it is supplying itself or driving magic items, There is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have also created a lot of magic items, knowing the difficulty. The most troublesome part is not the core of magic energy for the item? Now that I have solved this problem - it is a preliminary solution - now I will share it with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gives the whole scroll to the most Close to his mage, please go on. Originally, each reel is exactly the same, and the top is densely filled with dragon language, which is used to explain the function, use method and manufacturing principle of the elemental pipeline. After the last person got the reel, Siegel officially began to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, I am very happy to join you once in this great gathering that will be historic. To be honest, I don’t know most of you, you Only a small number know me, but this does not prevent us from gathering together today. Because two hundred and fifty years ago, a group of mages came to the new big 6 with hope and love of magic, in the wilderness outside the northern deep-water port. I started to build the School of Magic and called myself a Confed Master. Have they ever thought that there will be a deep water city, and the Three Peaks Tower will become the greatest magical building of the New 6? I have no way of knowing it. But I can be sure that after a hundred and fifty years, even the Three Peaks Tower fell. The descendants of these people still have not lost their faith,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now look at the people around you, there are no madmen, no madmen, no people who are indulged because of heaven and hell. Everyone swallowed the temptation, generated reason, and strengthened their faith. Everyone is the wizard of the federation, we Have their own pursuits and pride. Not the other, but the only one, is magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The path of the Masters Association is right or wrong, not Important. The important thing is that it survived and survived for thousands of years. I didn't join the Masters Association because the conditions they set out were not good, but because they thought that we couldn't live without them! I don't believe I don’t believe it at all. The new big 6 is a new hope. The predecessors came here with such ideals. Has this hope been cut off? Never.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Someone will say, oh, Siegel, you are both a mage and a lord. Why do you speak on behalf of the federation?" Siegel paused and looked at the thirty mages in front of him, then smiled and said: "Because I am stronger than you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I got off the boat for the first time six years ago. After one year I served as a knight and got a fortune in the adventure, so I was able to ring the Masters four and a half years ago. The door to the meeting became an apprentice and learned magic in the form of a salon. After eight months I became an intern and then participated in the orc war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I am from When I came back from the war, it was a coincidence that I got the official mages and the baron. The masked lord of the Deepwater City released the bait, and I swallowed it, so I had the Heim and Mystery. Maybe I am here. It’s time to get into everyone’s sight.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“After a few years, I’m twenty-two, standing here to show me my spell power: I’m better than You are strong. When I can't talk with age, seniority, and the federation's connections, I only show strength. I don't need your fear, obedience, or alienation. I just hope that there is an opportunity to pass on my ideas to everyone. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; "I have been living in the castle. From my room, the market in the city of Mier is not far away. I can see people of all kinds, running for life every day. Seeing from the Three Peaks Tower can see To what? There is only a powerful magic enchantment, the tumbling magic fog blocks all the gaze. We need the Master Tower. But we should not be trapped in the Master Tower, because the outside of the tower is the new 6, is the hope, if Can't see, then what is the difference with the Masters Association? I became a Master apprentice and an intern at the Master. I spent a total of 4,450 gold coins. I remember clearly that this is a considerable expense, and it is more than any Blocking the high walls that are strong, it separates us from them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are with them, this difference is a terrible idea, I have a deep feeling for it. I in the spell lab and I in the hall of the lord seem to live in two worlds. I was able to spend nearly 500,000 gold coins to make a secret nuclear core. On the other hand, I need to refer to a dispute between two chickens. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you give these two disputes 5,000 gold coins per person, will they possibly become a mage?" Siegel said: "Don't laugh, no one knows about this." I am a sailor, you? what about you? I noticed one thing, the six people who joined me in the apprenticeship, and eventually two became the official mages, and the other died in the magic experiment during the internship. In other words, almost half of the ability to cast magic. If the intelligence is not normal, it can be seen that it is not difficult to judge without knowledge. Therefore, it is much simpler to select a mage apprentice than to find a pastor apprentice. After the initial selection, can I think that 10,000 gold coins can be a master? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are thinking about it? "The undead mage Shelley snorted: "The Master is not growing vegetables. How can it be so casual?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at her. His eyes radiated a confident light. His voice was not ugly, clearly audible: "Using elemental pipes, in secret Within the envelope of the nucleus, the cost of magic is only a little higher than the iron. I can't get 10,000 gold coins for every two scholars. But I am confident that I will reduce the cost by a hundred times! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic test, magical items, energy supply for protection enchantment, my mysterious nuclear can continue to meet their needs. As long as fifty masters can be born from here, my cost will be recovered; when one hundred masters appear, the federation will basically recover. If there are a thousand masters, even the association will be shocked. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know some rumors. Said that I am ambitious, standing on the ruins of the Union, standing on the sick body of Deep Water City, with powerful elemental magic, let the new big 6 scream. I will say to these people, you are too small to see me. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
