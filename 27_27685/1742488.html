			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s territory was eventually targeted by the robbers. It’s a matter of time. After all, the caravans coming from Mola’s squad are endless. Too attracted to the eyes of those who are interested. But Siegel did not expect that the last unfortunate would be his two friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are they asking for?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five hundred gold coins or ten scales and shields made by dwarves," Fitzak said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Tell me about this Freedom Knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a group of lawless bandits. But they are not peasants who can't survive, and they take risks in order to fill their stomachs. The real peasant organization can't afford a fierce team of fifteen people, plus ten infantry, and no more elite archer and archer. "They are actually aristocratic children who have no inheritance rights. They don't want to be the knights of others, and slowly start from the bottom. In order to be able to keep the life of the flowers and wines, they organize and make up the robbery. They are proficient in riding and shooting, and they are very difficult to handle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is something tricky, for bandit robbers, gallows are a good destination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But once they are arrested, they either claim to be poor victims of being hijacked, or they are required to be captives in the identity of the descendants of the nobility, in exchange for ransom for freedom. And they know that the lord and the knight’s tactics have good martial arts themselves. So it has not been banned for a long time. Originally they were active in the South, this time suddenly came to the north to make us unprepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This does not blame you, our The garrison has not yet been established.” Siegel pondered for a while, then said: “Since they have asked for a ransom, how do you pay?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About three days north of the Ore Avenue, there is an abandoned mine that will bring the ransom within seven days, otherwise the hostages are not guaranteed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still remember that place, where we used to rest when we came." The Master immediately explained: "Prepare the money and send them to the past. I must first see Janis and Ding Bao return safely." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will encourage their arrogance." Fitzk said: "Would you like to borrow a unit from the dwarf and wait for the hostages to safely annihilate the bandits?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, I will go to Irene in person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Find the dwarf. The two men discussed it in the tent for a long time, and Elinte finally agreed to lend him to the twelve dwarf warriors. "If they run away on horseback, we can't catch up." The dwarf warrior said very frankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will fix their mounts. Two legs on two legs, this will not lose," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent. The wizard called Janet to his tent and arranged a lot of things. Then I saw Siegel wearing a delicate inlaid leather armor, covered with a squid cloak, a long sword, and ankle boots. Departed from the prestige. The team was followed by ten Orc Guard members and Elinette's dwarf warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they set off, the construction camp seemed to be a lot colder, and the original hot work scene was quiet. The people in the territory are very concerned about the news of this battle. After all, this is a confrontation with the bandits. Everyone wants to know if the new lords have the ability to protect them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Freedom Knights’ movement was named Turner. “Laughing,” he relied on the gambling to defeat the previous head. The Freedom Knights often change the captain, but they all come from the aristocratic members of the team. For them, this is an interesting game, while pursuing excitement, you can also earn a good fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel’s Heimqi was originally a barren place. Neither production nor beauty, naturally can not attract the attention of the Freedom Knights. However, the recent caravans of the caravans are too many, making the Freedom Knights curious. After inquiring about the news, they knew that there was a striped mountain gold mine in Heimchu, which could produce a lot of gold every day, and it was a rich place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravans from the top of the Mora are mostly armed with guards, and most of the goods are transported by food and artisans, and there is not much "oil and water". The fangs, Jennis and the cockroach Dingbao, slammed into the encirclement, and became very captive. Janis’s mouth is very hard and nothing is said about these robbers. Ding Bao suggested that the robbers be incarcerated by the kidnappers and asked Siegel for a ransom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bandits inserted a red flag on the halfway of the abandoned pit, and painted a slanted disc with white plaster. In fact, they don't know what it means, just to let the people under the mountain notice it. The road up the mountain is overgrown with many rocks and rocks. There is also a large stone falling from the top of the mountain, and God knows if there will be an ambush hidden behind. Next to the ore boulevard below the hillside, there is a small thick forest, which is a place suitable for hiding. Even if there are dozens of bandits, you can hide in it quietly. After three days of trek, the team that Siegel finally led came here. He took a shed to look at the mountain. I saw a man next to the flagpole of the ridiculous big flag, with unkempt yellow hair and tattered single pants. He shouted: "Who are you? What are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel replied with a shout: "We are here to find the Knights of Freedom. Let's take a look at the captives, otherwise don't want to receive the ransom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send a person up." The yellow-haired bandit shouted: "Don't want to play tricks." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel let others wait behind and walk alone on the mountain. Raven Barron stayed on his shoulder and looked around with a pair of sharp eyes. "Hey, little bird," Siegel whispered to the magic pet. "Be sure to help me look at the back, don't let people catch me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The Raven "嘎嘎" called twice, using his head to gently rub the Master's side face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the mountain is not good to go, there are scattered stones everywhere, stepping on and constantly slipping. The only consequence of running away from this road is to roll over. He cautiously climbed higher and lowered his footsteps until he saw the entrance to the abandoned pit. A faint sound of music came from inside the mine, which seemed to be the sound of the ukulele. On the open space before the mine, the fangs, Janis and the gnome, were tied with their hands and hung on the beams of the ruins of the tool room, like two fish that were drying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven bandits held rough spears and rusty swords in their hands, nervously watching Siegel. The raven yelled on his shoulder, this is the voice of its laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two captives had a hard time, and they saw that Siegel could only show his pale smile when he came. The gnome slammed his legs and let him turn around the rope in the air. An old bandit knocked his back with a wooden stick and calmed him down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not say anything, untied the purse on the waist and threw it on the ground. The things in the bag made a crisp sound. But it is different from the sounds expected by the bandits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The five hundred gold coins are such a bag? Who are you cheating? You will put up to a hundred pieces of copper in your place!" A bandit put the sword in The fangs swayed around the neck. "Where is the dwarf armor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a high-value gem." Siegel said with a smile: "It's easier to carry, look for any jewelry." Shops or pawn shops can be exchanged for gold coins, and they are only high or low. At least you can divide these gems now and then lightly on the road. This will run faster. The dwarves can track their armor, I think you don't want to be Look at it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bandits looked at each other and said, “Well, we believe in the quality of a nobleman.” He picked up the purse and opened it. Looked. It is really awkward ruby ​​and cristobalite. "This is a fair deal. You pay, we let people go. If you kill after we leave, our acquaintances in other cities will know. The next time you friends on the road will not pay the ransom. The opportunity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the customary practice of the bandits to prevent the lords who have the knight from attacking. Many times, unless the robbers can be wiped out or their old nests are smashed, these bandits will breed faster than the rabbits in the spring, and the attack will be worse than once. Therefore, the qualified lords will be equipped with elite knights, which can respond quickly and quickly, and compress the living space of these bandits. Therefore, the "Freedom Knights" chose to trade in a place three days away from Heimchu. It also has to occupy the heights of the ore boulevard, just to guard against possible cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bandits packed up their things, sneered a few times and ran to the abandoned pit. It seems that they have figured out the situation inside and left a retreat for themselves. Siegel stood in the same place, letting them scream and cheer, and turned a deaf ear to the bandits. After waiting for no robbers on the open space, he went to the front of the abandoned house, cut the rope with a dagger and put two meat tickets down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
