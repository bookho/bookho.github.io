In addition to the gift bag, this time the 515 red envelopes must be seen, the red envelopes do not grab the truth, set the alarm clock ang~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the eruption of the volcano, violent The elemental energy of the fire erupted from the top of the staff. The face of the gnome, he hates all the people taller than him, especially the wizard of Sig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people present were disguised, but the image that was changed was well documented. The short man still changed into a gnome, although it is far from the original Kobold figure, but still has not changed the height. Here, the gender and age group will remain in their original state, so as to avoid too much living habits and premature exposure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s age is based on twenty scorpions, an antiquities that have existed for at least a thousand years. Although Siegel is less than thirty years old, his image is an old man. Among the mages, the old age representatives are knowledgeable, experienced, and powerful, but they also represent slow response and fear of sneak attacks. A jester who can only play with his mouth can suddenly violently smother the sergeant from behind with a dagger, let alone another mage who suddenly shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome has a strong confidence to be able to kill white robes in a sudden attack. Although this will temporarily make his performance negative, but the threat of the record will make the days afterwards much better. Only a fierce little man can survive. This is his long life experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you serious?" A low voice came from the flames, old but full of anger. Siegel was unharmed under the protection of the element shield, and looked at the lamp god around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't get it wrong. You can counterattack when you encounter an attack. But you also need to pay the same points as the attacker. In the current situation. Two hundred points. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a self-defense counterattack!" Siegel said it was difficult to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't judge motivation, we only pay attention to action." The lamp god is cold and cold, and there is no humanity in the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flower! But it's so expensive, it must be spent." Siegel narrowed his eyes, and the actions of the previous gnomes angered him, two hundred points 掏Just let me go. For the control element, he has his own way of thinking, using elemental power like a gnome. Although the explosiveness is very good, it is only a brutal usage, and there is no skill at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out the sword, waved the staff, lifted the element shield, and plunged into the flame. The gnome's fire element did not come into contact with his skin, but was attracted by other three elements and was extracted from the torrent of fire. Thousands of tiny elemental aggregates protect Siegel, like thousands of waterwheels along the river, quickly taking the fire elemental power out of the river. Siegel took the opportunity to drill into the river. It disappeared in the eyes of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other wizards have long stopped to observe the battle in front of Fatah. When the "old man" uses the "fire". Everyone was shocked. They all know that all the spells of the displacement class are forbidden. If anyone can use it, even if it is jumping in a harsh fire, it is an amazing breakthrough. However, there are two mages who are more toxic, and they think of the reason when they think about it. It’s not that the “old man” has disappeared. He just synchronizes with the opponent’s fire element, so he blends in with the background environment and can’t find it with his own feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he appeared again, he was already on the top of the gnome. The long sword stabbed and went straight to the top of the flame warlock. The gnome quickly lifted his staff to resist, and his body rose up to the flame shield, and there were two thick arms of fire. Siegel’s eyes are bright, nothing else is wrong, but this fire element arm is a good spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword and the staff collided and made a loud noise. Gnomes feel that their arms are numb, knowing that they are not as tall as those in their height. It is clearly a battle between the Masters. How do you become a melee when you fight? The sigh in his mind was not finished yet, and he felt that another strong hit on the staff, and then he became an empty hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is proficient in dwarf combat skills and has long learned the skills of continuous strikes. So after the long sword, it is followed by the black gold staff of his own backhand. Two consecutive forces form a superposition, and the average person can't hold the weapon in this case. The gnome was shocked and knew that he was at a great disadvantage, so he rushed to ask for mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The counterattack of the Flame Shield and other protective spells was one step behind, and it hit the Siegel body's defensive spell, either blocked or offset, and did not cause much damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of short arms pulled out forcefully, but could not resist the power of Siegel. After all, under the old appearance, it is a strong body. The gnome coughed a blood, and reluctantly said a word: "Don't..." Siegel's arm slammed him hard and pierced him, ending his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of the fire element are still holding Serge's staff, and they have played such a role from beginning to end. Siegel reached out and grabbed his staff, while stepping on the gnome's chest and pulling out. The sword and the staff were returned to his hands, and the gnome's body fell to the ground with a slamming sound, and the blood flowed from under him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp god came over and looked at it, hit a finger, and the gnome’s body disappeared. But after two seconds, an identical dwarf walked in the direction of the valley protected by the stone pillars. He was careful to guard, but it was difficult to hide the desire for the tower. Eight people looked at the scene in a weird way, but most of the sights were still between the "old man" and the "gnome." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this time backtracking? Siegel looked at the god of light, and the latter only responded with silence. It takes a couple of points to protect yourself and kill the provocateurs, but in the case of already negative points, it is a fool to spend two hundred points "whip". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome is like being here for the first time, with a curious look in his eyes. But everyone has already got the alert and can see the tyranny and hatred hidden in his soul. Everyone is guessing whether this gnome knows that he has been killed once. Or ask him the score to find the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can kill him once. Can do it for the second time. But he found a difference. This time the gnome did not have a staff on hand, and the long rod that had just been struck out in battle was now lying on the open space not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc mage is striding toward the staff, and he seems to want to take it for himself. Siegel said: "Is it not good to get something for nothing." Then hook the finger to the staff. The gnome's staff flew up and fell directly into Siegel's hands. The half-orc smiled strangely, rubbed his nose, and turned to his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a flame cane that can be used to cast most spells of spells and strengthen the power of spells. The gnome was stunned with a lot of rubies and opals on the staff. Further strengthen the power of the spell. For Siegel, this wand is like a bomb of a goblin, and it can be dangerous at any time because of the overflow of fire elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Light God, if this staff is for you, can you exchange points?" Siegel wondered and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This level of items, twenty." Light God said: "Remind, you can only use other people's magic items in exchange for points, their own No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, which at least made up for it. Although I can't do anything on my body. But since other people's magic items are available, there is an additional way to increase points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. The first thing that Siegel thought of was not to take advantage of it, but to exchange it. Assuming that the exchange method is ok, then both people can get points. It's just that what kind of magic items can get more points but it is unknown, so it also requires luck and sufficient reasoning ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the staff can be converted into points, there is no need to do this in front of everyone. If someone else sees that he has handed the staff to the lamp god, you can guess it by simply guessing it. Siegel put away the ruby ​​flame staff and walked to his semi-buried house. When he opened the door, he saw that the furnishings were almost the same as his own study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more in line with your own habits, but it may also expose your identity. He thought about it and asked the lamp god: "Can you change it and become the simplest bed and chair?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Either Points, either do it yourself." Light God replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not difficult for a sergeant, with invisible servants and elemental guards, changing the layout of the entire room is just a matter of time. Siegel didn't need to do it himself, but asked about the situation of the lamp god at this time. I believe other people do the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
