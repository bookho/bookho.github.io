			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is called a study, then the house in Mystery is the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was the idea when stepping into the king’s study. Basically, it has been changed into an activity room. Several straw-covered straw targets are erected against the wall, and the traces of the original bookshelf on the ground are clearly visible. Only one large desk and the piled up documents still have a look of a study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon is squatting on the table, with a correct posture. He didn't lift his head and said to Siegel: "Come so fast, find a chair and sit down. I have to wait a little longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK, don't care about me.” Siegel came to the straw target and looked at the sword marks above. "You have recently regressed, how can you cut so shallow, is it too much to write too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon just looked up, quite Deliberately said: "Sorke, tell the Marquis, what is I cutting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A squid, squat." Salk said: "A peach branch picked from the garden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel reached out and said, "I don't believe it, take me to see, there must be something weird. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king put down his pen and raised his chin, indicating that the general manager would do it. It was a branch of Siegel that had almost the same thickness as the little finger, and there were traces of the leaves that had been smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, weird." Siegel applied the power of the earth element to it, secretly increased its hardness, and then slammed the armor . With the help of the sharp magic, only the sound of a bang, the scarecrow's armor was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hahaha, you are not even weird, it’s cheating!" Evan laughed and pushed the letter in front of him: "Go to him, now Don't do it! Come, Siegel, let's fight one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to rebuild the palace, I will be happy to accompany you." It’s pointed out: “And if the situation expands, it’s possible to rebuild the kingdom.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you pointing at the Viscount Bill?” Evan Scratching the head. Then take a piece of paper from the drawer under the desk, look it again, and then take out the stamp: "Since you are here, let Sorke put this in the world."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not seen. Three or two steps to the past, look around the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is probably the case, the sir of the sir. The rebel of the big rebellion tries to confuse the sacred hearing and affect the peaceful peace of the starry kingdom. I believe this situation is not a case. Therefore, in the name of the king, all those involved will be given the opportunity to defend themselves in order to show tolerance. Evan Star I, the saint of the gods in the world, the king of the kingdom of stars, the guardian of humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Siegel let go of his heart. With this purpose, Master Bill will not be implicated because someone has to deal with Siegel, and safety can be improved a lot. "It seems that you have been prepared, why didn't you send it out before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorke Khan all flowed down. I didn't expect the Marquis of Siegel to ask for an exit. Is this accusation? There is a pile of evidence for Bill’s participation in the rebels, but he has not been able to prove that he is not a rebel. In this case, it is already very good to be able to directly waive the suspicion. How can it be too slow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, you dare to say that," Evan pointed to the general manager around him and said to Siegel: "You yell you. The poor man is scared, the water on his head can be reflected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your squat, the outside is cool, there is some heat inside the house," Sorke said with a smile: " I can't hold swords and use magic. Naturally, I can't compare with His Majesty and Marquis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The body is empty, let alone say, don't blame the weather." The purpose is to throw it to Salk: "Go, stay here, you can't stand it, go to work. Let the wiki wait in the strategy room. We will pass in a while. Right, give him some refreshments, save the province and Last hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have a chance to be a king one day, you must refuse. Because it is too much brainy." Evan saw that he and Siegel had only two people left in the room, and began to vomit: " Because you are a king, if you are right, no one is your opponent, so each one will use the intrigue to deal with you. Tell you, it is really annoying me, bother me!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I expressed sympathy, you are indeed looking for it yourself." Siegel spread his hands: "I don't have the same, far away from the New World, this is still not troublesome." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, if it is not trouble, are you willing to leave your castle to come to me?" Evan jumped into the desk and sat down at the desk. On the top, swaying two legs. "Since you are here, don't worry. I have a lot of things to entrust you to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Can I refuse?" I already felt that I was too busy to come, and as a result, His Majesty had to add a burden. "I'm afraid I don't adapt to the life of the Star King."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crap!" Evan waved his hand: "For your master, you can drive away." The magic spaceship, killing it in the past - I am absolutely right in this word, you don't want to deny it. Now for me, you can't stay a little longer? You really think of me as a guy with a special seal?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not professionally stamped, and there is a smell of swordsmanship." Siegel sighed and knew that he had no choice: "Go, I recognized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two things, one is to become a military adviser, working under the count of Todd. But in fact, Earl Todd listens to your assignment. I have already said it to him. The other is to be my son's teacher and teach him to read and read."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How old is your son? No!" Siegel licked his hand and had an incredible expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I know that it’s hard to be a military adviser." Avon shrugged his shoulders: "The goblin crystal wall made me very annoyed, Master." The association and the school city make a strong suggestion, you are the most perfect shield I can think of. This military consultant is to do this. The benefits, naturally, there are. I promise you, the Royal Library, you look at it. As a military The consultant always has to check all kinds of information about the kingdom. This is a privilege that the Royal Marquis cannot have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have to be responsible for directing any fighting?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan rolled his eyes and touched his teeth a few times, like a bit of a toothache. "You want to be beautiful, and the command is certainly not in your hands. To put it bluntly, you are a black pot and a sloppy idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before you say this, I will Understood," Siegel nodded. "For you, the black pot can be back, but I won't give you a bad idea." He pointed to his head: "This is not white."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand that you use your head with a sword. Hey, you didn't find it, I have won without fighting?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't know where to laugh." Siegel shook his head. Then he spread his arms and hugged Evan and patted him on the back: "Since I am here to help you, sorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan’s body glimpsed, but immediately regained his strength. He squeezed his eyes hard and said that he was deeply inhaled: "Okay. Aaron's funeral is held the day after tomorrow, and you join me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No problem. It is said that he has three children who have been robbed. Is it true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are indeed three children, but not brothers. The flesh and blood is the hands and feet of several aristocrats who want to drill the camp." Avon said: "It was originally sent to Heim. But Aaron hopes to see more of these children. So everyone did not tell. He is the truth, only hope that his last time will be happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon said that Aaron was able to wake up every day at the last moment of his life, but two hour. In these two hours, he had to look at the three children all the time, raising his hands with all his strength and touching their faces. "Whenever I rest, you will pour me food. Elf biscuits or anything else doesn't matter, don't waste my time anyway." Aaron is such a servant and physician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
