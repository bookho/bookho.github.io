			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet, are you okay?" Siegel frowned and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay? Okay?" The Raven stopped on the owner's shoulder and licked his head to learn the tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been asking me for the seventh time, I am fine." Janet is still the same smile. But she lied, so she covered it with the same expression. Although Janet is the person who has the least amount of blood drawn, she is physically weakest, so it is the most troublesome to recover, and she needs to eat a lot of drugs. In addition to always feeling hungry and lack of nutrition, Janet always feels that the blood of the Mozu is starting to move – she often feels that her hand has become a paw and her teeth are sharp. She needs to touch her teeth to make sure it is just an illusion. But this illusion is so realistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you, Siegel." The kitten immediately shifted the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is frowning again: "I was almost possessed by a blood magician, and I almost killed you, how can I?" Stroking the raven's feathers and feeding it walnuts. He found that such an action not only makes the magic pet feel happy, but also calms his mood. He couldn't tell Janet about the Jazz's opposition to their union, so there was always pressure in the mind. "Next time I won't let you get involved in such a dangerous place," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness will seal you as a knight, is this true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes, I think it should be very fast. Dr. Rees’s medical skills are really powerful, and the Prince’s Highness has been able to walk with the staff.” Siegel paused for a while, then said: “Maybe I should let Reese see you again, personally. Prescribe medicine for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. I don't want him to know that I am a demon, as long as ordinary blood medicine is enough." Janet shook her head. The look is very firm. "Don't worry about me. If it's not good, I will tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, okay, you are right." Geer's is not Janet's injury, but other things. He has not told the jazz that he will be sealed by the prince until now. The two have not said a word since they separated. Siegel stayed in the tent to take care of Janet, took the opportunity to avoid the trivialities in the camp, and just escaped the sight of Sir Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the things in the camp were still in his ears. Three hiring knights fled, and took three horses and a bag of coins. However, they did not steal enough supplies from the place where the food was preserved, and only took a few sausages and a bag of bread. Now it's snowy season, others cursed that they would be hungry to death, or killed by the snow demon on the mountain. Siegel thought of what he saw through the eyes of the magic pet, knowing that they were not riding horses - maybe someone else, Siegel guessed. Everyone does not know when these three people left, what is the motivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The return of the prince means that the mission has come to an end, at least down the mountain. The mercenaries are checking the sled, collecting the dry wood used for the fire on the road, and trying to accumulate food. Sir Bill is busy, he needs to coordinate the affairs of the big and small, and he can handle the debris in a well-organized manner, which is appreciated by Count Todd. "The riverside city will be more prosperous in your hands," the count said to the baron. Bill kneels on one knee and swears that he will not live up to this trust and honor, and will use his life to be fair and compassionate. "Budget of Riverside City", this is the new title of Sir Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl completed his promise, and then it should be the turn of the Prince. Siegel thought about it and decided to go see Sir Bill, at least he should tell him the news. He walked through the camp and found Sir Bill behind a table in the middle of a pile of boxes, when he was counting the number of supplies. Seeing that Siegel came over, the Jazz looked up. Although his face was full of exhaustion, he could still feel the love and concern in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel coughed and said, "Mr. Sir, I think I should tell you something. In the cave, Count Todd promised that it would For me, I have been asked by the prince of the prince to be the captain of the Knights. This is why I did not accept being your heir before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, Janet is your reason. Sir Bill is very direct, and very sincerely said: "But I don't want to quarrel with you again for this matter. You will become a knight, you can make your own choice, I respect this, even if I am very opposed. Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do next after you become your Cavaliers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I will follow the prince, maybe I will participate in the things of the half-orc Go, but the most important thing is to continue to improve the strength." Siegel moved to a wooden box, opposite the table of Sir Bill. Raven Barron poked his head out of his sleeve and jumped onto the table, staring at everything around him with black eyes. "Jazz, this is the magic pet I got. Now I can be called a formal mage. You also praised my swordsmanship. I used to be happy. But in this adventure, I was in danger and almost died. I have seen higher and stronger strengths, and I feel my own shortcomings. If I want to do something big, I must improve my strength and make the right choice. I can only choose the same sword and magic. I chose magic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There has never been a magician's knight." Sir Bill said: "The road you chose is too difficult. I admit that many wizards are very powerful." But I also know that this road requires too much energy and time. The magician is a consultant, but what can he do as a knight? Does he know how to plant and harvest? Does he have time to manage the territory? He can command the army and improve Morale?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mr. Sir, it’s impossible to solve too many enemies with a sword. It’s only magic.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are wrong, child. You must remember if you want to be strong. One point, a friend is your way to solve the enemy. The sword is just your last choice, and magic is also. For thousands of years, the nobility has formed an intricate relationship. You have me, I have you. That's it. Only in this way, the stability and development of the kingdom of stars has been maintained. It is precisely because of this that the Master has never established a country, and the temple cannot control the customs. These are not swords and magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But..." Siegel’s words were interrupted before they were finished. A waiter wearing a star-studded costume came over at this time and said after the baron salute: "His Royal Highness will soon preside over the ceremonial ceremonies of Mr. Siegel. Please come to the jazz to witness. Mr. Siegel, please dress properly, instantly "See you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, this time you must go in armor and put away the mage's robes." Sir Bill said very seriously: "This It is a must-have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, let the attendant follow him, and quickly went back to change clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince’s camp usually has only three people to enter, he himself, Count Todd and Evan. The morning guards who are bodyguards can follow the prince's entry and exit, and others have never come in. The space here is comparable to the hotel's halls, all of which are comfortable and luxurious: soft and warm feather mattresses, thick silk quilts, and smokeless charcoal stoves that burn all year round. Fur-covered ring seat with desk with ink bottle and quill pen. There is a magical basket hanging in the middle of the camp, so the refined food can be seen everywhere in the room. In the early winter of the wind and snow, deep in the mountains, you can still see rosy apples, plump pears, and crystal grapes. The wine jug is always full, and there is always a good dry cheese and ham in the silver plate next to it. There is only one corner of the room that is not for enjoyment. There are a bunch of carefully crafted weapons, including long swords, giant swords, long bows and axes. A few new armor were placed on the shelves, which were spare equipment for Aaron, Todd and Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness is tasting wine, which always gives energy to his weak body. Knowing that he was saved by Evan's blood, His Royal Highness and his father's illegitimate child are more closely related, and they are inseparable all day long. He took out the best remedy from the court and shared it with Evan. The two men tasted the bread with simmered salt, and then ate the delicious squid with salt and fry, and the turkey filled with onions and mushrooms. However, these foods are obviously not suitable for the prince of the prince who is recovering from a serious illness, causing him to vomit and diarrhea. So now he can only eat porridge made from pumpkin, peas and ham, then wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel-Squid, a strange name, is he an illegitimate child? I should not give him a pedigree certificate to get rid of him. Is this identity?" His Royal Highness was awakened by the role of red wine. He asked Count Todd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Siegel is not an illegitimate child, he was born on the boat, do not know who his parents are." Earl Todd carefully prepared the clothes for the prince, for his face Wipe the powder and cover up the tired look. "He is just an orphan and will be the first person in his name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. A knight without a family drag can better serve the royal family." Prince Aaron said in a flush, then took another drink. "The Earl, how do I remember that the royal family cannot authorize a magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
