			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of war, even a sumptuous dinner is hard to boost appetite - except for the half-orc. Please search (product #书...网)! The fastest-changing novel, the food in the plate gradually became cold, and Siegel summoned the fire element to reheat everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet, you have something to do." Siegel suddenly turned his head and said to her: "In addition to taking care of Isaac, you have to manage the entire sea." The internal part of the collar. How are the three registrars recommended by Fazak now? They are all handed over to you for management."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If only responsible for materials and deployments This is not difficult, and it doesn't involve much energy.” Janet said: “Don't say me, the clerk can do this, so do you have anything to arrange for me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and reminded her: "I estimate that there will be a large number of refugees soon, and Heim will be prepared. It is impossible for us to accept all of them. When necessary, you can contact other lords in the South to keep abreast of the progress of the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet understands the burden of the body and nods in a dignified look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for my mission, I will talk to you too." Siegel’s eyes swept over everyone’s face, and a long breath Later, he said: "I will go to the walled mountain passage first, try to get through it as soon as possible, and then arrange the negotiation with the barbarian across the mountain, and strive to find a strategic space for Heim. At the same time, I will study the weakness of the war tree, hope to make ordinary soldiers Can have enough fighting ability in the face of ancient trees. If the elves' wizards appear, Heim will suffer the catastrophe. At that time, everyone must retreat from the secret road. This is a dead command. But I I will find a way for the Elf Master to look to the Knox Association to avoid the possibility of the destruction of Heim."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are many other details Things. I already have an idea. But I need to implement it step by step.” Siegel turned his eyes to Janet. Grabbing her hand and saying: "I am sorry, now I can't take all my energy to study the treatment. You must control your emotions and avoid further deterioration. But you can rest assured that I will solve this problem." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet patted his hand and revealed a warm smile: "You can rest assured, I will pay attention."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next. Siegel raised his glass and said to everyone in the room: "I don't want to deceive everyone, saying that we have the possibility to win. But although Heim is in the middle of the gap, it is far from desperate. I have found a glimmer of hope. As the lord of Heim, I vowed to protect the people on the land, just as the captain protects the crew in the storm. Even in the face of storms, I have to let the ship sail into a safe port. You are mine. The knight, also my brother friend, whether it is because of vows or ideals, go forward with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having finished drinking the wine in his hand, Siegel Pick up the knife. Inserted into the pumpkin pie, announced the official start of the dinner. Despite his poor appetite, Dan Siegel still ate something in front of him. I have to say that the cooks are still very hard, but their lords have no food in their minds, only worry about the future situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Jack, others rarely talk, so the dinner ends very quickly. Segal took Janet's hand and walked slowly on the walls of the city of Mier, enjoying the last leisure time. They met a listless guard. When the other party saw the lord and the wife, they quickly stood up and almost did not drop the helmet. Siegel patted his shoulder and gave him a word of encouragement, so that he would not be nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are an unlucky lord." Janet smirked and tried to tease Siegel: "The aristocrats of the kingdom of the stars may not be able to touch them forever." A decent war, you hit it three times in a few short years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and felt helpless: "I was originally acquired the territory. In order to allow the research magic to have sufficient financial support. Of course, I also want the people on the territory to live a good life, but that is only one of the reasons, nothing more. You also know that I have no experience in the daily management of the territory, the people I didn't ask what to eat and what to wear. In addition to scooping out the gold mine, I didn't contribute much to the territory and brought him a war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "War is not brought by you, and you are very beautiful victory twice." Janet leaned her head on Siegel's chest, and the two cuddled on the tower. “The war did cause casualties, but the population of the territory has increased much more than before. Not only the half-orcs and dwarves, but also the human population has increased dramatically. In addition to many immigrants, many children have recently been born and they feel that life It’s better to be able to support children and have a sense of security. Do you think they want a lord who is familiar with planting and raising? No, everyone wants someone to support and bring victory in times of crisis. You are doing very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Janet replied: "I understand how you feel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the lord of Heim, the tens of thousands of people in the territory are Concerned about him, this pressure is like the essence, just in the heart of Siegel's heart is heavy. He is an excellent sailor qualified warrior talented magician and lucky lord, but he is only twenty years old. Although he learned the style of Sir Bill all day, he tried to mature himself and enhanced his momentum with the mystery of magic, but he was just a youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an anxiety and fear. These emotions are hidden by his efforts. When it is difficult to suppress, they even need to become undead to pass. Only in the face of Janet can he relax and reveal these emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stood quietly on the tower, and for a long time no one opened their mouths and enjoyed a rare peace. The wind in the night is getting colder, but there are gas elements around it to separate the cold wind. The fire element provides the temperature, and they don’t feel the autumn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many City has a lot of people in this scene, in the heart to send blessings to the lord couple. Many people gradually calmed down from the fear of war, and the seeds of hope in their hearts began to sprout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few words in the meeting, which does not mean that things will follow the expected development, and some people must make unremitting efforts and even sacrifice for victory. The next day, the sky was not bright. Siegel gently kissed his wife and son. Bring his reel 匣. Came to the depths of the channel of the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a wide, short passageway, and the top of the cave sometimes meets Siegel’s head. In order to avoid the rune matrix of the city wall, the dwarf twisted and twisted the passage, twisting up and down like a dragonfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to transport the excavated sand, the dwarves built a zip line system, and several half-orcs were responsible for continually pulling the ropes and transporting the deep earth and stone. This work does not stop during the day and night, so the passage is filled with the smell of dust and sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The channel advances two meters. There will be a pair of dwarf runes on the wall. These runes are dedicated to the rune system of the Wall Mountain Range and serve as a hidden channel. At the same time they also emit a faint milky white glow, providing illumination in the microchannels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is an unfinished passage, the air flow is very poor and gradually unable to support breathing as it gets farther away from the hole. Fortunately, Heim has an elemental rune guard, so there is always a gas element that constantly blows deep into the passage with fresh air, trying to improve the breathing environment ahead. It is this kind of guarantee that the passage can continue to extend forward and the construction period does not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The torch is not allowed to be lit here, but also to save air. Siegel continued to advance along the curved passage. Use light spirit to continuously increase speed. But even so, he took a whole day to find the end of the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air here is very muddy. If an ordinary person comes, it will soon cause dizziness and even suffocation. The dwarves rely on the tough body to stick here, but their purple faces are constantly reminding Siegel that the dwarves also have limits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I brought you some good things." Siegel took out two space bags and opened one of them. A stream of air ejected from the space bag instantly made the surrounding atmosphere much better. "There is some food in this bag, and the other is air and food. When you feel uncomfortable, just breathe, at least relieve it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you." Dwarf Locke's beard shook. The long-term underground work made them form a short and concise way of speaking. He pointed his finger and said: "Hey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and understood . In order to save the air here, he used a wand to write words in the air, allowing the dwarf to answer in body language. After confirming the direction of the previous excavation, Siegel took over the rune guard core that controlled the earth elements and improved it with his latest mastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added a part of the rune of the energy focusing lens as a source of energy for the elemental rune, transforming it into an orientation device. A part of the core is aligned with the earth and stone layer in front, and the energy focusing lens continuously absorbs the energy of the earth element there after receiving the command. At the same time, the core uses the absorbed energy to make earth elements, and continues to excavate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the soil in front of it extremely soft and greatly speeds up the excavation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
