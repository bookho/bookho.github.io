			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and his group saw the elf's squad when they had not left the Holy Land. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the gathering of the grassland upstream and herdsmen clearly alerted the elves. They sent the Rangers and Druids who were good at the wilderness, and carefully entered the depths of the grasslands. They are covered in gray-white elf cloaks, and they can be mixed with the surroundings if they are standing still; they are wearing soft elf soft boots, and they are silent even when they are on the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the magical suppression of the Holy Land blocked them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this range, in addition to the priests who believe in the three spirits, the ability of other casters is greatly reduced. Moreover, there are too many warriors assembled in the Holy Land, and it is basically hopeless to want to secretly sneak into the past. Thus the elf squad lurked patiently, trying to find new opportunities until it was discovered by Siegel's psionic vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred cavalry culls rushed up and instantly drowned the squad. Personal martial arts can't play much of a role in the face of cavalry assault, and the flying saber has ended everything. The hoof of the horse's hooves stunned a group of crows rummaging around the grass, and they screamed and threw themselves into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is actually white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribal knights took all the things from the elves, leaving only the body of the ** on the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of flying crows are not far away, and the screaming whirls in the sky. After the Cavaliers have left, this will be the beginning of their feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not interested in staying behind to see such a scene, so the legs are on a mount and the snow leaves. Mana and others turned to the west and returned to Heim by the Mid-Levels. After Siegel stepped out of the Holy Land, he sent a teleport to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of food in the tall windows of Mire City is still the main food of the past few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant shuttled and served the wine and food for the Knights of Heim. The people in the room were intertwined, and loud laughter was heard from time to time. Some people whispered at the table. The lobby on the first floor of the city of Mier is now converted into a banquet hall. The brazier burns day and night, and all the food is hot over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a luxury for enjoyment, but a canteen for defending knights and soldiers. Just come here and you can eat warm food. The knights, soldiers, and mercenaries are divided into three tables. The tableware used is naturally very different from the food contained in it, but it is never short of two or perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel passed by the restaurant door and just took a look. Then he stepped on the ladder back to the study. Heim's air is filled with strong elemental power, constantly penetrating his injured body, drilling into the bones, and supplementing the loss of plasma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a mixture of tingling and stinging, making normal walking a luxury. At first the legs were just a little soft. I couldn’t afford the power until later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master frowned, never before. He waved his wand and let himself gain the power of flying, then gave up the plan to go back to the room to sleep, first go to Reid's temple to see the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind blows the cold air of his hair into the gap between his black hair, which is also mixed with looming whispers. Siegel listened and found that he had severe tinnitus. He had to open his mouth, balance the pressure inside and outside the ear, and then speed up the flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle hall is not far from the south, and the temple of Reid is cold and clear. The person who prayed has not yet arrived. Since there was no fighting, Zucker’s recruit training also came to an end, so there have been few wounded people recently. In addition to the two singers who come here every day, Rhett almost lived a life of seclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple one is less than a hundred meters, Siegel’s stumble, he only feels that the body has lost balance and direction. After the ear pain, it is a severe headache, and the line of sight begins to blur. He touched his forehead with his hand and only felt that his palm was hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he couldn’t keep his focus on the spell, the flight disappeared, and he fell to the ground with a bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Lord?" Rhett kept kneeling and praying. He opened his small, shiny eyes and immediately got up after seeing the people, and rushed over to check. Siegel's complexion is red, his throat is purple, his eyes and ears begin to flow out of black blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of life: expel toxins!" Rhett's right hand gave a bright glow, pressed against Siegel's body. The blue-violet color is slightly reduced. But the heartbeat is getting faster and faster, and it is almost out of the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't quit! Body recovery!" The magic image continues to perform magic, but only relieves but cannot be eradicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed Siegel on the ground, holding his hands on his chest, and then casting spells to remove the curse. This time he felt great resistance, and a force that was much stronger than him was constantly invading Siegel's body. Rhett's mana could not be dispelled at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Golem is still doing its best, removing the curse again and again. This curse came from afar and vowed to put Siegel to death. With the help of the repelling spell, both casters saw the true face of this curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative energy dominates, the toxins, diseases, and spell effects that affect thinking are mixed and constantly poured from the top of the Siegel head. The wizard's own magical protective power has been unable to withstand, and his internal organs begin to fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel only felt dizzy and dark, and the body began to get cold from the heat, just like the feeling of death. There is not much time left for him. If he loses consciousness, he will be finished. He looked at Reid, took a sigh of relief, and reluctantly said two words: "confidentiality" and then turned himself into a state of paralysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy uploaded by Reid's hand becomes the effect of damage, while the curse that continues to fall in the air turns into reinforcement. The red soul fire in the skull suddenly increased, and the plasma lines on the body were all lit up. Siegel squatted for a while before gradually calming down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God!" Rhett hurriedly took his hand back. "How can you become a dead soul?" He grabbed Sieg with his strong hands. Er's cervical vertebrae are ready to pinch off at any time. There is a constant electric spark coming out of his palm, but the Golem is simply unmoved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be nervous, Rhett, I am still me." Siegel relaxed and said that he was not threatened. "This is my life-saving ability to avoid fatal injuries to living things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder is still not at ease, after looking at the left and right Only slowly release your hand. He said to Siegel: "You are not a disguised transformation, but a real undead. Do you understand the risks?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Head, sit up from the ground: "Of course. Keeping this state for a long time will make my mind die like a dead, lose the vitality of being a creature." He pointed to the top of his head, the curse of negative energy is still there, constantly Attack him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before solving this problem, I am afraid I have to be in this state." Siegel said: "If you are not you, there is no other way, I also It won't be like this in front of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder nodded and reached out to pull Siegel up from the ground. "You know that it is very dangerous to appear in front of the people with the face of the dead. You will not follow a dead soul. Maybe you will lose the entire territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mage sighed and tapped his brain with his hand and said, "You have to help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, someone does their best."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell this story to Janet and let her have a mental preparation." Siegel said: "I need to go to the Federation's spell lab to see the fall. "What the curse on my head is going on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope you can find the answer." Reid walked out and then turned back. Said to Siegel: "You can't walk in broad daylight. Do you need to find some blouses for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't forget that I am A mage." Siegel applied to his own face, covering his face with his original appearance. Rhett stared at it for a while. But he shook his head and said, "The Lord Lord, someone suggests that you don't do this. You now look like an evil lich who has tried to mix in the illusion. The evil spirits that you have spread all over the body have reached a dazzling level, justice. When you see you, you will definitely attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
