When he saw Siegel put his hand on the crystal of the fire, the expression became very complicated. He is convinced that Siegel will be burned to death, but he is not sure if the scorpion will be spared in this disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first moment, a lot of knowledge flooded into Siegel’s mind like a flood, and every casting scene that was happening and about to happen rushed into him. In the eyes. Everything is bright and blurry, and all the sounds are huge and far away. He can't concentrate, and the soul wants to be torn into countless pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light from his body lit up, stopping the collapse of the body and consciousness. Chanem smiled and knew that his preparations were not in vain. Although it is only a part of the body of the orc saint, it is enough to change the identity of Siegel and lift him from the mortal class to the saint, completing an important qualitative change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For body repair and consciousness protection, this Holy Power is quickly consumed. When Siegel returned to God, he was almost killed by the will. Although he is not out of danger, the most difficult place has passed. Even if it is still the end of failure, there is at least a chance to resist and make a change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cut the fire and the priest to reduce the burden, you can have a chance to survive!" Chanem shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lil’s eyes widened, and he realized this possibility. Although the sacred murderer and Siegel have been cooperating, but Leer still has a kind of inertial thinking, that all the attempted gods will eventually turn against each other, so they do not think in the direction of sharing the fire. As a former knowledge creator, he certainly knows how the position of the murderer came. It was a famous event that divided the fire and the priesthood. If someone knows the technology, it is not a Chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately rushed to Chanem to fight to kill him before the fire of God. Chanem was prepared and armed with two daggers to prepare for the battle. The battle can't happen after all, because Siegel screams with a shout of fire: "Do not disturb!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the role of the tranquillity, the rules of the battle are This country of God came into effect, separating Lear and Chanem from each other. Have you mastered some of the fires so quickly? Lear looked at Siegel with an incredible expression and found that his mouth had overflowed with blood. "Oh, this is the right thing! The Holy Power is almost consumed. It can't take care of all aspects. It can only be repaired in the vital parts. I am waiting for you to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of it is the will of Siegel, part of it is also the will of the fire, both do not want to go to God to be disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick! Separate the fire! Don't be afraid to play with yourself!" Chanem yelled anxiously, both for himself and for Siegel. . Lear heard this and snorted: "Do you think you want to cut it and cut it? Only equal or higher power can complete the cutting. I have never heard that it can cut gold with wood! You need tools to cut it. , that is the fire of God, do you think it is a roast chicken that can be torn open by hand? Your little saint is not the body of the murder god. Do you think that you know all? Fool!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney was stunned, and then he realized why he could not completely remove the priesthood and fire of the sacred god. It turned out to be this! The power of the three gods of death is divided by the old god of death, and indeed there have never been instances of mortal or holy people completing the cutting. This process requires not only methods but also the right tools and strengths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After a failure?" Chanem did not want to believe this, so he looked at the obsidian dagger in his hand. If there are any weapons that can affect the realm of God, it is only possible to kill the saint's dagger. He threw the dagger to Siegel, "Catch, use this to cut!" he shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille first stunned and then laughed. In his laughter, the dagger flew halfway as if it had hit the wall, and slammed into the ground. "No fighting, no fighting. Before the rules of the kingdom of God are lifted, do you want to throw weapons? Hahaha, laugh at me, you can't even figure out the simple causal relationship!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two obsidian daggers inserted on the ground reflect the blue light of the fire, and the figure of Siegel's white robe is also reflected in it, but I don't know when it will disappear. This time, even Chennam did not have confidence, and could not open fire, Siegel himself had no hope of being able to withstand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to get control..." His voice came on and off, and he directly laughed at Lehr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical school of the magical fire has also affected the wall of the mine wall, the elements have not changed excessively, but the effect of the spell has become difficult to control. Most of the magical magic on the mage has become other forms, such as a stinking cloud or a burst of noise, or fire. All the transmission arrays stopped working at the first time, and those that did not come out from the inside were lost in the cracks in the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical beast feels the most sensitive, they are squatting on the ground, put away the power of magic, to avoid causing accidental injury. It is okay to take the initiative to control. Some creatures that rely on magic to fly in the sky have lost their ability and screamed to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the star number stayed on the ground, not like the other two patrolling magical spaceships, the end of the crash. After realizing the tremendous pain in the body, she hurriedly left a sentence, let Janet tell Siegel "to wake me up when everything is safe." Then she actively shut down the energy core and went into sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heam’s nuclear nucleus was subsequently closed, and the federation had a sample. If it is not just loading materials, the Federation’s headquarters spacecraft will inevitably fall. Any magical user who is not aware of it is crouching and does not dare to show up, in case it is inexplicably dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic is a huge system, like a sea boat that can break the waves. Even if all the ship operators have problems at the same time, its inherent inertia and strength will not cause the big ship to sink in an instant. What's more, Siegel does not want the ship to sink. He just wants to control the fire, but he is not going to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the story of "Capturing the Divine and causing the destruction of his hometown," Siegel thinks that there are too many whitewashes and it is not worthy of recognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it has to be said that Shenhuo is a reckless, unrestrained bastard who wants to re-cultivate his mind, regardless of whether Sigel can afford it. Even if Siegel keeps ordering and even threatens to cut the fire, it still wants to charge like an avalanche. The power from the orc saint is running low, but Siegel has finally cast his own spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of his residence room was opened. With the help of the lamp god, one crystal and another crystal scorpion flew out and stopped on the square. Each of the crystal cymbals is a clone of Siegel, which has been cultivated. After Siegel made the first one, he spent a lot of points and copied it as a magic item. The crystal cymbals are constantly flying out, and the number is soon over 10,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this, your body?" Dragon Lire has no memory of cloning, and naturally does not know what it is. Chanem heard about this spell a little, and he couldn't help but laugh at this scene. Is Sigel trying to resurrect by cloning, and slowly bear the power of the fire? But even if it can be resurrected, every contact with the fire is a new beginning. The last time the body has been destroyed, it is impossible to generate new resistance. In other words, no matter whether it is re-tested a hundred times or 10,000 times, there will be no slight change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's face is full of confusion, he can't understand what Siegel did. In the face of the unknown, God is not much different from people. Siegel looked at his "cloning army" in place, and looked at the following with the corner of his eye. At this moment, he hopes to see the expression of a sudden realization from Lear's eyes. That means identity, which means that he is not alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he fell into disappointment, Lear wanted to understand. "These are the things you use to resurrect yourself, just like the magic soul pot or the astral projection? You are crazy, so a lot and repeated resurrection will erase your soul and disappear from the world forever. Even the possibility of going to the kingdom of God is gone! And it is meaningless. You can't reset your soul so many times to continue to bear the power of the fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "It does not work." Siegel's voice changed under the influence of the body, and it became more and more low-minded, more and more neutral, and lost its personal characteristics. "My cloning can only carry one complete soul at a time, and only one after another. But there is a way to get them to work at the same time, and absorb the fire with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a circuit board embedded in red crystal, let go of the hand and let it float in the air. "The world of the goblin has no compromises, no understanding, no peace, but there is a good thing, that is, the gods of the gods! The Internet of the goblins, the super carrier they used to brainwash! It will help me to complete my vision!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
