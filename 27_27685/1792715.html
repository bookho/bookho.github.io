			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comprehensive war is already in the mind of Siegel. Although his eyes have not been seen yet, he has already smelled its smell, just in front of him. The letter of the hot stamp is inside. Www*xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this, the most precious and indestructible paper in the legend, adding a special formula of fine gold to the pulp, and then using the earth's The paper that the power suppressed?” Siegel did not open the letter in front of the messenger, but slowly observed with great interest. "I remember that at the top of the Mora, the price of this paper is 5,000 gold coins. It is not a special ink specially designed. Only the Master's level spells are worthy of this paper, so don't tell me. It’s just plain greetings.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf standing opposite Siegel was polite and smiled and waved his hand. He and Siegel knew each other a long time ago, when Siegel was still locked in the iron cage behind the carriage. Gerard Bun said: "The Siegel Lord, this is an invitation, I hope that you can attend the meeting that will be held in the holy ship: not a stone boat. Our dwarf kings are all smart and powerful to the world. The leader of the organization issued an invitation to discuss the important things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, and his sense of smell was right. The wording in the letter is sincere and polite, and fully affirms the importance of the Mage Federation on the New World. "There is no mention of Heim's collar, this is a letter to the federation, not mine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerard is a little embarrassed, he is from his arms again Take out another letter: a good parchment and bronzing decoration, written in ink mixed with blue dragon blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, this is the earlord to Heim, the only mage lord on the mainland, Siegel squid." Siegel will have two letters Put it in front of him, then stretched out again to the dwarf Gerard and said: "There should be a letter, the letter is the important letter that determines everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The dwarf nodded, untied the backpack, and took out a reel tied with a string. This reel is just plain ink and paper, which is available in any grocery store. Only the person who wrote the letter was Elinette. So this letter is more important than the other two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Siegel read the letter carefully, he no longer hesitated and said directly to the dwarf: "The federation will attend this meeting. Which one? The mage needs the decision of the Security Council. No matter who is elected. I will also participate as the lord of Heim."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarf is very honored to welcome you. The meeting will be held ten months later, I will stay at the Heim collar and lead you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking of the stone boat, what does the dwarf put it? Where is the place?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“On the middle of the oceans of the two continents. The plan is to stop at Ximu Town after seven months. Then sail to the Old World. Old Participants from the mainland will board other ships on the stone boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After seven months, Ximu Town, I understand, like this big thing I "I won't miss it," said Siegel. "The latest news I got, the door to the fine gold of Moura's cockroach is completely open, and it is already possible for other people besides the dwarf to enter and exit. Is it true?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes, I think your message is correct.” Gerard hesitated and said, “Your, still There is a message I think you should know. The Morah’s gang has now changed the management organization, and the three patriarchs no longer have the privilege. The gems family passed the gold coins and construction materials provided by the Dwarf Council in the construction of Heim. They have to recover. Moreover, they have discovered the passage through the city under the wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked up and looked at it with amazement The dwarf Gerard asked, "Why are you telling me this? This is the internal affairs of your dwarf. Did you tell me that it is not a treason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The dwarf's beard was shaking, and he raised his eyes to look at Siegel, his eyes convinced. "Because this is correct. Although the old managers made mistakes and misinterpreted the meaning of the patron saint and caused losses, they are trying to remedy the situation, and the dwarves' groups can continue. But the new managers have no experience. Only impulsive minds and arrogant cognition. This is of no benefit to the dwarf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But they are still the leaders chosen by the dwarves." Siegel waved his hand and said, "Gerard, sit down, drink something. We have known each other. You have taken care of me and treated me fairly. I have always kept it in my heart. But I am not a dwarf. Why should I care about where the dwarf leader leads the dwarf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a lot of pain when I think about it, aren't you?" Siegel nodded and said to him gently: "Gerard, I feel the same. When I first started my adventure, I would think about it. So many things. My own life? The balance between gain and loss? I will challenge two trolls for a stranger who is almost dead. There is no backup, no retreat, no mature martial arts, only Self-expanding confidence and boiling blood. Luck is on my side, so I can think about it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel makes the servant come to the two The corner cup shields the river ale, holding a cup of himself, then took another cup and went to Gerard and handed it to him. "Drink, Gerard, toast - like a friend - then listen to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After living in the hands of the eater, I changed Is it sensible? No. When I heard that the army of the northern orcs was going south and invading the world of civilization, I thought I could save the world and become a hero in the story. Why not? My talent in magic at that time was already It is revealed that my swordsman can easily defeat my peers, and the combination of the two makes me unstoppable. I embarked on an unknown journey, I did not think about what to do, only know that I am going to do it, I will do it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought of Janet: "I have a good thing," he said. "I also encountered bad things. I won, I also failed, naked. I was thrown into the underground dark river of the city wall. After all kinds of adventures, I thought that I had become the hero of the victory in the story book, but I finally found myself to be the marionette of the fate of the prophet. I am not saying to be a puppet. It’s a failure, it doesn’t mean that. Even if it becomes a great mage, it has the power of destruction and creation. I am still a marionette: being held by responsibility, compassion, trust, love, and the heart that wants to be recognized and praised. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know how to get rid of these lines, I only need one idea to make these things that limit me into the dust of history, to liberate the most powerful The purest mage comes. But I don't want to do that, because I don't even regret it when I do it. My memory and my history have lost the value of aftertaste. Everything in the world is a relish for me. Good book. Become a simple alphabet, Alpha is the beginning of Omega and z is zer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that you have learned to think now, you want Let me help the dwarf of Mora. I am afraid that I have prepared many reasons to convince me along the way. I can think of it, I only need one thought to traverse your thoughts. But now I only have one request: sitting at you On the seat, listen well ! Say "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Siegel hold down Gerrard's shoulders, pressing him in the chair, then stood up. His eyes flashed: "I am a mage, I am a person. I am not a god who can always forgive and forgive." He stepped back and his height suddenly became amazing - at least the dwarf had this feeling - black The shadow tentacle waved on the wall behind Siegel. Gerard blinked and found it was just an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The trouble caused by the dwarf, why should I help, is it because I am the closest? You feel that your compatriots are pitiful, but who is my anger? Come to control?" Siegel clenched his fist, and the flame ejected from his fingers, with a devastating heat. "I understand the truth, knowing what is called the cold, knowing that you need to face reality and meet the future. Knowing that only solidarity can finally win - but this does not smooth my anger! You dwarfs have to mine and dig, A whole city wall is yours, but you have to dig a crystal wall system. I still want to conquer the world. Now I found that I failed. Even the saints who guarded the dwarfs got in, and then began to ask for help. Things are as simple as this? I want to say, I will let you die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what is best for me?" He held the hilt with his hand, pulled the dust out of the star and put it back, going back and forth. A squeaking noise. "I remember the location of the mineral deposits in the city wall. I have a strong elemental array and a transmission array. I should dig the dwarves when they are indifferent. I will mine the ore I need, build my weapons and army, and use your dwarves. Life is like a flesh-and-blood wall. When the local counterattacks and finally consume all the essence of the dwarves, I first ruin the Mora, let the world roof bury the wall channel, and then attack from other places they have not found. The dwarf as the death squad And the vanguard is the most beneficial plan for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to save the cost of war, I will use the magical array of Heim, through the body of your dwarf骷髅 骷髅 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵 僵&nbsp; "The real hero can only sing the winners who survived. The dwarves, as the initiators and victims of the war, will leave a reputation for eternal resentment in history. They are not self-reliant, irritating, self-destructive. It’s your footnotes in history books! When the elves violated the racial covenant and launched the war, the dwarves stood by and went on to carry out their own big plans. Well, I have plans now, I can close the border.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
