			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between the two people is going well, they stay together all day, and even a simple exchange of eyes will lead to laughter. Sometimes, two people hold hands and silently, without a word, and feel happy when they are passing. In this way, they went all the way north, passed two big rivers, left the grassland, and the terrain became uneven. Here, the gravel is everywhere, and the shallow ditch is horizontal and horizontal, and it is impossible to ride on horseback. Two people can only walk and walk towards the foot of the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are looking for a way into the mountains, which has become a very difficult thing. Because the city walls are difficult to climb, the entire castle defense line is connected by the roads that are constantly moving up and down the mountain. There will be villages at the foot of the mountain to grow food by themselves. However, in the north, the food is not enough to eat, so the people in the village will also work part-time miners, looking for valuable ore from the wall mountains, transporting them far away, selling them to the tribes on the grasslands, in exchange for livestock and rations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf's Mora's scorpion occupies the most essential part of the entire walled mountain range, but there are still many treasures hidden in the rest of the mountain. It is not easy to get gifts from these places, and it takes a long time to explore and excavate. For humans, their lives are too short and they are simply unable to withstand such a wait. So here are some employed dwarves who move around in the blank areas between the castles, marking minerals and looking for caves that can go underground. They recorded these in the management of books at the top of Mora, hiding the information of the treasures, and only the dwarves could read them. They only tell a small number of mineral deposits, minerals that are very common to dwarves, to human employers. Therefore, the lords here are far less wealthy than the compatriots in the south than the jazz of the starry kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to maintain the rule and security here, they have no choice but to continue to crush the civilians in the village or to plunder like the tribes on the prairie. So on the plank road of the Walled Mountains, most of the robbers are dressed by the Castle Guard. According to changes in living standards, they will plunder the caravans that pass the plank road. This has led to a vicious circle in the economy of the entire region, with higher and higher prices and less and less food. Only those castles with mineral deposits can survive and barely use mining to sustain their livelihoods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Janet passed through such a village, not even a decent name, but simply referred to as "the village at the foot of the mountain." The stream here is dry and the houses are worn out. Only some tobacco plants grow in the field. The old woman tried to shake her cockroaches at the well, and her voice shook her ears. Some children work in the newly burned ground, take out the stones in the soil, throw them aside, then dig some small pits, plant the wheat, and then pray that the winter snow will protect them, the spring sun will let They sprout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked around and found that there was no man here, except for the small one, there was no long sword, and the old one was thinner than the shield. The woman here is staring at Siegel and Janet. Compared to the strong horses, strong clothes, sophisticated equipment and full body, the people here are like living in a poor hell, but the most What makes Siegel feel uneasy is their eyes—there is no hope, no cravings, no embarrassment, only innumerable numbness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no threat from the orc, it may develop here, there are more arable land and merchants, not like now." Janet whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are their lords doing? Let their people starve to death?" Siegel felt sad, but could do nothing. He saw a house with a horse ring on the road leading to the mountain, and three thin horses were tied to the trough. One of the saddles also has a badge - the black sun emits red light - that is the owner of the Schlint family, the Black Blood Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's ask the knight here, inquire about the situation. At least determine the specific position." Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stopped the horse and did not see anyone coming out of it, so they could only do it themselves. A lot of chopped wood was piled up beside the horse's ring. A missing axe smashed on the stake and the handle of the axe was blackened. A large bundle of hay was scattered on the ground, and Siegel checked it. No thorny branches were found inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two pushed in and the hotel was empty Only one old woman cook stood behind the counter. The tables and chairs here are made of black wood, the same color as the walls here, and the color of everything here is the same. A small fire pit was dug in the middle of the house, which was burning gray charcoal. It was the smoke from this thing that dyed everything black. A tin pot is on the fire, and the mushroom broth inside is steamed with aroma. On the table next to it, several broken dishes were placed on a simple meal consisting of black bread, onions and eggs, and the amount was enough for three people to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to get in trouble, jazz lord." The woman saw Siegel's breastplate and weapons, and recognized Janet as his maid or mistress - sometimes there was no difference between the two, so the treacherous answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a jazz lord, I don't want to get into trouble, I just want to eat and drink." Siegel gave a good smile and said: " If you can tell me who the horses are outside and where they are going, I will thank you more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I dare not say, Jazz lord." The cook looked at the silver coin, swallowed a slobber, and said: "I only have some dog meat left here, dried, cooked into a soup, and the rest is only black bread and onions. Right, There is also a half bottle of cider, slightly sour, but it can quench your thirst."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing to eat here, just let it be." Janet persuaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. Dog meat is not necessary. Take some bread and onions. If you have carrots or cabbage, wash them together and take them." Siegel puts the silver coins Throw it to the store and wait patiently with Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, there was noisy noise and arrogant laughter, the sound of the bag and the cry of forgiveness. Siegel was worried and was about to stand up and see, Janet held his hand and said, "They will always come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The entrance to the hotel was kicked open and three men came in. One body is wearing a scale, and the shield behind it has a black sun sign. The person is about 5 feet tall and has a white big cock on the side of the nose, which looks funny and weird. The other two should be his attendants, wearing simple leather armor, one person is fat and tall, and the footsteps on the ground rumbling. The other medium-high, medium-sized, and looks are also ordinary. He has a chain of iron in his hand and a unkempt woman on the other end of the chain. It was the woman who kept asking for mercy, but was stumbling and stumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard, there are eggs and no chicken, think we are all idiots?" The tall fat man entered the hotel and immediately twisted a neck. The chicken was thrown to the cook and shouted: "Hurry up and pluck. Then the mushroom and dog meat are tired of eating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the dead chicken How about eating a live chicken before?" The ordinary guy looks like a swaying chain, his smile is strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Grand Duke gave a low drink: "Shut up, you two idiots." Then he had a whole mess of hair, and if nothing had covered the face's puffiness. "I didn't expect to encounter noble jazz lords here. Where do the two come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a jazz lord." Siegel blurted out Janet wants to stop it too late. "I want to ask how to go to the Black Blood Castle, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a jazz lord?" Look, stare at Siegel's armor, look at his age, guess his origins. When his eyes swept to Janet, the look there made the kitten feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inquire about what we do? Is it that you are a spy? Where is the armor on your body? It doesn't look like it fits, is it stolen? Snatched?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood up, he was taller and stronger than the big man. His hand was placed at the waist and his fingers tapped on the handle. Janet is hiding behind Siegel, and the dragon's dagger is in a position she can withdraw at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, want to fight against us three? But we won't fight with you." Daxie shook his head and shook his short fingers, saying: "This is the jurisdiction of the Black Blood Castle. Everyone is managed by the Viscount. Let me go now. First, hand over the weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dream Siegel replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big shrugged shoulders, an indifferent look: "This is your choice. I am a knight, and you dare to draw a knife in front of me? Kid, you are a civilian, you should bow your head and talk to me. Offend aristocrats, illegally possess weapons, and arrest, you can commit a lot of crimes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There is also espionage." The ordinary attendant quickly added: "He has to ask about the garrison everywhere, it must be the spy bought by the orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
