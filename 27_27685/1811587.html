"When do you want to end up like this, when can you end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The teacher frowned, as if thinking about complicated issues. He did not answer the words of the sacred sorcerer, but said that the lord gave the servant a task: "The fire is a little weak, and the firewood is added."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chanem squeaked his fist, but Siegel still looked at the fire with great concentration, using his fingers to swiftly pass over the top of the flame. Every time he does this, he can bring up some fine Mars. Mars can only exist for a short moment after leaving the flame, but in this short moment it can be transformed into a complex rune system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is even impossible for Chanem. He stood for a while, even though he knew that Siegel was taking the opportunity to learn the secrets of the gods, but he could do nothing. Some people have the ability to do the same thing when they get the same thing, but as long as their income is not affected, then he can only bear the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t like the heat from the fire and the flames, it will dispel the shadows and weaken their strength, but this is just an excuse. If Chanem really said this, it would definitely greet Siegel's ruthless ridicule: "The bonfire in the district affects the power of the king of stealth, then you are still weak!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Chanem can only go out of the cave, come over the canyon, and come to the woods. Because it is not too far from the village, the farmer has already cleaned up the dead branches for cooking, so there is not much harvest on the ground. However, this trouble obviously does not affect the sacred murder. He walked over to a tree and put his hand on it. However, in a matter of seconds, the whole tree will be lost, the water will be withered, the leaves will be dried up, and it will become a big firewood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the dagger and made a few strokes, and the whole tree became a firewood that was easy to burn. The shadow spread from his feet. Wrap all the firewood packs, just like the glue monsters swallow food. Chanem frowned, why did he feel the glue? Didn't the gods be stripped clean? After collecting the firewood with a shadow, he stopped to concentrate on checking his physical condition. After discovering nothing unusual, I came back to the cave with doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time at this time, he found that Siegel had changed to a place to sit, but still studying the fire. Chanem didn't know what it meant to change his seat. He just liberated the firewood from the shadows and then kicked the roots into the campfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no time in the cave, and day and night have no meaning here, especially for Siegel. He used various reasons: drinking water, firewood, game, and going to the toilet. Every time he spends Chanem’s expenses, he will oscillate time and space. Let yourself have more research time. And every time he oscillates time and space, he can steal a bit of power from the fire, strengthen his own legendary spell seeds, especially the seeds related to time. With the help of the fire, the regular patterns on his bones are becoming more and more abundant, and he is about to form a closed whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is time to borrow and need to return. After each shock and time, Siegel must leave the original position and sit aside to avoid being involved in slow time and space. in. Fortunately, Chanem is not willing to sit down with Siegel. Especially when it is a burning fire. The light and heat hurt him, but it is enough to make him feel bored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Siegel’s little tricks made Chanem feel. But he didn't know what to do. This is the difference between planning and prophecy. The former needs to know the conditions before it can be deduced, while the latter only pays attention to the final result. Siegel hides his actions in the light of the tropical straits, the bad attitude of Chanem's call and the progress of the research, and seizes this rare opportunity to enhance his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many people have such a rare opportunity to study the fire in close quarters? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not to mention whether the gods will take out their own fire, even if he wants to do so, it may not be able to do it. Most of the fires stay with God in the gods, even if the god war will be placed in the new God of the winner, how can mortals approach? Only when encountering a lazy and brainless god like the god of glue, will it depend on the crystal wall system, and even do not care about its own fire power is suppressed by the rule of the crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not the sacred person of murder. I am afraid that it will not be so simple to solve the god of clay. He didn't get the cave job he wanted, and he had to peel off the glue. This series of things has been completed. Siegel has the opportunity to observe the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look again, you can't help but swallow the fire into the belly, even if you know that he will burn you to death." Chanem's voice rang in his ear, and Siegel made a shock. "The power of God is a very powerful temptation for mortals. If you can't resist the attraction of the trigeminal flame now, then when you see the fourteen-fork flame of the god of magic, you will definitely lose yourself." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy One of the murderous god rarely sat down and crossed his legs at Siegel. Fortunately, he chose the direction that did not have time and space, so the secret of Siegel was maintained. "Is it very strange why I suddenly said this to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The teacher nodded. Chanem is not like someone who will follow the trick and teach the younger generation. He is more like a cold, ruthless blade, holding his throat and no mercy. There is no look of kindness in his eyes, only the exquisiteness of the scorpion hand clenching the beheading knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your mage makes a golem and a lamp god, and the god makes a saint. Do you know the difference between the two?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the secret of the gods, how can Siegel know? He looked at Chanem and waited for his following. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are natural gods, gods created by the day after tomorrow, but when they get the fire and the priesthood, they will be slowly changed, getting closer and closer to the priesthood. Ask. The Lord of the Morning will not deceive, the God of War will not seek peace. It is not that they do not have such ability, but that they have lost such a concept. The only god in the world that can avoid this situation is the creation god, they can still Have endless possibilities and normal emotions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After becoming a god, most of them will choose to live in the outer plane and create their own country of God. Maintaining the connection to the crystal wall of the main material plane while avoiding the oppression of the crystal wall. The outer plane also has a strong tendency to change the character of God. Moreover, the kingdom of God is absolutely with the will of the gods. Change, that is, the mind is going to happen, so the gods have no experience like mortals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, God will become more and more like a magic , or a lamp god that serves some kind of rule. God only Fire, no soul, this is not much different from the devil and the devil. All their experiences come from the prayers of the believers. So when shaping the saints, the gods will use the soul of a believer who used to be the core material, and then use The power of the rules squeezes out the outer shell. This composition is no different from the gods, but it lacks the fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the original memory and way of acting of the gods is completely When the fire of God and the kingdom of the kingdom are assimilated, he will become a fire again. Or, there is only a fire of the gods, and there is no god. At this time, others have the opportunity to use their own souls to hold the fire and open a new cycle. Geer, I am a saint, and it is no longer possible to return to a mortal, or to disappear, or to become a god. This is a matter of no choice, but you are different. If you have a fire for a long time, you will lose the most important soul of the mortal. Losing the ability to be plastic and change, being assimilated by rules. So, there is only one chance for what you want to do, and it is a short chance. After that, it is better to give up the godhead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at Chanem, the swaying light shining on the firm lines of his face, but never forever spreading the shadows in his eyes." . What he said is true. No word is deceiving. So Siegel nodded and remembered this matter in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chanem, should you tell me how to strip the power?" Siegel walked into the fire and swayed. Seeing this scene, Chanem’s eyes glowed with a smile on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Siegel, you can actually adjust your physical condition, so you won’t be hurt by the fire so soon. OK, I will tell you this. How to distinguish the relationship between the priesthood and the fire, and how to separate the fire. If you can learn my destruction and cutting power, do all things more confident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Destruction of cutting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of murder, the power of destruction. Not all gods can separate the fire alone, only master the death The power of the power is possible. I don't think you can learn, but if you can understand some of the principles and then cooperate with my actions, then the success rate will be higher."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK, I will study hard." Siegel touched his neck and touched the twenty-faced scorpion that the other person could not see. Others can't learn, it doesn't mean that the twentieth scorpion won't. The power of destroying and cutting is the god of murder. It is usually rare to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
