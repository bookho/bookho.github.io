			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most occasions, Siegel likes to sit in a quiet place, quietly observe, think, read emotions from other people's expressions. If you find a worried passenger or a sad walker, he will perform a trick for them to shake the whip, or jump around on the mast to make them happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Dwarf King’s meeting, he really wanted to have such a person to make himself happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formal meeting was held in the hall of the stone-free boat, which was originally a warehouse for storing low-alcoholic wines that would not cause a fire, such as brown ale or sweet Taste rum. It is now steaming and steaming, with aromas of roast meat and freshly baked bread. There is no fresh fruit in the center of the sea, but the dwarf still worked hard and put some dried fruit in front of the elf. They are trying to create a lively and harmonious atmosphere, and hope that this meeting will be filled with cup collisions and conversations as in the Dwarf Kingdom. The kings and leaders who came here did not have the interest to eat, nor the desire to talk to each other. They looked at the Dwarf King with all kinds of pupils, so the atmosphere in the hall became depressed and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William was sitting next to Siegel, he completed the test of the serial transmission array and rushed back a few days ago. The Federation’s magical spacecraft is flying straight to the unsinkable stone boat and is expected to arrive in a week. In addition, Ai Meng agreed to Evan's plan, she is now Siegel's sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only trouble is the surname of Siegel. The squid is obviously the surname of an orphan or an illegitimate child. It is only used by Siegel, and the cute squid can't marry the king. Therefore, Ai Meng's life needs a series of "falsification" movements, and the aristocratic genealogy data involved may be a thick book. So the matter of raising a relative could not be started immediately, so Evan took the general manager Salk into the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Mr. William got to Siegel’s ear, not for these things. "Do you know, I just made sure that the place where we are 30,000 meters below the foot is the weak point of the crystal wall. When I first investigated, there was a deviation. I went to the north to calculate fifty Riggs. You said that it is a coincidence that the dwarf is looking for this place. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's hard to say, but the possibility of coincidence is too low." Siegel lowered the volume: "You really can ensure that the northern part of the city wall Weak points will not be discovered?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There is no problem within five years. If you want to stick to ten years, you need to look at luck. I don’t expect to be able to take ten years. Above." William licked his teeth and made a groaning sound in his mouth. Frowning and staring at the Dwarf King: "You said that this short fat man wants to engage in a ghost, how can he still talk now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel does not do it either. understand. The Dwarf King "Bing Boxing" Stone sent everyone together and arranged enough food, but did not say anything about the goblin. Under his gray-white thick eyebrows, a pair of brown eyes kept glancing at the venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A horn blew from the deck, the dwarf's beard shook, and his face seemed to have a smile. The runes around the venue lit up and the space began to oscillate. Obviously someone is trying to come in using space transfer spells. Siegel grabbed the wand in one hand and the other hand in the sleeve and began to draw the magic mark. He glanced at William and the travel mages were the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bingquan stood up from his seat, then kneeled down on one knee and lowered his head humbly: "Welcome the dwarf saints to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a flash of red light like a flame in the furnace, the pale golden beard was hung on his face, and the dwarf saint wearing a golden body armor smiled and walked out. He threw the "World Forge" Warhammer to Stone and sat in the position of the former Dwarf King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission is still going on, and the elf is also elegantly getting up. In a silvery white moonlight. The Elf Saint, who wore the emerald breastplate, appeared again in front of Siegel. He nodded to the people around him and then sat down under the escort of the Elf King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan smashed Aurora, and Xiaosheng said to him: "Does the Lord of the Morning say that the Holy One is coming? Don't yell at me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sacrifice shook his head. He is a theft user. The power of the two gods is most evident. In his vision, the two groups of strong light are like the dazzling sun, making him blind. Everything else around you is vague and you can only see the faint outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon Siegel understood the meaning of the dragon. The dwarf saint went to the crowd. In a loud voice, "We dwarves have found a new world, just like the New World. There are more resources and space. Some of our gods mean to give this to the mortal believers. And we only do one testimony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other saints also nodded slightly, and condemned the words of the dwarf saints. But who is the current posture? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the Dwarf King stood up and began to introduce the situation of the Goblin World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Lord of the Morning is also coming to the Holy One and personally providing proof for the dwarf, the Star Kings will be very disappointed." Ruo La is nervous and sweating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, the Lord of the Morning is concerned with the expulsion of evil and the light of the light, and the direction of concern of the ethnic gods is not the same." The Great Lord sacrificed that Evan was also recently He gained the attention of the gods. For a long time before, he did not have actual beliefs. If you can make the king a devout morning god believer, it is more important for the temple than the goblin world. Aurora is excited and regards this as his most important task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think this thing seems to be a little bit directed at humans." Siegel said to William: "Fortunately, the current king is Evan. If it is Aaron's words." His body could not bear the pressure of the power of these saints, and he agreed to what he did not consciously. Now it seems that the dwarves, elves, and many races have already made decisions, leaving us humans. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William nodded and groaned in his throat. "I feel a little disgusting. I am going to talk to someone." He stood up straight and walked straight to Jinlong's side, sitting down. Jin Long glanced at him and handed him a roast chicken. The two men ate and chatted, and the king of the dwarf, who was eloquent, was aired to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dwarf is born to be a builder, and he has the power to forge the world, so he can discover this rare crystal wall. The current channel links to a planet, above There is only one kind of intelligent creature, that is the goblin. In order to facilitate everyone's name, I propose to call the opposite side the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel almost couldn't help but turn his eyes : Dwarf, how much do you like to write a world manual! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goblin on the earth has developed advanced weapon technology that can cause great damage to heavy infantry." The dwarf singer began to introduce the goblin Weapons and tactics, also took out a few real objects for everyone to observe. In the months when the goblin was defeated, the dwarves mobilized the best craftsmen, and they were able to copy the weapons of the goblin, which would offset the opponent's advantage. However, the goblin also has a self-wheeling car magician that can move quickly. Their explosive fireballs are also very threatening. This requires the help of the Masters Association, or the Elf Art Institute tries to crack it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The final decision is not a weapon, but a god." The dwarf king said: "We know that there are many beliefs on earth, but there is no true God. The existence, even the simplest gods, no one can display, let alone the saints. Their gods are only false idols, and they have no casters, whether they are wizards or druid spells. No, it makes them very vulnerable. And the goblins can never be united internally. They fight each other far more than the possibility of uniting against the enemy. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to gain a stable, non-threatening new survival territory. It’s very important for all races!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no saying that the current world is about to be destroyed. Siegel looked at the performance of the Dwarf King and exchanged his views with William. The saints did not speak, but their meaning was very clear: now this big ship is about to sink, who is willing to find a way? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I personally don't like the goblin, but the death of the goblins will make me happy. The Masters Association is willing to cooperate with all races to provide the best possible help." The voice of the Necromancer is like a voice coming from the grave, with a gloomy and vibrato: "At the same time - dear participants - the Masters Association is still the same as in the past, with the attitude of the starry kingdom as the priority First, listen to the arrangements of His Majesty the King."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth, many organizations' leaders have expressed their views, and they are close to their own race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning the country’s affairs into a racial nature is not good for humanity. The saints looked at the human beings with dignity, but except for Evan, other humans could not withstand this pressure and surrendered in the depths of the soul. The representatives of the islanders from the eastern archipelago of the Old World were trying to stand up and talk, and they were crushed by Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
