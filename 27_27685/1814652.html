			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that it is wrong to try to solve your idea as soon as possible. The gap between you and me is not as big as you think." Lear dissipated The smoke came out of the explosion area unscathed. The stick of the sorcerer in his hand glowed slightly, but only the color could not identify what the spell was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled a little and didn’t answer. He still maintains very cautious optimism, but he can't easily waste his physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not as good at mobilizing the total amount of magical energy." Lear said: "I am better than you in the technique of using spells, but Your progress is also very obvious. If you didn't try to be opportunistic, you wouldn't give the three guys a chance to intervene. I didn't expect that an ordinary squat would affect the balance of the whole game."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. The fingers hidden under the sleeves flicked, swaying the energy of the magic like a string, and impacting Lear's defensive array with a subtle but large variety of spell structures to test his protective spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leer is doing the same thing, except that his temptation comes from the magic ripples that are cast with the language. If you can find the key nodes of the defense system, you can use the element impact to create loopholes, and when you remove the protection, you can do more with less. After all, the spell on which spell will form a completely different system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times, dismantling magic protection is much more troublesome than thieves unraveling traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to be a magical god? I don't think it is a matter of negotiation." Lear said with a confident smile: "As long as you take you Give me the scorpion, and I will send the fire to me. Use knowledge to change strength and use power to protect knowledge. This is the fairest and most reasonable transaction in the world. I made a choice many years ago, and now I can do the same. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have given up the fire, it is not yours, you can't talk about trading it to me." Siegel worked hard for a long time, too Failed to find out the vulnerability of the Lear defense. It was like a perfect eggshell with roundness and no cracks. Siegel pulled out a similar thing from the pocket, and the fingertips ran up the elemental polymer. Then he looked at Lear and said, "Do you think that the fire is my purpose? It is just a means. As long as you The threat is gone, the world can be clean, and the fire is not important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to say that you are too naive. Even if I am not there, There will be other people who are coveted by your nephew. The things left by the creation god are extremely rare in the multiverse. Without the gods of us, the power of the outside world has long imprisoned you like pigs and sheep. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not a jailer, but more greedy than other jailers. You gave up the duties of the guards, just to be able to get the same as our prisoners. The identity is good enough to snatch something that doesn't belong to you.” Siegel puts the flame formed by the elemental polymer into the furnace, carefully guards it with a spell, and waits for a stable burning flame, then fill it in a piece. magic Stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;霎Time, the rich elemental power fills the space, combined with the powerful elements of the School of Magic. The four elements seem to be waking up soon, either elemental monsters or activation spells. From the flowing air, it seems that the element is comfortable and the whole space is recovering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the secret nuclear? Why is it so small?" Lear was very surprised. In his impression, the secret nuclear core also needs to have dozens of tons of weight, hard and heavy structure and hard to destroy. The little thing in front of me is very similar to the kind of small stove that is warm in my arms. The material looks very ordinary, how can I withstand such a violent material quenching reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? The lamp god sent me a message. If I hand this stove to the college, I can get 3 million points. It seems that in the multiverse, the secret nuclear is also very rare!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you are a guy who has no knowledge!" Cried. “Infinite energy represents an infinite future. All the worlds will use the secret technology of the secret as the coveted top technology. The secrets I have ever heard are the secret of a giant stable half-plane. The area and belongings are more than the entire wall of the entire wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyes sighed with a questioning tone: “You should take this The news tells me that if I know, I will reach a deal. The half-face is enough for the people of the world to emigrate, and there is no need to go to the goblin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first and foremost condition is to change a trader." Siegel loosened the Urmon nuclear lifting furnace, which flew around the owner like Ironstone. The power of the furnace manufacturing elements is far less powerful than that of large energy cores. If you want to supply Sigel with all your strength, you can't leave too far. The original design was put in the arms or hung on the waist, but Ain Stone gave Siegel a great inspiration, so it became what it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leer, I can't believe you, I can't believe you. It's nothing to do with the transaction, and it doesn't matter the price. The key is to trade with you. You It is a very persistent researcher, but also a very extreme person. To study, you can give up everything, not just everything about yourself, but also everything else. In your field of concern, your greed is endless. Your control desires like wildfires will burn everything out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say a thousand 10,000, since you don't give me, I Take it!” Lehr said: “The multiverse is so cold. If you don’t fight, you will be taken away by others. If you don’t lead, you will be eliminated by others!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What is the difference between you and the dualism of one or the other, how similar are you to the goblin?" Siegel shook his head: "Although the rigid knight's creed can make people stupid, but there is no bottom line. In order to make God fall, I am not the king of the gods, I have no responsibility to teach you. I can only be against the robbers. Sentence: rob you have the ability to try "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Ler the Grand Master of the stick stuck in the ground, his hands clapping?!. "Say well, Siegel, this is the young mage leader I admire! You are perfect in all aspects, but your experience and knowledge accumulation is too inadequate. You think you are a heroic knight, I am a villain Big Devil, then do you know the commonality of the villain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have more words?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There are many people." Lear's expression suddenly became very embarrassing. He slammed the rod of the sorcerer, and the scepter with a glare slammed into the ground, and it made a roaring sound. The whole square trembled, and the light and shadow seemed to burst like bubbles. When Siegel looks at it, there are magic towers and nine room entrances around, which is clearly the magical beast of the sixth floor of the Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of 30,000 kinds of magical creatures, each ranging from two to ten. You are already very skilled in one-on-one wizards, do not know the face How is the army and the horses?” Lear’s figure gradually became transparent and disappeared from the current dimension. "I will go to see the sacred murderer and wish you a good time here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant World of Warcraft is like a flood of water, and the power is overwhelming. The last time Siegel insisted on it for a few minutes, he had to flee, but now he looks up, where is the spiral staircase? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky flies, swims in the water, runs on the ground, and drills under the soil. Considering that many World of Warcraft have the ability to transmit spells remotely, it is the most dangerous when the terrain is on the shore. The ground is second and the air is again, but the underground is safer. But by hiding alone, you can't escape forever. Siegel is not like the first hibernation, the later sleep, and the corpse in a grave becomes eternal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the last time he came in, he attracted a lot of Warcraft to the vicinity of the entrance, and now they are running towards themselves in the distance. This is an important message, at least I know the general direction of going back to the fifth floor. At the same time, as the location where Lear sent himself, the space barrier of the magic tower in this position must be different from other places. There are special rules. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain why it can be passed through the stairs. here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked up and saw that the sky was not unusual, but he had a feeling that the stairs to the seventh floor should be near this location. Lear's pursuit of results is naturally very efficient, so this location is very likely to store the secrets of going upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beasts have to run for a while, and the fastest flight after about five minutes is coming. Siegel can of course start moving, use the speed to lengthen the team of magic beasts, and then slowly solve them, but this may be in the middle of Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a large number of enemies, is there really no way? Siegel is not here for the first time. He will definitely be prepared to know the situation. If Anna is not dead, she will tell Lear, "Siegel has long had the authority and experience of the upper level!" The current situation is that although Lear is familiar at home, he knows nothing about the latest changes in the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out more than 30 runes from his pocket, with a thin line depicting a smile. Nexus's micro-engraving plasma technology, the dwarf's rune matrix and the union's tranquility matrix are combined with each other, and with the help of a part of the sacred sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
