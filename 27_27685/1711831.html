			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one told me that there is a woman among you." Siegel gnashed his teeth and glared at the three people who were still awake: "My gold coins It may not be enough. What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have been pretending to be very good, no one has seen that she is a woman." Assassin Tim stretched out his wrist. , 镣铐 still wrapped around. He said to Siegel: "Help me out, I will save her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you dedicated to pasting me?" Knock Tim's hand and push him back. "Give me shut up! I can try to save her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price has already shouted to 1400, the auctioneer is on the platform. Dance and dance, using the inferior language to provoke the mood of the bidder. Siegel squeezed the excited half-orc and walked toward the front of the stage. When Tim saw that he was no longer observing himself, he lowered his head and tried to unlock it with the wire hidden in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Accountant" kicked him from behind and said, "Don’t mess up again. If you didn’t hit the auctioneer with a wooden knife, how could there be so much? Trouble.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is this still my fault?” Tim is still not convinced: “The auctioneer keeps touching my lower body, and it’s me if I’m not strangled. Very restrained. It is a stupid idea to pretend to be a slave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it is indeed a stupid idea." The alchemist bit his lip, in my heart Constant calculations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price is stagnant around 1,800 gold coins, which is more than three times that of a normal female slave, and the average archer doubles. Buyers who are mixed in the market have already separated their classes. Only the generals of the generals, their agents are still bidding, and others are just more busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel squeezed into the front desk and stared at the auctioneer. The current price has exceeded the balance of the gold coins in Siegel, he must use other items to bear the price. But this must go through the auctioneer to meet the rules, but the half-orcs simply ignore it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1,900 gold coins." Red-eyed general Ruger, the orc who wore a yellow short cloak, raised his hand and said the price. This time no one can shout and add one more, because the body of the female orc who did the last thing is still lying in the dirt not far away. As for who killed her, no one cares. Everyone only knows that Ruger’s wallet has become more bloated, and it’s enough to have enough money to spend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One thousand and nine hundred gold coins, is there a higher one?" The auctioneer spit out and was more excited than anyone. A one-eyed old man is nothing but a personal slave. What is it? I thought that letting a beast with a nose without three cents of gold coins would make me obedient. Did he suffer from it now? If I gave me five hundred gold coins early, I would let all five transactions succeed, and the auctioneer would think in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, the deal!" The auctioneer deliberately ignored the one-eyed man's gaze and pushed the female shooter to the red-eyed general. The orc laughed, but did not directly touch it, but threw a rag and covered it on the shooter. Siegel’s eyes lit up and he rushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This adult, please stay." Siegel blocked in front of the yellow cloak and pointed the female shooter with his hand and said quickly: "I want this." Slave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc stunned, then violently thundered, and took out the long knife around his waist and squatted. Siegel expected that when the orcs would not agree with each other, they would start to prepare. He traversed two steps to the right, and the dragon's tooth was held in the palm of his hand, then his arm slammed. Only heard a crisp sound, the dagger was nailed to the long knife, and the blade was drilled into a hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel slammed the long knife with the other palm and smashed the weapon into two segments along the crack of the blade. Before the yellow cape orc rushed to the encirclement, he raised his dagger and shouted: "This is the weapon I used to exchange, the dragon tooth dagger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; In the orc society, only the value of weapons is above everything else. A good weapon can be exchanged for power, status, wealth, and women. The Orc General waved his hand, letting his hand stop moving, and then carefully looked at the dagger. In the brief confrontation just now, he did not feel that there was tremendous force to be uploaded from the blade. This shows that the dagger itself is sharp enough to destroy the metal structure of the long knife, which is a complete crushing of materials or manufacturing processes. He can be sure that this is not a special combat skill, only the performance of the weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Kabu will like this woman." Siegel said: "He once recited a need for a good archery. This woman is also good, as long as it is well trained, it will come in handy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your dagger gave me a jealousy." General Ruger reached out and asked for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, and if he passed the dagger, he would never return. "If you agree to this transaction, the dagger will naturally be available, but it will not work until then."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I don't look at your dagger, how do you know the quality of the goods?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How the female shooter's skill is unknown, so the deal is still fair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Why didn’t you just use the dagger to bid directly, but come to me after the end?” General Ruger frowned and said, “Do you think I am more easily confused?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "General Kab, like you, works for the three-eyed adult. He has stood on the side of the three-eyed adult before the hammer is dead." Siegel retells the history that Fitzak told him: "This shows your The vision is better than others, and only with such vision can you understand the preciousness of this dagger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Ruger squeezed his chin and looked away The dagger and the female slave swept back and forth. He reached out and pulled off the cloth on the female shooter, and once again let her stand naked in front of everyone, and then observed the "one-eyed old man" look. Siegel hides the sympathy in his own eyes, deliberately puts on a look of color, staring at the woman who can't stop looking up and down, and deceives the red-eyed general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dagger is discounted at a maximum of 1,500 gold coins." General Ruger said: "More is not appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really a bargaining expert." In order to prevent extra-budgets, Siegel nodded and promised: "I will give you the dagger, and then give you five hundred gold coins. How do you see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc nodded: "Say me to General Kabu." Then he pushed the female slave into the arms of Siegel and left the auction with a dagger. His followers kept up, one of them holding the white gold coins paid by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction is still going on, but Siegel is no longer in the mood to stay. He hired a car and threw five people and a dog in the carriage and brought it back to the grocery store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After closing the door, he untied the crowd, found clothes for the girl, and then woke up with Count Maxim with water. The nobleman apparently worried about a punch in his stomach and did not give Siegel a good look at all. He arranged his own tasks and completely left Siegel aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Eric, you list the pharmacy, let's finish the rest of the work as soon as possible. Gerber, you are responsible for finding the raw materials, and in the alchemy When you get a hand, Tim, you and I go to the houseboat to see if our wood has arrived at the warehouse and then go to the harbor to find a boat. Mana, you are responsible for protecting the alchemist."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female shooter nodded and turned his eyes to Siegel. Her face was red, and some embarrassed said: "Excuse me, do you have a longbow here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Siegel first answered The woman’s problem, then took out a few long-prepared belts and hoops from the shelves and slammed into the Earl of Maxim. "If you don't have a slave collar, no one can leave the grocery store. This is not the deep water city, but the orc's fortress, Makarbu, where you have to listen to Fazak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Instinct, figure out, I am the commander of action." The count was straight, and looked at Siegel in a condescending manner. "We just enter the city by dressing up the slaves, it doesn't mean we are slaves. Put your iron collars away, you don't have to direct us how to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In this city, you either have a brand on your face or you need an iron collar on your neck, otherwise you will be noticed by the patrol when you leave the port and the brothel. The inspection here is much stricter than that of Deepwater, so take your head. Listen to me a persuasion: Bring the collar together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collar is iron, with a layer of tin on it and a card in dwarf language The name of General Bu. Behind the collar is a belt that can be strapped. After wearing it, it can be passed over with red rivets, then tightened, and then cooled down. According to the orc's thoughts, efforts only to cut the belt to solve the slave collar, so once the slave found that the order is not a collar, or see the belt is damaged, you can directly kill, no reason at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
