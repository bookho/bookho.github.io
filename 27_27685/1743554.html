Siegel said: "Heim is now doing a lot of things, and I still To continue learning spells and spells... Elinte, tell me the truth, is there something happening?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf screams twice, it is impossible to check Nodded. Siegel knew that the old dwarf must have something to say, so he sent Moore and took Elinte to a secluded place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know me, if you have any trouble, I will help you." Siegel said: "You are not only my friend." , or my teacher. I have the opportunity to become a mage, and the lord is because of your help, I will not forget this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 , , 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉 揉揉The leader, Locke Diamond, originally planned to settle here for you, avoiding the sight of other dwarves, but the situation has changed. I don’t know who is in it, let these dwarves think they are exiled and expel the dwarf forever. In the territory, even the names of the clan should be erased. These are good explanations. They finally understand that this is exploited by people, but it is difficult to make up for the barriers. To put it bluntly, they do not trust you and think that you are just a human guard. It's him "The jailer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is not being treated as a member of the dwarf?" Siegel said, "I climbed up and became a brave man." That day should have this right. Isn't many people seeing it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Does not include them.” Irene felt very embarrassed, after all denied There is no difference between facts and lying, and this kind of thing happens to the dwarf and makes him feel ashamed. "This is just an introduction. Their real purpose is to return to their respective families. The nine speakers of our three families believe that there are other families of dwarves who want to continue to promote the West. They are all well-informed, no. "Cool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarf temple will not sit idly by, which directly violates the gods? Isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The god said that the dwarves of Mora's shackles are not allowed to go west. But if a family is separated from the Mora priest?" Irene sighed and said: "Other families want Gaining a higher voice at the top of Mora, contrary to the vows when I first came to Mora, but if I saw that my attempt was not fulfilled, I went out alone. They were stunned and stunned. We will make such a crazy plan. We will never allow the Mola to split, only the united dwarves can stand on the heels in the New World!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you decide What should I do?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the worst case, the Mora will seal the gate to the west. So no one can reach the west of the Wall Mountain Range, at least the way to turn over the wall No," Elinte said. "Our gem family doesn't want to see such a situation. It is now being coordinated. But if you climb the road in front of everyone, they can't find any reason for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. "I understand, at least I can hold these people for a while. Let you find behind the scenes of spreading rumors and divorced dwarves." Black hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Elinte said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will climb again." Siegel immediately agreed. "If you say it, I have not climbed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord will once again challenge the path of ensignment, which makes the half-orcs such as Zucker very excited, and even some of them are eager to try. However, the road to the road does not allow the orcs, giants, and goblin blood to try the race. The lightning warhammer of the dwarf god will unscrupulously smash these smashers into powder. In order to avoid misunderstanding with Mora, Siegel will go with the dwarf Elin, leaving others to protect the Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet as the future hostess of the Territory must stay in place of Siegel to handle all matters. Although she understands this responsibility, she is obviously not happy. As the walls of the castle are built higher and higher. Janet only felt that the distance between herself and Siegel was getting farther away. After a person has multiple identities such as a mage, a jazz, and a lord, does the space that is the fiancé occupy less space? She saw young lords spend more time experimenting with magic, practicing spells, or dealing with territorial affairs, and only when they were eating could they get along with each other. On a cold night, Siegel slept alone in a study filled with scrolls and notes, and Janet slumbered in another tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a torment made her awake all night, and her inner contradictions made her often squat in the carpeted camp. On the one hand, she wants to indulge herself and completely devote herself to the arms of Siegel, but on the other hand she still has fear. I am afraid that my impulse will destroy the hard-won situation. It can be said that every night that Heim is leading is a great test for her. She prayed to the Mother of the Earth, hoping to get guidance, but the "mysterious lady" in charge of love, and she did not pay attention to the confused cat on the ground with hands clasped together. When Siegel left, this torture was even stronger, and loneliness followed Janet as a curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of lack of sleep. Recently, she always feels awkward, often can't hear what other people have said, and many things she does are hard to remember. However, she knows that she can already help the sleeping prescription, and the effect is strong and certain. She configured a dose of this potion and checked the dose again and again. After all, a drop of this kind of thing can help a night of sleep, ten drops is a permanent sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally got a good night's sleep, and the next day she felt that she was much better and could clearly feel the respect and love of the people around her. However, Fitzk is always mysterious, and he chooses to avoid it when he sees himself several times. Janet thought of this matter, thinking, changing from the lady of the lord to the senior spy kitten, secretly keeping up with the one-eyed dad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This castle was designed with Zane's advice in mind, so it is very unfriendly to spies and spies. The kittens are glad that the castle has not yet been completed, and the craftsmen who saw themselves thought they were walking, and there was no sneak tracking. Janet wanted to hear about Fitzk's secret. The original one-eyed old man got the secret of Siegel and began to prepare for the wedding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the whole thing should be kept secret to Janet. Be sure to make a surprise look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitten was satisfied and forced to return to his tent with a smile. Suddenly, she felt that everything was getting better, and Siegel did not forget the promises of the two. The plan of the lord, the castle, and the wedding did not change. Everything seems to have a new meaning: all of Siegel’s busyness is to get married soon, so there will be earth elements working on the site all night, and the gold coins in the vault will be spent like water. material. Even Siegel’s road to climb the road has been explained. He is here to maintain and strengthen the relationship with the dwarves. If it weren't for the dwarf and the craftsmen, what time would the castle be built in what year? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I figured out this, she took off her light close-fitting clothes and was ready to change back to a warm long dress - a dress that the lord's wife should have. She also wants to simplify her makeup so that she can look younger and more beautiful. Janet is proficient in makeup and easy-to-wear, dressing up completely, even when she picks up the mirror, still thinking, if Siegel let her change her face to please herself, should she agree? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not her current face in the mirror, but a pair of gray and red mixed dry faces. There is no muscle under the almost transparent skin. As if it is tightly attached to the skull, it will disappear at any time. The two empty, godless eyes are much smaller than the eyelids, and they are swaying in the wind, seemingly falling. The dry lips are small and flat, wrapped in teeth that are not reflected in the stone. If someone says that this is a descendant of a gargoyle, Janet 80% will nod and say yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror fell to the ground and smashed, and Janet quickly stroked her face to make sure it was the horrible look. She can still feel the smooth and smooth skin, the full lips and the long, curved eyelashes on the eyes. Just as she comforted herself that it was just a possible side effect of sleeping pills, she saw her left arm re-turned into a red claw. Lost control of it, slammed his throat. All her shouts were suppressed in the scorpion, except for the slight "squeaky, squeaky" sound, and there was no sound at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet is running wild. I want to get out of the tent and ask for help from outsiders. The dwarf runes are on the construction site not far away, they will save me. But her thoughts just appeared, and she found that her legs were tripped by the tail, and she fell on a soft and thick carpet with only one step. She saw that her tail was no longer a smooth, oily black tail, but was covered with scales and joints. A long tail with a barb like a scorpion. Janet only felt that breathing was getting harder and harder, and with her right hand, she couldn’t pull the left hand of her throat anyway. The terrible claws are not relaxed, keeping Janet's trachea and blood vessels in their hands, and using the tail behind them to extinguish all hopes of trying to save themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness came up, but Janet’s eyes were blood red. "Death, death, death," there is a constant voice in her ears; "death, death, death," as numerous bells echoed in my mind. Her arms and scorpion tails only wanted to kill the nearest creature, and only Janet was alone in the lonely tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
