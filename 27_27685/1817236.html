But they have an ability that others don't have, that is, the linkage of thinking and the absolute mutual fit, the perfect division of labor can control the spell. So when the clones cooperate with the spell and then communicate the magical powers of the magical power pool, then the magical ability they can play is no less than the * division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t care about the threat of death, they don’t have the heart to win, they only have one idea, the command issued by the main brain: dragging Evan, no Let him leave here. At the same time, Siegel cut off the connection that the deputy brain initiated to him, and handed over the control, so that he could completely separate himself from the battlefield and concentrate on doing his own thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan can break every spell and even catch an opportunity to hurt one or two clones. However, the clones quickly learned to advance and retreat together, turning into an infinitely flexible big net, and firmly traping Evan. Maybe you can really get 10,000 spells out of a sword, but at least try 10,000 spells first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the opportunity to get out and came to Moore and Nata. "Mor, I need you to do one thing." Siegel looked back at the battle between Clone and Evan and said, "I want you to dress up as Evan and go back to the venue. You don't need to say anything." , what to do, just need to appear there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They won't see it?" Moore knew it was a silly question. If the magic god's spells are easily seen through, it becomes a joke. So he changed a question: "Do you need to directly advance the motion to retain the New World?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you can't say anything." Then he cast a spell, converted Moore into Avon, and threw it back into the city of Mith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nata, if there is an accident, it will block Evan anyway. I need time to stabilize the situation in the world of the wall." Sit down and kneel and connect your consciousness to the portal of the Thunder Wall World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can close these doors at once, but that would be equivalent to isolating the monsters that were thrown out from the rescued soldiers. Moreover, with these portals, he can also oscillate the elements and pass on their own spells. So almost all the people in the world of the thunder wall, especially those closer to the portal, all had the voice of Siegel in their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People in the world of thunder walls, I am the god of magic and knowledge, the last god and guardian of the world, the manufacturer and manager of the portal. Now I met the attack of the outside god. The damage and disaster spread with the portal, and this was originally intended to be saved. I need your strength, I need your faith, I need you to pray to me, read me. The name, and salvation will follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage is repeated, and even the alien creatures that are raging everywhere are heard. Some clever guys perceive the power of the gods, and their companions begin to retreat and save their lives. However, more monsters can't connect this sound with what will happen later, and they will continue to destroy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representatives of the various races in the venue naturally heard this voice and immediately shouted: "What is going on here, why are you so much ahead?" They turned their eyes to "Evan", the star king left the venue to find the magic god, this is something everyone knows. Evan or Moore remembers Siegel’s words, sitting in a chair and saying nothing, just a "mysterious smile" hanging from the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the trapped beast of Evan, and his mood was very complicated. On the one hand, if it wasn't for Evan to cut a part of the fire, he couldn't grasp the priesthood so quickly. There are only three forks left, and the fire that has been unable to maintain its integrity is frightened, and only seek to be attached as soon as possible. Together with the power of Siegel itself, the two together, Siegel officially promoted to the god of magic and knowledge. The increased power in the future does not require the cloning of the parasitic brain to share, and Siegel's own body can be fully withstand, and there will be no instability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Evan became like this and gave him a big warning. The reason why gods become inhuman, is largely related to the fire of God, and they must continue to be careful and vigilant, constantly comparing with their own self, to find changes in personality and mood. Since the life of God is infinite, the struggle with the fire will continue forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future will be said later, he has heard the prayers everywhere, and the power of faith has increased. It is certainly not possible to live up to the "believers" at this time, so he immediately contacted Isaac in the city of Mith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isac, lead the Magic Corps, cooperate with the Xingsuo to help the problematic portal. I will tell you where and how the monsters appear, and you will quickly strike. Let the Secret City Chamber of Commerce allocate disaster relief items and send them. The door system starts to be launched. Don't fight in the battlefield, leave the enemy and leave, because the battle will be very frequent, and the quickest decision is the most important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will let the pastor Ryder will help you, as well as the paladins of the Magic Temple. If there is a problem with the command, you can always ask Mana. For spells, Wendy should be enough to protect you. This time, you have to show the image of the strong to the world. Let them build confidence to meet the challenges of the new world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that the son has understood all the information, Siegel sits cross-legged and concentrates on digesting Growing power. If there are so many people to help, Isaac still can't do well, then there is no good way. I can't always get everything done by myself, even if he is a god, he is too busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a hundred clones have died under Evan’s sword, and this number is increasing. The fighting power of a long sword in Evan's hands is surprising, but it has no effect on the situation. He is killing 10,000 clones, and what can he change? Evan tried several times to try to smash the power of the body through the clones, just as he did for several saints who assassinated him. But Siegel used the obsidian dagger to suppress the division of the fire, and did not give Evan any chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps he should be a free-spirited swordsman, not bound by the king, with his talents may have reached the peak of the hundred-faced scorpion. Siegel himself is also better at being a magician than a lord. Hem’s trivial things are all left to others to worry about. He only needs to come up with something advanced enough to make Heim’s motivation full of development. Yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think from the perspective of Xunzi, the pursuit of the peak, then it must be more pure. The twentieth scorpion at least represents savvy and learning, and finally it can be more colorful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the current Evan, he could not help but think of Lion King Alexander. Whether it is influenced by the control of the mind, or from the undead, or from the fire, the human soul is always a fragile thing. When it is affected by good influence, people will be good; when they receive bad influence, the speed of falling will not be slow. This is different from dwarves and elves, and it is quite different from dragons. Although it will be more energetic, it is also easier to embark on the path of self-destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easier to sway beasts and goblins than humans, and the lessons of the goblin self-destruction are in front of you. Of course, there are also the contributions of human masters, but even without Lear's shot, the outcome of the goblin is almost doomed, and a sooner or later comprehensive war will completely erase their development for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is the ending of mankind doomed? Siegel looked at Evan and was filled with worries. Even if it is half-way, everyone settles in the New World, can things end? Perhaps for a generation or two, even for ten generations of human beings, the current situation is stable enough, but for his undead god, I am afraid it has just begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-plane is closed after all, and sooner or later there will be a depletion day. This depletion is not only a solution to the problem of resources, but many of the crystal walls have a large number of resources that no one uses, and some are enough to use half a plane. What Siegel is worried about is the exhaustion of the soul. Those who are in a closed state will eventually fight inside, just like the goblins, and eventually destroy themselves. The only way is to go out and continue to progress in development, absorb good things, and fight bad things. Some radical elves say that humans are just a disease that infects nature. Maybe they are right, but the disease can also be used in good places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s fire is getting stronger and stronger, and soon surpasses the original level, after which the rate of growth has dropped. The army led by Heim attacked everywhere and, under the guidance of Siegel, went straight to those dangerous areas. The magical spacecraft's electromagnetic gun, the elemental rune guards and the magical knights equipped with the fifty-sixth submachine gun were invincible. The creatures from the outer domain did not expect to be counterattacked at such a level, and they were almost killed by a face-to-face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some clever ones have long since ran, others have hid, and Siegel is not worried about them. After the restoration of divine power, the portal system has stabilized and is even more handy than before. This time there will be no more monsters, and only the various relief supplies marked with the Temple of the Magic will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reversely, the kingdom of stars, because there is no command of His Highness Evan, the action is much slower than the Heim. For the rescue problem, the Imperial Parliament is still in dispute. They issued orders to fight demons, and several magical spaceships belonging to the royal family began to move. But they don't have the guidance of the magic god, they are not sure where the enemy is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
