			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never talked to the pastor about ideals, too far, too big, too vain. WwW.XsHuotXT.com" Siegel picked up the knife and fork with leather gloves Put a fried fish in the dish in front of you, dig the mashed potatoes and tear a piece of bread. He gently sprinkled salt on the food, just like making an art "I just like what I can see before I see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The reality is cruel but real," said Dorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I agree with this sentence." Siegel put down the tableware and gently applauded. "I won't be a believer in the god of murder, so you can save your effort by Pastor Dorn. Let Lily stay with me tonight and leave her a sweet memory. How good?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is probably not possible. Lily is my wife's sister, and I have the obligation to take care of her." Dorn said: "Every unity is a brother and sister. We strive to survive in this cruel and real reality. Only when we unite can we have a way to live. Although we are poor, we support each other spiritually and do not need your money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you always need something, otherwise you won't come to me." Siegel ate a piece of fried fish and rushed down with sweet wine. "This meal is really good, don't you come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorn smiled and shook his head. "Jie, you are a person with a goal. It happens to me too. Why don't we share the two and see if the goals are the same?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, how is this? Maybe?” Siegel, while imitating the mercenaries he had seen in the Mariner’s Bar, watched Dorn’s look. The priest of this murder god is always very calm, and his body is almost motionless when he speaks, and his expression is almost unchanged. It is difficult to distinguish between true and false without comparison, so Siegel does not know which sentence he is true is false. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your purpose is related to the temple of the murder god, and I am one of them. So no matter what you say or not, I will eventually know "Dorn puts his hands on the table and is very confident:" Regis said that you have good swordsmanship and powerful spell power. I didn't believe there would be such people. Appeared, but now I see you and feel the energy of the element on your body. I can't help but believe it. If you are an enemy, you are a dangerous enemy. Whether it is for the temple or the Solidarity, I have an obligation to ask one. Fan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I originally wanted to go directly to the Duke Let him send a soldier to drive you out of the town. Your ability is no longer strong and you can't openly confront the lord. Or I can let the brothers and sisters of the Solidarity not to entertain you. You can't find food, water and cover in Kaibu. No wind and rain tiles will provide you with information and help. Both of these practices are unfair, and fairness is the first step in order. So I arrange to meet like this and want to know your true purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It sounds a lot like it.” Siegel said: “The assassin of the murder god attacked the Elven Forest a long time ago. It killed a lot of elves. Not long ago, the Helm leader led the adults to investigate and said Kaibu Town. It was a stronghold of the murder god. I didn't believe it at first, but I didn't expect it to be the same thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel. The squid is a very A powerful mage, his ability is limitless.” Dorn said with a smile, and observed the expression of “Jie”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His wallet is what I care about." The mouth swallowed the mashed potatoes and made a greedy look. "I will bring back the news I have seen so far, and I will get seven hundred gold coins. If I can know the situation of the base under Shaq Manor, I will have seven hundred gold coins. I will not give up this thousand and four hundred gold cute little things. In particular, the gold coins of Heim’s collar are good, unlike the fake money of other southern lords.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“1,400 gold coins. Great money, It’s worth working hard.” Dorn nodded. “You are sure you can figure out the situation at Shaq Manor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s better to tell me In order to save trouble for you, I can divide you three hundred gold coins." Siegel raised his eyebrows. "If you can tell me where the assassins who attacked the Elven Forest are, and who they are, I can divide you more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think I Will they betray them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really want to buy you with three thousand gold coins, but you can't let your companions shut up together." Dorn said: "Especially the priest of the earth, Arnold, he will not lie with you. So, in the end, it may still be the end of the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is definitely impossible to use only money, there must be other things blocking his mouth, let This thing looks like a thing.” Siegel swept away the plates in front of him, his eyes shining, and looked at Dorn with sorrow: “We use a gambling to solve everything.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every time I kill and bring back a head that participates in the sprite attacking the Assassin, I can I won the extra 800 gold coins. I used my head to gamble on the assassin's head. If I win, I will take my head and take the thing, and then I will alarm the assassin. They will disappear and eventually Only the reward of the bounty. If I lose, it is dead, you naturally do not have to worry about someone with a big mouth."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorn caressed his chin and thought about it: "It’s a very interesting proposal, but I don’t seem to make any money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Asking for the price, you can sit back and pay back the money.” Siegel casually replied: “If you don’t want to, let’s play a game now, and see if you can stop me from leaving Kaibu.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you drop your companions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naria and love are pretty cute I can't bear it, but what can I do? I don't know how to take them together and make sure to leave. Sol's skill is similar to me. As long as he has no brains and heroes to save the beauty, there is no problem. As for Arnold and Yao En, I will pity for them, shed a few tears, but will not leave a life. I can gamble on my own life, but only gamble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I promise you this request?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha, not please It’s just a proposal.” Siegel patted the table: “And, you always need my day, maybe this day will come soon. Maybe when Heim’s collar and elf’s army kills Kaib When I was in town, I might be a guide for them, maybe I will help you defend. Who can say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, mercenary, take money work. "Don said disgustingly: "I am looking for you to see you in your ability. This year, the swordsman can not find it." If you lose, I don't want your head. You only need to contribute your own strength to serve the gods. Three months is a good start. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three months too long, I don't want to stay for a month." Siegel took a dagger from his boots and placed it on the table. "Come, let everything be given to fate and spirit." When you come to rotate the dagger, when you point to me, you give Lily to me. I barely stay for a month; if I point to you, I will stay for three months. How? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god is on my side. Dorn took a few prayers and held a few words, then stretched his finger and pushed the dagger to make it spin in place. The dagger spins and swings. But when it starts to slow down but has not stopped, West Geer stretched out his finger to block the blade and let the dagger point at himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop of blood flowed from his finger.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You? ! "Dorn frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe that human efforts can overcome the test of destiny and the gods," Siegel licked his fingers: "And for Lily, what is a drop of blood, hahahaha. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a funny person, Jay. But you are too confident and will definitely lose. The priest stood up and gently shook his robes. The door of the wooden house opened: "Go with me, let's go to Shaq Manor." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, after receiving the magical communication from Siegel, Yao En was wrong, then he sat up quickly and quickly called everyone together." "Jie is ready to enter the Shak Manor investigation, he found a pastor of the murder god to lead the way. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the mother of the earth bless, he is a sheep into the tiger! Arnold almost jumped up: "We should hurry to save him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, Jay has a lot of means, and he can safely escape even if he is in danger." "Evan has already prepared for the news that Siegel has given him, so he has a well-thought-out: "Our past words can only give him trouble, and there will be no good results." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
