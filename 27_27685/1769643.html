			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grievances are raging in the elves, and the ancient trees of war are at a loss. The possessed elf and the normal elf do not see a difference unless they can always pay attention to the battlefield and judge according to the action of the wraith flying. But in this chaotic time, even the well-known elves will not be better than the orcs. Who can have the time to pay attention to those? Exquisite martial arts and swift shooting have made fratricism more violent and cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the elf lost one-fifth of the man's hand, and the casualties continued to expand. Fortunately, the Elf priest responded in a timely manner, exerting a large area of ​​magic, and shrouded the entire camp with the light of healing. Wraiths are undead creatures, some of which are made up of negative energy, and the positive energy of healing deals damage to them. Soon, the smoke of the spirits appeared, like the snow gradually melted in the warm spring sunshine. Under anger, the grievances focus on the area where the priest is located, trying to disturb their spells with various negative emotions, so as to fight for the initiative on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the Moon Temple screams the name of the gods, and the sacred emblem shines with dazzling light, and withstood the impact of the grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is fortunate is that a large part of the war tree belongs to plants and has good resistance to the possession of the spirits. If they are confused with the first time, the damage will be devastating. The grievance did not attempt to control the tree at first, after all, the flesh and blood body was more attractive to the undead. But with the addition of the Elf priest, the closer it is to the ground, the harder it is to act, so the grievances begin to pounce on the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individual grievances are not as obvious as the huge bodies of war ancient trees, but the large number of grievances that are concentrated can be controlled by the dragons. The tree will not be spared. As the first war tree no longer accepts the command of the elves, and throws a huge fist to attack, the elf priest immediately orders other ancient trees to gather immediately, and dispatches a special priest to focus on protection. The protection of evil enchantments was maximized, and the war tree that was ordered to gather was immediately rooted and could not be moved. Any war tree that wants to stand up again must be possessed and must be destroyed immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard wizard responded most quickly. They transmit to the protected area with any door spells the first time after the priest casts a protective spell. Then the Masters found that the commanding of the Necromancer spell was very poor. Even the best use of the power field missiles that were usually used to deal with the ghosts of the ghosts seemed to make obvious damage. It will lead to a timely and effective counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can it only rely on the priest's treatment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to stop the chaotic battlefield situation, a mage released a hesitation spell in the elves, intended to calm the tension and fear. Unexpectedly, this spell actually slowed the surrounding grievances from a high-speed dive like a eagle to a balloon-like slow ups and downs. With only a few eye contact, the wizard wizard and the priest immediately changed the tactics. They tacitly cooperated with each other, some used comfort, some continued to fight the dead, and another small group began to try other spiritual spells to see if it had any effect on the Wraith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead was originally controlled by immune spirits. Under normal circumstances, no one can think of such a means. The grievances are special, and the grievances of death occupy the vast majority of the body. The elf’s luck was very good, and he found it by mistake. They stabilized their positions, began to gather the soldiers, and attacked the spells when the grievances gathered and the speed was slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also left the hub control room at this time. Before leaving, wipe away the traces left by you here: a small element disorder caused by Yan Lingjing can achieve this goal. Before other wizards come here, follow the spiral down the ladder to the bottom and head toward the exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-lighted arrow tower caused the attention of many people in the hub, but the light was not obvious inside the Master Tower, and no one noticed at first. The mages, especially the few official mages of the Knox Association, took a while to find problems from the anomalies surrounding the energy fluctuations of the elements, and then rushed to the control hub. Siegel had already left at this time, and along the secret road, the scope of the Master Tower was hidden among the residents of the hub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he left, his usage changed his appearance. It does not look much different from the refugees everywhere. Looking back at the red spire, the heart flashed through Wendy's shadow. Siegel sighed and took all the magical items on his body and slowly moved toward the west gate of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirits of Deepwater City gradually got rid of the harassment of the spirits. They formed a stable front, supported each other and encouraged them, so that the grievances could not find a way to possess them. The elf constantly prays to the moon god, melting the body of the wraith with the Holy Spirit. At this time, the Red Magic Tower stopped attracting and controlling the Wraith, so these undeads left, and some of them came to Deepwater City to launch a raging action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Master then attacked Deepwater City. They summoned thundercloud storms and skyfire meteors to the direction of the Three Peaks Tower. The Mage's protective spells reacted immediately, bounce back all the lightning and the falling meteors. The Elf Master immediately chanted the curse and redirected the magic that flew to the elf, squatting on the temporary wall of Deepwater City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the war tree stood up and began to move toward Deepwater. They walked outside the range of the trebuchet and stopped, sticking the roots firmly to the ground, taking a deep breath and setting the posture for throwing at a very long distance. As long as any caster or air force appears, they will be hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defenders of Deepwater City held their heads under the magical blow. Several heroic knights insisted on the city and tried to manipulate the trebuchet to launch a counterattack. The ancient trees of war made them understand the conspicuous consequences on the battlefield before the death. After the javelin used to kill the dragon directly hit, the knight exploded under the impact and turned into a red rain. on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Three Peaks Tower Master was surprised to see the thunderclouds and fireballs falling from the top of the head, and the apprentices rushed to escape from the Master Tower in fear. People who have become formal mages are not worried, and most of them know the strength of the Union's spell protection power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Thundercloud and Meteor were blocked by the protective array, and only the banging sound came. If the squad is fully activated, even this last voice will not come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These nasty elves, really daring, actually attack the federation? The mages talked a lot and wondered what kind of counterattack the Fed would take next. They looked at the Three Peaks Tower with a look of hope and waited for the power of the magic tower to gather elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower is not responding at all. It's like sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the tower, Casper’s squad forced himself to calm down, and even if the anger in his heart was like a volcano that was about to erupt, he could not lose his mind. Just yesterday. "Lion King" Alexander received an urgent letter from the Masters Association, asking him to travel to the school to mediate the contradiction between the two princes of the Star Kingdom. After he left, he handed over the affairs of the federation to Casper for temporary escrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visitor William is still in the dwarf kingdom, he lost in front of the fine gold facade. But finally it was allowed to enter the top of Mora. It’s been a long time now, and William hasn’t appeared again, just knowing everything from his letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Casper seized the opportunity and issued an order to begin the embezzlement of the Masters Federation, members of the Federation are ready to act. It was during this critical period that someone actually used the Red Tower to summon the spirit of grievances and suddenly pushed the federation to the forefront. If it is a simple summon, it will not affect the plan, but these grievances will attack the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves’ counterattacks are swift and decisive, even after they see the Union’s protective enchantment that can bounce spells. There is no intention to stop. Now when the Masters Association decides the attitude, if it is tolerant, the reputation of Caspar is definitely a heavy blow. Don't say that the original plan is to close the transmission array, fight in the name of independence, and take the first step to conquer the mainland. If you don't fight back, he still has doubts about whether he can straighten his waist in front of other mages today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no matter who the grievances are attracted to, but as long as they are allowed to attack and do not counterattack, the Knox Association will have opinions. . Casper believes in his own control ability, and will continue to support and obey him. Who are the original Masters Union? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs time to slowly influence these people in a closed environment. Even with the help of spells, you want to control their loyalty and retain their normal ability to cast spells. Not a simple matter. In the process, any ideological impetus will affect the role of the spell. If the control spells are carried out rudely, the intensity of the simple spelling will press the crowd, and in the end, only a group of cockroaches that cannot be cast can be obtained, and it is meaningless to grow the joint meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This timing is really clever. Caspar had to wonder if the prophet master in the school had set a trap. It stands to reason that the plan of the Red God is like the highest player, even if other gods are unable to see through, it is even more impossible to make such a precise counterattack. Recognized as the strongest prophet Lille, he can only make vague predictions on important events, and he generally does not make interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless... Knox has a traitor inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
