			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element surges from the ground to the sky, such as the network of clouds that rise rapidly in the same group. The light shining in the clouds is as beautiful as the stars in the night sky. But under the beautiful appearance, there is a deadly killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Master, the elemental surge is irresistible, it’s like the flame encounters pure oxygen, after a more dazzling glow, Complete destruction. Lion King Alexander immediately rushed to the sky and moved to the side to try to circumvent the range of elemental surges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will go around." Raven Baron suddenly spoke and his voice was exactly the same as Siegel. "Call the guards, stick to them, the master will come back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet clasped Isaac and kept stroking his back so that his son clam down. She then asked Baron, "Do you mean that Siegel will definitely come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there is a law in the core of the city of Mithru Array, when I use specific defensive measures, it will cause all the secrets of the nucleus. The master and the star will be together, he will know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Who is that person? Can you beat him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War? The hostess, you are laughing, it is a **, I am the most It’s good to be able to hold him.” Baron said: “Remember, don’t run around, don’t send, don’t use any magical effects, and stay behind me.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barron is able to imitate the effects of elemental surges, but there is still a big gap from the real surge. The real surge needs to detonate the Peruvian nuclear, and such a move will make Baron die. Due to lack of strength, the surge began to dissipate only a few hundred meters, and eventually became a thundercloud that continued to rise upward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion Alexander rips off the thundercloud and looks at the castle at the foot and smiles. He squeezed his fist like a warrior, took a deep breath and began to gather the power of the elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel set up many defensive measures in the city of Miele, the first to respond is the element Rune Guards Corps. Twenty super-large elements screamed and flew to the sky. Because of anger and excitement, the body became black with black clouds. They threw lightning bolts at Alexander and rolled up the wind and quickly approached with the wind. Trying to tear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good power, good means." Alexander sighed, then cast a spell, covering the huge claws made by the force field on his hands. And pounce on the elemental wolves like a lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will kill you, leaving only the lives of both of you. I want to settle with Siegel, this is the only two of you can survive. The reason!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental corps is powerful and difficult to deal with in the eyes of ordinary people, but there are many flaws in the eyes of the **. First as elemental creatures, they only have the instinct to fight. There are few options for strain and the tactics are relatively monotonous. Secondly, their elemental power has a single attribute and is easily defended and restrained. When the gas elements rushed up, the momentum was very good, but the discerning people could see that they could not cause much damage to the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret police bell rang, and the guard knight rushed over with a rifle. The female knight, Mana, happened to be in the castle. She immediately organized the defense and ordered the guard to push the anti-long heavy machine gun out of the storeroom. This kind of heavy weapon against the Air Force has always been the secret of Uncle's City. When they were made, the imaginary enemy was the Griffin and the Dragon, and of course the Magic Spaceship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Please hand over the key to the Trusted Knight on the third floor, and let him open the No. 13 warehouse, which has weapons designed by the owner." Raven Barron suddenly turned his head and said to Janet, and then continued to control the castle's rune defense array to counteract the various spell effects from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet said according to the words, took the key of the city of Mire from the neck and handed it to the guardian knight. Although he is a half-orc, he also learned to read and read under the leadership of Zucker, at least not to read the words of the thirteenth warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp servant of the castle saw the key and let the road open, and the Orc Knights passed. The third floor of the underground is said to be the treasure house of the Marquis of Siegel. But in fact it is just a place to store all kinds of magical experimental supplies. It is full of scrapped magic items, and various scraps of experimental failure are also here. Only the various numbers with a numbered warehouse are good things to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hammered his leg and slammed it through the door of the No. 4 warehouse, which made it easier. He didn't dare to stop, rushed forward with a sigh of relief, and finally rushed to the thirteenth warehouse door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a heavy iron gate. At least there was no sound at the back, which made him feel a sigh of relief. The Orc trembled to find the keyhole and then opened the lock. The iron door opened on its own, and then a dense, squeaking sound was heard from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc looks at it with his dark vision, "Mom!" yelled at the ground. Hundreds of sharp mechanical legs supported more than seventy large and small spiders, which emerged from the warehouse like a rat. They ignored the half-orcs that fell to the ground, and did not need people to order them. They concentrated and climbed toward the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a runaway spider that is out of control and a failure to make an electromagnetic killer spider. Because of the small size and large number of spiders, it is very troublesome to control one by one. So Siegel tried to make them form a cluster. As a result, spiders developed their own cluster consciousness. Siegel can still give orders to them, but after the order is completed, the spiders will give orders to themselves and always act in groups, like a group of ants. Since spiders are already equipped with electromagnetic weapons, they may pose a threat to the safety of the castle, and Siegel can ruin them, but in the face of the experience gained from the failure, he chose to leave these spiders. It’s not only that success is important. The parasitic brain technology of the Magic Spaceship is derived from this failed experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Siegel ordered them to wait in the thirteenth warehouse to "wait for the gate to open, then attack the enemy that threatened the castle." Know if you ordered the spider to "in the thirteenth The warehouse is stationed, so they will complete the task themselves after they have been stationed for more than a minute, and then they will find something for themselves. They are very hardworking, but this hard work can cause chain troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now their hard work just comes in handy. The array of electromagnetic gun tubes began to spurt when the gas element rune guards were killed, the high-fired machine guns fired out, the plasma waves and the "56 rushes" intertwined into a fire net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these are not enough to trap Siegel, and they can’t stand Alexander. Although he is now embarrassed, with the help of scorpion, flash, mirror, trigger stone skin and other spells, the Lion King still avoids a deadly attack. In the end, these weapons are only physical attacks, and they are all single-attribute models like the Gas Element Rune Guards. There are obvious weaknesses. The master's specialty is to deal with various situations, so it is only a matter of time before he regains his advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, it’s never been alone in the city of Mith. Although they didn't know what was going wrong with the federation, their spacecraft had no movement, but the students of the Mire City Magic School and the adventurers of the mercenary pub came. No one has the idea of ​​arson and robbing—that is, it is extinguished immediately—no one believes that Siegel will fail. And from the number of people, the invaders are also in an absolute disadvantage. The Marquis is rich and enemies, and has always been generous. Everyone knows that after helping to guard the castle, there will be plenty of rewards waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time. Siegel, who was still talking to the association's mage, suddenly felt a guilty heart, just like being caught in the neck. He smiled and explained to the guest that he had a spell experiment that was almost out of order and could not continue to accompany him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will not bother, here is the magic book of death mantra, not the kind of ciphertext." The wizard opposite Siegel stood up , left a book and a vial filled with bloody meat. “It’s very pleasant to talk to you and hope to cooperate in more aspects in the future.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel let go of the restrictions on space locks, the opposite mage has some Inductive, after the ceremony, use the transfer to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? Do you feel?" Siegel asked about the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, Master. My Secret can have some abnormalities. The output drops very badly in a moment, but it recovers in a few seconds." Answer: "I remember you said, if this is the case..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That means what happened to the city of Mire! You immediately to the secret Flying in the city, I will take a step!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a burst of energy fluctuations expands outward with the Tongtian Tower as the core, and the stars and surrounding The space is all enveloped. The magical defense array of the spacecraft flashed, but it did not stop the entry of energy fluctuations. An oversized space lock is applied to the star number and merges with the original space lock on the spacecraft. As a result, Siegel could not use the transfer to leave. It takes a lot of time to unlock this space lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
