			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying four large flying carpets from the magic spaceship, the dwarf's gaze fell to the unsinking stone boat. WwW.XsHuotXT.com Siegel made an inviting gesture, boarding the spaceship with His Majesty the King and the chief of the guards who were always inseparable. The Federation already knows the attitude of the Masters Association and the City of Learning. Everyone has a sigh of relief, so this action to win the Star King has been supported by all the members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chiefs of several major factions are all welcome to board the ship, and use the courtesy of the courtiers instead of the mage. Although Evan didn't care much about this, he still felt very happy. In this vast sea, in addition to the Royal Fleet and the Wings, this is another powerful military force that expresses allegiance to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wywood, Wendy, you two to take the King’s Majesty to visit the spaceship of the Federation, I am not very familiar with this place.” Siegel Said: "Who knows how to go to the library?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will take you there." Master Shelley stood up, so the two men were temporarily separated from His Majesty the King. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of the magic spacecraft, the first thing is to transfer the books from the original local library to the spaceship, and re-invent and sort. The action did not tell Idis in advance, but the action department, the change system, the curse and the necromancer of the necromancer. Shelley said to Siegel as he walked: "We found that there are seven spell books and twenty-four books of information that are missing from the original warehousing. All of them are related to higher spells and external plane knowledge. Edith Master Being controlled by us, his three students are also separated and have not asked anything yet. Maybe you need to use your mind to explore the spells to get the information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Once the mind-like spells are used, it is hard to tell whether it is detected or improved in the brain.” Siegel shook his head: “It is better for the federation not to open this precedent, otherwise everyone will be afraid.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, *师, we follow your opinion." Master Shelley said politely: "You propose to install Knox on the magic spaceship." At the time of the peaceful squad, everyone was still worried. I was afraid that the things being controlled would be repeated. It seems that this is just a misunderstanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the enemy and against I still have to be clear about myself. For some doubt, it will confuse others' brains, especially when it comes to the Master.” Siegel came to the middle of the spaceship. This is the deepest part of the spacecraft, farthest from the outer wall in any direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was originally designed to be a summoning room. The masters of the spelling system can summon heaven or purgatory creatures here. Summoning such creatures is more dangerous than performing elemental spell tests, so there is a heavy protection array around the summoning room. In addition, there are also a variety of spells that are suppressed, restrained, and imprisoned. Even if the evil spirits appear, they will be trapped and cannot be moved at all. Idis was held here, and his spellcasting ability and physical ability were kept to a minimum. Coupled with an element to dispel the shackles, he can only sit in the middle of the captivity. Every day, I am in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked to the door, Master Shelley said: "Oh, Lord, Idis is inside, am I avoiding it?"<br /><希 />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, some unexpectedly, said: "I don't think it's good to see the suspect alone. You still come together, both as a witness. Can help to record the process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pushing the door of the summoning room, Siegel clearly felt the effect of various spell suppression. Although the goal of these spells is not him, the power of escape is still very uncomfortable. Idis heard the door and looked up. When I saw it was Siegel, I tried to stand up straight and sit up straight. This move led to the chain of his body creaking. Somehow, Siegel thinks he is a few years older than the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel*, I haven't seen you for a long time." Idis lifted his wrist. The chain made of silver smelt glowed with blood red, the power of magic slammed down, and pulled his wrist back to the knee. "Can you tell them, put this lighter. My nose is very itchy, and I can't scratch it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid not. Now the federation It’s not the Big Three, but the Security Council. I have to obey the rules that everyone has set.” Siegel, like Ediss, sat cross-legged on the ground, and Master Shelley stood a little further away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the Masters Association and the City decided not to provide information on higher spells, I made this proposal. To conduct a comprehensive inspection of the collection of the Federation, I also proposed that the Council keep the action confidential and not inform you." I did not hide it: "I really hope that you can tell me where the books and materials are going. How I wish you could say: I just hid it and did not destroy that knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis shook his head, and his mouth barely pulled out a smile: "You asked the wrong person, I don't know the whereabouts of the book."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"French Faranis trusts you very much and gives you responsibility for transferring the most valuable wealth of the Federation. You are solely responsible for the construction and subsequent management of the library. The books involved here are stored in high-level spells. District, there are only two ways to open: * the teacher himself goes in or the faction chief opens with you, and no matter what the way, you should make a record. Can you explain now, these earliest counts have entered the library books To Where did you go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have nothing to explain." Edith sighed. "You think I am a member of the Masters Association. Now I am being held up. It is actually as simple as this. I don't recognize the loss of books in the library. You are purely framed!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel turned to look at Master Shelley: "Have he been this attitude?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deceased chief nodded . She has known Idis for decades. It is impossible to see a colleague who is trapped in a sympathy without a trace of compassion. She was afraid that the young * division would be under the wrath of direct manipulation, destroying the body and soul of Edith. Reason tells her that there is something wrong with the library. Idis needs to take great responsibility in it, but the emotional side still hopes that this is just a misunderstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things happened so well, everything is like a targeted strategy, and the goal is me." Siegel said very calmly: "In When the secret nuclear power was just manufactured, the Masters Association and the School of Learning also showed considerable goodwill. But when I officially became a * division, things went down. The people in the city of Mystery told me that the school counselor stayed outside the castle. It’s also sneaky recently. It’s often late at night in the vicinity of the Urn nuclear. Then suddenly, the information of the high spell disappears. Or it can’t be obtained. Even the status of the federation and the past agreements have become “waiting.” "Can you tell me what is the true intention of the Masters Association to suppress me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't tell you." Edith shook Shaking his head: "The Masters Association and the City of Learning have never targeted a mage like this. There is no precedent to check. But one thing you said is right, Siegel dragged you down the entire Mage Federation."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dare say if I withdraw from the union Will the Masters Association open this information to the federation?” Siegel sneered and said: “If there is such a convenience, I will not be able to deal with the Federation only as the Earl of Heim, even like Deep Water City and Sanfeng. The relationship between the towers is similar. Is this an acceptable situation for the Masters Association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Shelley shook his head. Everyone knows that this is definitely impossible. Siegel has become part of the federation, and the federation has also deeply impressed Siegel. And most importantly, the new federation will never exchange charity with a betrayal member! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis has nothing to say this time, only shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel suddenly frowned and touched his forehead with his hand. This is a sign of soul-connected communication - someone went to him through Raven Barong Passed the message too early to God. He turned his head and asked Master Shelley: "Tell me the truth, is the union secretly making another secret nuclear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow Lai also stunned, then shook his head: "I don't know it. Unless someone can do this with the leaders of all factions. We did negotiate to make a secret nuclear, but then calculated it. In addition to being able to become more proficient, the new Secret can have no effect and waste resources. So I did not pass this plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Siegel looks at Idis: "Someone is making a secret nuclear." Siegel said: "I don't know the exact location yet, but this thing can be basically determined. I don't know if it is a drawing. The leak is still within the Master of the Federation. I hope that the drawings will be leaked, because the number of people required to complete such a job will be much less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard!" Master Shelley clenched his fist: "Whatever the reason, dereliction of duty or The people who do this are damn! Siegels, what should we do? Can we find out where we are, and then drive our spacecraft directly? I want to see who is so bold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
