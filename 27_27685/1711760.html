			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the wand, many times you can save on the use of spell packs, greatly increasing the speed and flexibility of casting spells. This is like a face-to-face duel between two swordsmen. The first person who draws the weapon will always get a bigger win. So the wizard will use the wand as the first choice. But the wand also has the disadvantage: using the wand for a long time will reduce the sensitivity to magic, and it is easy to lose the "feel" when improving the spell. Many wizards think that the wand will cause some special spell release techniques to fail, and the wizard who tries to create new spells so that the name is historically minimizes the use of the wand. It is said that using a wand to practice new learning spells will also affect the mastery of the spell details, resulting in an unstable spell base, which is hard to improve in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel has never purchased a wand until it needs to go far, and is likely to encounter combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the wand, he bite his teeth and spend money on a flight and an invisible scroll, so the 550 gold coins are spent again. This is exactly what the Master of the Elf said, the Master is really a profession that spends money. It is no wonder that the Elves never accept foreign disciples and disciples. Most of the elf society is on-demand. If the apprentices of the aliens are also used as needed, they will be very Quickly drain the elves' wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Light God is still promoting various products, which is the only meaning of his existence. Siegel looked at these good things, and every one wanted to buy it, but he was ashamed. He waved his hand, thanked the god of enthusiasm, and then joked: "You have free magic items here, I can see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp god smiled Said: "How is this possible? Even Ain Stone (a kind of gemstone that rotates around the Master) has 25 gold coins. The authoritative tower has always been..." Here, his face changed. Mixed with doubts, surprises and pains, the lamp god replied: "You don't say that there is really a magic item here for free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out A coin, the side of pure gold is engraved with a smile, and the side of sterling silver is engraved with a crying face. "The first time I discovered that there is such a thing, the description of it is 'an artifact, only the son of fate can use.' If you want, I will give you, anyway, don't want money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel dumbfounded, and the coin was taken for a closer look and found no clue. But this is indeed a magical item, you can feel the magical energy flowing from inside the gold coin, but Siegel can't figure out its function and principle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought about it, or continue to create my own destiny, and take my own path better. Those who are destined for various strange missions still let others go This gold coin is still returned to you, leaving it to others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he returned the gold coin and left the Mage Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a lot to be done in the north, and all equipment must be purchased by itself to ensure safety. Sir Bill has set a good example in this regard, and Siegel has also developed this habit. He added the supply and bought a good horse to start with his own pony. After that, he found the fangs Janis and handed him a task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go to someone who is proficient in the northern savage and orc language, I need a guide." Siegel said: "In addition, you go find a mouth Strict, reputable agent, I have a business to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fangs ran out with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel called Mrs. Linda-Dip, handed out two hundred gold coins to her, and said: "I have to go a long way, probably It will be a few months to come back. These are the money that will be given to you for emergency. If there is any change, you can use it. The cost of life and employment is still in the cupboard. You usually use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must pay attention to safety." Mrs. Dip took the money and said: "Karl has entered the trainee pastor's study and started to contact some rituals. He said thank you very much. The opportunity you give him will serve you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's great. After he learns, please let me have a big meal." Siegel was sincerely happy, and then said: "For Ms. Linda, you want to buy some flour, stir it and put it in a bag and use it as my dry food. I saw this from a travel note. Way, I just want to give it a try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, young master."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be sure to keep it strictly confidential. If I hear that you have leaked any news that affects the military action behind, then I will report to the lord, even if I am punished with you, I will not let you go."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured." Trines hurriedly bowed and said with respect: "Reputation is my life, and confidentiality is my motto."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this thing, Siegel no longer worry about, and turned to the fangs to ask the guide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not many people who dare to go to the wilderness of the northern wilderness, and there are fewer people who are proficient in multiple languages. I have inquired a lot of people and only found one." What meets the requirements is a troubadour called Jarrell. However, this person's style is not very good, and his employer is often not happy. Few people hire him again. And those employers are not closed to what happened. It’s very mysterious. This person likes to spend a lot of money, owes a gamble, and the price is very high.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What else?” Geer asked: "Is there no people from other northern countries in Deepwater City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes some people come from the north, but I ask After that, it is said that most of these people were punished and expelled from the tribe, so these people did not dare to go back, so it is of no use. The northern savages have many tribes, and their languages ​​are different. Subtle language differences are sometimes customary. Change, a little careless is likely to cause trouble. Compare It is better to know more about the orc language. There are also some multi-language guides, they have been taken away by some local nobles, used to do some business with the savage. They have not accepted other commissions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I don’t really have a choice, can I just go to see that Jarrell?" Siegel sighed and there was no other way to think about it. I can follow the fangs to the "Rocky Moonlight" pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocky Moonlight Tavern opened near the dock area of ​​Deepwater City, and its reputation is not very good. It is said to be a gathering place for smugglers, intelligence dealers and some villains. The fangs Jennis and Siegel both wore armor under the cloak and prepared a few more weapons to cope with every possible situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Siegel’s wand is turned into a wristband, hidden under his sleeve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked through the muddy roads, avoiding the dirty rubbish and smelly puddles on the ground, and finally set foot on the stone steps of the main entrance of the pub. A cockroach with one leg missing is snoring in the mud, and the broken bowl in front of him is empty. Siegel pulled out a silver coin and threw it in. The crisp sound of the silver coin hitting the broken bowl did not make it lift the eyelids. The fangs said: "It must be drunk." Siegel shook his head and stopped looking at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub's door is thick and heavy, full of mottled paint and greasy dirt, yellow warmth in the door, but it looks quiet of. After pushing the door open, a smell of sour smell came over, and you could see two rows of sleeping big men on the ground. They held the bottles and stacked them together. A few drunks talked to each other in a sleep, and even one person gave a low laugh. These people may be wanderers on the dock or unloaders. The depression in the port of Deepwater City first affected their lives. Apart from getting drunk, there is no other way to forget the pressure of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel just wrinkled his brow, or calmly walked slowly from the middle. The pub was filled with the pungent smell of alcohol and tobacco. Some people looked up and looked at the people who trusted at the gate. They looked at them carefully and found that they had nothing to do with themselves and then looked away. The people here are all-inclusive, and they form their own small circles one by one, glaring at the glare of the fireplace, whispering and discussing their little secrets. In the dark corner of the room, you can see a few fuzzy figures, they sit quietly and hide their gaze in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the tavern hides behind a huge bar, silent, bowing his hands to work in his hands, and he has not even come to greet new guests. However, Siegel is not here to drink alcohol. The toothy Jennie looked around the pub and found no "poet" figure, so he could only find an empty table to let Siegel sit down and then quickly rushed to find out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the bitter haha ​​here, Siegel’s fabric is much better and the pattern is clear and refined. Several women who were exposed to the clothing discussed each other, and one of them looked the youngest and came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not wait for her to talk, she bought her a glass of wine, and then asked him to leave. Several drinkers looked at this scene with great interest and speculated on the identity of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
