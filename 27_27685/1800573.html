			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reappearing in space, the goblins are prepared, have not waited for the Siegel projection text, the goblin uses the searchlight array Keep sending messages to the sky. Since most of the earth is covered by contaminated dust and fog, the area that can be visually observed from outside space is very rare, so the goblin has spent a lot of time in order to transmit signals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes set up this searchlight array in thirty-six areas to ensure that there is always a communication system that glows in the dark. Siegel looked at the "apology letter" of the goblin, and knew the tricks of covering up the facts and trying to trick themselves down. Stars scorned the goblins, and praised the master's foresight. Siegel stopped the idea that Xingsuo learned to flatter and asked him to re-issue the "Ground Book". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are celestial stars, investigating the spacecraft of the exploration force, one of the other living beings in the universe. We are not malicious, but we are not afraid of using force. I hope to be able to communicate, exchange and learn. Your attack is meaningless. If your trip is safe, please send a signal to arrange a landing place. I will interview you. 1."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing from the number 2 to the number 1 is not a warning, but an encouragement to attack the goblin. Siegel knows this very well. He deliberately did this in order to defeat the confidence of the goblin in a short time. This time he did not rush to land, but stayed in space for three full days before he began to slow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes used these three days of surprises, stepped up their mobilization, and even the troops near the amethyst moved over. This time there was no such thing as a crowd of onlookers, not even a goblin soldier with a gun. The smallest unit of combat near the landing site is also the chariot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the decline of the star number, there are constantly goblin planes moving back and forth, and some are deliberately close to the spacecraft. The airflow rolled up by the wing blows across the surface of the spacecraft and is immediately disturbed by the energy-focusing lens, so the attempt by the goblin to analyze the spacecraft is curbed. The goblins don't die so hard. Then they use the sound waves. After Siegel casts a silent enchantment, all the sound waves sink into the sea, which makes the goblin extremely shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Full vibration absorption! This means that they are able to control the fluctuations of all substances, and we are not opponents in materials science!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also radar signals at the same time. Countless waves shrouded in all directions. Xingsuo was not in a hurry, and he did not have to worry about Siegel. He directly applied the electric claws on the surface of the spacecraft. The electrical energy contained in the unsupported energy cooperates with the lightning energy provided by the Miereng nuclear to interfere with all surrounding electromagnetic signals. Xingsuo found that he could even use electromagnetic shock to directly destroy the equipment of the goblin aircraft. Or occlude all electronic devices of the goblin by emitting a large amount of radio waves. This is a no trouble to deal with the goblin, and Xingsuo happily recorded it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the height of the star is reduced, the detection of various light waves from the ground comes as expected. From the books of the goblin, Siegel knows the temptations such as perspective rays and sensible heat rays. Although it is believed that the spacecraft's thick leaded outer armor is sufficient to shield these probes, it always seems to be inscrutable. Deal with this means. Using illusion is the best way. A variety of deflected visible and invisible light, messing up the equipment of the goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these methods encounter a magician or a pastor, it is not a problem at all, and the magic spell can be completely cracked. But the goblin obviously didn't know this, so the researchers all licked their hair, and they scratched their faces. Without results and unclear results, these two words will never be a good result. Only by making yourself appear harder and more miserable, may even survive the anger of the superiors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the detection of the goblin, Xingsuo complained: "I hate it. I am around me, I don’t want to stay clean. Next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Keep calm, star, from now on you have to think more, pre-judgment. Too much emotion will affect your efficiency." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I know, I will be calm." Stars sent a reassuring heart signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Siegel has not only brought the protection of the long-range arrow, but also applied elemental shield and warhead protection spells to himself. This spell created by the Federation can defend against sniper-level impact damage, but it can't do anything about the flames of the explosion. Elemental shields are the best way to defend against flames and high temperatures, so the combination of the two makes Siegel look more prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally walked down the ladder and stood on the ground. Not being shot at the head. However, this time he obviously did not use the Zenith Star language to complete the "small step, a big step" sentence, but looked at the surrounding chariots and artillery with the burning black soul fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going a goblin from a chariot with fifty stars, with a gray-black helmet. There are no weapons on the light gray combat uniforms, but an electronic display board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a concern that the Zenith stars will not speak the language of the goblin, so use the method of the display board to communicate. At the beginning, there were only four words: "Please come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least this time the goblin learned to say "please", but this should only be spoken verbally. . I am afraid that what I think in my heart is very different. He nodded and took a step toward the ground. Because of the pattern network formed by the elemental aggregates on the whole body bones, Siegel deliberately released some of the flame power at the soles of the feet, forming two rows of smoke footprints. Then he glanced back and pretended to be the one he had just discovered before stopping the flame trail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move has made the research goblins busy. Their analytical skills have been pushed to the limit, but when they come up, they are exposed to the deepest part of the other system, and even the gods can't understand it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goblin Guide is busy writing on the imaging board, and Siegel glances at him and then uses the gnome to say: "Directly communicate in language." Yes, I can understand your words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real-time image passed back, the dark brown goblin pointed to the bald goblin and said: "Listen, it is your goblin. The accent of the language! The source of the leaked information is right there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fart! Our technology is indestructible, but you allow ordinary goblins to also launch satellites, those fakes It is the root of the leak! The accent can't explain anything, don't think of accusing me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel naturally doesn't know that he almost caused a goblin in one sentence. War, otherwise he must think more about this aspect. The goblin took him to the car and headed north. It seems that their primary tactic is to separate themselves from the spacecraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Alien?" The goblin guides smashed their hands, and the following goblins asked the attitude of the finest goblins: "What should I call you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call me with the name of Galan, you can't pronounce the name of my Zenith star." Siegel mimics the way the dragons speak. It seems unpredictable and has a long history: "Why attacked me when I landed for the first time? Is this an individual behavior or a group behavior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes one Xiaoyan’s fearful terrorists are a group of criminals, and such things will not happen again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It seems that your management ability for your own world is very Limited." Siegel casually commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence has caused extensive discussion in the goblin giants. The idea of ​​establishing a goblin regime has been placed on the table. Which goblin does not want to have all The power of the world? Only the silent goblin did not participate in this discussion, but focused on the images passed from the front, and kept thinking in his slightly larger head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ask Garland, what does the number at the end of his declaration mean?" His orders were quickly passed to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We believe that learning ability is a very important benchmark in the universe, and there are considerations in learning from mistakes. If the standard is not met within the number of times You can't communicate as a smart creature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the local standard is asked, Siegel is silent, looking at the window outside. View. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They passed through an uninhabited town, where the streets have been cleaned for a long time, with dust and rubbish everywhere. The air is filled with the energy of the dust, although not fatal but not good for health. Siegel is naturally not afraid of being a scorpion, and other goblins are a bit nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has read about the situation here, an earthquake and the subsequent tsunami destroyed the energy core here, causing the dust to leak. The residents have long been driven away, and all the belongings have been collected by the military. There is no better place to place and talk than a city without people, especially since all the facilities here are working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
