			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people are shocked - except Leer, he is always a stunned look. Www/xshuotxt/com Siegel may also be excluded. He is too focused on watching Lear's actions and preventing the possible reaction of the big prophet, so he did not listen carefully to Aaron's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am dead." Aaron said: "Although there is always a death, I will reach the end faster than you. Ironically, This is the only area I am acting faster than you. I have been preparing to become a king all my life, then I became a king, then what dissatisfaction is there? And according to any law and reason in the world, as my brother, You should have more power than me to become a king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just a swordsman," Evan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you are not just a swordsman." Aaron shook his head. "I will give you the throne - or return it to you, these are the wording details - naturally conditional. If you can promise, let's continue."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan closed his eyes and thought: "Tell it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the father, I am the king, then you are the king No matter what the circumstances, I am the king before you. I don't want to be slandered by the names of the slayer, the pseudo-king, etc. I was born to be the eldest son of the father. Although I was not dead, I am not. It is allowed to be splashed with dirty water and insulted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one can insult you. My sword will protect this." Evan said categorically. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never been formally married, but I have many women in my confusion." Aaron said: "I was always drunk and everything was blurred. Hey, so who can't remember it, but it's just that Salk is here. You can ask him when you get there. I don't think it's possible for me to leave my blood in this body. But this is not true. If there is a child, because his mother has no formal marriage contract with me, it is still an illegitimate child. You also know the faces of those friends around you, so I hope that you can treat these illegitimate children well. Let them be safe and secure. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is, I will arrange them to go to Heim. It is a quiet place away from the starry kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron glanced at Siegel and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, except for Evan’s illegitimate child, there may soon be a group of Aaron’s illegitimate children. Siegel wants to laugh and want to cry, but he can't do anything with his pain. In Mier City, you can open a school and teach the royal family to be an illegitimate child. If the name goes out, the little ministers of the princes and ministers will be outside. They will continue to go to Heim. Perhaps it will not be long before the new astrological kingdom aristocratic pedigree can be assembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a condition, if you can't do it, I would rather die than give up the throne." Aaron sat up straight and breathed heavily. A few mouthfuls, then said: "The dwarves have failed, so they convened this meeting. But the kingdom of stars cannot be defeated, never! I am like this, if the kingdom is always safe, it can be supported, but as long as it is not calm, it cannot Competent. I know very well, as long as you raise the flag and formally start the army, I will get rid of it. If you die within three months, you will not have to win on the battlefield. How can such a body guarantee the invincibility of the kingdom of the stars? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I never raised the flag, nor allowed anyone to mobilize the soldiers." Evan’s voice was flat, just like when she was a child, she told the younger brother to apply the swordsman. The legendary story: "I fantasize, if it can be as good as a child. If we have any disputes, pick up the wooden sword to play a game, and decide whether to win or lose. Or use simpler and more A fair way to throw a gold coin into the sky Go, the stars in the sun is what you win on that I win "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"... Haha, I was thinking, "Aaron looked very happy. Both hands clapped, but the sound was not loud. "From small to big. What I want, whether it is what you want or not, will eventually be mine. Because my last name is a star, and your last name is a golden sunflower. Now you are also a star, then you want Things should be yours, just like when I was young!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You no longer have to check the authenticity of the book?" In my arms, I took out a roll of paper. "I have been carrying it with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan immediately tore the paper in his hand. "If you have this kind of momentum, how can swordsmanship be worse than me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your sword is better because it is less reading!" Aaron said with a smile. . Then he started coughing again, but this time he stopped. "This time I also made other plans. For example, if I lift my finger, the card will puncture a sword from behind you, and a sword will kill. I also prepared a super sweet juice, which is added inside. The poison. The Royal Navy will also come over after you get on the boat, but they will not board the attack without receiving my order. I think you will come, but I didn't expect you to come alone, still at the door. Unlock all the armed forces. You trust me, and when I am your brother, so you are still my brother. And my brother is the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Not all the armed forces were lifted, I still carry a dagger.” Evan took the obsidian dagger from behind and placed it in his palm: “This is not made of metal, but made of stone, so the card is also seen. Not coming out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lil’s eyes trembled and he was clearly seen by Siegel who had been watching him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good decapitation, good kings should have a good decapitation." Aaron said with a sigh of relief, then said to the chief of the palm print: "Help me write the will." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorke spreads a piece of paper and picks up the quill: "Your Majesty, please give instructions."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, damn, would you like to elaborate? Simple, write my name, complete the title, and then say that I will transfer the throne and the subsequent inheritance to Evan Kim. All lords and royal knights in the whole country should immediately pledge allegiance to the new king, otherwise they will be rebellious, and then write something else. Stupid, what to write, what is written, anyway, it is something embarrassing. Write me to sign You can take the seal again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feather pen is slowly writing on the paper, the writing is clear and beautiful, everyone is holding their breath and waiting for this The arrival of historic moments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lil stepped forward, and Siegel shook his shoulders and prepared for the cast. The atmosphere suddenly became dignified at a time. The great prophet smiled a little and said to Aaron: "His Majesty, the school city respects your choice. But the new king is enthroned, and it is reasonable to receive the blessing of the morning temple. I believe that if the opinion of the great sacrifice Aurora is also written in the script. It will be more convincing and will make the kingdom less turbulent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron nodded and looked at the morning priest, "The temple is willing to change for this throne." Endorsement?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord’s sacrifice nodded, and Siegel frowned. All gods cannot interfere with the actions of the scorpion holders, so their prayers never receive a response from the gods. In this case, the morning priest can summon the blessing of God? Siegel looked at Lear's expression and then suddenly realized that the great prophet had known it all. Then the original array of those who stored the hundred-faced scorpion chamber is likely to be arranged by him. This also confirms the words of the Green Dragon Alenoz Iggs from the side. Lear is the magical god. His purpose is to study these scorpions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is still not worried about the safety of the twenty-faced nephew. He is still trying to resolve the immediate crisis. I don't know why Lear didn't want Evan to sit on the throne. Is this going to be contrary to his original intention to study the secrets of the nephew? What is the relationship between the throne and the nephew, fate and blood? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron nodded and made a gesture toward the chief of the guard. The king's guards used their right fists to lick their chests, and the anti-magic force field disappeared. Siegel took out a bottle of healing potion and eased his injuries. The Aurora's main sacrifice is to hold the holy emblem. Pray to the Lord of the Morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He prayed over and over again, but the brows became wrinkled and tighter, and Lear’s mouth was getting more and more warped. Evan lowered his head. Looked at Aaron all the time. He can't see from his brother's face that he is looking forward to or disappointed. There is only one calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest put down his arm and shook his head and said, "I am sorry that the king is kneeling, and the Lord of the Morning has not lowered his will. I suggest that other pastors try it out. To make sure that I don't miss the meaning of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lil bent down and said in a clear but depressed voice: "The Lord of the Morning has not given Fu Ewen, I am afraid that the gods are also worried that this will cause the kingdom to be turbulent and to be ruined by the king. His Majesty the King..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King, I think the teacher of the school Is it wrong to interpret the meaning of the temple?” Siegel said: “The handover of the king of the king is the internal affairs of the royal family. As a courtier, there is only obedience and allegiance. You have shown in history that there has never been in history. The magnanimity and the temperament, this kind of behavior is even for the gods like the Lord of the Morning. It must be difficult to see. Such a move is better than a swordsman or a kingdom split. It is already a good deed. God The views of the temple are important, but in the morning temple Was there any change in the starry throne before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
