The loopholes, lack of time and lack of interest are the main reasons. However, it is also beneficial to do so. This is the only place where Star Trek can be positioned and transmitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time the wizard casts a spell, the wiki is amazed, of course, only in his heart, completely invisible from his expression. He didn't have to ask Siegel to know that something went wrong, and he could see it from his move to throw the bag of clothing onto the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that woman thinking?! These clothes don't belong to anyone, no one can find it! Without media, the error in positioning will be great. He bit his lower lip and forced himself to calm down. "I need to go to her and ask me in person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I go with you?" Wiki said: "On the one hand, the security of the Viscount It’s important, my Majesty takes this matter very seriously, I have to do my best; on the other hand, I also want to see the speed of the magic spaceship.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reason Very full, and Siegel also needs a guide to familiarize with the terrain and conditions. One of the benefits of being a military adviser is that the Stars leaving the King only need to say to the Guardian Card, so Siegel called Shelley and Jack, and set off in ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows the general direction through the map, so climb up immediately after uploading, then accelerate. The star number has reservations, and without the elemental control of Siegel, she cannot break through the sound barrier independently. But the speed that has been revealed so far has been amazed by everyone, and even Master Shelley is shocked to keep his mouth shut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would like to understand the secrets, but Siegel’s mood is not good, and now it’s obviously not a good time to ask questions. Plus the half-orc stood on the sidelines and stood ready to vomit. The intelligence chief was always boring without expression, so the cabin was always silent. Master Shelley could not help but worry about another countess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Countess of Ferrara is dominated by forests and hunting grounds, where barley and grapes are grown, and during the management of Sir Bill, peach trees were planted here. Added a new variety to the original wine industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a dangerous military fort. The Countess’s castle is more like a sturdy big hotel. It has a face to the lake. A small dock that can be docked for cruises was built. The two slender boats that the two fishermen liked are docked next to the trestle, swaying and leaving ripples on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo is unceremonious, slamming into the lake, and the pieces of the pick-up boat are thrown directly onto the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Siegel," Master Shelley raised his eyebrows and hated and slammed his feet: "Don't be impulsive! Opposite the widowed lady and find no To the father's child, it is not the place where you are wild!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s half-many door spell stopped and his eyes shook. Then bow your head and breathe deeply. He changed the spell and cast a banner of Heim's nine-claw squid with illusion over the star. His red-flamed eyes and fluttering tentacles frightened many people, but they also defined the identity of the visitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then walked down the ramp with everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, I saw the carriage and the knight constantly rushing through the gates of the castle. The courtyard was full of chaos, full of dirt, horses, armor and screaming. The voice of the person. The speed of the magic ship was too fast, and the patrolling guards had not allowed the archer to stand on the wall, and it had already landed in the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the use of those horses, can you step on the platform of the magical spaceship on the lake? There are two trebuchets on the highest platform of the castle. But obviously there is no assembly of all the parts yet. However, even if they launch with full force, it is impossible to damage the outer armor of the star cable - even if it hits, it can only cause scratches that will be quickly repaired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the chaos caused by the magic ship is bigger than he thought. The Cavaliers here are used to the existence of Sir Bill. Habits follow his instructions, and now his departure leads to complete loss of order. The knights acted in their own way, and all kinds of news were scattered around. Pirates, giant eagle, and a mountain that fell down, the Stars had a lot of "reinforcement" that did not exist at all. Even when Siegel entered the courtyard, he did not encounter any obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went straight to the inner court where the pier was facing. Walk through the garden of oak trees and evergreen shrubs and walk towards the castle. Armor in one hand. The young knight with the scabbard on the ground suddenly slammed into front of Siegel, his eyes, nostrils and mouth were rounded. The fingers trembled and lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyes flashed, and a “fan” was spit out in the mouth, and the spellcasting was completed. The young knight quickly dressed his clothes and said anxiously: "Adult, please go here, the countess is looking for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is too fast Fast, in order to catch up with his action plan, Master Shelley had to walk two steps, standing between the gram and the wiki, and gently put their hands on their shoulders, and then began to cast spells. She confessed: "The three of us are too conspicuous, don't move, I will show invisibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel followed the young knight, all the way through The chaotic maid and the frightened maid went straight to the second floor of the castle, in front of a closed door. There are no people guarding here, is it that the panicked knights have forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Countess?" The young knight knocked on the door, but no one answered. The shoulders of the wiki trembled and slid out of Shelley's slender fingers like mud. He left the invisible range, quietly but very quickly slammed the back of the young knight and put him to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are not here, have left in a hurry. Before the servant destroys all the traces, hurry up."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and followed the intelligence chief. The half-orc smacked his head. "Really?" He slammed the door handle and slammed the lock and the door. Behind the door is a rest room with hot lemon tea, a few children's drawing boards and a comfortable crib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼克 sniffed with his nose, and then admired and said: "Sure enough, they just left. How did he know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand caught his shoulder again, and Shelley once again included the Orcs into the invisible range. The wiki leads the way, and he stares at the carpet as if he can distinguish the footprints from its fluff. The servant who passed by him was stunned by his palm, and his arms, knees and feet were lifted and sent to let the faint servant roll quietly to the side of the corridor. His martial arts path is completely different from the knights and warriors, all of which are created for the human body structure and key points. If you run into a steel armor with full armor, his ability to use this set is useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel guessed that he must have other martial arts, not the only one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s here, behind the wall is a dark road, they are leaving from here." Wiki looked around and looked around: "I need some time to find out Organ traps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Siegel raised his hand as dissociation, opened a large hole directly on the wall, and presented the slide behind it directly. Everyone is in front of you. Several people followed the slide down and turned over a dozen or so laps to stand on the mat of hay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman wearing a mother-in-law skirt is holding her back and is stroking the back of a slightly older child. The three-year-old boy is constantly retching because of the double cause of the slide and panic. There is no guard around her, but there is a servant who is unfastening the cable a little further away. Originally there was an underground river below the castle, which was transformed into a secret passage for escape. The lake flows from here to the distant mountain forests, and there may be exits somewhere in the hunting ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman saw the stranger who appeared behind her, and quickly put the cockroaches in the arms of the older children, while keeping them behind them, they said loudly: "Run! Run!" She has no weapons, but she will never retreat or escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the person you are looking for, that's right," Wiki said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, you run, you run too!" The older child slammed the mother's skirt and finally understood that the mother would not go. He glanced at Siegel with his teeth, and when he was about to turn his head away, the culprit that caused all of this finally spoke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Countess Ferrara, I am Siegel Squid, Bill's apprentice. I am too reckless, but I am not malicious, at least not now "He looked at the three-year-old boy's face with a firm look, like Sir Tiger Bill. "I need the things of Sir Bill to find him, I am worried about his safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
