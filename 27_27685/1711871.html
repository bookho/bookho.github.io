			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The war is over," Viscount Kira Start said while writing a letter, with a tired voice. The only thing that heard this was his vowed Knight Morgan Clarke, the most loyal subordinate and friend. He needs to erect his ears to hear every word, and the rustling sounds in the room seem to be louder than the words of the owner of the hub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hub of the fortress is far from the battlefields of the North. Unless the orcs continue to break through the deep water city and the country of the elves, it is impossible to reach the walls of the hub. There is still a calm life here, and the busy caravans still shuttle back and forth on the Cloak Avenue. The orc war seems to have occurred in a very remote place, but it still affects the attention of Viscount Zilla. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think of this war?" The Viscount put down the quill in his hand and stopped writing. He looked up and watched the vows: "You read all my letters, what do you think of this result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morgan Clarke is very calm, as always. In addition to the life and death of the Viscount, he does not care about other things - or is too lazy to care. So the Viscount will show him the documents and seek a fair and objective opinion from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The orc has won this time." The Cavaliers said: "Deepwater City has only lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount nodded, this is the answer he wants to hear. He is not young, except for the two sons and three daughters under his knees, I am afraid there will be no new sons. He tried his best to educate future generations, but none of them had the vision of a Morgan Knight. The hub is located at the core of the New World, and its geographical location is very important. It is the meaning of the word “hub”. Although it is a treasure, it attracts too much attention. Only those with a keen political mind can keep this territory and not fall into the middle of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriage can help their eldest son to sit on the lord's seat, and the second son can get another territory of the family by virtue of marriage. But the Viscount is worried that after his death, the aristocrats who are married will have a heart. He is looking for new allies and trying to strike a balance among the various forces. Therefore, he has always been concerned about the situation in the north, buying the most detailed information at a high price, and thus judging the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The orcs will come back soon, and the interval will be much shorter than in the past," said the Viscount. The knight listens, and then the viscount will ask his opinion, which has formed a habit. "In three years, there will be a big battle. Deepwater City will definitely encounter big troubles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it will be another big river battle. More The race unites against the army of the orcs," the Cavaliers said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Visla closed his eyes and carefully calculated it in his mind, then nodded: "It is very likely that it will develop to that step. We should be prepared early. What do you think of the few people in this war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who? Your Royal Highness Prince Aaron?" The knight shook his head. . He didn't want to say bad things about the royal family, so he only made the simplest comment: "His body is too bad, and may not affect the next battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have left him a face." Visa Zilla said with a smile: "In the end, this thing is not done by the deep water city, let the prince of the prince out of the ugly. Knowing that he is in poor health, let him Speaking at the celebration ceremony, but conversely think about it, maybe this is the real purpose of the (Sham Shui Po) lord's parliament, so that everyone can see the royal family of the starry kingdom that can't stand even if they stand up, so that they can build confidence in continuing self-government. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavalier snorted: "Deepwater City announced that it has been separated from the starry kingdom for almost a decade. Even if there were some cracks in the Battle of the River, it bullied a sick person. It is really a loss of wind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned around and looked at Morgan Knight: "Will the sick person get preferential treatment? I am not insisting on the hub. Aaron Prince is actually too self-aware. If you are not good, don't be reluctant, don't he know." Can silence bring majesty? The original starry kingdom is not strong enough in the New World, and the current situation is increasingly unfavorable to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hub cannot be deep water The city declared autonomy," the Cavaliers reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This I know," the voice of the Viscount was full of helplessness. "I know that this is impossible. The result of declaring autonomy is to fall apart. Don't say wait until others start, let's Your own vassals will rise up. Attack on us. Do you say what reason they will use to eliminate the rebels or cruelty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Very good.” Every time the Viscount heard this, he would feel very relieved. No matter when. The Morgan Knight is as full of support as his own brother, killing the enemy with a sword. Even in the face of the high-level rituals of the Elven kingdom, knowing that the starlight they were calling was the power to destroy life, the Morgan Knight did not retreat in the slightest, and was firmly in front of the Viscount. When did he come to the hub of Fort, I am afraid I saw him from the moment I remembered it? The memories of the past have been somewhat blurred. Many scenes can't be remembered, only the twisted shadows and strange sounds. Every time this fall into memory, the Viscount is exhausted, so he immediately turns his attention back to what is in front of him. "The things of His Royal Highness Aaron have not been discussed. Anyway, he will go home. He will not have much influence on the New World. I am concerned about the man named Siegel. His identity is very strange. The Baron of the Royal Family, the Master of the Federation, and actually became the pioneer of the Deepwater City. The Lord’s Parliament is making up his mind and starring the kingdom this time. This is too abnormal. After all, they just rely on the other’s navy to ensure that The safety of the sea. You said, is there any conspiracy in this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can’t think of it." The knight shook his head and his armor His movements made a soft noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Siegel is really very powerful, and he dares to take over the triple identity at the same time. I really want to seal the land and die. Right, this man's knight. The mentor you have seen, Baron Bill Tiger, is now an unbelievable jazz in the field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be said that Bill Barre is still very Horizontal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think so?" The Viscount snorted and his voice was full of depravity: "A stupid mercenary can't tell the difference between humans and elves." The difference between the two would rather help the outsiders not obey the order. What kind of skills can such a person have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Morgan Knight closed his mouth and did not express any opinion - But this may be his point of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ultimate winner of this war is actually a young man who is not known. It is said that he was only a low-ranking sailor a year ago. This world has changed. So fast, let's have one more neighbor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Hemqiu in the west of the Ghost Fog, what is the use of that place?" Morgan Knight gently He snorted and said: "There are only a few towns and wastelands, and there is nothing to produce. It is very difficult to build a castle. The only advantage is that it is far enough away from Deepwater City and farther away from the Prince's Highness."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it’s very close to the legendary dragon, maybe this is his cuddling. I didn’t expect that there was a dragon inhabited on the holy peak. It is said that the dragon Will protect Siegel's life, provide him with the ultimate asylum, and don't know if it is true. Even if you throw this away, a mage is already dangerous enough." The Viscount got up from the chair and moved to the stiff shoulders. And the arm, then stepped on the study with soft slippers. His energy has been getting worse and worse in recent times, and it is likely that the magic tower being built outside the castle has influenced him. Every day, he can hear the sound of jingling, and he knew that he should not agree with Knox’s request for land. But why did you agree at the time, the details could not be remembered, maybe the Morgan Knight can still remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked inquiring, but he did not get an answer. He turned around and saw that there was no one around him. The strangeness of the heart of Zillah’s heart has not yet emerged, and it has been forgotten. He seemed to just squat, and then he quietly opened the door to the bedroom, full of thoughts of sleeping well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Macabu and the hub, Ximu Town also has a red magic tower that is rising. The Knox Commonwealth has invested enormous wealth and demonstrated its talents on the New World. The magic towers they built not only did not drive away the surrounding residents, but also provided a large number of employment opportunities, so that the population of the place has increased to a certain extent. Moreover, since the merger with the Masters Association, the Knocks of the Knox Association have gradually begun to appear in the public. They always draw attention to them with a kind and fascinating language, and then slowly win their favor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This emotional identity also spreads within the Masters Federation. The Knox Association handed in some of their unique spells, and the flash of thought flashed the Alliance's mage. They have asked to deepen their discussion and explore the limits of mind control spells together. There is even a voice that requires the addition of the "Red Heart Tower" belonging to the Knox Association next to the Three Peaks Tower. This kind of sound was quickly suppressed. The magical protection of the Three Peaks Tower and the surrounding is the guarantee for the Fellows to settle down. It can't be easily changed. Therefore, it was proposed to build a red heart tower in the deep water city, which can be compared with the Sanfeng Tower. There are many mages who support this proposal, but the ruling parliament of Sham Shui Po did not pass this bill, at least for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
