			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bald bear rushed forward and suddenly felt the ground under the foot vibrate, a clay bag arched from the front, and two large rock arms first stretched out. He screamed and jumped up, stepping on the earth and the giant body that had not climbed out jumped into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long handle is like falling from the clouds, and Siegel’s head is in the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exclamation of the southern lord coalition, Siegel was turned from head to toe into two sections, the axe had been smashed into the soil, splashing gravel countless. They took a breath of cold air because they found that there was no imaginary scene of blood. Siegel still looks at his opponent with a smile and is unharmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the illusion that he casts, and the warrior who is eager to fight is not aware of it. Felton, who was watching the game from a distance, was alert, but it was not certain that it was too late to make a sound reminder. Now the bald bear is in trouble, the earth element giant rises up, and the huge fist hammers his back with a whistling sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, the warrior pulled out the long-handed axe and slammed it backwards. Huge power with the sharp weapon, the arm of the earth element. He shouted loudly and called Siegel a coward and a clown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s voice suddenly appeared in his ear, but the voice was subtle, but it was very clear: “You are just a hired thug, what qualifications are with me? Duel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Rats!" The bald bear turned to the side and naturally couldn't see anything. The mage used a spell to voice him, and he didn't really talk in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are just a bait, like a piece of meat hanging on a hook." Siegel continued: "Although it looks oily and fragrant, but When the fish bites the hook, it will be dead. Do you really think that you can survive by yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth element grows another arm and continues to The front punches and fights with the soldiers. The rock hit the plate and made a dull sound, but it was never able to tell the opponent to knock down. The bald's counterattack accurately hits the opponent's shoulders, chest and ankles, causing a huge and obvious wound, but it is also impossible to kill the earth elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only need to summon a soil element to trap you, even without the power of lightning and flame." Siegel's voice is near and far, The bald bear is irritated. "Do you know what your end is? I will let the earth element squeeze your internal organs out of the skin. Then I step out of the gap in the armor. Except for the wreckage of the armor, there is no one in the world." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton is far from the side, and the situation on the battlefield has changed his perception. He knew that the soil element of Heim was guarded, but he had never heard of the fact that the earth element could be "regenerated." This must have been improved and a new spell was used. He did not expect Sigel's means to emerge endlessly, or a mage who can constantly improve his own spells, which makes it difficult to judge his means, nor can he use ordinary tactics to perform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every element of the earth is not lost. But he couldn't penetrate the opponent's armor, but he was hit many times by the axe. It is bruised and bruised, and many places are ragged and ready to fall apart. However, everyone who knows the eye knows that the winner must be a monster of earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By continuous slamming, the action of the bear seems to slow down, the dagger is not as swift as it was at first, and more importantly, he finally closed his mouth. . Everyone seemed to be able to hear his heavy gasp, accompanied by a burst of buzzing buzz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My soil element will never fatigue, unless someone blocks it for you. Otherwise you will be exhausted." Siegel continued to speak and quietly blended Miscellaneous let the bears produce a timid spell power. "You will die alone here, even the body will not be complete. Oh, I will leave your mouth and tongue, feed the dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the source In addition to his constant ability to regenerate, he is fully dominant, but this is a disadvantage that has led to a loss. The bald man tried to pull back and turned around the earth element to the side. The helmet limited his view, but he was very clear about the direction of the trench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is waiting for him to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth element slammed forward and the two men twisted into a ball. The armor made a harsh squeeze. The giant bear finally couldn't support it, and the knees were soft and smashed by the earth elements. He tried to turn around and slammed into the trench. The masked assassins hidden in it stunned. Bright eyes convey doubts through the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His drink revealed the identity of the assassin. The original so-called duel was just a joke. A joke used to cover up despicable intentions. Felton frowned, stretched out his right hand and made a few gestures to cast a message to the assassin's head. In addition to confirming his identity, his subsequent orders were simple, killing stupid bald bears and getting out of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was prepared and kept staring at the opposite camp. He hides behind the chest wall and turns on the ability to see the magical fluctuations. Communication is very easy to identify, but only the early master can intercept. What kind of instructions will the enemy give in such an emergency? Siegel made a bold guess and then deliberately set the game, taking advantage of the character of the bear and the situation on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately cast exactly the same spell, followed by the enemy's communication technique, just added a sentence: "Remove immediately to the main account, come back to rest "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soil elements are getting closer and closer, and huge shadows stick out from the trenches. The bald man stood up and held the long handle. He wants to fight for his own survival, but he also plans to find the right time to retreat as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The masked assassin received a message, judging from the first few words that this is a real command from the top. Siegel's words were mixed in the back, mixed together, and he was taken seriously. So the assassins took out short swords, lied to help deal with the earth elements, and then followed the bald bears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock fist was held by a long-handed axe, but there were several short swords in the gap of the plate. The blood that was blackened by the toxins was moored, covered with a skirt, and oozing into the soil along the shiny leg. The weapon in the hands of the bald bear fell. He just wanted to say his last words, and his head was hit by the earth elements, like the eggs in the stone. The huge headless corpse fell and leaned against the edge of the trench, which was extremely miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at it! This is the despicable Siegel, actually ambushing the man and assassinating my warrior!" Felton yelled and used influence Emotional spells make everyone blame. "There is no knight spirit, it is the shame of the nobility!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A southern aristocrat is obviously very emotional, with a slightly stuttering tone should say: "Fortunately... Fortunately, you didn't fight with him. How do you have a real title based on deception and evil spells? How can you have a real foundation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since he arranged Assassin, we don't have to waste our troops to attack the city. It is better to ask the Golden Fingers to take action and directly solve the problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton shakes his head and continues Maintaining an elegant manner, the whole body seems to exude a majesty and light: "Siegel's self-destructive personality does not mean that we have to do this. The jazz of justice, our blood vessels are flowing with noble blood, how can we descend ourselves? Identity, and assassin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton's words naturally cannot be transmitted to the battlefield, except the lords of the Southern Allied Forces, who can't hear. The victory of the earth element warrior is the main theme on the battlefield, and it can begin to chase the assassin. Masked people will not stay on the front of the battlefield, they immediately follow the order to retreat to this array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! Those assassins! Don't let them get close!" A knight shouted and pulled out the sword in his hand. The smarter person took the long bow behind him and waited for the command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton knows badly, hides his hand under the cloak, and quickly casts the spell of the mission, commanding the masked assassin to leave. However, Siegel had been prepared to suppress spells with him from afar. The same spells will cancel each other out and will not have any effect in the end, so Felton's message will never reach the masked assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't hesitate any more!" Brown Baron from Garco Castle raised his right hand and ordered his attendant to raise the square flag. "These masked people are not as cheap as the Cavaliers, but it is very troublesome to encounter the militia, or shoot it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton is still doing Spell confrontation, I did not expect how to stop it. The Baron Brown waved his right hand and his archer made three rounds of volley. Masked assassins roll, evade, and commit themselves to the trenches, but they are still shot dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not fools, knowing that they have been betrayed, the former employer seems to want to save some expenses. Their heads blew a few whistles, and the remaining three assassins lowered their bodies and hid them in the shadows. Just a few moments of effort, the archers have not seen the masked person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
