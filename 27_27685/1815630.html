			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisons that have been assembled by a number of gods have long since resumed operation, and the light wall that reaches the sky extends all the way to the edge of the crystal wall. Surrounded by a straight beam of light in the wall of light, it is a regular beam of light that is blocked by the ten-faced scorpion that blocks the wall of the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only after becoming a god can Siegel see this arrangement. The source of the power of the light wall is far beyond the wall of the crystal wall, mixed with the regular fragments of the gods of the thunder wall, including his magical god, which has the same blocking effect for each god. The only way to crack this is to use the blood of the mortal to pollute the wall, so that the power of the wall can penetrate, so that the rules of the prison can be suppressed to the mortal state, and then there is a chance to create a loophole. The last time there was Turner's assistance, the guards of the Elf Ranger, the Druid and the Warriors were all sacrificed before they opened a temporary passage for Siegel. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering this method, the Mother of the Earth will withdraw all the jailers, staying in the outer areas and avoid being controlled and utilized again. Only leave him alone to guard here, while slowly recovering the Holy Power. When Siegel broke open the space blockade and sent it to the front of the prison, he was already feeling. Hesitated for a while, he felt that he could not give up his responsibilities, so he smacked his head and came to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long time no see." Siegel said with a smile: "Do you want to stop me this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is my duty." The halfling clasped his throwing rod - a large castor mounted on a long stick - looking at Siegel with a strong eye . From time to time, he slammed into the sky and worried about the long-range blow from the sky. Xingsuo's electromagnetic gun left him with a serious psychological shadow. Now every time there is a shadow flying over the day, he will hit a beggar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to be hard, how can you get inside? I don't think you will shut Turner permanently?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can get more than four gods to agree and accompany you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It seems that this is really a prison!" Siegel snorted and walked over to the barrier before reaching out. The halfling, "Hey?", raised his hand and tried to stop him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real power to block Siegel is the regular power of the light wall. Like legendary spells, there are at least a thousand different "rule seeds" on the wall, most of which have not been seen by Siegel. His power is concentrated only in the realm of magic, knowledge, and prophecy—predicting that the ministry has been handed over, but the lack of management does not mean forgetting how to use it, and at most it includes some creations, elements, immortality, and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more here, and Siegel can probably guess the war, strategy, travel, the land and the sun, and the rest is completely strange. . These rules are the embodiment of the gods and then combined with the rules of the crystal wall. Where mortals do not have enough power to pass through, the gods are blocked because they are too strong, just like the isolation of the crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The last time I killed a lot of elves, is it necessary to re-establish the bones and blood into the river?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, I don't allow you to use evil spirits to cast evil spells." With the familiar voice, the Elf Saint appears next to the halfling, along with a strong warrior and a big beard. Dwarf. This dwarf exudes the glory of the saints, but it is not the one that Siegel is familiar with in the channel of the crystal wall. However, it is not difficult for the Holy One to change his appearance. Perhaps the Dwarf Saint has absorbed too much radiation and dust, so it is easy to understand how to change the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, now I have four saints in front of me. Maybe you can agree to let me in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, or Lord of the Magic, what are you going to do?" asked the Elf Saint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You all know that the world survived the power of the devastating storm by relying on the power of the scorpion inside it? For so long, you have Haven't you tried to find an alternative?” Siegel said to them: “I can communicate with him and then try to work with him to work together to block the wall of the storm forever. Is this reason enough?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not say that the ten-faced scorpion was brought out, but made recommendations from the perspective of saving the world. "No, we still don't agree with you." The dwarf singer snorted and replied: "The inside is the place where the scorpion holder is held. As the holder of the scorpion, you will definitely try to take Turner away. This is against Things agreed by the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you do that, you will be hostile to the gods and fall into a very unfavorable situation," said the Elf Saint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My ability to find allies is still very strong, and not all gods are satisfied with the current arrangement."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several saints glanced at each other and then said by the Elf saint: "We have fully communicated and believe that the situation now needs to change. Siegel, you have only been a short time to become a magic god. The process of adaptation. We are worried about the impulses and arrogance in your character. They may have disastrous consequences. Every new god will do this, but to a different extent. The thing we want to avoid most is the war of God. The time of the second god war is calculated in a hundred years or even a millennium, much larger than your current age."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred man put his hand on the hilt, scales As his movements creaked. A hoarse voice came from under the helmet: "In the war of God, our experience is much higher than you, but you have the ability to manifest in the main material plane. This advantage cannot be offset temporarily. So the final As a result, apart from the loss of both sides, he did not think about it at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf saint stepped forward and said to Siegel: "Look at you as a new god. On, we decided to move you once. Of course, instead of letting you go in, you will do one thing. When you are done, there will be more than four gods agreeing to your request, and willing to give you a separate Turner has the opportunity to talk, but no more than three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you talk about first? I need to measure which method is more cost-effective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, you should have done it. This thing is completely made out of ten scorpions." The Elves of the Holy Spirit said: "The northern part of the New World is in the storm. There are a lot of ghosts in the vicinity of the wall, they are getting more and more restless, it is very likely Threatening the safety of the world's souls. You can find a solution to this problem, this is our proposal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will take a long time." Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s shorter than God’s time.” The Elf Saint advised, “And I know you have a way.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he suggesting? Siegel looked at the Elf Saint, a god with a long history, and it is not surprising to master certain secrets. However, they are right. It is not impossible to force a customs clearance, but the price paid is too great. Since these saints have already said the war of the gods, then there will be conflicts, and God will not let his threats become empty talk, and the war of God will inevitably begin. Siegel has not fully integrated his own power. There is not much difficulty in eliminating several saints, but the war is another. In the foreign domain, he will be defeated, and only in the crystal wall system of the Lei Wall world, he has sufficient advantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the God of War says, the biggest possibility is that both lose. Even if Siegel has confidence in his ability to develop, it does not mean that he can defeat racial gods like dwarves and elves. So now he has only one choice to receive the offer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I will go to see the shadows of the dead, and strive to eliminate their threats as soon as possible. But I also have a request!" Siegel on the four The saint said: "If you blame me for not transferring Turner, what should I do? In order to avoid this, I will send a saint to guard here. He will not try to enter or destroy the barrier, and will stop everyone. Enter. Do you accept this proposal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several saints looked at each other, communicated with their eyes, and finally nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel used his power to break open the space, reached out and grabbed one of his clones. The fire passed through his body, and the clone was indeed a saint, but the power was relatively weak. Without the ability to resurrect several times, the cast spells barely reached the level of the common mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he can serve as Siegel’s eyes and ears, perfectly transmitting information and staying at the barrier for research. The entire wall of light is full of various rules and seeds, and Siegel wants to say that he is not curious that it is purely deceiving. Even if you go to the North to solve the shadows of the dead, you can't give up trying to break this barrier by your own means. At all times, you should be proactive, even if you are passive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not know whether a few saints are very respectful of their commitments, or simply have absolute confidence. After seeing Siegel's clone, they only reminded him not to try to break through or destroy the barrier, and then left. Even the half-human saint of the Mother Earth has left, ending his guardianship here. It is very likely that he knows that he can't stop Siegel at all. Only God war has enough deterrent, so he won't stay in the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
