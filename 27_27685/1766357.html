			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came to the nearest mine on the ground two hours later and finally understood the final destination of the blood spider. There is a sloping channel that has collapsed by half because there is no reinforcement. Under the stacked gravel, the body of a giant blood spider waited quietly for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel fired an energy missile that accurately hit the long legs of the blood spider. Unexpectedly, its limbs are like dead wood, which will be destroyed by a touch. In the exoskeleton, the part of the body tissue that should have been turned into an empty tube, nothing in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dead body that has been completely rotted by time. From the perspective of the surrounding environment and the integrity of the corpse, the ultimate cause of death of the blood spider is not like landslides, but hunger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dwarf closed the mine, the blood spider first lived a comfortable life, leaving a lot of spider eggs. But it soon found itself in a forgotten corner where there was no food to eat. Instinct tells it that it should climb to the ground as soon as possible, where it is wider than the ground and there are more opportunities for foraging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the dwarf is closed with the runestone is almost indestructible, and it can only find other outlets. Following the instinctive guidelines, it began to excavate the rock formations. Even if you have a limb that can pierce steel, it does not work in excavation. The huge body also increased the amount of work it needed, so it didn't complete the escape route until it died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those eggs should be eaten by themselves, just to reserve more power." Locke stepped on the body of a blood spider and knocked it with an axe. Its empty shell. "Siegel, I know that you have doubts about the motives of the dwarfs, even if you don't say I can see them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so obvious?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have lived for more than four hundred years, and most of the time is on the ground - we are not the kind of miners who only know how to dig deep." Locke said: "Although the Walled Mountains are very rich, there is always a day of exhaustion. If you don't find a way out, you will be trapped like a spider in a place that seems to be ruled by it and full of freedom. If you find that the situation is wrong, do it." Change, I am afraid there is no room to change, it means war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you say so, the final war is inevitable." Siegel thought Nass. I thought of a powerful army based on a devastating world. "If the city wall is not enough, it will go to the western wilderness, but if the whole New World is insufficient?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves carrying the blood spider body stopped to work and watched Siegel. There is a firm look in his gaze. Locke said: "So we have to go all the way to the west and understand why the wall of the storm is retreating. What is the appearance of this new continent? Whether it was originally created or created. What is the reason for us? With this piece of paradise, can we reproduce this process. The god of dwarfs teaches us that creation is the greatest force in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now I Some understand." Siegel nodded. Call the gas element and take out the energy lens scepter. He continued to excavate the unfinished project of the Blood Spider, which is not far from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Fazak also left the Heim collar and went to the Elf’s forest camp. He rode an ordinary hummer and wore a fur coat without carrying any armor and weapons. When he saw the ancient tree of war far away, he stopped his mount, raised his hands high and turned his palm toward the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't see any elves with his own one eye. But he believes that he has seen himself with the vision of those forest residents. The ancient tree of war stopped and there was a whistle between the leaves. Fitzak's horse's ears trembled, and he slowly walked four hoofs and walked toward the old tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is good, even your own horses are controlled by the elves. Fazak has never understood why the elves who have always lived in harmony with nature suddenly became the initiators of the war. Do they prefer to study poetry, art, and more awkward theology? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse crosses the field, which was originally a phthalocyanine field. After no one cares, we have begun to grow weeds. Originally, the turnips grew fastest in winter and will be harvested next spring. However, according to the current situation, the crops here are wasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse himself went under the old tree of war, then stopped and looked down at the turnip leaves on the ground. Fitzak came down from the horse and had to raise his hands because of his age. So when I landed, it was awkward. Then I heard a familiar voice coming: "Be careful, don't worry, you are safe here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak holds the saddle with his hand Straight up. He saw Elf Leah jumping from the ancient tree of war and standing in front of him. She changed her attire, no longer the light green inlaid leather armor belonging to the Ranger side patrol team, but the luna knight breastplate inlaid with silver. A machete is hung on each side of the waist, and the handle is inlaid with green gemstones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longbow behind Leah is still the original one, but this time her vows who is the enemy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect to meet you here, Miss Leah." Fitzak snorted and licked his sore shoulder. "You definitely won't shoot me with a bow, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liya nodded, her look was very complicated, her eyes were not willing to have a relationship with Fazak. communicate with. The one-eyed old man can see the contradiction of the inner spirit of the elf. Heim’s collar is also the territory owned by her apprentice. It is not a place that can be occupied simply by bringing the old war trees. In addition to the stone-walled walls, the invisible walls of emotions are even more indestructible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s too tired to hold hands, I really have reached the age of retirement." Fitzak sees Lia is still silent, it is no longer tight Force her. He only needs to know that Leah has no enmity against Siegel, which means that there is still the possibility of negotiation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want you to be embarrassed," Fitzk said. "Siegel asked me to come and see the elf general here. Ask. The next step of the elves. These huge trees are walking around all day, and the fields have been trampled. If you don’t want these phthalocyanines, can at least let our farmers leave some?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The area where the ancient tree of war is located is the territory of the elf." Lia lowered her eyelids and answered mechanically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This big tree behind you is called the war tree? In fact, the territory comes from war, from history, or from Farming. Your big tree is coming, we can't do it. But it doesn't mean that the seeds in this place are planted by you. Are you doing fertilization, watering, and weeding?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf wrinkled his brows, and it was hard to get the courage to keep his voice from shaking. "Fazak. I am not only the master of Siegel, but also the captain of the Arc Moon Regiment, responsible for the action in the southwest. I understand Siegel, he will not send you to talk about the Jingjing. What are your requirements? Let's just say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Lord said that Heim’s collar has not had any conflict with the elf. On the contrary, he himself has a lot of cooperation with the elves. For example, the element runes Guard and..." Fazak looked at Leah and sighed and said: "Leah, in fact, many things are more familiar to me than you are. When you are in the Elven Forest, you are with Siegel. Those spells, The curse is too sloppy, I have spent a lot of thoughts and can't remember, I won't say much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liya nodded, barely squeezed a smile, Said to Fazak: "I know all of this, so the ancient trees of war did not besieged the city of Mire. The walls you built are very good. I know that there are dwarfs and helpers, and it is very unwise to attack the city. And our elves also I don't want to attack the castle and kill more. We hope that human beings It is enough to recognize the reality, leave the land of the elf, and go back to the side of the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lea, you know that I am from the northern part of the walled mountains. I have lived in the orc territory for a long time. I have seen the war between them, tribes and tribes, heads and heads. There were various reasons for the war, but it did not affect the war itself. Now your elves can control the situation, at least I have not heard that you kill innocent people or burn the village. But then? As the human lords become more and more anxious, the possibility of desperation is getting bigger and bigger. You tell me, what? When will the elves order war ancient trees to attack the city? How many elves do humans need to kill before? Ten? One hundred? Five hundred?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I don't know, I don't know." Lia said: "We have war trees, and humans can't win. This is very obvious. Why do you want to stick to it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War is not mathematics, ancient "It’s not omnipotent," Fitzak said. "The Lord of the Lord said that your true enemy is not the peasant of the arable land, nor the knight of the armor, but the Knox Association that built the Red Tower. The lord of mankind always wants If you care about your people, you won't fight with you easily. But Knox is not like this. They can exert their power without any scruples and have enough resources to compete with the elves. The Lord's adult means that if you want Really want to use pressure to control people, control the true scale and extent, and avoid evil killings, so what is the use of scaring ordinary people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
