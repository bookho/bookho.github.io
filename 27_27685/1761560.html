			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Morritt Wilderness is located in the southern part of the Ghost Fog, not far from the sea. If it was before, you can go south from Ximu Town and follow the coast. But now the ghost fog swamp has expanded and this road has disappeared under the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Moore have to go south, all the way through the territory of the southern lords, and then turn to the east to get around the Morritt wasteland. After leaving the scope of Heim’s control, the road became dangerous. Siegel found abandoned dead bodies on the road, his clothes were taken off, and the red strips were foraged by the crows. Some of the cottages were empty, the house burned into wreckage, and everything was removed, leaving only a few watchdogs that survived and choked in the black ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore rode a round and came back and reported: "No one is in the village. I saw a big pit at the other end. There are a lot of ten inside." Several bodies, but neither buried nor cremated. The mill on the hillside was also demolished, but the food inside was removed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mill is The important financial source of the lord, even this can not be defended, indicating that the place has completely lost control." Siegel looked at the attack with the eyes of the lord, asked Moore: "Who do you think will be so cruel ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it’s a squad, maybe a robber who is acting on the plane." The waiter thought about it and added: "It should be the wicked passing by here, they It’s only cruel to leave once, so it’s so cruel.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel then asked: “Who is the territory of this place?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Anpa family, they joined the coalition and attacked the city of Mith, it seems to be a heavy loss. Moore replied: "There are few traces of fighting in the village. The number of bodies does not match the size of the town. Lord, do you say that the villagers have escaped?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hope so." Siegel said: "I am going to cremate the body, you wait for me for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel observes the village with his own eyes, I saw more than Mordo. There are only a few horseshoe prints on the ground, indicating that the enemy is not dominated by cavalry. On both sides of the pitted road, you can see some pits that the pig's trotters stepped on, and some traces of towing. It seems that the robbers have harvested food from the village and then fled north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Moore said. There are not many traces of fighting here. The roadside fence did not collapse, and no one removed the stone from the wall to attack. Weichai's axe is still inserted on the wooden pier, but the axe handle has been burned to a residue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the robber does not have a thatched roof, there should be more clues. The evildoers are clearly in despair. They are desperate, and there is no thinking about the future when they rob. Siegel is not a child born to a noble family. He started from a sailor and naturally knows the way people live on the bottom. Many times, mountain thieves and pirates will not rob the villagers of their things, at least they must leave enough weight to make ends meet. They need to get information from the villagers. When is there a caravan and when is there a nobleman? At the same time, they also need to hide and sell. Even in the year of hunger, they will give the villagers some food, which is more kind than many lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw the big pit, and the body inside was lying flat. Moore ignored one thing. The robbers killed the villagers, lit the village, and will leave as soon as possible. So who is digging the pit? He turned on the vision and looked around. Sure enough, the hidden figure was found in the field not far away. They are hiding behind the mounds and trees, looking at the direction of the village with a cautious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably a villager who is hiding, and Siegel thinks that they are coming back to bury their loved ones. However, this place is very close to the ghost fog and swamp. The simple burial of a large number of corpses is likely to cause the energy of the dead to gather and produce the undead. Many funeral ceremonies are to avoid this happening, but now there is no pastor around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage took out the water bladder from his pocket, poured some on the body, and threw a torch. Of course, it is impossible to ignite the body, but he can cover up the situation of his own spelling - for those who observe it in the distance. He is burning with fire oil. The magic wand is secretly waved, the flame rises, and the high temperature instantly masks the evidence of evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel no longer sees the red fire and the flying ashes. As for the people hiding in the distance, he can't help. I only hope that they can go to the Heim collar, where there are at least no thieves and bandits. He rode back and saw that Moore was surrounded by a group of people holding manure forks and long poles. The young attendant is still riding on the horse, and the hand is pressed on the hilt, but it has not yet been drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave everything, you can still leave you alive. Now one or two people will die, no one will care!" The man who spoke was about forty years old, shaking his hands with sharpened rifles in his hands, not even metal heads. . It is impossible for such a weapon to penetrate Moir's chain arm, let alone the dragon skin below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw this scene and stopped. He hid behind the house to see what Moore would do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people who don’t have the experience of using weapons can be seen from their gestures, pace, and chaotic scenes that block each other as they move forward. Moore learned a lot in the city of Mier, knowing that these people are just a rabble, as long as a charge can break up. The only thing that prevented him from doing this was the look of these people. There was some greedy look and some numbness, but the most was fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Sergey Siegel is back, it is easy to destroy these people with his magic. Even if you don't use it, the martial arts of the Lord's adults are very good. Can these unruly robbers persist for a few seconds? Mohr thought for a moment and said to these people: "If you want to live, you will go northwest. Heim is safe there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We Don't be safe, we have to eat, and your life!" The man with a long gun gnashed his teeth, added strength to himself, and closed his eyes and slammed. Moore held the reins in one hand to control the horses, preventing them from trembled because of panic, and the other hand took out the long sword and instantly cut off the woods. The middle-aged man only felt his hands open and opened his eyes, and found that the long-sworded sword stopped in front of his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll!" Moore shouted: "Or die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the number The advantage can not be frightened by this lone knight, everyone like birds and beasts, rushing to run outside the country. Moore is wary, in case there is a cold arrow at this time, it is not dangerous. He waited for a while, and the surrounding area became quiet again, as if the previous things had not happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel riding over, he is very satisfied with Moore’s disposal. "Let's go," he said. "This road leads to the castle of Ampa. Let's go there and rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went for a long time Finally approached the castle before sunset. The last glimmer of the setting sun left the castle, and now only a large shadow is overlaid on it, far from the dead. The thorny pigeon flag of the Anpa family swayed weakly. Only a few sporadic windows cast light. There were no patrolling people on the wall, only the light from the burning brazier in the arrow tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of the castle has been closed, and there is no guard at the door. It is impossible to open it. Outside the city walls are affiliated villages, all located on the south bank of the curve. It opened a distance from the castle in the north. Moore pointed out to Siegel an inn, the walls covered with lime were covered with vines, and the roof was covered with a thin layer of slate. The inn has a stable, and the firewood is neatly stacked in the corner of the courtyard, and everything is clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was light in the window, the chimney came and there was smoke, and I wanted to come here without being harassed by the robbers. Everything looked fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron column swayed a fragile signboard that read "Rose Field Inn." The two men did not see anyone until they tied the horse. Then he opened the door and went in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young girl who was about eleven years old and whose hair fell to her waist, staring at the two, she still had two holdings in her hand. Boiled beans and bread on a plate. Her gaze saw the arms and armor of the visitor's waist, so she insisted on calmly saying: "We are out of business here, not to entertain guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel looked at it and found no other person to understand the reaction of this little girl. So he said: "If this is the case, is there any other inn around?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl thought about it, if they lied to leave, when these people discovered Maybe I will come back to find her. Isn't that more dangerous? And these two people look strong, maybe they can help themselves. Besides, my father always taught her to be honest, so the little girl said: "There are no other inns around, you can go find someone to sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not bad people. We Will pay." Siegel pulled out a gold coin and showed it to the little girl: "You have ready-made horse stables, beds and stoves. We only have one night for two."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that gold?" The little girl swallowed: "You only eat and rest, don't do bad things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
