			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a good mood at dinner, Siegel continued to learn spells in his study at night. Try to unlock the secrets of legendary spells with the only information on hand. Through bright candlelight, he examines his spellbook over and over again, taking the trouble to dismantle the structure of the spell and find out the most secretive connections and structures in order to capture the essence of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are often scrolls and letters on his desk, so the window is rarely opened during the day, and the servants here are told not to go to the study without instructions, so The air in the room was a bit boring. Siegel walked to the window and opened a heavy buckle. The refreshing night wind blowing on the face made him feel better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the courtyard of the Star Fortune, he can see that there are still many rooms in the main fort. It seems that the King has not rested. Evan is also very busy recently. He complained a few days ago that he has called Siegel as a helper, but his workload has not dropped. The recent events, from the Orthodox Church, the Doomsday prophecy to the situation in the New World, are all challenges for the new king. And the conflict between the Masters Association and the Federation, Lear and Siegel is enough for Evan. They are all powerful forces, not just a few dukes to deal with. He is a king, which means more responsibility, burden and pressure, which means he can't do whatever he wants, just like Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Stars of the Royal Family can't get rid of the influence of the city, and even many lords simply don't want to get rid of the city. There are consultants who can help with daily chores, which can greatly reduce the pressure of work, and in this respect, the city counselor has always done a good job. Isn’t Siegel himself the same? He needs to study magic, so he needs a small council to assist himself. For the aristocrats of the Starry Kingdom, the City Advisor is a very handy tool. For a long time, the work of the industry has never happened to be a betrayal of the lord. Even if it is the recent doomsday prophecy, it is not a lie. If the news is really from the school counsel, they have not deceived or betrayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the ability of the City Council consultants to act in unison does require the attention of the royal family. They established lord-level communications through homing pigeons, ravens, and other means, even the orders the king gave them. You also need to use this channel to ensure the fastest arrival. Many school counselors are also experts in animal husbandry and masters of cipher texts. To some extent, they have mastered the exchange of intelligence, even more than the intelligence chief wiki. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the situation cannot be reversed, then the order of the king can be obtained accurately and timely by the lords. It’s not what the king said. I don't know if the wiki has any thoughts and plans in this regard, maybe it is time to remind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel suddenly discovered that the school has long since taken root in the starry kingdom and is fighting a deep-rooted system. In this system, unless Evan decides to push everything back. Otherwise, a new lord who rises up like a nouveau riche is simply unable to make a radical change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this sentence is not absolute. Goblin technology is a way, and their communication system is not at all worse than the Master's crystal ball detection. Even if they can't make handheld communication devices, the telegraph system they have eliminated is better than the pigeons. Thinking of this, Siegel immediately sat down and tried to remember the documents he had read. It took only a while to feel the mind screaming and yawning in succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the recent thinking about legendary spells is too much energy, and that your mind is not without limits. The room has been replaced with fresh air, and Siegel closes himself by hooking the finger window. He stretched out a little, no matter what Evan, across the courtyard, didn't sleep. He is going to rest himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His plan was interrupted by a tap on the door, and the voice of the half-orc was passed over: "Adult, someone meets you, he makes makeup." , but they refused to report their names."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows this person knows. What is the use of ordinary makeup, the nose of the Orcs can discover the truth. But for professional spies, such as wikis or Janet in the past, they naturally have a way to deceive sensitive smells. It seems that this person does not have such technology. Has it done its best or deliberately concealed its strength? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let him come in." Siegel waved and folded all the scrolls unfolding on the table. Books and letters are also automatically returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visitor is physically strong, and the boots on his feet are still standing with fresh mud, but the tattered look is not exactly what he has just made. He wears the thick waterproof canvas that is commonly used by sergeants, and there are several historical patches on the yellow-brown rough material. His face was covered by a hooded cloak. All skin is hidden under the fabric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you see it?" Salk said in a weird, low-pitched tone. He quickly woke up and restored his normal voice: "You are a teacher, you have the means, I can only admire and admire. But I feel. The guard at your door also recognizes who I am. Is it my camouflage? Is there a big gap between the ability and the wiki?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the general manager, you are not professional after all." Siegel pointed to the seat, Then said: "Salke, I believe that you are not here to discuss the problem of camouflage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Marquis, I am you Friends, we have to talk alone, I need your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that things are urgent, so that you have to do it under your own jurisdiction. The masquerade dance party." Siegel nodded to Zucker and ordered: "You retreat, don't let others close." When the door closes, only two of them are left in the room, and Salk grows. In one breath, he walked to the side of the wine cabinet and opened the door with his trembling hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something that scared him, and the trembling hands couldn’t open the cork. "You want something to drink, or I will help you. Salk, you are still very safe here, calm down first, so that you can talk well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am sorry, Marquis, let you laugh." Sorke's mouth twitched twice, then said: "Trouble you, whatever wine is fine, sweet, not strong, my nephew Like smoking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his fingers, and the invisible servant took the job and sent the drink to Sorke. He grabbed the glass with strength and swallowed it, almost licking himself. Then the general manager said: "The Marquis, I heard the news, someone wants to kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You?" Siegel snorted: "This one You are not looking for the palace guards, but come to me? Do you want me to help you, slamming you to change?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Let me repeat, I am a little flustered, not clear.” Salk wiped the sweat on his head and said: “Someone plans to stab, there is me in the target. Other targets may be king and you, but one There are loyal guards who protect themselves, one is a sergeant, so they certainly can't succeed. Only me, poor me, have no ability to protect myself. If there is such a thing, no one will care for me at that time. I will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace, this kind of mindless thing... Siegel shook his head, but decided to listen first. "Where do you get the news, what time do they plan to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I walked in the castle and heard it unintentionally." Salk replied Dao: "It's not very real and clear, but I really didn't lie about this. They said that they want to make sure everything goes according to plan, and I am likely to interfere with the plan, so it must be eliminated. As for what plans they have, I will not I know, why can I interfere with the plan? I am also confused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will it be deliberately scaring you?" Siegel was a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think so?" Sorke looked surprised, then his eyes flicked back and forth, a little panicked. He immediately stood up, put the cup on the table, and said: "The Marquis, I only ask you for one thing, please let me stay with you. If there is something, please turn me off." The life is in your hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stared at him and nodded. Solk turned and left, but by the door, his hand had touched the doorknob and he turned back. "Adult, if I leave like this, would you not help me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe. Your identity is the general manager, how could it really be Staying with me?” Siegel shrugged. “I don’t understand what you are doing. I’m able to make up and suddenly say that I’m going to be assassinated, and my majesty may be the target. Even to some extent, they The hatred for you is greater than that for the king. I rarely rely on someone else's one or two sentences to decide anything, so I only visit you when you come, and then when an accident occurs, I will not Let the bad guys hurt you, but that's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are an honest person, I can hear it from your words, this is a rare Quality is very rare in Wangdu.” Salk released the doorknob and walked back again: “The Marquis, you are not suitable to stay in Wangcheng, if you have the chance, let’s go.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
