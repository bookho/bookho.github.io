			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red dot goblin has come up with its own true skills, using high-speed traffic lines, using the three-dimensional network in the air and sea, a lot of troops To the Xingsuo, the missiles covered the sky, and the explosion of the fire reflected the entire sky, even the small gossip of the earth can see this spectacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, the red dot goblin also broadcasts its own military operations like the whole world, and is equipped with the "big red point of mighty" awakening target. In their view, the zenith star's spaceship is like a whale that was encircled by them decades ago. Although the body is huge, it is bound to fail under the constant struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as you can shoot down the ship in your own territory, you can think of who will be the first lucky goblin to board with your ass. Even to a certain extent, the red dot goblin does not care whether the spaceship is blown up. The more debris the salvage work, the more red dot goblin needs to participate. Regarding the level of science and technology, Red Dot has full confidence in his own hands. In fact, only the narrow land has been restricted to the development of the Red Dot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My journey is the sea of ​​stars!" The red dot was excited and unable to self, waving a saber and shouting: "Assault! Charge! Charge! Let all the troops fire." Let the space-based laser fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lavender light descends from the sky and accurately hits the star. In fact, the color of this laser has been out of visible light, and purple is just a halo formed by spilled energy. Such a high-speed attack has no way to dodge. The extremely high-energy rays burn through the steel shell and leave a continuous incision on the ship as the spacecraft moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo screamed, she immediately mobilized a large number of ice crystals in front of the laser, reflecting and refracting while cooling. The melted ice was like tears, and it was a heavy rain in the air. Fortunately, the red-based goblin's space-based weapons need to be cooled, and they can't continue to work. This is the only way to avoid the bad luck of being cut into the next body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad! It hurts!" The electromagnetic guns that were able to aim upwards were all upright, and the fine gold projectile vented her anger at a residual image that was ten times faster than the speed of sound. Although the distance is too far to accurately aim, these warheads form a face. The red-based goblin's space-based weapon platform was broken into pieces in a metal storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it solves this trouble, it also leaves the opportunity for other weapons to approach. The continuous hit of the missile allowed the star to return to God. Re-inject the electromagnetic gun into the defense work. However, the missed wave of defenses triggered a chain reaction. The firepower of the red dot goblin showed a snowball growth trend. In addition to passive defense and maneuver avoidance, the star cable has been difficult to form an effective counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation becomes the opposite of firepower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This performance of Xingsuo made all the goblin giants see it. They nodded lightly, knowing that the researchers did not make a mistake in estimating the fighting power of the Zenith Star. A weakness is also mentioned in the latest report, that is, the firepower of this spacecraft has a ceiling, and it is impossible to cope with the advantage of quantity formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;red dot goblin is not qualified to see this report, but he also found it with his keen battlefield sense of smell. He immediately announced the opening of the boarding storm. Seven thousand goblins wore the "Tengu Samurai" combat armor they had dreamed of, and they took a high-speed launching bin similar to a cannonball, and they continually rose from the ground and rushed to the airspace where the star cable was located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very risky action, because the missiles that were detonated by the electromagnetic guns in the sky are still blasting, the sky full of fire and broken shrapnel are everywhere. The huge body of the star is also doing tactical maneuvers, and the huge quality makes her in the air like an invincible siege hammer. The goblin lander shouted "Bawa!", actively fired the shells in midair, and then rushed to the star with the remaining flight power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are groups of magic missiles that greet them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light curtain formed by the purple light ball is like a fireworks, a deadly fireworks. But in the red dot goblin, this is the most gorgeous and glorious welcoming ceremony. Their fighting spirits were smashed to the highest, singing with white foam and screaming to the other side of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Xingsuo went all out to attack, he was still successfully landed by hundreds of goblins. Their magnetic boots are attached to the metal casing, and numerous laser transmitters begin to work, trying to open the gap on the spacecraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, after the test of fine gold drill bits, the laser has the greatest impact on Zenith Star Technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo started the electric claw on his body surface. One by one, the goblin lander was cooked in paralysis. Or after the electromagnetic boots under the feet are damaged, they are smashed like dandruff. However, in this way, Xingsuo did not have enough energy to repair the gap that was made by the space-based laser. More than a dozen goblin machines that were closer to the gap jumped in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were the first goblins to successfully enter the interior of the spacecraft, which is a historic moment for the goblins. The red dot goblin leader even shed tears of excitement, he has no idea what emotion to use to face this moment. It seems that all the functions of the body have lost the ability to work in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with the excitement of the goblin, the star is uncomfortable crying - if she has this feature. The nasty goblin actually got in and took the light weapons everywhere to destroy. She continually issued a "hmm" cry, obviously overwhelmed. If it wasn't before the exercise of the ability to shoot with the secondary brain, the star rope would be sunk by the missile because of the loss of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master..." Xingsuo hurriedly said: "I am too busy to come, help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very well, learning to seek help is a very important step in growth, I will always help you, rest assured." Siegel immediately recited the spell and launched the Knox Anning Faction through the core of the spacecraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless smiley images flashed from the air, although they lasted for less than a second, but they stayed in the corners of all the landing goblins, and they flashed from time to time. It's like a person blinking at the sun, always leaving a fuzzy black spot in the field of vision, it will take a long time to disappear. However, the smile of the peaceful circle will not disappear so easily. Unless Siegel stops casting spells, it will stay there forever, and it will become more and more clear and more noticeable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple symbol can also resonate with emotions, not to mention the goblins who have long accepted this symbolic communication education. In the communication of the Star God Network, they replaced the specific face with abstract symbols for a long time, and even many goblins could not remember what the real smile they saw last time. In the world of goblins, Siegel doesn't even have to be as troubled as the Red Fortress of the Hubburg, and needs to be filled with portraits of smiling people on the walls - simple graphic symbols can satisfy all needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local fine mouth is touched by this symbol and starts to rise slightly, and the peace circle penetrates into their thoughts. In the first minute, their movements became slow and they began to appear. In the second minute, they showed a happy smile and the muzzle was low. In the third minute, they walked aimlessly in the passage, filling every touch. Satisfaction; in the fourth minute, they have no life goals, just hope to live with the happy symbols forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel issued orders, these goblins came obediently to the hatch, and then lined up and walked out one by one. Relying on the electromagnetic boots, they struggled to the edge of the ship, then jumped, flew like a bird, and fell like a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only landers, all the goblins within a radius of 30,000 meters have been affected, which has been able to cover a part of the ground. All the goblins who spent five minutes in the tranquillity circle lost their fighting spirit and then waited peacefully for death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the trouble caused by the stalker, coupled with Siegel’s ability to cast spells, Xingsuo finally completed the repair of the shell, at least from the outside. there is a problem. However, both Xingsuo and Siegel knew that the space-based satellites had destroyed two of the secondary brains, and the efficiency of the advanced creations was affected, and the power of an electromagnetic gun fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Accelerate, then carry out a surround blow," Siegel said: "Let those missiles chase behind the ass, so it's easier to intercept."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you can do this!" Xingsuo feels that the owner is too smart, so he can find a countermeasure so quickly. She first aimed all the electromagnetic guns at an area, cleared out the basic clean passages and accelerated the drill. The missiles are chasing behind, especially those artificially guided missiles. However, with the control of Sigel's elements, the star that overcomes the air resistance quickly broke through the sound barrier, and then doubled the speed of sound and tripled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s control of the elements of gas also forms other defenses: the secret energy and energy focusing lens, plus the master who is good at element control. A huge air vortex is formed behind the star cable, and after it is heated with fire elements, a huge tornado is formed. These powerful whirls are densely covered behind the spacecraft, like trees in the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
