			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of the Lord of the Morning reveals the truth. This woman named Janet has not imposed a curse, but it is indeed related to the prince's evil." Bishop Pastor Cooper The tone is gentle, but the sound is clearly audible in the hall. The holy emblem worn on his chest exudes a soft light, and everyone watching the light can't help but be convinced. "And according to God's guidance, this woman seems to be a demon, it is a devil. I suggest using fire and silver juice as a punishment to purify evil as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Janet raised her head fiercely, filled with fear and hatred. The fear comes from the punishment of fire and silver juice. Whether it is tied to the stake on the stake and swallowed by fire, or poured with molten silver on the head, it is the most cruel punishment. The source of all these trials is based on several magical effects. Ken is not a fact, it is all delusions and filth, so Janet is filled with hatred. She wants to swear and want to curse, but she knows that it is useless except for letting her suffer more. Under the care of the morning knight, she did not have the ability to escape, and the death penalty seemed inevitable. She thought of Siegel, then hid the curse in her heart and pleaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a devil, I have never hurt a prince. If you sentence me to death because I am a demon, I also recognize it because I am both It won't be the first one, it won't be the last person to get a crime for blood. I just ask for something, please let me jump off the cliff, just in the place where Siegel is missing. You can tie my hands and feet and let I can't speak, can't move, use all means to make sure I can't break free. I just want to be closer to Siegel, he is the only one who really wants me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Cooper Pastor frowned, the spells that detected the lie did not respond, which shows that Janet said the truth. What is the reason for this, is there another hidden truth? Although he had doubts, he did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you hurt him to fall off the cliff." Sir Bill stepped forward and reprimanded her: "I heard this from many people, but I have not been able to Find your verification. Can you say it now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, that is my fault." Janet replied with a cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill nodded and turned to Prince Aaron. Then said: "His Royal Highness, Baron Siegel is your royal jazz, and has been fighting for your loyalty. This demon is related to the disappearance of the Siegel Baron, as a knight's former knight tutor. I hope Can temporarily hold Janet in order to get more of the situation on the battlefield at the time." He also said to Cooper, the morning priest: "If the temple is willing, you can send someone to look after the person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately they can't do that." Evan suddenly spoke, then lowered his voice and said to the prince's ear. But the keen Earl of Todd and Pastor Cooper can still hear. He said: "The paladins and priests of the Temple of Dawn can only defend the royal family members, and can not participate in political affairs. His Royal Highness. This is our royal thing, many jazz and knights will work for you."<br /><br </br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Aaron nodded to him and said, "I have always been grateful for the assistance of the Temple of the Morning, this is the case. Hold her up, Count Todd, you will arrange If you want to ask her what questions, go. Poor Siegel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, please let me cast a spell. Good Blocking the devil's mana, lest she violently wounded." Pastor Cooper bowed and began to cast spells. Janet only felt a whirlwind, and the people around him turned into blurred light and shadow, and the distorted and funny faces were clearly visible. Under the influence of the spell, she gradually lost control of the body. Just like the last time she fell into a coma, a face that she had changed in the past appeared constantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd was just like watching the excitement, only that it was amazing, and Count Todd was shocked by a face. In the blink of an eye. He found a familiar face, which was seen before the Prince's Highness left the Old World and visited Master Lear. He did not pay much attention to the maid who was the master of prophecy for this person, but it is obvious that Master Lear will not have a devil maid. So what does Janet mean behind this face? He decided to check out the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell was finished, and a pair of white gold handcuffs restricted Janet’s hands and suppressed all her talents. Prince Aaron waved his hand and let the poor kitten go down and said to Pastor Cooper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Royal Highness. I will do it right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cell of the Black Blood Castle is facing the West, and Janet can see the last glimmer of the sunset. Disappearing scene. The sausages, bread, and clear water that were placed next to her were still in the way they came in, but they had already become cold. She looked at the darkness that came out from the outside, but did not believe that it would be her own ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal in the hand is cold and cold, but it doesn't look strong. If there is a tool to unlock it, she can try to unlock it. However, the knights who stand outside the gate are not good at sending them. No matter how they change their appearance, they will attack without any explanation. If you can break through this line of defense, it is not too difficult to leave the Black Blood Castle with easy tolerance and camouflage. How can I find Siegel at the time and explain to him after finding him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you confess to him that he is a spy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the end of losing professionalism, Janet said to herself. Although the cell is very cold, it is much better than the trial hall, at least one person can be quiet. But such extravagance was quickly broken, the iron gate opened, and Count Todd came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the prisoner facing himself, the count opened the door and said, "Janet, you have a choice now. Tell me what you did in the capital of the stars, I Can plead for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you let me go?" Janet did not look back. In order to steal intelligence, she is very familiar with the temperament of Wang Guozhong. Earl Todd is a stubborn old man, and no one except the royal family can make him change. But Janet still wants to try and keep a glimpse of Siegel’s hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't let you go. But you can hold you forever." The count said: "A loose cell is something I can promise you, as long as you and you "All the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still free, Earl." Janet replied: "I don't want to listen to the truth, otherwise I won't. It will be here. Maybe I will make you feel that I still have some secrets, which will make me live longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count frowned and shouted Said: "Don't think about going to the royal family. It takes a day to build a stake and collect silver coins. You only have to think about it for so long. I advise you to change your mind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door is closed, Janet can quietly be alone. ‘Where is Siegel? Is he good? Janet only needs to think about these things to be able to pass the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was opened again when the moon climbed the sky, this time Sir Bill. He came in with an oil lamp. I saw a piece of frozen food on the table and sighed long. "Go get some hot food, I have to stay here for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sent the guard at the door, put the oil lamp down, and held the sword Janet said: "You didn't harm the prince of the prince. Is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet smiled, she just said: "Jazz adults, what do you think than me? How to say it is more powerful, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz nodded and said, "I don't know you, but I know Siegel. Although he looks Stupid, but can tell who is a good person and bad person. Even if you were a villain before, you will give up bad deeds around Siegel, otherwise the kid will not spare you, and will drive you away." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you are right." Jenny nodded. This topic can also arouse her interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't let you go, please understand this." Sir Bill continued: "This is my duty, I can't defy it. Earl The adults are already preparing the stake, and the pastor of the morning temple is also helping, they will not do nothing, so your ending will be very tragic. I said at the trial to ask for information from you, on the one hand to avoid that terrible The way, perhaps in a more neat, more painless way, but now it seems that this effort has failed. Another aspect is indeed a problem to ask you, but has nothing to do with the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jazz paused. Then he asked: "Do you have a bed with Siegel, is it possible that you are carrying his child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
