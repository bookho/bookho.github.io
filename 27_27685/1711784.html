			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They crossed the outpost again, there are only two hired knight guards, bored and hiding in the sheltered place, the banner of the starry royal family is slantingly inserted in the rock On the pedestal. When they saw Jeff, they quickly surrounded them and said with enthusiasm: "Old gold coins, what brought with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are not many things, I only I can give you some private goods." Jeff took out two onions, four sausages and two big potatoes. "You can only give it to you. Save it with fire and bake it. Don't make it sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people thank you very much, then let the people go It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the situation in the mountain so bad?" Siegel asked: "Is the prince not in the mountains, can he not eat anything?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want to marry, the prince and the grown-ups naturally don't eat these things." Jeff grinned and looked disdainful: "They have a magical magic basket, every day. I can change a lot of food and drink. But the food is for the knights and knights. Mercenaries and followers, that is, we can't get anything from the magic basket. Sir Bill often puts his one. The food was brought out and mixed in our big pot. I have already persuaded him many times. He is already a master. He can no longer live like a mercenary. Otherwise, it is difficult for a free knight to go to him. It is also difficult. Attracting the followers - of course Siegel you are the exception."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Jeff talks about his embarrassment: the big castle, the flag, The fiery blacksmith shop and the knights who lined up to buy armor. "I want to find a wife with a big ass, who can have a lot of children." He concluded: "Can't be like a firewood girl like Janet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Janet is good, she can grow up with more food." Siegel said: "The days she used to live are too bitter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I bet the jazz won't like her.” Jeff said: “A knight needs a woman with a similar status to pass the blood and the child.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know who my parents are, let alone the blood. What kind of woman is different?” Siegel said with a smile: “I am just a little bitch, but not so much pressure. This is the only benefit of the fatherless mother. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope you can make a jazz, but I don't think it's that simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Janet listened to her ears and licked her lips and said nothing. ‘I’m just Siegel’, she thought this way, ‘no one can take him away’. Janet followed closely behind Siegel, looking for shortcuts between rocks and puddles, through pine, oak and tin tree forests. She began to be glad that there were still trees in the forest, because they finally had a roof that could cover the rain. After crossing a cedar that was burned by lightning, they finally arrived at the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never dared to imagine a spectacular castle in the middle of the mountains, so that he could sketch out a campsite surrounded by tents. I didn't expect things to be much better than expected: there must have been more castles in the past, and even the surrounding affiliated villages and towns were built according to the standards of the fortress. They are all stone buildings. Many remaining stone carvings can also see the runes of the dwarves. And mark. There are a lot of broken round walls around, a lot of different columns and broken stairs leading to the cliff. However, a landslide destroyed the area, most of the fortress and the city were buried under the rock, only the cave door leading to the inside of the mountain can be completely preserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp was arranged next to the gate of the cave, and the proposed house was built with stones, wood, branches and canvas, and the kitchen, dormitory and toilet were arranged. Surrounded by an earth embankment, the camp also digging a drain along the earth embankment, so that rainwater and urine can overflow. On one side of the earthen embankment, a simple door was made, and a horse was placed, but no one stood guard. Most of the people here are standing in the mud that can cover the feet, and the shovel is used to dig the second drain. It rained for four days in a row. This is not common in the autumn mountains. The camp is basically soaked in water. In order to find a place to dry the ankles, everyone has to work hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple counts, there are now more than 20 people in the camp, mostly wearing simple armor or chain armor, weapons are also various, with axe , short swords, hammers and even mace. These people do not have any family or knighthood logos, they are mercenaries, or they are better known as free knights. They saw Jeff coming in, put down the shovel in his hand, and greeted him with enthusiasm, helping him to unload the cargo on the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet, come with me." Siegel threw the reins to the person closest to him, then led the kitten's hand and walked forward. Although the ground was muddy, their hands were very tight and steady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the house is a wooden board covered with sheepskin, and Siegel pushes them away and bends over the threshold. There are already more than a dozen people in the room, standing around the table in the middle of the room, what is being debated. One person shouted: "You can't wait any longer, you have to send someone in." Another person said sullenly: "Who sent to die? Your person is still my person?" The brazier on the side of the house burned The bright red flame is reflected in these tired and muddy faces. Rain water infiltrates from the smoke hole in the roof, flows down the stone wall, and constantly washes the boots on the floor filled with charcoal and mud. The house is full of wet tobacco, sour red wine and stinky sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed that someone pushed the door in, everyone turned their heads and looked at the door. The armor on these people has a family emblem, an eagle that catches a sword, a girl who rides a horse, and a fish that jumps out of the water. One of them had a tiger head printed on his belt, and the man stayed by the fire basin for a long time. However, he first stood up after Siegel came in and strode over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows the face, this person is Sir Tiger-Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small nephew, long time no see. How did you find it?" Sir Bill grabbed Siegel's shoulder, twisted him and turned outward, dragging Out of the house, Janet was smashed out like a small tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came to the North by chance, and I met Jeff-Gold, so I was brought over." Siegel sucked his nose and smelled the jazz. The smell of wine. Compared with the time of separation, the Jazz seems to be a little older, and the horns are somewhat gray. His beard was unkempt, and no one was taking care of him. The black armor on his body was gone, and now it was replaced with a slightly worn silver scale. But the jazz's body still looks strong, and the fingers holding Siegel's shoulders are still full of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t seen you for more than half a year, little nephew." The Jazz said to Siegel: "To be honest, I don't really miss you at all. Follow. Elf Leah is okay, have you seen Eilet and Dio?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All good, all good." Siegel said: "I have to give You report the things under this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came to the corner of the camp and talked to the rain under a piece of worn stone. Siegel talked about what happened after they separated from the hub. Some things Janet heard for the first time. As they spoke, Jeff came over with a charcoal pot, took some onions and radishes, burned the frying pan with fat, and started to cook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Deepwater City wants to enshrine some pioneering knights and reward them with the lords of the border. I think this is a good opportunity to come to the north." In the end, I introduced Janet and said: "This is Janet, my travel companion, I want her to be my woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Xiaomao child, learning what is wrong with me, first learned to find a woman?” Sir Bill first smiled, then put up his face: “Which deep water city is the seal of the knight? They are just opportunistic businessmen, usually not even true face. Dare to show people, it is not the lord of the lord, where is the power to seal the courtiers? Only the knights they held have a little meaning, the knights that stand out from there will be recognized by everyone. You should go to the game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I didn't have a referral at the time, and I became a mage, so I couldn't participate in the Cavaliers game." Siegel scratched his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The practicer has nothing, but the money you earn yourself can of course be used as you wish." Sir Bill looked up and down again and noticed his The body and muscles are still solid, knowing that he has not put down the training of the soldiers. "But the Master is too time consuming, and it depends on talent. Many people have learned a lot of knowledge, but they can't cast spells. I still hope that you can continue to use your heart in the training of martial arts. You are the most I have ever seen. One of the people who are suitable for learning martial arts..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel's magical talent is very good, Sir... Sir." Janet is hard to plug in. Speaking, he said: "He is also a kind gentleman, thank you for his teaching."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Sir nodded and said to Janet: "You Where are the people? Are parents here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
