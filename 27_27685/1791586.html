			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel sergeant, thank you very much for being able to personally preside over the construction of the Guardian nuclear, and all the Masters of the Federation would pay tribute to your generosity." Master Wiewood, on behalf of the various faction mage, spoke to Siegel at the Security Council meeting. Other mages have stood up and bowed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said after the return: "I have had such a plan, and after I became a teacher, I have mastered some techniques that can The nuclear made improvements so that all the wizards could complete the magic item. But this work has not been completed, and some of the plasma lines have not come up with a suitable alternative, so this is not the best secret. Can nuclear. Now it is mainly forced by the situation, we can not ignore the threats before and in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow Shell Master smiled tiredly, she Respect and love the federation over any of these wizards, including yourself. Even though Siegel is generous, she is subconsciously wary. The ambitions and conspirators always exist, and they never disappear like the commander: "Do you have any opinions about the people who participated in the construction of the secret nuclear reactor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I will give this matter to the Security Council in full discretion. I am only asking for the magical ability to participate in the Master. Apprentices and junior mages will not come together for fun." Siegel smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your trust, **Master." Master Shelley made a convincing expression, she still did not give up temptation: "I believe all The wizard's mage wants to see the birth of the magic ship, which will be the most spectacular creation on both continents. Everyone will..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel If you continue to tout, he will change even more embarrassed. “I think, before the manufacturing is completed, try not to be too excited. Even if it is successful, you need to avoid stimulating the temples. In fact, I think they want to fly in the sky.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter echoed in the venue, and the proposal was approved by a full vote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Siegel led more than 30 mages to prepare to build a second Peruvian nuclear, but the first thing to accomplish was It is the power to strengthen the law of higher creation. If you use this array to prepare building materials, you will greatly reduce costs. At the same time, Siegel also shared the idea of ​​Nexus's assembly line with everyone. And I hope that everyone can work together in a standardized way and continue to reduce costs in a repetitive way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's also convenient to replace the same parts." Siegel learned a lot from making plasma shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, sir, I have a question." A mage suddenly said: "The higher creation law array can be made with the support of the Peruvian nuclear. The fictional material has existed for a long time, so if the secret can be made by this method, can it support its own existence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a Very good question, but one thing that can't be ignored is the mutual interference between the spells.” Siegel patiently explained: “When combining defense defensive arrays, you need to consider the interference between spells, especially Between magic with strong elemental tendencies, the Mire can provide a high concentration and a large amount of pure elements, which means it will have a great impact on the surrounding magic array. When I made the secret nuclear, I dare not place it next to the energy focusing lens, that is, the energy transmission system, to prevent mutual interference. How long do you say the Advanced Creations array can last in front of the elemental wave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard nodded and then asked: Will this time also install an energy focusing lens on the spacecraft?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and explained: "From the current design, the entire spacecraft However, two kilometers long and more than five hundred meters wide, the Mier can be combined with several energy markers to achieve coverage. No additional energy delivery system is required. After all, the energy focusing lens serves the territory-level range. It’s a waste on the boat.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have a variety of questions, and Siegel answers them as much as possible. He has a lot of experience with other people about the legal matrix, but it is not so proficient in other aspects. Many things related to spells and spelling techniques, as well as the creation of some magical items and the formula of alchemy pharmacies, Siegel also generously admits his shortcomings. "I am just a somewhat talented mage," he explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone only said that he is a self-important language, because everyone knows that no one except the madman dares to say that he is a versatile person. Even if there is a bachelor's title, it will not work. In fact, the Bachelor of Science really knows how vast the ocean of knowledge is. The slogan in the library of Xuecheng is: "The more you learn, the deeper you know, the more you know your deficiencies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarf's armor has a few sets of Count Siegel. Let's just look for the Lord to lend it. At least try to see what kind of damage can cause the dwarf's wounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is a generation of lord Mana to come forward. Siegel gave the key to the weapons collection directly to her. The test methods of the knights are very simple. Put the pork in the armor, fix it, and then drop the steel forged awl from the sky to see if it can break the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took advantage of the biggest gap in Heim's collar: the mine platform of the Striped Mountain. The conclusion is that the quality of the dwarf's armor is extraordinary. No awl can pierce the armor, but the best is left with a dent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana told Siegel about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dwarf's opponent must use a ranged attack. If it is a melee, I won't make up much after the stab, which is too wasteful. And it is not suitable for the front line. On the battlefield, only the use of 弩矢 or arrow will cause multiple holes in the same person.” Mana pointed the dent on the dwarf armor to Siegel. "The Lord Lord, is the armor that the dwarf gave you the most sophisticated, completely beyond the equipment of their troops?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be comparable. Siegel said: "The dwarves know that I can't wear their armor, so the gift is mainly for the nature of the gift, not the actual combat. Some armor uses more steel, thicker than the actual combat troops, but does not mean The enemy can't wear a greater thickness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the bodies we salvaged, all the dwarf wounds did not attack their weapons. They The body is bare, there is no metal. And, do you remember to find gold from the ashes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold? Dwarfs can also produce gold?" Mana stunned and then suddenly realized: "You mean gold teeth and the like? There is no similar discovery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's take it from my warehouse A set of fine gold weapons, I remember that there are fine gold arrows, maybe able to test the broken armor Method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana smiled twice, but saw that Siegel was still very serious, so he said: "Lord Lord, you don't really think of the dwarf Are all the enemies using fine gold as a weapon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think only such an enemy can bring the dwarf up to spirit?" Siegel said: " Anyway, try it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using fine gold equipment can cause wounds similar to the dwarfs, which makes the Knights of Heims take a breath . On the one hand, it is how the headache protects against such attacks, and on the other hand, it is completely attracted by the words of fine gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wouldn’t want to have a set of fine gold equipment? That is the representative of the highest quality of armor and weapons. But the Cavaliers must first find a way to survive this attack before they can think about how to get the gold deposits that the enemy has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve days later, the body of the dwarf finally began to decrease, and one or two at a time, only need to leave water elements to guard here. The priests were finally able to take time to purify the water, and the Shield River finally became clear. But this disaster has led to the basic extinction of the creatures in the water, and it is impossible to capture the catch from here in the short term. It is expected that after a year, when the fish reappears in the river, the water here can be used for drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although well water is not very good to drink, it is very good to be able to guarantee drinking in a very special period. There was no infectious disease in Heim, and the disease in the village was neither spread nor caused by death. The plague in the prophecy did not form. This made Reid and Siegel feel a sigh of relief, at least the Golem foresees The scene can be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard-to-drink water makes the city of Myrtle more dependent on the drinks that come from outside, and the sweet wine and the mellow ale suddenly have a broad market. The easy-to-preserve rum is more popular, and each store stores a few barrels, and the vendors quickly grasp the business opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the East Gate of the day, there are more than 20 carriages lined up on both sides of the road, filled with large and small barrels. If the road that is not the head of Heim is smooth and easy, the heavy barrel will have to cut off the axle on the road. In addition to the barrels, there is a box of apples and oranges, and the ability to relieve the hunger-thirsty watermelon is also very popular. Many cars have guards next to them. They will follow the nobles and embroider small logos on their chests. This is actually a rating based on ability and task performance after the establishment of the Adventurer's Union, which allows employers to have a more intuitive understanding. At the heart of the union is the lamp god made by Siegel, who is able to assess and process a large amount of information, and has no selfishness, always justice – and always loyal to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
