He said that the matter of the Orthodox Church made Evan angry, not only because they tried to rebel, but because they really did. A small team raided the manor housed by Aaron and had already rushed to a place less than 20 meters from the room of Aaron. Under the blockade of the brave guards, they were defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron died the next day because of the shock. His body is too weak to support the next breath and heartbeat. Under the care of the pastor of the morning shrine, Aaron walked very peacefully, without any pain. But this matter was maliciously smeared and passed down into Evan to conceal the killer to consolidate the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the three aristocratic women associated with Aaron were also taken away, with children who had not been born for a long time. This kind of intention is obvious, that is, using Aaron's blood heritage, as a reason to continue to shake the rule of His Majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The evidence obtained by His Majesty is very true, but he still does not believe that Sir Bill will be involved. I am now in agreement with His Majesty’s point of view that this is a planting The other party’s means are so brilliant that there is no guarantee that there will be more sensational evidence afterwards.” Director Sergek said in the letter: “The Sergeant Siegel, for the peace of the kingdom, please be sure to pick up the Viscount Bill. As long as he is placed under your supervision and no longer appears, it will not cause more serious problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sentence in the whole letter Washing up the grievances of the Viscount of Bill, this shows that the situation has been very urgent. Sir Bill in the starry kingdom, at best, manages a Piaget collar through his wife's relationship. Even if he really raised the anti-flag, it actually didn't work. In the whole matter, the ultimate goal of framing Sir Bill is to influence the relationship between Siegel and Evan, and only in this respect can he play a more important role than the Earl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must find Sir Bill, there is no time to delay." Siegel said to his wife: "Who is the best tracker in our territory, who is the best protection? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet shook his head: "There are people in this field who are talented in this field, and can be faithful and trustworthy. But..." She was silent. After a while, then said: "Although I don't want to admit it, only you are the only way to solve the problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stunned. Then he said: "I certainly want to go in person, but I am not very proficient in tracking and investigation, and my goal is so big, wouldn't it be a surprise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to go to the Star Kings. See Evan directly and strengthen the relationship between the two of you." Janet said: "Only the relationship between you and the two is as close as ever, only the trust between you is still unbreakable, then Sir Bill. In order to be safe, you can find and protect him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Jenny features nod. Siegel analyzed: "The death of former King Aaron's Majesty will be used, and his children - and not whether they are born or not - are also used. I think Sir Bill is hearing the wind, so it is only Let the wife divorce, and then go out. He is very dangerous now, because only if he is dead can you really deteriorate the relationship between you and Evan. Even if the ambition does not say, you will not doubt whether it is under the king. Hand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could it be Evan?" Siegel shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not Evan, it’s His Majesty the King." Janet said to Siegel: "Look, although Evan said that he does not believe that Viscount Bill is involved, But he did not issue a decree or announced his asylum, so Sir Bill is still a fugitive party. Because of this, the general manager Salk will be anxious, I hope that you can take Bill away quickly, so that no one will kill him, then plant it. Evan is down. Sorke is very loyal, but he is only loyal to the king. What you have to do is to quickly eliminate the real reason that threatens the life of Bill Sir, so you must go to the Star King in person, and you can't use the projection method. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the lords of all royal titles. Siegel was the only one who did not go to the ceremony. Once the minister had raised an objection, Evan refuted it with the reason that he had witnessed the handover of the kingship on a stone boat, and there was no need to look at it again, but it was always a stain that could not be avoided. In the eyes of the lords of the kingdom. Siegel is far from the New World, or the king's "little scorpion". He holds the vast territory and enormous power and has been detached from the control of the kingdom. Now this generation is okay, Evan and Siegel are very close friends, but the next generation. What about the next generation? The long-term stability of the starry kingdom requires good rules, and the king’s oath of allegiance is the most important one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel understood the meaning of her words and strengthened her confidence, so her brow stretched out and the haze in her eyes swept away. "It seems that I have to go," he said categorically, and there is no doubt in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet really hopes that Siegel can stay with her, this time the enemy uses political plots to fluctuate, and Siegel is not good at this. He has never been to the Star King, but she is very familiar with it. The capital that knows the power of the Star Kingdom is just a place where there is a sin, and every breath is accompanied by honey and poison. "I will accompany you," Janet said. "I can help you there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took her in her arms and used Hand rubbed her back and comforted her and said, "No, you stay, I need you to sit behind the town. Heim can't mess, here is my foundation. Obviously this time is against me, who knows There will be a backhand in the New World. The situation here is more complicated, and even if you leave, even the small council can't be held."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Janet really does not want this. She hopes to see Siegel every day, even if she can't see it, she knows that he is in the city of Mire, working in the laboratory, and can find it at any time. Although I can't help myself in terms of magic, I know that Siegel is safer than everything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, she also knows that going to the Star King is a very dangerous thing, I don’t know how many plots have not surfaced. "You...you must be careful, no one should trust, even Evan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so serious?" Siegel scratched his head, some I don't quite believe it: "If I say, I am also a sorcerer, and it is the Royal Marquis. What else can they do? Even Lear can't say that he must beat me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are not mage, but politicians, they will never try to defeat you, no one will think so." Janet said: "They will only harass you, make you feel uncomfortable, disgusting, disgusted and even angry. From this, they will be able to obtain their own interests. You must not have invincible thoughts, because you have to face the majesty of the starry kingdom, he must be able to overcome you, at all levels. Those touts Your people will be worse than those who are hostile to you. You remember this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK, I will act on the plane. The main purpose is to shoot Evan. The horses are all over the world, so I remember it." Siegel said to Janet: " On the one hand, the search for Master Bill's actions can't stop, and it is more important to make him safer than anything else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it's better to be more important to the king. Janet said: "No matter what kind of means the enemy uses, you can't win if you don't act rashly. Because in the frontal battlefield, you will always have an advantage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Understood, this time I will go as a knight and act as a big aristocrat. But if someone wants to provoke, I will use the sniper's means to swipe, so that we can establish a frontal battlefield in all aspects. I am also going to take the Starship spacecraft, so you have to contact the Federation and ask them to take care of the Heim collar when I am away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to worry about these, I will handle it well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A letter was sent out as quickly as possible and sent directly to Evan. In the letter, Siegel expressed his thoughts on His Majesty the King and his "sister", that is, Queen Ai Meng, hoping to have the opportunity to see the stars. Siegel will not be stupid and so on. He has already let the Xingsuo be fully armed and ready to embark on a trip to visit relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of Heim’s collar want to join, and it is a great honor to be able to see the King as a Marquis Guard. But the more people there are, the more complicated the relationship is, and the more likely it is to have problems. Siegel thought about it, according to Janet's opinion, only brought a half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you encounter a bad situation, you will smash the table." Janet is so arrogant: "Whether the opposite is the Duke or the Earl, you There is an absolute advantage in this aspect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... I haven’t done it for a long time, since I started studying and studying." The special eyebrows gradually erected, so I quickly changed my mind: "But please rest assured, I must be the guardian of the Lord's adult, no one wants to make him angry! You said with a fist, I use my fist, no magic! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the first experimental product to be instilled by Siegel, Zucker was one of the first colleges to join the School of Magic. His ability in elemental sensing is not strong, but it is surprisingly very talented in predicting spells. However, his ability is very unique, saying that good is never to be tested, but predicting bad is ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
