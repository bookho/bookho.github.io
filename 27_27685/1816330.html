			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the blinds should be together", this is the last words of Turner to Siegel. For him, nothing is more important than this. As the first awakened nephew holder, he was burdened with this responsibility from the very beginning. He did not regard it as a burden, but accepted it and paid his life for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not without regrets, especially in the loss of eight-faced scorpion and four-faced scorpion. Siegel had no power to blame him, and even the two who died were aware that Turner did his best. Siegel only hated that he was not there at the time and did not have enough ability to make better choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner could have left, and when he saw Siegel, he had already made plans. All the scorpions have been found, whether it is persuasion or tough, Siegel has the means to bring the Nana of the twelve-faced scorpion and Evan of the hundred-faced scorpion. However, Siegel chose to permanently solve the threat of Lear and bring a safe living environment to the deaf. There is no god in the world of thunder walls that can threaten the holders of the scorpion, but Turner is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel swears by the Styx to avenge Turner. After that, he stood up and used his power to flatten the ground of the jail, pinch a stone tablet, and use a variety of words to create a tombstone: "The person blocking the wall of the storm." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, he sent back to the Heim collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Heim’s collar, many people are in a hurry, with a trace of panic on his face. The disappearance of the gods not only acts on the temple, but has now begun to subtly affect ordinary people. They will feel the feeling without any reason, just as they know that they have forgotten something, but they can't remember it. An anxiety hits the heart, causing nothing to concentrate on, and can not feel the joy of success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They instinctively went to the Temple of Magic and took the last divine power from there. Not just ordinary people, some of the other priests who stayed in the city of Mire are also going to the Temple of Magic. They have various reasons to convince themselves, curious, academic exchanges, and visits. But it is undeniable that they have begun to have desperate feelings in their hearts, and there is a deeper sense of anger. They don't know that they have been abandoned, but they have a vague feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw this scene and immediately spread his power and sprinkled the light over the city of Mith. He flew slowly over the city, marching in the direction of the castle, and passing the words to everyone's ears: "Don't panic, magic is still there, God's eyes are watching you!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bathing in the light, many people feel comfortable and relaxed again, and their emotions are gradually stabilizing. But this is just a small corner of the world, and Siegel’s light can’t be completely covered by Heim’s collar. What should be done next, how to avoid a big panic, how to maximize the evacuation effect, all need to be well planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Siegel drifted into the castle, Janet flew to it: "What happened outside, is there something wrong? I have always been Restless, there is no response to the prayer of the Mother of the Earth. Do you know anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, come with me, bring Isaac and Megan, let's go to the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why go there? I won't go, I don't want to see Wendy," Janet said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And Mana is it, don't you want to see her?! You always see her in the small council of Heim, isn't it? Is it a kind of torture? Ah?!” Siegel suppressed his anger and took a few deep breaths before saying: “Sorry, there has been a big change outside, very urgent. My temple is the foundation of my country, must Go there. Now, go find Isaac and Megan, we go to the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet was shocked, she was the first time See Siegel like this. She licked her lips with her tongue, and thought about it at this time, then nodded. "Okay, I will take the children to the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pulled Janet, who turned and wanted to leave, said to her: "Simply say In a word, the gods have disappeared. Whether it is good or bad, now it begins to grow uncontrollably, and emotions can easily become fierce. From crying to anger, you may only need a blink of an eye, so be careful. Not only yourself, but also the people around you. Calm down, don't use emotions, but judge with knowledge and experience. The god of knowledge is still there, so this can still be stable."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only me." Siegel barely made a smile and then disappeared from Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array of stars in the Stars is still running, but they can’t stop Siegel from becoming a god. He didn't want to come so early, after all, the change in identity made him feel awkward when he met Evan again. Only through correspondence, strengthen the friendship and connection between the two, at least offset the impact of God, Siegel will come to the king. But now things are urgent, and he can't take care of these details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel descended to the square of the palace, and was parked next to the berth of the magic ship. His sudden appearance immediately caught the attention of the guards of the palace, and the whistle representing the warning had been put in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyebrows were picked up, silenced the whistle with silence, and then the group of humans fixed all the soldiers into inactive statues. He saw the carriages parked on the Star Square and recognized their family emblem. All are family members of the pre-meeting meeting, so the position of the king is easy to determine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, all the people trying to stop him were fixed until he came to the king’s conference room. The former guards saw Siegel, on the one hand, opened the anti-magic field on the armor to be on alert, and on the other hand asked him what he meant? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came here naturally to find the King." Siegel’s nose shook a few times and asked: "Why is there a bloody smell here? The feeling of the Holy Spirit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the morning, several assassins suddenly appeared, trying to assassinate the king. The assassin martial arts is strong, but our king is more heroic than them. His majesty killed the assassin, and the smell you smelled should be left by the servant who has not cleaned it.” The guard heard the sound inside the door and nodded to his comrade-in-arms. He closed the anti-magic field and said: "Lord Marquis, the king allows you to go in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven people sitting in the conference room, and they look at this Siegel with their different expressions. Ever since he left the Star King, he has not heard of him for a long time. Evan also looked at Siegel up and down, with an inexplicable smile in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Evan has indeed experienced a big battle, his forehead and shoulders are still hurt, and the traces of bandages are clearly visible. The broken magic sword "bonfire" was placed at the conference table, where Evan reached out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A long time no see, it seems that your martial arts has finally begun to rise, even the Assassin with the Holy Power can solve." Siegel nodded to Evan Even if I have said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you guess what the Holy One is coming from?" Avon seems to be very satisfied with his record, and there is a flamboyant tone in his conversation. "I am an enemy three."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never seen all the saints, but the sacred one must be one." Siegel carefully felt the palace The remnant rule of power, then said: "There is a feeling of thick and heavy, will not have a halfling in the assassin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is indeed one. He did not Come to me for trouble, but use the earth wall to block my guard." Evan put his hand on the hilt and gently stroked it, then said: "I should thank him, if it were not him, I would not be able to Everyone is strangled. Guess, who is the rest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be honest, I didn't feel the third saint. You Unless I let the spells reappear yesterday, I can't guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy One of the Lord of the Morning!" Evan is on the table. A punch is punched. "They suddenly came to my house and asked me to hand over the scorpion scorpion, and then I smashed my hands! They actually looked at me with mercy and good eyes for me, and said the robbers were so righteous. I thought I was the dawn. The Lord's saint, his endorsement in the world, did not expect another person. Siegel, you are right, there is no trust in these gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You're fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I won't have anything. But the Temple of the Morning has a big deal." Evan said: "I have Ordered to pay the temple of the morning sun and punish them for treason. Now, they should have already attacked the door of the temple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He blinked his eyes and took a panoramic view of the temple area below Wangcheng. After losing the support of divine power, all the temples became chaotic and fragile, and no one could stand under the charge of the knight. Even a mighty morning warrior, no gods are just a little stronger fighters, and soon they will be defeated. Siegel has seen some of the morning priest's heads being strung on the rifle in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
