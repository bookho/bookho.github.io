			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using easy-to-use spells and messaging, Siegel can dress up the lamp gods. In the past, Janet had a sensitive body and could definitely see it, but now I am afraid she is hard to detect. If you go to the spell lab yourself and then let the lights go from there, it is safer to go directly to the venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything must be prepared, it is best to keep your game and your time in the stands as staggered as possible. For example, on the first day of the opening, he needs to make a speech according to the usual rules, so he can't arrange his own game. This involves a lot of work, and even the order of the lottery. But here is the city of Mire. All the magic is under the control of Siegel. It is not difficult for him to do this as a lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After thinking about all this, he was in a good mood, and he kept a small tune on his way to restorative training in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage often stretches his mind through meditation, and Siegel has another way: muscle. Sweat is a method of bringing out impurities from the inside out, forcing the body to create new tissues and replace old and aging parts. Although it will make people breathless and tired, but then the ethereal and relaxing is not a substitute for any brain movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel listened to the sound of his muscles, knowing that they accepted a clear command to begin growth and recovery. At the same time, he could hear the sound of metal crashes and the sound of people singing in the racetrack outside the castle. Some of the fighters who are preparing to participate in the competition are warming up there and adapt to their new weapons. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim is rich in wealth, or finds a way out for his sudden increase in steel production by forty times, announcing the standard blunt swords and shields for all contestants. If there is no suitable armor, there are three body types of breastplates that can be loaned to the participants for free. If you want to customize the half-length plate, you can also reduce the price by 10% for each round. It is estimated that the game will take 12 rounds, so the champion will have 20% more armor money in addition to armor for free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious half body armor needs five hundred gold coins, and the fine armor needs to add another two hundred gold coins. For some less prosperous free knights and mercenaries, they are often full of confidence – both about their martial arts and their computing power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just don’t know what level of iron prices that Heim’s collar is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a plan made by Janet and Lampshen II, which is much higher than the income from selling armor directly. Considering that steel and armor craftsmen were originally important resources for the lords. Not suitable for selling with the merchant's strategy, Siegel nodded and agreed to the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era of hammering swords and bows, armor is particularly valuable because of its important protective effects. The new era is coming soon, and Siegel has foreseen it. The goblin musket will make the era of armor knights gone forever, and it may be the last large-scale knight competition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight comes from a warrior and comes from a long sword in his hand. When using a long sword, it is not only the strength of your hand: your feet should stand firm. Your legs are going to hold back, your waist is going to sink, your shoulders and arms are going to open. Your ears should listen to all the sounds around you, and your eyes should see the present and future of the target. You have to make sure that there is no stagnation in every joint, and you have to make sure that the blade hits the opponent's weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the cutting of weeds with sickles and short swords, the swordsmanship taught by Sir Bill has been accompanied by Siegel. In the deduction of Siegel, there will be no force from the foot to the hand in the future battlefield, leaving only the eyes and a finger. Pulling the trigger and firing the projectile, only half of the current sacral bow is simple, but it has dozens of times of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he made the crossbow of the power generator. For the sake of "Knighthood", he only made five ammunition shots. Only he used a special cross for his own spells. Although they have not seen the impeachment of the goblin, their guns are fired for bursts. Siegel estimates that the number of ammunition is between 12 and 30. The cost may be the only thing to consider, not the launching mechanism. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an improvement would eliminate the Cavaliers, and Siegel’s blunt swords were used to force the dummy’s wooden poles in front of them. Cut directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me one more, move faster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, it is the knight class that is about to disappear. He believes that with the adaptability of human beings, a new generation of new knights using muskets will soon appear. They will undergo new training methods and adopt new command methods. Use new tactics and tactics. On the road to their rise, there may be a generation to a generation of knights eliminated by the times, but I believe there will be no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good thing for human beings. As one of the four strongest races, humans have the best adaptability and tactical organization. The dwarf's learning cycle is based on thirty years, and the elf is sixty years. This is enough for humans to update two to three generations of fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs have a shorter life cycle and more frequent reproduction, but their learning and organizational skills are slightly worse. As for gnomes and halflings, they have nothing to do in the war, but instead will be the ones that are least affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, Heim’s decision can’t be a problem. It is better not to have a big tree, but to make the territory of the castle and the knight smooth and peaceful. We must find ways to train a new generation of knights, and we must do this on our own initiative. Those knights who hold the past traditions may not be suitable for future development, so we must pay attention to the new generation from this competition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers will eventually change, so will one day face the same problem? When magic can no longer be used with special elements and physique, or with the help of tools, when everyone can cast magic, what will the Master do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this is not the most terrible situation. Although the current gnome's musket is fierce, it has not exceeded the limit of the Master. There are hundreds of ways to avoid strikes for formal mages and sergeants. But if a weapon like a vanity can be mastered by ordinary people, then the status of the Master is not guaranteed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a knight in the face of a densely grounded musket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has some good luck that the Void Gun was developed by his Master, which gives the Master sufficient time to cope. So the strongest force in the world is not the rise of force, but the ability to research and adaptability? If we consider that mortals can never be omnipotent, then the survival of the fittest is the truth of the multiverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows his own thoughts and thinks more. Recently, he used his brain too much, and some of them were far away. He threw the sweaty towel to the servant and relaxed his shoulders while walking towards the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, the knights destined to be eliminated by history were dressed neatly and rejuvenated, waiting for Siegel’s interview. It is not so troublesome for a single member of the martial arts team, but Siegel is not only the Earl of Heim, but also the sergeant of the Federation, which makes his identity very sensitive. The ** division is equivalent to the duke title in the kingdom of stars, and the territory that Heim has led to his "duke" has real power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid the situation becoming too solemn, it was misunderstood as the king to meet the courtiers. Janet arranged singers and dancers in the hall, and put a simple meal in the form of a federation meeting. Siegel did not wear gorgeous aristocratic costumes, but the elf-style armor that did not interfere with the spelling, and met the visitors like a warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the hall is full of music, laughter and the snoring of the iron boots on the slate. The dancers danced in the prescribed area, and the musicians were instructed to play only the songs of courage, kindness and victory, so the singers turned over and over were the songs, and Siegel quickly became bored. He looked at the people in front of him, nine out of ten did not know, more than 80% of the family emblem has never seen. He even saw a young man who used his seven-pronged squid to make his own family emblem, and he often turned his eyes to himself. What does it mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no common topic with these people, except for the false greetings, it is the same encouragement and appreciation. Fortunately, there are many foods available, and only meats include uncommon varieties such as crocodiles, sharks, yaks, and antelopes. Of course, some meat can't be brought up, such as white geese that symbolize holiness, horseback riding and dog meat. The well-prepared and hearty dishes gave Siegel a lot of good ideas:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, the shark was captured by a heroic captain from the deep sea. The three crew members were injured. The shark is a powerful predator in the sea, representing vigilance and bravery. You should try it more!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although using the lead The topic of the method speeds up the speed of the interview, but he still feels that the mouth is twitching very quickly, and even a smile expression is very difficult, which is much more exhausting than the chanting spell! I remember that when he made the secret, he had been chanting a spell for a day, until his voice was dumb and not as tired as he is today. You should use a illusion on your face when you are not paying attention, and you can maintain a constant smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
