			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sneaking away from the South China Sea Watch Castle Inn, Yao En led the entire team to lurk down and find the right opportunity. They do have very professional knowledge, enough to make Evan or Siegel open their eyes. A group of five people opened the entrance to the bottom of the sea, sneaked into the stronghold of the murder god along the passage of the abandoned garbage, and then proceeded cautiously. Their purpose is very clear, to find the Siegel that was taken away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is a arrogant, impulsive and untrustworthy person - the original words of Naria - he is still in this operation Companions, and did not make stupid actions that endanger the safety of the team. Instead, he shared the attention of the servants of the murderers and made an early warning before the danger came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has enough reason to start a rescue operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial actions were very smooth. They solved the coughing and sneezing problems of the gnomes and cleaned up the seawater to ensure that they did not leave available for action. Tracking traces. Ai Meng uses her long pole to explore the road. Naria detects the magic trap. They carefully avoid the enemies that pass by and slowly move toward the core of the base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they accidentally fell into the channel of an infinite loop, and they were stuck in it. Siegel first used locating to find them at this time, so the Master felt that the position of several people is constantly changing and difficult to access. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took more than four hours for Naria to finally figure out the mechanism of this passage and come out from it. At this time, it was dawn, and Siegel launched an attack on the base. The pedestrian decided to speed up the action and learned about the location of the cell through intimidation. Then support each other, killing a bloody way from the servant's servant, and trying to move in that direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They arrived at the laboratory of Master Reese and found that it had become a ruin, and there was no trace of Siegel caught. Yao En knows the true identity of Siegel, and all this in front of him relies entirely on spells, so he can think that Siegel has been out of trouble. So in his opinion, Siegel can leave this place at any time as long as he can deliver the spell. There is only one goal for the entire team. Leave here as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they fell on the way back on the black sacred sacred god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan first saw this guy in a black robe trembled, which heralded a hard battle to start. The black man took off his hood and revealed a pale face because of lack of light. He has no hair and eyebrows, and his pupils have a faint gray color. The lips are like bruises like corpses. Although there are no weapons in both hands, everyone can feel that this person is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to my temple, little mice." He rubbed his right hand and said: "I introduce myself, my name is Chanem. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan. Stars, the king of the kingdom of stars. The guardian of humanity - Evan too wants to introduce himself like this, but his reason tells him that this is not a good idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry about your broken name, playing or not?" For the first time, he felt that he was particularly unpretentious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak well! Have the ability to let the horse come over!" Ai Meng put the stick across, keeping Narya behind him and standing firmly beside Avon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Interesting, do you really think you can resist?" Chanem said: "I will use my right hand to open the sword and guide it to hold the stick. Then squeeze from the middle of you. Break the nose when the glasses sister is too late to react, and take the dagger from her belt. The priest will try to attack me, but I will lead him to miss. Then use the dagger Inserted in the middle of the gnome's eyes. This is my plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you dreaming?" Ai Meng raised his chin: "I won't give you Such an opportunity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why. I am the Holy One of the murder god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am still the god of murder, his sister!" Ai Meng lost the long stick and took out the battle sickle. "Come on, use a sword to hold the stick that I threw on the ground, fool!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the saint finally brought a touch of blush, apparently Was affected. Evan controlled the trembling and had entered a complete state of combat. His eyes stared at Chanem and said to Emmon: "I love you, I really like you more and more!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle started like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is very cautious, keeping the shield in front of him. Holding a long sword slowly approaching the opponent. "Follow me behind me, don't pull away." After he finished, he continued to adjust his breathing and let it stagger with his own pace to balance the ups and downs of the body. He only dared to blink one eye at a time. This is the skill he learned from his opponent. Any negligence can be fatal in the face of a dangerous opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney moved, but his knees and ankles did not bend at all, but they still moved abruptly. In the eyes of Evan, the black man turned into a vague shadow and flew straight to Ai Meng. With his eyes, he could only see a few white traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the afterimage of Chanemâ€™s fingers. His speed is so fast. Evan has no time to think about a better coping strategy, and can only hand over the sword. At the same time, he turned his body and picked up the shield and slammed into the shadow. Weapons and armor exchanged identity, but as long as this strategy works, it can save love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meng also noticed the enemy's attack, but the mind was too late to think, only the muscles responded. She only realized that the black shadow flashed in front of him, and then there were two consecutive metal percussion sounds, and then I saw Evan and the sacred murderer slammed together, and the palms and swords and shields held together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fast speed! Yao En!" Ai Meng waved a sickle and rushed up. A hairpin rubbed her ear and flew to the face of the saint in the seams. The hairless bald head snorted and forced a downward pressure to let Evan squat on the ground with one knee. Yanya swept away with his bald head and inserted it on the wall behind Chaney. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naria did not hesitate to recite the spell of the magic missile. The four balls of light hit the body of the saint accurately, but they were absorbed by an invisible shield, only a faint ripple in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy resists magic!" Naria said: "I can't hurt him, first help everyone!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The glory of the Mother Earth protects the evil warriors, guides our weapons, and protects our safety!" Arnold raised the holy emblem, and the brilliant light shrouded the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the use of this?" Chanem's hands were hard, cracks appeared on the shield immediately, and thick rust spread along the cracks. The other hand caught on the sword was forced twice, but the magic sword did not respond at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him somewhat confused. How do you see this sword is common, why can you resist the rust spell? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan saw the opportunity from the subtle expression changes of Chanem, with a slight shift in focus. Lift your foot and kick him. He only felt that he had kicked a thick cotton bag and there was no feeling of hitting the human body normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With your feet? Who do you think you are, legendary monk?" Chanem snorted and his body jerked. Evan and Ai Meng all went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next goal must be to flee to a weak wizard or gnome. Evan did not dare to wait for the landing to adjust the balance, so he used a long sword to support the ground, and at the same time, the shield was pulled out to adjust the posture. When Chanem rushed to Naria, he finally arrived in time and blocked his opponent again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's fun. Swordsman, reaction and speed are fast, but your sword can't stop me." Chanem keeps his hand off Evan's offense. The direction is obviously the flesh and blood of the palm but can be slashed under the sharp sword. He said: "Only by joining my majesty can I live, I will give you this opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan did not pay attention to his words, only one thought in his mind, That is to defeat and destroy the opponent. He hopes that his sword will be faster, more powerful, and more angled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaneyâ€™s light gray scorpion suddenly shows murderousness. He suddenly holds Evanâ€™s sword with one hand and the other hand scratches his throat. Come, a white afterimage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itâ€™s too fast. And the turning point is extremely abrupt, there is no normal power-force process. Evan's face suddenly changed, and the warnings in his heart rose, knowing that this is the key moment of life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can your own long sword be mastered by others? Isn't that just putting your life on it? Evan made up his mind to put his own destiny on his sword and the swordsmanship that has been honed for a long time. The fingers caught in his eyes suddenly became clearly visible, and even the fingerprints above were clearly scored. And the hand holding his long sword is flawed, there is still a gap in the force movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
