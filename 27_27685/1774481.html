			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet did not agree with the plan for reincarnation, at least not at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been without symptoms for a long time, and I have to take care of Isaac now." She reluctantly said: "I want to feed him, change one." The body is not going to work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, it is really impossible. The old body is dead once, and the new body does not necessarily have breastfeeding conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there are other troubles, such as the uncertainty of the spell and the appearance of the new body. Siegel looked for relevant information from the Federation Library and had only a few words about the Druid's reincarnation. According to the Master, the process of reincarnation can neither control racial change, and even the gender is uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idiss laughed after hearing it and let Siegel rest assured. "The race can't be picked. It can only be played by the elf Druid. It can only be the elf or the half-elf lineage. It depends on the effect of the spell. Don't worry about sex, it must be a woman. But the appearance does not guarantee, this is in the spell. It is still an uncontrollable part."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance is also a big problem - for Janet. Although she always appears in the image of a human woman in the castle all day, she is actually a demon, or a very attractive one. When she thinks she may become ugly - although it is only "possible" - there is a great resistance in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Using a new body is no longer a demon, will my ability to transform disappear?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving a positive response, she was even more worried. Even though Siegel comforted her, she said that the jewelry that uses the spell of the changing spell can achieve the same effect as the original, but Janet still resists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admit that this is a risk, but I can't watch you become a bone demon." Siegel can only try to persuade: "At the moment, this It is the only way to eradicate. If you have psychological pressure, you can wait for a while. But if the situation worsens, no matter what reason you have, you must do this. You can only watch our children grow up if they are alive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny features a nod and reluctantly agrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw that his wife’s mood was somewhat low, and she tried her best to make her happy. The whole day. They all stayed in the bedroom, and even the meals were sent by the servants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happiness is valuable, but there must always be a sense of urgency. Siegel can allow himself to fully indulge in a day, but not indulge in the bedroom. The next day he began to work in the work of the lord. Inspect the training of the army and understand the production of the territory. After that, they gathered the knights of the territory and gathered in the hall of the city of Mire to mobilize the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana is sitting on his left hand, and Mike is in his right hand. Both are wearing the latest magical armor. The silver-white breastplate depicts the pattern of the nine-claw squid in black and adorns its eyes with two red gems. They both tried, the general weapon can not hurt this armor, even if it is hit by a hammer, the body will not be hurt. Although Siegel said that every three years of armor needs maintenance to continue to maintain such protection, it is more effective than other armor, but it is a magical equipment, not cheap in the New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warehouse in the underground of Mier City stores a large number of equipment manufactured through the assembly line, with the largest number of 弩矢 and ammunition. There are also hundreds of armor. If it were not for this war, Siegel did not have enough financial resources to buy these treasures. It can be said that the wealth accumulated by the entire southern aristocracy and lord is constantly flowing to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are also elves in the provider of wealth. Although Runestone can't make much money, the elf's wine is a cornucopia. It is impossible for Siegel to take the grain of his own territory, but the barbarian who sells the elves to the west side of the Walled Mountain Range is a business that makes a profit. The wine became meat, fur, herbs and animal bones, and then turned into rations, leather, bowstrings, and then exchanged for iron ingots, spices, gems and population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel already has 500 standing units, plus four thousand militiamen ready to mobilize, which was unimaginable before him. Perhaps these soldiers will return to the field after the war, and take the money they have earned to buy cattle and fruit trees. But now they are a force that cannot be ignored under the training of Zucker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light infantry and light cavalry are not cheap in front of the elves. The only way to avoid the elves' arrows on the battlefield is to protect yourself with heavy armor and rely on equipment instead of martial arts to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most difficult winter has passed. Spring farming has also been completed. Now you can take the energy to see the development of this war." Siegel said: "Elves What's the news on the front line?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing happens." Kenki, who lost his left ear, said in a low voice. He became the owner of the Sol Forest Castle because of his combat power and his witty mind. The seat has not yet taken the heat, but it has been driven out by the elves who are better at the forest environment. However, this person's brain is very clear, and his successful cover of his territory residents have all retreated to the city of Miele. Siegel did not criticize him at all, but promised to help him reclaim his territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Kenji helped Mana to be responsible for the investigation of the elves and to understand all aspects of the information. He used to send a poet who relied on singing to win the city. Now I have played my talents in the struggle with the elves. Through the "good" relationship between Siegel and the elves, he quickly found out the distribution of the opponent's strength, and even more information about patrols and guards than some elf generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said this, there must be the following, Siegel thought. So the mage took a sip of wine, smiled and looked at Kenki, and did not speak. The one-eyed knight touched the scar on his chin, cleared his throat, and then spoke out his knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elves spread the army very broadly, with war sacred trees as the core and many patrol units interspersed. They have druids and mages to provide investigation, usually It's extremely difficult to get close, let alone sneak attack.” Kenki said: “The baron adults have always been a steady and correct method, and the impulsive southern lords have all suffered defeats.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picks up the backpack on the floor, opens and pulls out the things inside - it seems to be ready. There were a few more flags on the table, broken and covered with dry blood and smoked black marks. Then he pulled out some broken weapons, the tip of the arrow, the broken chain armor and the broken sword of the blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults, the weapons and armor of the elves are better than us, or superior to the lords of the South." When Kenki spoke, he looked at Mana and Zucker, envious of the magical armor on both of them. "Look, the top of the arrow is flat, indicating that the armor of the elf is not drilled. The same is true for the broken sword, and the general chain armor protection is almost non-nistic. If you want to fight the elf, you must improve the weapon and do a good job. Everything is ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight took the sword from the table and looked at it, licking his mouth. "The work of these things is not as good as the kitchen knife that Heim has taken. They don't know how to use weapons like hammers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing to see on the battlefield The specific situation, but speculation is much better than using these sharp-edged weapons," Kenki said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not all the lords are close to the fine iron ore." Siegel said: "Heam's arms and armor manufacturing, from mining, smelting to final molding, Among them are the techniques of dwarf artisans, which are considered to be the best of the New World humans. Our blacksmiths have learned a lot with the dwarves, which has the advantage that other lords do not have."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Lord, our weapons are better than other lords, but compared with the elves, not much cheaper, can only say that they will not suffer." Since he is clever, he knows the best truth in front of Siegel. "But if you can send us magic armor, like Mr. Mana and Mr. Mike, we promise to win when we charge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others Smiled and should be, but when Mana glanced at them, she closed her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s not when you attack," Siegel said. "If you want magical armor, you can either use the martial arts to change it, or you can owe it, just like Moore. Even if it is secret city, there is no reason to send magic equipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Of course, of course!" Nodded and nodded: "We are happy to owe the debt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They also have this qualification." Ten fingers crossed, placed on the table, said in a serious tone: "A while ago, I have been preparing other things. Two seasons have passed, I can say that the situation of Heim is the best among the human territory of the entire New World. And this has nothing to do with any of you! I told Mana, including Mike, that there is only one requirement for you, that is, to bring your own soldiers and prepare to fight at any time. Only qualified generals can have the best equipment. I am asking now, who of you have the confidence to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
