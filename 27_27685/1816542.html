The representative of the dragon, a strong man wearing dark red leather - of course This is the form after the transformation - standing up, acting respectful, but the eyes have no meaning. “How long do you estimate the life of the world?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s hard to say, maybe tomorrow, maybe next year, there is no precedent in this.” Siegel’s indulgent moment Then, he said: "But I think that half a year should still be a time that can be supported. After half a year, I can't estimate it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our dragons decide all Family relocation, we have the ability to survive in any world." Red Dragon said: "We will not go to the world of the goblin. We go directly to the wilderness (a paradise of outer planes, beasts and animals) ), and then find ways to find new settlements from there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the dragons and knew they had such ability. The magic of the dragons is innate. Among them are some skilled masters, and several of them have already reached the ability of the sergeant. They themselves have the ability to open the door to the outside world, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the gods are gone, the dragons will go again, even if the other races together successfully save themselves, It will also take a lot of effort. The existence of the dragon is a morale support for most races. Although Siegel does not understand politics very much, he understands that marching is a war. So he shook his head and refused very resolutely: "This is impossible. All races must contribute to this matter. You can transfer dragon eggs, dragons and most female dragons first, but the dragons with magical ability are not allowed. Leaving. Moreover, the transfer I mentioned can only go to the goblin world, or to find a safe half-plane. This is a ship that will sink, but to face it together, I am not allowed to have a deserter." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon spit on the ground and the fire screamed: "You should not do this. The dragon has the pride of the dragon, not the god of your magic." Management."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha! Jokes. From now on, all the planes that have left the wall of the thunder wall have stopped working completely, only the ones I personally performed. The door can open the plane channel.” Siegel pointed a finger, all the elements swayed and then quieted down. "I am the only god here, you can only listen to me. Don't let me use the dragon spell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon just wants to say something, just Serge was sitting back in the chair with a little hand. At this time, the magic god said: "The premise of evacuation is to contribute to the evacuation. This is like a war, the old man, the child can leave first, others must contribute! Will not get because of your strong race Preferential treatment will not be discriminated against because your race is weak. Living goods, production materials, and how to start living in another world as soon as possible are the most important things. Don't try to challenge my authority, don't try to disturb this action. I will not distract you from solving your trivialities. I have only one principle for any conflict: I waste my time, that is, murder, so I will throw the troubled person directly into the wall of the storm!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear appears in the expressions of many races, and of course some ethnic representatives have made the "should be so" look. Time is the most precious, and Siegel can't manage so many trivial things. He needs to concentrate on the most important aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think that it is safe to go to the goblin world. The crystal walls of the two worlds have been opened. If it is not cut, the storm will follow the passage and put the earth. Destroyed together.” Siegel’s words are like a hammer for everyone. The hope that has just risen is starting to sway in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The desire to cut the wall channel requires a powerful power, which I don't currently have. But the departure of the gods creates an opportunity. Although the gods leave, But they can't take the rules that belong to this world. I need you to work hard to push my god up. So after three months, all races must have the same faith, that is, the Temple of Magic. Even if it is for other things to pray, I must also recite my name Siegel Squid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible!" "No way!" "Don't agree!" Representatives of many races I stood up and waved my fists. It seemed that I forgot the opposite of them was a real God. Only a handful of weak races don't mind this. Being able to believe in the true God and get shelter is something that they have dreamed of for generations, and it is finally achievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks to Evan, human beings are the largest of all ethnic groups, and there is no racial god. If you can get their support, things will be much easier. However, Evan closed his eyes and seemed to travel to the sky. There was no meaning at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gave them a minute to vent their emotions, and they looked at them silently, gazing from a personal face. There is power in silence, like the dark clouds before thunderstorms, the tides that retire before the eruption and the tides before the tsunami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minute later, he began to talk: "I have not created you, everything I have learned, is inherited from others. I am the only one I will be the two children in front of me. I will be very happy to save you, but I will never allow myself to be insulted and embarrassed in the process of saving people and after the process."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You feel that I am not worthy, but it is because my past has nothing to do with you. This is true. I killed the orcs, fought the elves, and also confronted the human fellow swords." I have killed the dragon, slaughtered the lich, and all kinds of monsters, I have not made any contribution to you. So you didn't believe before, I have no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is to save you, or most of you. I need to upgrade the fire, and then consume them all in the process of breaking the wall channel, this is the only way to avoid the destruction of the storm to catch up. Way! If you can't do this, then everyone can only pray Within three months, someone can find a large enough semi-level to survive. If you move to it, you can't cut the problem of the wall channel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to bet on this. This is related to the life and death of hundreds of millions of people, absolutely sloppy. Therefore, the method of burning divine power must be prepared, this is definitely not allowed to have problems." Siegel knows I can't let the spear point to myself, so I said, "Now the representatives of all ethnic groups are here. Who wouldn't pray to me after three months? Now you can say it. If the remaining races are not enough, then everyone will not. I have to relocate and wait for death, just as those who abandoned you hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representative of the elf stood up, a complete stranger Handsome face. In fact, Siegel has been dealing with the Elves, and rarely sees the actor in the Elves. "Lord of Magic, if everything goes well, you succeed in breaking the threat of destroying the storm, then do you still need the power of faith?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rule has always existed The gods are just the existence of their place, so everything is just an exchange. You give me faith, I give you the magic." Siegel replied: "If you are willing to live without pastor and magic, naturally think Believe who believes who. But you have to figure out, I will not let other gods return to light after the disaster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of the words is understood. After cutting off the devastating storm, the magic god does not make a mandatory request. Then there is an account of this race, and everything is a temporary means to escape safely! However, there are also ethnic preparations to use the magic god as the patron saint of the race. To tell the truth, who does not want to gain magic and gain strength, and ultimately receive equal treatment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe only one day, many races still don’t fully understand the impact of the retreat of the gods. Siegel knows that he should be patient and give them some time, but he has a hard time controlling the feeling of anxiety. In his mind, it seems that there is always a clock in the ticking, constantly urging, constantly whipping, never stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare for three months, leave after three months. Races that can be tapped, you can start now, when you start working, you will You can evacuate your own group one step at a time. This is a preferential treatment for you. The Magic Temple will coordinate the whole thing, and the Magic Federation and the Masters Association will also assist. When I finally cut off the Crystal Wall Channel, I need enough. Believers - even if they are false believers. If the number is not enough, then you can only stay and wait for death. So, don't think about robbing and fighting! If you kill a provoke, you can kill two innocent people, then I will Do. The Temple of Magic and the organization of the sorcerer are watching this thing, don't be lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how many races can be heard, I don't know how many twists and turns will happen in this. Siegel wants to save as many people as possible, but he also knows that he can't save everyone. Everyone is just a dream, an idea, but it may also be the obsession of the savior. Siegel can only do what he is best at, and then trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trust is nothing but a simple survival. In order to survive, even the Earth's goblins were able to choose to compromise - despite being destroyed by Lear's means, they did make a truce and compromise - there is no reason why many races in the world of the wall can't. If they are not as good as goblins, then they are not qualified to occupy the world left by the goblin. It is better to disappear in the storm of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
