			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closed-door meeting of the federation took a full day, and Siegel detailed his own insights on Earth. The grim situation is beyond the imagination of all mages, and everyone is trying to digest the information that Siegel brought back. "No matter what kind of means, as long as the battle begins, the goblin will never stop fighting until all resistance is eliminated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarf has already started the battle, so again It doesn't make much sense to discuss this.” Siegel said: “The goblin will never believe in the goodwill from this world, even if they signed a certain armistice agreement at a time, it is just a kind of offensive blindness.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the Goblin doesn't know where we come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detailedly talk about this idea." Siegel looked Shelley Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomes constantly bombard the amethyst crystal wall passage with their nuclear bombs, forming a relationship between the two, and according to your research, the goblin is dealing with the relationship between the two sides. Time will not end, so I am thinking, is it to join the party, let the situation change." Master Shelley has just produced this idea, so I said, while thinking about supplements. "Gnomes have also tried to leave their homes and go to other starry sky walls. Then we can pretend to be visitors to other planets, or buy, or threaten. At least we can get time for the passage of Mora!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I oppose!" Verwood said: "Mr. Shelley, do you want to open the magical spaceship of the Federation in your plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have this idea, but I know that it will definitely not work." Master Shelley shook his head too: "No one can ignore the magical spacecraft." The threat posed by the goblin world. If they can reverse the magic from the spacecraft, then our only remaining advantage will be gone. My proposal has no enforceability, and everyone forgot."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people nodded and began to discuss other options. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not speak, but Shelley’s thoughts entered his mind. This plan really has no merits, it is not necessarily. Siegel believes that its starting point is good. If it can work, it can affect the balance of the whole battle. It is a strategic choice, but the key is how to achieve it safely at the tactical level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line of disguised as "Stars and Guests" is the inability to expose the existence of magic, and does not allow the Goblin to master the power and knowledge of the world of the wall. Because the goblin is very aggressive. Then you must be prepared to destroy the magic ship, and you must ensure that no piece of debris can be obtained by the goblin. This difficulty is too high, there is only one way to achieve this effect, that is, the astral projection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is crazy. Even Siegel smiled slightly. Astral projections can only bring creatures with thoughts and wisdom, because without self-awareness, they cannot produce bodies in the astral world. Let a magical spacecraft develop consciousness, how is this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. It is not impossible. Siegel’s eyes sparkled with inexplicable light. He was shocked by his own ideas. Humans, elves, dwarves, and the like can be projected onto the astral, animals can, and dragons can. Some uninhibited creatures, such as vampires and lichs, can go to the astral, but the elements are not. Can the clay monster go to the astral? I have never heard of it, but they all have their own ethnic gods, I believe it should be. So smart magic items can't work? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other mages are still discussing it enthusiastically. Siegel suddenly asked: "Can smart magic items be in the astral world, can you still show intelligence?" With intelligence, then he relies on his own intelligence. Instead of taking it as an item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t tried it yet, the Federation now has no smart magic items. It used to be in the Three Peaks Tower, what happened?” Verwood wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who have you read about it, what if you bring the light god into the astral projection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone looked at each other and shook his head. Siegel suddenly found his problem stupid. The Astral Projection is a high-level mantra of the ** division level. He has seen all the books about the high-level mantra in the Federation. There is no relevant record at all. He smiled apologetically to everyone. "I am a little distracted. I don't care about my previous question. Where did you discuss it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said, "I have thought about this in the world of the goblin. Tell me what I think." His gaze swept across the faces of all the masters and said with a sigh of relief: " Only by attacking in all directions can we know what works for them. We need to use enchanted spells to influence their thinking and let them fight each other; we use the spell to summon monsters and destroy their facilities; we use illusion The shadow of the gods spreads fear among them; we want to use the curse of the Necromancer. Let them fall into disease, toxins and decay. Elements, ghosts, we must use monsters that do not leave dead bodies after death; earthquakes, volcanoes Don't be sorry for all the magical powers that can be used. We have astral projections, we have teleportation, which is a great advantage in tactics. I think it is more flowering, mixed attack, like a cocktail. Don't stick to it. A certain means can't give them the opportunity to guard against and adapt!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, I don't discuss what method is good now. Inferior, but all used out, according to the results and then choose?" Wendy two hands rubbed, frowning and said: "If my understanding is correct, it is like iridescent rays, each time with a combination of boxing From the point of view of the protection system, this is indeed the most difficult method to prevent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only requirement is that all methods cannot allow the goblin to be launched. All actions can't leave evidence. Except for the astral projection, you can't go to the opposite side in any form." Siegel's tone is very serious: "That is, all actions are given to us." All other members of the federation should brainstorm and don’t let any thoughts go. As long as the security is guaranteed, the test will be handed over to the mentors.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Master, about the situation of the Earth, is it also explained to the official Master of the Federation?" Someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venue immediately became quiet. This is a more difficult problem, and it is somewhat more troublesome than how to defeat the goblin. Saying and not saying the pros and cons, it is about efficiency, effectiveness, trust, security and other aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My opinion is that I only tell the Master who already knows that the Federation has a crystal wall passage, and then don't spread it again." Siegel chose a relatively safe one. Route: "Of course, this matter must be decided by the board of directors through deliberation. On the other hand, we must find ways to know what the channels occupied by the wizards, elves and star kingdoms are doing, what they found. What are they? Through the Majesty of the King, I know that the kingdom of stars has been delaying the time, but the Masters Association will not have no movement. They have the same astrological projections as we do, there is no reason not to explore them. We don’t like associations. We don’t have to help They, but we can't have conflicts and let goblins profit. Does everyone agree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage are not fools, they can still be separated, so Everyone nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation is acting. Start preparing for "cocktail therapy." With the theme of "How to combine the most spells in one offense, using the most varied means and techniques", all the Masters participated, creating a big collision of ideas. Numerous sparks are produced in collisions, many of which are just like the meteor's instant brilliance, but there are also some sparks that ignite the fire of the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Council continues to select and absorb the good ideas and announces the rewards that all mages hope: the breadth and breadth of thinking determine the vision and understanding of the Master Therefore, the sergeant Siegel will personally reward the outstanding participants, personally teach and perform spell demonstrations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people asked about the ability to perform those spell demonstrations, and the answers were shocking them: except for the unique elemental aggregates of the Siegel Masters (special abilities) Others can't learn). All spells and abilities, including time and space turbulence, are within the scope of individual lectures and presentations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if the best person wants other mentors to confuse, such as Wendy or Simonton, it is not a problem. The Federation encourages learning and encourages a hundred flowers to bloom. In addition to this "Cocktail Collision", similar events will be held in the future to promote the construction of the School of Magic and reward outstanding students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentice Master wants to be a trainee, and the trainee wants to be formal. And which of the official mages do not want to become stronger and stronger, until they become ** divisions? For a time, the federations have produced amazing vitality, and various new ideas have emerged in an endless stream, and the overall strength has been greatly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Siegel doing? He was still thinking about the idea of ​​Shelley. Through actual experiments. The lamp god can be squatted into the astral and produces a split projection. If the avatar is destroyed, it will return to the body normally without leaving any traces. Siegel also experimented with ordinary constructed creatures, which cannot be projected onto the astral unless they are carried on the body as objects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
