			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pink beam completely erodes the magical enchantment over the macabu, its color begins to darken until it becomes completely opaque ceiling. At this time, the battle between the "Alchemist" and the one-eyed witch festival was over. The orc who was robbed of the home advantage fell on the rubble ground. His chest was torn open, and all the internal organs disappeared, only in the wound. The nearby flesh melted and rolled, like a silver flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of dead bodies lying around, and most of them are dying between each other. For the Knicks of the Knox Association, manipulating the mind is their masterpiece, and with the help of the power of the Wraith, it is the ultimate in this ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alchemist" Eric finally unloaded the disguise, and the fake skin burned by the sacred flame by the witchcraft was overwhelmed and became full. The shredded waste was now torn off by him and thrown aside. If Prince Aaron is here, he will be surprised to cry out, because the bald old man who appears under the fake skin is one of the leaders of the Knox Association, named Casper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partial reference to the demon skin grafting technology, Knox will not be able to create such a realistic life-like skin, can deceive the vast majority of the naked eye And the identification of spells. For the New World plan, the joint meeting has been prepared for a long time. They collect materials, make magical equipment, and use wealth to get secrets. Now it is finally time to harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Casper’s sergeant took a trick, and a wand filled with flaming souls broke through the void. The defensive enchantment of Macabu has been taken over, and now the trans-domain space transmission spells can function normally, and the ** division is also calling for helpers. After a while, his disciples and his men will receive a message and will be rushed to the site of the Makarbu Beastmaster Palace to witness the establishment of the first Akam minaret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tasted the joy before victory, strolling in the hall covered by blood and dust. The statue of the orc patron saint has been blown up and crushed. The original Beastmaster image is left with only two incomplete feet. At his feet, it is the core of the entire Macabu enchantment, but now it is replaced by a flaming soul. This flaming soul crystal is better than the one that Siegel has. And it is also wrapped in gold and secret silver glyphs to form a complex magic rune. The grievances in the soul of the soul are controlled by the runes, and the source continuously outputs the energy needed for the spell to run. Condensed by the Knox Commonwealth's most proud magical technology, it provides almost unlimited power for all the magical enchantments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing needed to make Soul Core Crystal is the Wraith. A new species, unlike ordinary undead, is currently only gathering in the northernmost part of the New World, and is already very close to the edge of the storm wall. Knox has been suppressed since its inception, and their proficient mind-controlling spells are weak in the face of protective thinking, mind barriers, and even simple anti-evil spells. Until five hundred years ago, the wall of the storm retreated. Exposing a brand new continent, Knox will receive the attention and guidance of a new god, Riyadh, the god of the Red Flame, to discover the existence of grievances. After a series of new spells are based on the study of the Wraith, the powerful possessive control of the new species is fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the research progressed, deeper secrets were discovered. Many Masters believe that controlling the soul is to modify the fate of the subject. This is a very energy-intensive, unclean, unclean behavior, so many spells of protection control have been studied. The reason why the grievances can easily be successful is that they are born with a powerful power of destiny, enough to cover the soul of the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discovery opened a new chapter in the Knox Association. Simply using the grievances for possession is not as good as extracting the power of destiny. on the basis of. A variety of new magical arrays and magical items were born, and the power of mind-controlling spells continued to strengthen. The Knox of the Knox Association finally saw the hope of the rise. However, the grievances are hidden in the remote and extremely cold places, which are extremely difficult to obtain, and the nearby storm wall will interfere with the transmission of the spells. The walk is too expensive, so we must find ways to exploit such resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Master Caspar proposed the Magic Tower Project, which is the Akam Minaret. By creating such a tower at a specific location, the grievances are induced to go south and capture. Simultaneously. This magic tower can also strengthen the power and influence of the wizard's spiritual magic, and is the best protective fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the magic towers in other research directions, the towers that focus on mind control need to be built in densely populated areas, so macabu is a good choice. It is close to the coast here. At the same time, it is the largest town closest to the north. But the orcs have been entangled in this for many years, and the forces are deep, so Casper’s clerk has personally taken the plunge and vowed to hold it in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the statue of the orc patron and came to the heel of the wreckage, where he would look at another survivor in the battle. Count Maxim fell to the ground weakly, his legs were broken by the flame rays, and he had lost the ability to act, and his right shoulder was empty, and the right arm that had been cut had already exploded in the battle. For fly ash. In addition, there are countless large and small wounds on the count, mostly caused by explosions and flames. These wounds caused him to lose a lot of blood, and now he is weak and waiting for the advent of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also witnessed the whole battle and saw the power of the strong division. Although he must die, there is hope in his heart: the eldest son who stays at home can inherit his title and seal the land, and the second son may one day become an equally powerful mage. Just don't know if his action through the walled mountains is successful, and the frostbite on his feet is better? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspar stood in front of the count and looked at the unpredictable expression of his opponent with interest and guessed his inner thoughts. This is one of the favorite games of the Enchanted Faculty, which can exercise their ability to master the mind and control their minds. Being able to become a sergeant, Caspar is naturally good at this. He smiles and says to the count: "Are you thinking about your family? Especially your two sons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl spits on the ground, but only a burst of blood. "No matter what," the count reluctantly said: "Makab is destroyed, I am dead without regrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, destroying here The port is not my intention.” Casper said: “How can I destroy what is going to fall into my hands? But there are others who are destroying here and burning my three most important shipyards.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, this is a favorite thing." The count has lost his sense of the whole body, and he can't even make a smile. "I remember that before I lie to the Beastmaster Hall, have two shipyards been destroyed by you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Caspar said calmly: "Now, except for a repair dock, I am afraid that nothing will be left. But this will only delay my plan and will not affect my victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do you hear the flies screaming?" Count Maxim gasped and gasped in his throat, then said: "You thought you could drive away the flies as long as you waved, but you don't know they are already Produce eggs in your food and spread the plague in your wounds. You will eventually die in the scorpion fly, and the corpse becomes a locust food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I can seek eternal life in the land where the red flame shines." Caspar is not in a hurry, nor is he angry. It is the gibberish of the dying person. Is there some credibility? However, he had news to tell the count to quell the anger that was suppressed when he was called to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you and I talk, your blood has been cut off." As if to say a trivial thing, the tone of Casper’s teacher is like The deep pool in the winter season is as calm and waveless as it is cold and cold. "Your eldest son died in a falling horse. Your second son was shot as a geese. Your grandson was suffering from an emergency and reunited with his father. The two illegitimate sons you left in the city also sank to the bottom of the sea. Because of your two A younger brother has no son before his death, so the blood of his family has been cut off. You are the last person in the Maxim family who still lives in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message is like The sledgehammer was heavily swayed in the heart of the count. He denied the news, but his heart had a hunch that "this is true." "I curse you, curse you not to die! You will have no children and no grandchildren, and the name will always be cast aside! The Knight of Justice will judge you and will drive you into the bottomless abyss, and never live forever!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bottomless abyss I have been there, there is nothing special about it." Caspar replied: "The Knight of Justice is just a weak warrior god, in my red god red flames In front of Ruihad, a trace of wind and waves can't be turned over. Do you know why I spent a lot of time to destroy your blood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count did not pay attention to him, but used the last The strength of the swearing swears, the most vicious curse is constantly applied to the "Alchemist." ** Division Caspar let him gibberish, lifted the staff with the soul of the soul, and slowly inserted into the heart of the count with a sharp bottom, while whispering in the mouth. The power of magic is concentrated on the staff, and the soul of the soul is constantly oscillating, making a strange sound. Then the surrounding sandstone slowly floated up and continued to rotate around the light column. The count spit out the last breath, and the eternal darkness enveloped him. Then his body was ignited by a red flame, burning a light, and there was no leftover. The flame is added to the light column and then attached to the masonry. Under the control of the sorcerer's spell, a magnificent magic tower began to take shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
