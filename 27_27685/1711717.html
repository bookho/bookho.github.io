			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the blue waves, a San Francisco merchant ship is hurricane and heading west to the New World. They set off in the Iron Island of the "Old World" star-studded country and needed to go through a full nine-month voyage to complete a round-trip with the "New World" Ximu Town. Only two islands on the way can stop the ship for resupply, but in order to avoid the pirates, the time of each stop will not exceed one day, and then they must rush on the road. So in general, this boat is always on a very tough journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big ship is called Lucky Sos. It has been 16 years old and can be regarded as an old ship - but it is not badly maintained. It has encountered many disasters at sea, but in the end it was safe. The seafarers are superstitious and believe that the ship is protected by Poseidon and is willing to board such a ship to find work. The shipowner also likes to see such a situation, but he uses the lucky name of the Soth to pay less, resulting in less seafarers on the ship than other ships. Because of this, the crew of this ship has been coming and going, and it has rarely been long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only two people have been working with the Lucky Soth, they are the sergeant Siegel, whom all crew members respect, and Xiaoxi, which most people like. Geer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two are not father-son relationships, they are just the same name, but the surnames are different. Captain Siegel-Marin is a hard-working old seaman who believes in the god of the storm (no roots storm) and keeps his commandments at sea, so he has not been educated. Small Siegel was discovered in the cabin when the ship first sailed, wrapped in a raft and abandoned in a water tank used by seafarers to catch squid. At that time, the baby was stinking, and a thick, dark, dark ink almost suffocated him. The sailor reported the first officer, the chief officer reported the captain, and the captain went down to the cabin to see him. Despite the embarrassment and hunger, the baby smiled at the captain, which allowed him to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child has very rare black hair and black eyes, and the crew said it was dyed by the ink of the squid. The old captain has another theory: "The god of the storm has a squid saint, this is the child he sent! You can't leave him to the sea, it is a gift from God, it will cause disaster. Everyone's well-being, let me raise him." The crew nodded and believed the old captain's words - just as he believed in the prediction of the storm - so the Siegel-Squid became the baby's name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he was six years old, Siegel didn’t even step on the ground that wouldn’t shake. He breathed the sea breeze, drank the sea, played with the sea, and made a bite in the storm until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child is now 16 years old, sitting on the bow of the ship, ups and downs as the merchant ship breaks the waves. He was baptized by the sun and the sea breeze all day, making his skin dark and bright; his years of labor and eating sea fish made him muscle compact and energetic. The passengers said that he was active like a healthy leopard. The most popular thing is his smart black scorpion. There are few things in the world that can escape his observation. This talent becomes more and more obvious with the increase of age and nautical experience. Sometimes he can even be older than the old captain. Forecast the coming storm earlier. Usually he is responsible for looking on the mast, and few pirate ships can avoid his sight and approach the Sos. The crew personally fixed the position for him and called him "Sailor", but the appointment was not officially approved by the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passengers on the Sos is unlikely to notice this strange child, only two reasons are enough: 'black hair black squatting', 'up and down hopping '. They will ask the seafarers about the child, and the seafarers will always be happy to answer, make tips by making up stories, or simply listen to a few exclamations. But as I said before, the seafarers here are rarely able to do long, so the stories they told about Siegel were heard from someone, and someone heard about it from another person. The facts were quickly rumored into stories, and the story was exaggerated into legends. So even though Siegel never left the ship, he still has many versions of "legends" near Tin Shuigang and Ximu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these legends, Siegel was welcomed by shops and pubs every time he was on the beach. Everyone rushed to see this "from squid The child coming out of the belly." Siegel has no intention of correcting these different versions of the "legends", and does not want to push the waves. He often enters a strange dream, too ridiculous to dare to mention to others: a world of steel and lightning, people are eager to eat poisonous food, and contribute to the glowing image in their hands every day. He wandered around the world, then was caught by a flamingo and flew into the whirlpool of the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After every time such a dream is made, the squid will wake up in sweat and panic. He often prays to the "God of the Storm" or "The Squid" to ask about the meaning of the dream, but no one has ever given him doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the mood of the "squid" is very low, and the list of the sea and the sky is slouched, and the legs are unconsciously dangling. The annoying squad told the passengers on the deck about his erroneous life story, and Siegel was too lazy to correct it. If it is placed on other days, Siegel will vomit for revenge at his lunch, even if he does not play with his legs. The two have been blind to each other. Siegel thinks that it is purely a nuisance to himself. He always orders himself to do some very hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Squid, come down, the old captain wants to see you!" Deville chef iodined, and finally squeezed out of the hatch, so on the deck Staggering, like a cooked egg. He shouted: "When you see the captain, don't forget to come to me to help, and have lunch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel from The bow of the boat jumped up and untied the lasso from the waist, throwing it out after two rounds of slamming. The lasso rubbed the scalp of the mate over the deck and accurately hooked the beam of the first mast. In the curse of the first officer, the squid slid across the front deck and stopped in front of the chef in an agile and elegant manner. He shook his hand, and the lasso was wrapped back to the young man's waist if he was spiritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several passengers applauded and shouted loudly, hoping to watch the circus performance several times. Siegel smiled and made an exaggerated hat-off ceremony. He waved the long-cap that did not exist in the hands of the applauding passenger, and then squeezed from the belly of the fat chef and went straight to the captain's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respected captain is now almost out of reach, he can’t even stand on the deck to direct the voyage, he can only lie on the bed in the lounge, eat and drink, others Come to serve. The old man endured tremendous pain, and every joint of his body protested loudly to strike - a permanent strike. As the ship was ups and downs, the old captain was also undergoing rounds of torture, and the age spots on his face were constantly twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm will also disappear." Old Siegel explained to Siegel's life and death: "until the new storm is born."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to see you die." The squid sits quietly across the captain, helping to lift the old man's hand and put it on top of his head. The black hair was straight and hard, but when the old captain's rough hand touched it, he felt only silky and supple. "After you die, I will not like this boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So take the risk, go on the land and see, I am from your eyes I have seen such an idea." The old captain said: "The ship owner originally wanted to make you the next captain, but I was rejected. I recommended the first officer. You will not be angry with me, right?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The squid did not agree: "He is a person who is good at giving orders, and I am different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You deserve better, child." The old captain tried hard to sit up, but only with the help of the squid, he finally succeeded. Xiao Siegel thought that the captain would mention "the treasure" again. After all, after he could say it, the old captain always put this thing on his lips. The captain said that when he first became a sailor, a saint of the god of the storm revealed to him the secrets of the world, allowing him to predict the signs of the sea storm. Then the god made a prediction of the life after the captain, and let him convert to the god of the storm, to keep the single commandment throughout his life, not to marry. But at the same time, he told him that there is a secret about the wealth of the world that can only be passed to his son and realized by his son. The old captain never understood this thing until he found the little Siegel from the squid box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the captain told the little squid about this and kept him in his heart. At the beginning, the children were able to cross the entire New World, reach the end of the west, get endless treasures, and then live a kingly life. Even though he later knew that the New World was dangerous, only a few legendary powerhouses had arrived there - little sailors could never complete such a journey. But he still believes that he can accomplish this dream, as long as he finds the opportunity to exercise himself and improve his knowledge and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the captain knows that he doesn’t have much time today, and he won’t repeat the old story. He trembled and took a small box from the dark compartment of the wall cabinet, opened it with the key that was removed from his neck, and handed it over to Siegel. Siegel took it curiously. He saw that there was only one thing in the box, a pendant with a twenty-faced scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scorpion has only the size of the thumb nail, the whole body is black, and the crimson dragon number is engraved on it, from 1 to 19. The only side that should write 20 is that there is no number, but a reddish symbol. The old captain had secretly asked many people, and no one knew what was written on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
