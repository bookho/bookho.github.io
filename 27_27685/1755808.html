			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left channel is curved into an arc that is more distorted than the previous road. Around the passage, there are many translucent glulam gates, just like the bees protected with beeswax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is inside?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have isolated my perspective here, so I don't know it! Let's open it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Not yet waiting for Siegel to stop, the konjac stretched out the slender arm and grabbed a large piece of gum. Siegel's hand immediately took the dust of the star and pulled it out of the scabbard and crossed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing happened, as if the room was empty. The konjac didn't feel that he had made a reckless mistake, and he threw down the broken pieces in his hand and looked through the hole. He constantly changed the combination of lenses, and then excitedly said to Siegel: "Look, it's all your brothers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel leaned over I saw a terrible scene. Thousands of iron hooks hung in the honeycomb-like room, and each of them was hung with a warrior. They are close together, like a bunch of grapes crowded. Although there are patterns on the body, none of these cockroaches shine, and they do not see the ability to move. They quietly stayed in this dark room, waiting for the day to be awakened in the eternal stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hole caused the air circulation in the room and the passage, that is, the wind. The shackles hanging on the hooks swayed slightly, making a creaking sound during the collision. Countless empty eyes glanced around, although they knew they couldn't see, hear, or have any senses, but Siegel still felt creepy and felt a huge threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is terrible." Siegel said: "Is there a tens of thousands of embarrassment here?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you wouldn't be afraid." Two toot said: "Are you not a cockroach?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I and They are different.” Siegel said: “I will not ignore you, will not attack you, and will not hand you over to the ruler. If I can, I would rather you fall into the void and disappear, and you will not be made. The same warrior as me. Can you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost, there is a little bit of understanding." Two toot said: "I am out of place, you are some Strange, we are a good friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. Let these babies who can't be friends continue to sleep." Siegel said: "Let's continue. Go ahead. But next time don't open the closed door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They dropped the broken door and continued to walk deeper along the passage. The second tout said that the air has a faint sweet taste, so this direction must not be wrong. As he walked, he whispered the song softly - it was a light and enthusiastic song. The rhythm of the jump coincides with his pace. Siegel thinks this song is really good, but he can only remember it in his mind, but he dares not to make a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a subtle movement in front of the road, which was captured by Siegel’s keen hearing. He immediately caught the konjac's mouth and motioned him to silence. Two people are hiding behind the stone pillars. Waiting for the owner of the front voice to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subtle sound is getting bigger and bigger, like a rain boots walking on the wet ground just after the rain, making a squeaking sound. Siegel can make the same sound when he walks, but he can use some of the tricks of the elf's pace to lower the footsteps and become like a cat when necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is getting closer and closer until it passes by two people. It was a warrior, slightly lower than Siegel's, and the bones were slimmer. There is a steel shield behind him, with a long-winged lion statue on it, not knowing that it was from that world. But there is one thing that attracts Siegel's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the arm there. Glue a black dagger. Siegel recognized it at a glance, and that was his lost obsidian dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t believe in his own judgments, mistakes and surprises take up most of the time, and in a flash, his mind has turned into countless ideas, and Siegel is also fast. Weigh the pros and cons. His dagger was lost in the walled mountains. Is there a passage connecting the empty ship? The only sure way is to carefully verify the dagger, and there is only one way to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently swept his fingers around each inch of the dagger, avoiding the sharp and sharp parts. Compare it with the dagger in your mind. It is indeed his own obsidian dagger, and every detail is exactly the same. How did it come here? What kind of adventure has it experienced since the Walled Mountains? It is a pity that the dagger will not speak, otherwise I really want to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run!" said two tomb: "There will be guards coming soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The konjac did not ask questions about fratricidalism, maybe he didn't care, maybe because time was too tight, maybe he hid the suspicion of emotions - Siegel hopes the answer is the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green lines on the surrounding walls begin to light up. Although the number is very small, it still gives the impression that “buildings come alive”. Two people quickly left the scene and ran in the long passage. In order to be able to drag the inspector's footsteps, Siegel used a dust of stars to break a lot of gelatinous materials that seal the door, causing the illusion of breaking into the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The konjac took Siegel through the numerous winding roads, and it was not easy to find the channel where the plasma lines did not turn green. While running, they should pay attention to the movements around them, especially the neat footsteps. There are several times when the footsteps are at a distance from their two corners, and they are surrounded by each other. At this time, the konjac will jump to the ceiling, and I don’t know where to find a new corner. I quickly walked in with Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running for a short period of time, the konjac finally stopped. The surrounding area has also become much quieter, at least without the movement of chasing troops. The body of the Void is much larger than the body. Siegel feels that he seems to be unable to reach his destination forever, but the konjac is very optimistic about this. It seems that there is nothing that can be difficult to live with with his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are close to the workshop, this is the safest place." Two toes stretched out the slender arm and pointed to a spiral cast iron on the ground. "Let's go down there, take a break, and find some supplies by the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladder is very smooth and can't see a little rust, which is very abnormal. Unless there is someone to maintain it all day, use gauze to do the grinding work, otherwise the iron should have rusted. Siegel followed the konjac and walked down the ladder, and the green fluorescent light was lit by the place he had touched by hand. He looked down and looked at it. It turned out that there were extremely fine green lines on the ladder and reacted to the surrounding plasma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still very quiet here, there are no signs of chasing, or Siegel would think it’s a trap. The konjac walked in front of him and resumed his joy. He began to stare at his minor tune, making a snap from time to time, just like a bard in a pub. Siegel didn't want him to be Lin Ke, and he didn't want to be betrayed in a strange place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a passage without a stone pillar under the ladder. It is made entirely of metal and is finally different from the previous environment. Vaguely, you can hear the sound of roaring, accompanied by the sound of a bell tower. Walking down a long, curved corridor, the heat of the air is increasing and the bell is louder. He has not heard the minor tune of the konjac, he can only speak loudly to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The air here is very good, all are metal, just like my first hometown." Two excitement said: "I can smell Iron, copper and lead, but most of them are iron, then oil, or oil that is hot because of friction. I like that taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Channel Terminating in front of a huge door with gears and drive rods, the konjac didn't know which chain was smashed, and the door slowly opened, revealing a small slit that just passed. A huge roar erupted from the cracks, like a flood that washed away the dam. The konjac waved and let Siegel rush to keep up, then he drilled in first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all metal machines: gears, chains, all kinds of cables and mechanisms, they constantly reciprocate, from birth to the end of the world . Siegel saw a large number of inflammatory soul crystals, which were placed on the body of a metal machine, with a halo-like hieroglyphic surface engraved with sinister energy. Siegel felt the fluctuation of magic, not from the combination of elements, but very pure magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here he can cast magic, he needs to know why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot faucet spouts the squeaky steam, the metal cylinder that smokes the smoke constantly drives the lever to cut off the large piece of metal, like the konjac The tip of the metal arm emits an electric arc and is depicted on the steel block. Siegel walked and watched, followed by the cut piece of steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
