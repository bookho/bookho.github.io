			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning, after a night of familiar and fragrant sleep, Siegel’s mood became very good. When the sun came in from the window, he got up in full spirits. When Janet was still asleep, he came to the small restaurant himself. Good appetite, eat fried bread, apple cake, two large bacon omelettes and half roast chicken. He asked the servant to prepare the same one for Janet, and then he was ready to see Isaac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, he realized that he had something missing in his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did the defensive staff go?" He tried to remember, then took his forehead and shouted: "Bad!" and then cast any door. , transferred to the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Dudu was busy at the door of the Temple of the Unknown, sorting out the things sent by the good people, including some food, fruits and clothes. Both Dudu and Reid are creatures that don't need to eat or drink. These things are used to help people with hardships – even in the booming Heim collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two Dudu, did Reid find my defensive staff yesterday? I left it near the temple."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, Lord Lord!" The konjac smiled and greeted him, then replied: "Yes, he picked up your things and then hurried to the temple." Inside, some kind of prayer ceremony began. He has not finished yet, and he is not allowed to enter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are developing in the worst direction, Rhett Ten ** was found to have issued a sorcerer's life. "I have to go in and see," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two bounced and shook his head, in front of Siegel: "Ryder said, no one can go in, so as not to interrupt the ceremony and cause danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid he is already in danger, we must go in and see." Siegel said: "I know my staff, and Rhett is not a mage. Magical operations across knowledge and fields...” Siegel deliberately left behind and said nothing, these are enough to make the konjac start to worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to trust my ability in magic, and I am also worried about Reid's safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Two Dudu was finally convinced and let the door open. Two people went in together. Only seeing the empty temple, there is neither Reid nor the defensive staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! Where did the big mud go?" Two muttered his eyes and turned his head. Hands and feet are shaking and shaking. "Lord Lord, I have been at the door, I have not seen anyone coming in and out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things in the temple are still very neat, a small round The altar was in the middle of the stone house, and the surrounding candles were burned out. The wax oil melts into a pool. There is a faint scent of meditation in the air, which also enhances the power of the priest during the ritual. Since the two structures are cleaned every day, there is no trace of dust on the ground, and no traces such as footprints are visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel closes his eyes, communicates with the energy-focusing lens array, and covers the spells of the dead spirits to cover the city. As he expected, Lion King Alexander is no longer in Heim. He also applied item positioning, but still could not find the position of the defensive staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are clear, Rhett found the sorcerer's life, and then tried to purify it. Then Alexander came and left with a defensive staff. Alexander has been studying the energy focusing lens in the basement of the city of Mith, and his ability allows him to use teleportation in the space lock area - just to say that he is Siegel. The second beep is always at the door, and the transmission is the only way to avoid getting in and out safely. The key to this is what happened to Rhett? As a Golem creature, with a sacred power to protect the body, is it possible to beat it without moving? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certainly not an attacking spell, and not to mention the extent to which the power of the element can hurt Rhett, saying that Siegel’s keen sense of elemental energy If there is such a spell, he must escape his nose. Spiritual control spells? Even if it is the spell of the Knox Association, can't it work on the Golem, especially the Priest Golem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Lion King Alexander sent Reid with him? This is very likely in the technique of spells. But there is no reason. Siegel thought about it and once again applied the item positioning technique to make sure that the spell could take the target of the two gongs, and then tried to locate Rhett. Constructed organisms are considered to be "articles" to a certain extent. Only their resistance to magic makes this spell more difficult to implement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the actual combat ability of two people, the Golem Priest and the Lich Master have their own advantages. Even if Alexander can win, he has to pay a price. And with Siegel knowing, Alexander's goal should be just a life-threatening. What good is it to defeat the Golem? Siegel couldn’t think of it. If you want to take your life quietly, what will you do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move the scene. I'm going to get some magic scrolls." Siegel had some ideas, and then he confessed to the two, and hurried back. Own laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought of two spells, one for maze and the other for imprisonment, both of which "disappear" and trap people The spell. However, the duration of the maze is limited, and it is said that it is only about ten minutes, so there is only one possibility of imprisonment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has to make sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item positioning and biopositioning are not able to find the existence of a shackled seal, and in the spell mastered by the wizard, the most powerful positioning spell is the "perceived position" . Unless Rhett exerts a psychic barrier on himself—Siegel estimates that Rhett has not yet had the ability to cast this spell—or direct interference from divine power—no way to prevent the caster from knowing the exact location of the target. Even if the item is not in the world, you can know the name and location of the plane it is in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the ** division can cast this spell, and Siegel has only recently mastered this spell. This spell is very common, and there is a need for a special material or the need to find a particular item, so there are multiple spell scrolls in the union's library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell is also the spell that Siegel wants to learn after becoming a sergeant, not even one. He originally thought that this spell could locate Janet, but it was not the same thing after he really started learning. Things that don't exist are still outside the scope of this spell, including the soul. Siegel himself did not know what Janet would look like after his reincarnation. This spell is naturally powerless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The display of the perceived position requires a support array to support and prepare a suitable venue for the ceremony. He returned to the open space in front of the Temple of the Unknown Temple with the materials and implements he needed. The konjac two toes are shrugging their heads, like a deserted puppy, slouching and slouching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come a favor, give me a few things like Rhett, I will locate the position of Reid." Siegel gently kicked He kicked his feet: "Get up, don't pretend to die! Where will the construction creatures be tired?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my heart is so tired." Hold it up and take it to Ryder to wipe the grease rag. "We don't have anything of our own. This is what Reid uses every day. I hope I can help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s biggest concern is actually this one. The rag is used by Erdu to help Reid wipe the oil. In that case, the belonging of the item is problematic. He didn't want to spend a lot of effort to cast spells, and the result was positioned on the konjac in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there no part of Reid's body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence reminds me Two beeps, that opened the body of his iron box, and took out a small glass bottle from inside, half a bottle of clay inside. Erdu seemed a little embarrassed. He said, "This is the time when Rhett is mainly a clay golem. I scraped it down. Please don't tell him, okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel doesn't know what face to use to face this thing, just nod and focus on the spell spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his first official use of the perceptual position spell. When you learn this spell, you only locate the position of the item you have already determined, so that you can test whether the spell is successful. Positioning Reid is the first attempt to locate an unknown presence. The element gathers in his circle, is controlled by his spell, and exudes his consciousness. Soon, through the interaction between elements and elements, the search for Rhett is widely spread throughout the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elements, matter, and divine power are the three basic forms that make up the world. The perceptual position of the spell makes full use of the first two. Siegel got the answer shortly after the spell took effect. The magic statue, Rhett, was in the underground of the unknown temple, and was trapped in a state of stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was unharmed, but was trapped." Siegel stopped casting a spell and took a sigh of relief, then looked at the second look. His eyes said: "As I expected, he was trapped underground by a powerful spell: imprisonment, just below the temple. Time was condensed on him, he would not have any consciousness, feel no The outside world cannot change him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
