Siegel can change his appearance in terms of spells, and he is not afraid of any tracking of the prophetic spells, but that mother and son do not have this ability. In fact, how to deal with this mother and child is a headache for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You two walked with me for a while, I have something to tell you." Siegel looked at the burning fire in the yard and determined that the bodies were It is impossible to recover, and there is no more weight that can be used to cast the resurrection spell of the deceased. There are no ways for the mother and the daughter to thank him for his help, but he is also worried that he will cause other threats, so he has to follow him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, they moved away from the village, took the horse through the fields and fruit forests, and walked toward the sparsely populated fields. Dodd also found it wrong at this time. He began to look at Siegel's back and figure out how to find his heart. He is not very worried about what he is being taken away, but the mother can not be a little wronged, that is what he will never allow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They followed the sound of the water and came to a creek. Siegel loosened the reins, patted the neck of his mount, let it drink water, and then looked back at the mother and daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for him to speak, Elsa said, "Please, no matter what you let me do, don't hurt my son. I am not good." It’s easy to give birth to him, he is so beautiful.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I won’t hurt you, of course I won’t hurt him.” Siegel scratched The nose, then looked at Dodd and said: "I am Siegel squid, your father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Dodd shouted, then Shake your head hard: "You don't want to lie to me. Don't even lie to my mother in this way. There are already many fools like you who have tried it, we won't be fooled!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s mouth trembled and unloaded his disguise. Show the true face. But with black hair and black eyes, the two still don't believe it. "You are magic. Just like what you can, don't think about deceiving us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I taught you how to dye my hair, Ai Miss Elsa, when you were still at the top of the Mora, many years ago. It was my friend Dio who took me, and you received me." By relying on the memory of the people, Siegel can also tell the truth. The date, only when he wanted to repeat the detailed process at the time, was interrupted by Elsa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in you. I have an impression on you. When you came, was this black-haired look?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not all. In order not to attract attention, I have some makeup changes." Siegel looked at Dodd, this child is still immersed in shock, his mouth is big, enough Stuffed into an egg. "I didn't expect to have a child there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't think of it." The mother took the child in her arms and kissed his forehead and said: "We have a way to terminate the pregnancy, but he still came. I was scared at first, looking for a pharmacist to take some medicine. But the stomach is still getting bigger every day. Later I thought, this must be given to me by the gods. Child, I can't hurt him any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dodd's birth was very smooth. It has been growing healthily. Later, the dwarf of Mora announced the closure of the city. We left there and went to Deepwater City. At that time, he was still a baby, but he also persisted in the long journey. The good times did not last long, the Elven War began, and many people were forced to leave the New World and return by boat. Starry Kingdom, we had to leave with it at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a while here, there will be a while. But I can still raise him. Now We have accumulated some money and went to the country to start a new life. I didn't expect to meet you here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't expect me to be me from his black hair?" Siegel was a bit strange. . "My appearance is unique in the whole continent. No second person is born like this. And I am in Heim. It is not far from the Mola and Deepwater City. There is always news and news. To."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
