			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the war progressed, the demand for shipbuilding has caused the orcs to cut down the trees around Macabu, and there is not enough to make a big ship within a hundred miles. Good wood, now they all come to a more upstream location, looking for thick trees here. The rows of tree trunks still appear to rise and fall on the Black River, and all the way to the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc's outside the city is ridiculous, only mud, ashes and rubbish discarded everywhere. The three-eyed warlord Longte arranged a part of the army outside the city and set up a tent on the site of the original forest. They dug out the trees and used them as fuel, and then they messed up in the tree pits, making it smelly. Even in such an environment, people still sell their catches with buckets and carts. These businessmen need a lot of courage, they must be able to walk through the rude, violent orc soldiers, endure their cold, hateful and greedy eyes, but also to hide the money as safely as possible, so as not to lose their blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the camp is a wood dumping site, the wood drifting from the Blackwater River will be salvaged here, divided according to the material, and then distributed to the various docks. There are human slaves who know the use of wood. Many of them are carpenters who are robbed by orcs from the sea. Many people who don't get well in the Old World will try to come to the New World to try their luck, and some will be looted here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of the recent wood has red markings, have you noticed it?" said a one-armed slave who looked after the dumping field. His left arm was cut into two sections from the elbow, and now tied with a wooden hook, you can hang something like a bag. Only when there were no half-orc supervisors around him would he dare to talk to other slave companions of the same tragic fate. “Those speckles don’t look like they grow naturally. Is it a tree disease?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you do with this thing, do you want to see the trees? "A man who is skinny but has a big belly like a drum said: "The owner said that the wood is divided, and you will divide it. If you talk to the owner, the gold potion will not be enough. You also know the shipbuilding Hart." The gang has been watching our share for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guys are more annoying than the mice." The one-armed slave said: "Their The share has always been more than ours, but it is still greedy. These days they are more like a red-eyed madman. It’s like killing a living, it’s like killing, eating more and drinking than before. You heard that no, yesterday, the bloody dock There was a carpenter in Linwan Town who broke his hand when he was working, but he still didn't stop to rest. When others found out, his hand had completely turned black. The supervisor had lost his hand, but rewarded He made a whole bucket of gold syrup and let him rest for a day. No This man actually went to the nailboard the next day, and it was really a fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, traitor." The slave of the belly said: "In order to survive It is a last resort to work for the orcs every day, but such active work can be regarded as a traitor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not to let others hear, they are not Will pity their little lives." The one-armed slave said: "In any case, it is very difficult to escape from Macabu in this life, we must support the efforts to live, only to die later, more happy. Every night When I slept, I could hear the screams outside. It’s lucky that we didn’t fall into the hands of the generals. You see their messengers coming here, peeling a slave’s skin every night, saying that they are proficient. The feel of the hand. It’s hard to imagine what it would be like in their camp.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t say it, I’ll vomit it again.” The man said: "The amount of wood recently is very large, and the average distribution of red pine is to each ship. Go, go back early and go to drink medicine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are these red-stained wood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;""It doesn't affect the hardness and use of wood anyway, what do you do with this fart?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two started talking about other things until half-orc The supervisor has reappeared. I just gambled a few dogs in the camp next to me and won some small money. I am planning to vent to the woman at night, and naturally I will not care about the abnormality of the stockyard. If they look closely, they will find that the red markings will live, and the essence is a kind of hyphae that is entangled in the heart of the tree. They grow very slowly, and their heads are extremely small, even if they are connected in a piece, they are like a red marking. When the wood vibrates, some spores that are difficult to distinguish with the naked eye will fall off the hyphae and drift with the wind. The slaves who inhale this spore will become ideological fanatics and action machinery, and will work madly under the joint influence of the golden potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Makabu's witches will guard against magicians and guard against priests who are not believers in the gods, but will not guard against evil." Alchemist Eric Explained to Siegel: "If they detect evil, look at the city everywhere will be bright light, there is no need to do anything else. So our plan is to evil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General plants, except those who are wise, are naturally good and bad. But these are not the products of this world." Eric patiently explained that he would treat Siegel as his student. . "In the purgatory, where the Ugres is infested, this hyphae will grow into a large mushroom forest and become the main source of food there. That is, what you see now is the purgatory hyphae, which naturally brings evil. Breath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel carefully observed these "mushrooms" and thought they were between plants and animals. The tiny hyphaes that are constantly twisting are like tentacles, and seem to be able to sense the surrounding creatures and nutrients. “What kind of harm does this thing have?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Under normal, there is no harm, at most it will make the mind slow and slow.” Eric laughs Said: "But it will have a strong effect with the orc's golden syrup. Those ship unions become more and more stupid, lose their ability to change, and in addition to stupid work, even the sense of self-protection will gradually weaken. The composition of the gold syrup is not a secret to our alchemists. It is only a very low-level formula. Our research on gold syrup is much better than the orc witch festival. This kind of addictive pharmacy is used in slaves. Helping the orcs to establish social classes, but in fact, the addiction is not only those human slaves, but also the orc society has become a full-fledged addict." Eric pointed to purgatory hyphae, excited to shake his fingers: "We are very I’ve been trying to test this tactic for a long time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”Would the witch festivals not find this hyphae? The shipyard is now the most tightly guarded by Macabu No one knows how many places The eyes of the witch festival are staring there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, the shipyard is surrounded by layers, and the eyes of the witches are also staring there, but These are useless.” Eric shook his fingers and looked like a well-thought-out: “The witch sacrifice does not care about the health of human slaves. As long as the work of shipbuilding does not stop, no one will check the hyphae in the wood. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So your plan is to get rid of all the shipbuilders and let the docks of Macabu squat down?" Siegel frowned. "Those boatmen." Most of them are humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although this is a race war, destroying orcs to defend humanity, but does not mean that all human beings are allies." The alchemist said: " If necessary, you are also a solution, but we are not so mad. The role of purgatory hyphae is limited, even if I strengthen them with chemicals, the environment here will eventually kill the hyphae, at most half Months of time. My plan is the opposite. , Particularly the use of mushrooms purgatory fire element aggregation function to attract good the whole shipyard burned "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; this feasible? Siegel recalls what he learned at the Masters Union. Among all the elemental magic, Siegel has a special liking for the magic of fire elements, and is the most skilled in addition to the magic of water. He firmly remembers 317 kinds of materials that can attract the coming of fire elements, from the most basic cashmere to the most rare inflammation throat, which has absolutely no purgatory hyphae. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Eric to deal with all kinds of materials, but used the corners of his eyes to secretly look at the expression on the face of the alchemist. He is still a serious and calm expression, and his tone is not shaking at all. In short, he does not show signs of lying. "The most troublesome thing is that you can't get the attention of the witches in advance. The detection enchantment of Macabu is not a joke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How are you going to deal with this problem?” Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to come up with the housekeeping skills, you will know when you wait a moment." Eric was busy for a while until the oyster shell was completely crushed into powder. , put it into the mud bowl. Then he pinched the back molars with his index finger and thumb and slammed. Siegel saw a white denture pulled down and tied with a silver-white thin line. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemist smashed the thin line and resisted the vomiting sensation that rushed up, insisting on picking up a small glass bottle from the stomach pouch. Eric sipped his ale and then swallowed it hard, which showed Siegel a clear glass bottle that was not as thick as the little finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my secret weapon." Eric said: "Red Devils, his fragments can emit magical energy fluctuations under the influence of potions. It can be used to confuse the entire detection enchantment. As long as it is arranged in advance, and there are a large number of false alarms in the city at the same time, we can cover our real actions. This is called squid fishing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This gem is so amazing, can you show me?" Siegel reached out and asked for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
