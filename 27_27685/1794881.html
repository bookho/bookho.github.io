			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to implement his own plan, Siegel initiated a meeting of the Federation Council and formally requested assistance from the Federation. ¥°F, building a chain of transmissions connecting the two continents, turning the sea into a thoroughfare. This is a blessing and ambitious idea. It is good for Heim, but it is just an ordinary project for the federation. The construction of the magic ship has taken up a lot of their energy, and the apprentices fill up the rest of the time. The mages have already felt too busy, so Siegel saw many brows wrinkled, and apparently not too interested in the idea of ​​the transmission channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but who can refuse to do so? Everyone has a face to face, how can there be a fool in the mage who can enter the board? Did the magic ship fly to the sky with the help of the secret nuclear, and the nuclear drawings have been handed over to the federation, and then the federation refused to help the sergeant Siegel? Moreover, the construction project was carried out by Heim, and the Federation also made a profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the union’s colleagues with a smile while letting them slowly look at the plan in hand, adding: “The federation was the biggest in the year. The achievement is the cross-continental transmission of the Three Peaks Tower, which is a feat that the Masters Association has not completed. The new federation should also have its own things, and the one you circulate is the magic device used: long-term transmission Both the array and the energy channel are the latest achievements of the synagogues. And the efficiency of this transmission array will be much higher than that of the past trans-continental transmission array, which is a transcendence of the historical achievements of the federation."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a very creative idea, and I don't think this thing is as difficult as it seems." Verwood took the lead in making a statement: "I noticed this repetitiveness." There are a lot of equipment, most of which can be split and handed over to the apprentices. The bottom embryo can also be digested by the assembly line of Heim. Most of the work that needs to be done by the formal mages and those of us is concentrated in two months. .. Was when the magic of the ship have been completed "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Segal nodded. I agree: "I also have estimates in this area in my plan. If all goes well, when the dwarves hold a meeting, the transmission channel can be put into use, which will have a very significant impact and enhance the reputation of the federation." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of three or four months is short and short, but it can’t be said how long it is. Siegel’s plan was clearly written, and the wizard’s mages could not find any objections that could stand up. William, another sergeant with one vote veto, is still "wandering" outside. In this case, is it possible to form more than half of the opposition by everyone's "tacit understanding"? There is no need to communicate with each other. The mages knew that this was impossible, so in addition to the opposition Wendy’s opposition, the other members of the board agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows why Wendy voted against it: unless Siegel can accept her, she will definitely oppose it. This is a very naive behavior. Can emotional things be brought to the bright side, and slowly disassembled and explained one by one like a parse? This vote veto can't change anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your teacher, the federation will support your plan, but the current priority is still the completion of the magic ship." He said: "We will review it in a few days after receiving your specific manufacturing instructions before we can arrange a specific project."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you all. Support, within two days I will send the detailed drawings and the first cost of the project. I hope the federation will prosper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prosperity." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel turned and left, leaving Wendy with a big back. The guardian wanted to open his mouth. I don't know what to say. Instead, the chief of the curse, Verwood, chased him and found Siegel in the aisle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel **, I applied to borrow a few spell books." He took out a blue note and handed it to Siegel. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, you have to start formal learning secret locks and eternal stagnation. It seems that you have touched the boundaries of the sorcerer." Siegel Signed readily, allowing him to enter the ** division area to read books. "If you have any problems, let's discuss together. It is important for the federation to have multiple divisions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I work hard." Passing the note, then lowering the voice and saying: "I heard something that is not quite certain. Some wizards are secretly trying to make another secret nuclear. I suspect this may be related to the Master Association."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verwood frowned and sighed, and he felt helpless. The Federation has extremely "complex" feelings for the Masters Association, and it is simply impossible to use the rational thinking method of the usual Master. There are contempters, feared people, envious people, and disdainful people in the Masters Association, but the most troublesome thing is the one who does not say anything and adopts an evasive attitude to face this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters Association led the lack of evidence to support the merger of the Knox Association and the Federation. It was more like conspiracy theory to transfer Lion King Alexander at a critical moment. It also directly led to the conclusion of the "seeing death and not saving" conclusion. This is very similar to the situation in which Heim’s collar is facing Morah’s. The rational and emotional intertwined, it is not so easy to adjust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel feels the same, and there is still no connection between him and the dwarf. The stubbornness of the dwarves is as famous as their patience, and I am afraid that it is difficult to solve this problem at the dwarf meeting. But the affairs of the Federation and the Masters Association cannot wait until then to make a decision, at least within the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet has told me a way, maybe it will work in this matter. Everyone will concentrate on not discussing the actions that follow, but All the emotions have been vented before, whether it is crying, laughing, spitting or roaring, all come over and say everything that can be said. After a day, everyone can calm down and think." Siegel pats Chest, "This method works for me, and there is no harm in trying it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can hardly imagine such a scene, but you are right, Try no harm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do magic protection, maybe the spell will fly at the moment, the fire is full of days." Siegel said goodbye after leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only two months left before Siegel’s departure to participate in the Dwarf Conference. It’s too late to study the new theory related to the Nautical Cannon. So Siegel put all his energy into promoting the transformation of the production process of the territorial magic products. From the original artisan workshop production, gradually to the new manufacturing method with assembly line, standardization and modularization as the core, using the energy furnace and the creation matrix driven by the secret energy core to reduce the cost, and using the specially designed servant portrait to deal with the repeatability. Physical labor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoes like a beating, passing, shredding, cutting, Siegel created a special golem. It only takes a few strong metal arms to complete the mission, powered by the Mire Nuclear. This golem has been greatly welcomed, and metalworking has become more dependent on eyesight and experience than muscle and endurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can rely on Siegel's own creation of the servant's golem, which is a drop in the bucket. The Federation is busy with the project of the serial transmission. In this case, Siegel's flash of light flashed a servant's lord to make a servant's lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge guy. The core of the Golem, formed with limited pledge, can understand the manufacture of several standardized Gothic parts and the assembly work. Then the assembled things should be handed over to the wizard to complete the final steps, portray the circle, communicate with the secret, and cast a spell to make it move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a light god assists in the work, the maker's golem can process drawings that have not been seen before, break it down into manufacturable parts, and then produce Assembly. This is an important step in the history of making magic items, and the manufacturing speed of the servant will be greatly improved. And with the maker's golem, Siegel's vision of the miniaturized Golem army can be better achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the magical image is still inseparable from the Master’s spells and abilities, otherwise it is a subversive invention for society. Can the Golem be able to produce itself? There is a clear and affirmative answer to this question in the multiverse, but only in the mechanical environment can the creatures acquire life in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maker's golem is a giant, with thirty-six different metal arms, two to three each. It can't move its position, sitting quietly in the basement of the city of Mystery like a guardian, right next to the initial assembly line. The assembly line built by Erdu and Siegel had already stopped production. The new craftsmanship and better technology were moved to a new location in the Rift Valley, which is more like a nostalgic showroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be mass-produced, you must standardize and modularize, and the speed of manual work can't match the ability of the magic work day and night." A powerful protective spell is applied here to protect the maker's magic image. "In the future, this is the research room and delivery room of the Golem Force. If there is a war, this is the place to provide seeds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
