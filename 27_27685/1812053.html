			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Broadcast] Pay attention to the "starting point reading", get the first hand news of 515 red packets, and the students who have not robbed the red envelope after the Chinese New Year, this time can I have a show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the force wall, the mountain road is no longer a difficult trouble, but just an anxious journey. The closer to the seven-story tower, the stronger the induction from the Lord of the Rings. It is an impulse from the heart, between finding a life and death enemies and getting huge treasures soon. Siegel remembers to shield the negative emotions set by the writer in the devil world, but did not expect it to come out at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are affected by this emotion for a long time, you will definitely become a madman. Siegel tried it himself, even if he wore the Lord of the Rings in a sly form, he could not completely get rid of the influence of the Lord of the Rings. For the sake of safety, Siegel temporarily turned off the induction of the Lord of the Rings and placed it in the key space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蜿蜒Through more than forty peaks, the narrow and rugged road finally ends in front of a wide platform. Large white bricks are paved into flat squares, and seven different statues of the mage each occupy a corner. They have different casting instruments, common wands, wands, reels, crystal balls, rare swords, blood drops, and inexplicable emblems suspended in the air. All the statues were focused on the instruments in their hands, and the slightly open lips seemed to be chanting spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees the right side from the left side, the expressions of the statues are connected in series, and their lips form a coherent movement. He tried to imitate this pronunciation and found it to be the word "curse." The spell is the expression of magic, the basis of all Master's learning, but why must it be a spell, always a spell, but no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The platform behind the seven statues is a soft stone paved road, guarded by tall white stone pillars on both sides, through the last valley, and then Magic Tower. It is full of rich elemental power, and Siegel can pinch the elements into water, earth and the like. If you try your best to display the fireball, it is easy to create a landscape that is full of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element is too rich and brings some problems, that is, the decline in perception and detection distance. The dark night makes people unable to see things. But being shrouded in glare is also blind. Before a dark brown lamp god floated out from behind the statue, Siegel was not aware of it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of white smoke holds its strong upper body, a large hand holding a long staff - but how to look like holding a long The posture of the machete. The eyes of the god of light are painted with colorful eyeshadows, and a pair of brown mustaches hang under the nose. It seems a bit funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, a foreign mage, welcome you to the Supreme Magic Academy." The lamp god said in a dragon language without a slight accent: "Only one winner The person can win the crown and become the master of the magic tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is there before me?" Siegel is more concerned about this issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time and space are relative, where is it in the morning and evening? People who are one step earlier than you may not be born before you die. Why bother? Then care. When you walk through the statue, your face will be hidden. Unless you expose yourself, no one can know your identity through prophetic spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said that he understood. The kingdom of God formed by the fire of God has its own characteristics. Unless it also has the realm of the Kingdom of God and can win in the power of God, it must be obeyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this magic school, except for the identity of the student, there are only competitors. But all competition must be within the rules, otherwise it will be expelled. "Leave here forever." The lamp god said: "The rules are very simple. All interactions between you must be reported in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If someone suddenly shot , hurting other people, even killing what will happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp god smiled twice, and the figure shook. “Time and space are relative, there is no essential difference between before and after. The impact of violations can be traced back by time, you don’t have to worry.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all Things can be traced back by time, Siegel thought. However, he is not obliged to educate these lights. After all, the lamp god is nothing more than a structure designed to perform a specific task, not a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice has also changed. Old but not losing momentum, faintly with the sound of thunder. Siegel scrutinizes his body and finds that his hands are not getting worse because of his old appearance. He can still use the dwarfs and the elves, and the abilities that the scorpion brings are not affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"European Cologne will be my name," Siegel said after thinking about the lamp god, "I am from a day called The world of the top star."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history and culture, language and art of Zenith Star are readily available, and Siegel is not in this respect in order to deceive the goblin. Work hard. Later, these things were completely useless, and few people knew it, so this fake identity can be used with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please go here, Mr. Clullner." The lamp god flashed and flashed in front of the road. Siegel used a long stick to knock on his own feet, making it a bit awkward, like a really old man. It is said that the pace and pace can identify a person's identity, so I hope this simple camouflage can come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fears are superfluous. Blocking the original identity is the rule of this small world, unless you use a higher power, or you don't want to see it. After crossing the canyon, eight people have already waited early in the square below the magic tower. Siegel narrowed his eyes and looked at it for a long time, and did not see who Chanet was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are old and young people, male and female, plus Siegel has three humans, three elves, one and a half dragons, one gnome, A half-orc. Some people are cold and arrogant, some are full of loneliness and hostility, and some are enthusiastic. Siegel asked about it. Everyone came from a place like the Zenith Star that I had never heard of. They all arrived here not long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp god once said that time and space are relative. These people are likely to come from different time periods, but are transferred to this place. Siegel is also not sure whether he has experienced time to move when he is walking on rough roads. His current time is likely to be far from the Blackwater Bay orc war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your mission is to learn, then become the strongest one, climb the tower and become its master." The words of the lamp god are clear and clear, printed on each In one's ear: "You will have your own home and your own follower lamp god. Whether you want to get daily supplies or read books, you can find a follower lamp. Remember. Even if you are the only one left It doesn't mean that you can win, but it means that others have failed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the brown-colored lamp god disintegrated in the air and became Nine small lights gods of different colors. It is still brown to fly to Siegel. I don't know if this is a coincidence or something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first class was held in the afternoon," said nine lights gods in unison. Everyone is wondering how to judge the time and feel the top of the head. A round of the sun appeared out of thin air, hanging high in the sky, and the light and heat that sprinkled seemed to be the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no longer the effect that phantoms can achieve. Siegel clearly feels the vitality of the cockroach and the feeling of similar power. Opposite him, an elf wearing a black robe with a smiley face – completely visible from the pointed ears – flinched in the sun, as if this light and heat were a kind of injury. Is it going to be Chanem, he likes to hide and shadow, and even the bonfire doesn't like it. Not to mention the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The masked elf body trembled for a while, re-standing straight, escaping some light gray smoke from the gaps in his robes. He moved his neck, and the result was supposed to be the sound of the bones, but it was full of slippery snoring. This weird sound makes people feel nausea, and Siegel’s own goose bumps are all up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is listed on the list of dangerous people by Siegel and must be vigilant at all times. At this time, the god of the lamp has spoken again, and there must be some connection between them. Otherwise, it is impossible to be so tacit. “Your room will appear right away, and it will create an environment based on your own habits. It comes with alchemy and spell labs. All the materials you need will be provided by the towers, but the materials that are too rare will be from your final grades. Deduction. According to the time ranking of your way through the mountain path, you will now get 100 to 200 points. Please ask your own lamp god for the specific amount."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The voice fell. Eight earth bags were raised from the periphery of the tower, and then turned into a semi-buried underground house. This form of residence is very common in half-person villages. Behind the rounded door is a warm, comfortable place to avoid the harsh weather and the outside world. However, everyone did not come to vacation, and they competed with each other, so they looked at each other and chose a direction to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
