			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the elemental rune matrix and the energy focusing lens re-run, everything in the city of Mithril is different. Www/xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the secret nuclear, the summoning of elemental creatures has become a matter of almost no cost, and Siegel only needs one thought. You can create an elemental squad. With the positioning capability of the energy focusing lens, this elemental squad can instantly appear anywhere in the territory to execute defense or offensive commands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only obstacle to limiting the size of the element squad is simply the energy conflict between the elemental creatures, never the concentration and quantity of the elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves can use their tactics to create elemental surges, and with the help of the Mire nuclear, Siegel can do the same thing theoretically. However, after such a surge is generated, this energy core will also be destroyed, so Siegel takes the energy demand of the element surge as the upper limit of this array. He had seen the power of elemental surges in the Ghost Fog, and according to his calculations, his own secret nuclear core is possible to create giant elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the giant element should be more than fifteen meters in height, and it may be greater if it is a gas element. Such elements already have the power to directly destroy a castle, and even the Rune City Wall in the city of Myrtle cannot withstand several attacks. If the secret nuclear weapons were built during the Elven War period, then all the war trees and elf troops would not be seen by Siegel. Only the casters can create a real threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Master turned to think that giant elements may not be difficult to manufacture, but they are somewhat whimsical. The more elements gather, the more they will represent the character represented by the element: violent and strongly aggressive. This is the characteristic of the four basic elements of the plane, they will attack all the travelers who have entered the city without any difference, no mercy and kindness. Once the giant elements are created, perhaps the first one to suffer is the city of Myers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the four-meter-high large, nine-meter-high super large elements have begun to create self-awareness, and in the battle, they are no longer simply repeating the swing. It is the ability to choose the coping method autonomously. Very large elements are sometimes dissatisfied with the commands issued by the manufacturer, especially those such as "defense, guards, and patrols" - but if they are attacked, they will perform perfectly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, although it has great potential. But in fact, there are too few parts that can be safely utilized. After all, the element is not the best choice for guarding the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted the secret energy core, let it slowly expand the sphere of influence by means of the energy focusing lens, in addition to protecting the entire castle area, continue Expand outward. The absorption area of ​​the elemental rune matrix is ​​a radius of fifteen miles. The effective area is only less than two radii. The energy-focusing lens doubles this range, but Siegel doesn't know how much the Peruvian nuclear can cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about the repair that he had just cast, Siegel is full of confidence in the nuclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took his attention back from the magical array, only to notice that the whole army of Heim’s army was watching him, and his right hand was bowing to him. Their eyes are with adoring eyes. There is even a hint of fanaticism. Maybe the meaning of the sun-like light is not understood by them. They don't have enough knowledge and skills to calculate the concentration of elements, but they know that a wall that can be repaired at any time means safety, meaning standing in front of foreign enemies. Poor qualification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is invincible for ordinary soldiers without spell knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mana, remove the martial law, take the soldiers back to the camp, and reopen the trade route." Siegel said: "Set a sign around here, Warning danger. Especially naughty children, don't let them approach the secret. I don't want to see the wounding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight looks at the hair Iridescent energy ball. The instinct of the warrior made her aware of the threat and constantly wanted to retreat. But Siegel is right. For ordinary people, this is a glorious big ball of light. "Organs, do you want to build a wall to prevent someone from approaching? Does that interfere with the operation of this thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought about it, then Said: "A low wall is a good idea, you can do it. If you really want to have a hard cordon, try to get close to the energy ball, don't worry, let them try. I don't think they can succeed. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, if someone is close to this rainbow ball, what will happen?" She did not care about the final fate of the intruder, she just wanted to say a few words with Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, actually, I am not very sure. It depends on the color he has encountered." Siegel looked around and picked it up. A stone, smashed the weight, and threw it at the core of the secret. Under the gaze of everyone, the stone kept approaching the rainbow ball, but when it was not touched, a lightning shot came out and the stone blast was blown into the rice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning did not stop, but shot at Siegel. The mage blocked the knight who wanted to rush to protect, and the other hand painted the runes in the air. Lightning hits a protective spell and energy is absorbed. In addition to a scorching smell in the air, Siegel was unharmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the power that touches the lightning, and it may be flames, acids, etc." Siegel said: "Now this array is not It's completely powerless, so it's no danger to get on the platform. But remember to write on the warning sign, the brighter the ball, the more dangerous it is. The best thing to do is not to go to the platform at all."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember." Mana said: "After the Lord of the Lord, after the completion of the magic array, can you take a break without having to shut yourself down in the study room every day?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and let the female knight feel secretly excited. "I am going to take some time to restore my physical fitness and swordsmanship. I came back from the starting castle three months ago, but it has not been implemented. We have a few good swordsmen in the city of Mire, I need to use them. "Technology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The best swordsmanship is Evan, this is everyone's recognition." Mana blinked at Siegel and smiled and said: "But I want the lord to not go to him to practice swordsmanship, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exclude him." Siegel said: "How is he?" I don’t understand what it’s like to keep a low profile? Who else besides him?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”Hay’s collar has never held a formal contest, so everyone is not sure. Mana said: "I will bring them to you, maybe the Lord of the Lord can give a fair judgment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Are you ready to find a lot of people? "Siegel looked at the horsewoman's eyes and stunned: "I thought about it again. It doesn't seem to be a good master." Maybe I should secretly carry out recovery training. Then hold the contest at the right time. So, you have a hard time, do some sparring for a while, until Alfred hires another suitable coach. The original is a Good candidate. But his big mouth makes me less reassured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right coach can be found so well, maybe never found. With such an idea, Mana nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has no other things to explain, so Mana is busy. He closes his eyes and looks at the state of the array through the control node. Currently the energy focusing lens has covered a radius of fifteen miles. But it is still expanding. Within this range, Heim’s collar is extremely difficult to compromise, and at least the tactics of sending troops to the frontal attack do not make any sense. However, the assassin of the small stocks can still sneak in, especially the black man of the murder god, their stealth and shadow ability is still very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to using the magical servant guards like the Light God, what spells can play an early warning role? Siegel held his chin for a moment: maybe ask the guardian Wendy is a good idea. He only thought of starting the female mage with him, and then found that she was sitting on the ground and watching the iridescent ball on the squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty has witnessed the process of the entire spell coming into effect, and is now calculating the energy level of the Mire Nuclear. The estimated number is amazing, she is unbelievable. Then he counted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked up to her, and the footsteps made her wake up from her meditation. Wendy jumped up from the ground and frowned at Siegel. The voice was fast and anxious: "Your law is actually stronger than the Sanfeng Tower's mana pool. How did it do?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not seen the mana pool of the Three Peaks Tower, so I can't answer your question." Siegel said: "As for the secret of the spell, I can't tell you now, especially I can't tell you this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to learn this spell, can you worship you as a teacher?" Wendy said: "The federation is a teacher." I will dedicate my loyalty and ability. In exchange for knowledge and teaching, don't know if I can?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are always cautious, even in the face of colleagues in the federation." Wendy said: "Besides I ask you various questions, you rarely communicate with everyone, always researching in the laboratory alone. This construction of the squad was originally a good opportunity for us to unite these surviving synagogue mages. Let's progress together in the spell. But the result is that you treat everyone as a mercenary, only if you give us a task. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel painfully discovered this statement is true. Just like issuing a lord command on the bulletin board, the construction of the magic squad is bigger and more complicated. He arranged these things as the lord, but not as a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Magical Array of the Three Peaks Tower was built by two Masters and more than forty Federation of Masters. Everyone studied and discussed together and inspired each other. Only the Three Peaks Tower." Wendy continued: "We admit that you are amazing, walking in front of everyone, and this rainbow ball has the ability to open a new era of magic, but that is only your own strong. Perhaps Do you prefer the atmosphere of the Masters Association? One researcher is born and independent in his magic tower. The communication between the people will only happen under the driving of the interests. Look at the current federation, not just being Is the Mage Association destroyed for its own benefit? The Federation is not like this. We originally hoped that you were not like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the hub, The people of the Masters Association issued a solicitation to us, but we no longer believe in them. It is a mistake to merge the Knox Association into the Federation, but it is even worse for the Association to see the death of the Association. We will never Work with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty raised his hand and wiped the tears in his eyes, then said to Siegel: "At that time everyone looked up, only You may also rebuild the federation here, so we will come to you. Siegel I advise you, although you are the lord, but do not learn the subordinate style of the Master Association, everyone will hate and even fear you." She pointed to the Rainbow Ball saying to Siegel: "Especially after it has it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s gaze in Wendy and Rainbow Moving back and forth, weighed the pros and cons. Obviously know that the biggest weakness of Mire City is the insufficiency of the caster. It would be very stupid to push the Rejection of the Masters Association. However, from Wendy's words, he also learned that it is impossible to recruit a wizard of the federation. After all, he is not as attractive in any way as the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Siegel doesn’t want to be a consultant in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School City has sent a letter and recommended several consultants. In the letter they said that these consultants have no talent in the spell, but can play a very good role in assisting the Lord in governing the territory. Through the advisors of the City, Siegel can quickly establish relationships with other territories, greatly eliminating the time spent negotiating and negotiating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consultants will swear allegiance to the lord and serve only the interests of the lord. Although there has never been a betrayal of the lord in the history of the lord, Siegel still does not trust the people sent by the city. Heim has his special circumstances. Both Siegel and Janet have no relatives. The military strength of the territory is based on the loyalty of a few new knights. It can be said that it does not have the same heritage as the real big territory. Siegel may eventually be assisted by a consultant, but it must have been many years later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation is indeed the best option at the moment, but how can we coordinate the relationship between the Territory and the Federation? This has always been a headache for both the lord and the mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wendy stared at Siegel and noticed the hesitation in his blinking eyes. The colleagues of the Federation had exchanged in private and thought that Siegel was the only choice for the current reconstruction of the Federation. At the same time, everyone is also worried that Siegel will oppose this matter. First, because his time in the federation is very short, he has always been like an outsider, and he is still a lord, always putting the interests of his territory ahead. He has no urgent needs, how can he work hard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opinion of everyone is to collect as much money as possible and then restart the stove. Half-Elf Mage Idis is now the eldest member of the Federation. He is willing to help, take up the savings of building a magic tower for many years, and establish a new stronghold for the Mage Federation - one outside the Heim collar. Neutral area." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter remembers that Siegel once said that Idis is a member of the Masters Association. If he told Siegel about his proposal, Wendy believed that Siegel would definitely oppose the plan and spare no effort to leave the Federation in Heim. However, the female mage wants to know the true character of Siegel and wants to know his chest. The hesitation in Kesig's eyes made her gradually frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
