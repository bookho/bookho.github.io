			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take me to the camp." Elf Lia stood up, her tone was unquestionable, like asking Siegel to practice the pace of the elves. The same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Luna nodded to them and left. The two druids snorted and glanced at Siegel, entering the woods from the other direction. Only Master Rosian has been with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand never left his wand, and he said to Siegel unceremoniously: "I came to monitor you and protect General Lia." You don't want to hurt her spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel laughed. If someone here wants to hurt the wizard, he is the one who can protect her until the end. However, Siegel did not respond to the wizard wizard, he did not have to convince his enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Lia did not make any representations, just as the Master’s words did not exist. She took Siegel to the war tree, and several people needed to look up to see the shoulders of the old tree, and Siegel needed to look more closely to find the eyes of the war tree in the folds of the bark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes are like two black round coins, which are totally out of proportion to their huge body. The thick and tough bark protects them, their eyes are squeezed underneath, and they are rarely seen at ordinary times. Siegel looked at the eyes of the ancient trees of war and found that when they opened, they were like human babies, exuding pure and clear eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are big enough." Lia beckoned. The ancient tree of war swayed slowly, and slowly walked over step by step, then stopped in front of Siegel and squatted down. It has two large branches with no leaves as the arm, and there are more than ten branches at the end of the branch, and the right is used as a finger. The ancient trees of war raised their fists, just like the siege hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has never heard the sound of tree breathing<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. It’s finally a long experience. Along with the action of the war tree, it makes a slow and low-pitched scream, much like the bellows in the blacksmith shop. Siegel just wanted to ask why the trees need to breathe, and the old tree spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human?" The old tree has a raised nose under the eyes of the black scorpion, and below it is an unbroken tree hole. The sound is emitted from here. "Do you want to hammer it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alemo, no, this is my friend." Lia introduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old tree nodded, and the branches and leaves creaked. Siegel stepped forward and patted the bark and found it to be as rocky. The damage of ordinary swords is bound to be greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the difference between the ancient tree and the tree?" He curiously asked: "I know that you have vision, hearing, and if you have a nose, you should have a sense of smell." Do you have touch and taste?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can taste good water and good soil." The ancient war tree said: "We can also perceive the touch of others." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, his fingers dim hard, slammed a bark and observed the expression of the old tree. Just listen to it snoring and ask: "Don't pull it again. It is hurting me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am a little curious." Siegel will tree Pisce went back and slammed it hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the books of the Masters Association, the tree is a tall but fragile creature. Their size and strength are terrible, their movements are quite agile compared to their size, but they are extremely afraid of fire. The ancient trees of war should be an upgrade on this. The elves have to cultivate the ancient trees of war, which must take into account the fire prevention problem, and perhaps use other means. Segal took the opportunity to pull out a bark. There is a purpose of spying on intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the ancient tree of war actually has two layers of skin, the outer layer is tough, and it feels a far cry from the wood. More like a stone. No wonder that no old tree was burned to death in this war, that is, this layer of skin played a role. In the news that is currently heard, if you want to ignite a big tree, you can only cause a fire if you throw the oil canister into the canopy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying Elf Druid can make rain and extinguish this flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ancient trees of war were born for war. Their fists can destroy the walls and smash the towers. They can knock the heavily armed soldiers into the soil like nails." Leah said: "Although they seem to be unable to catch humans." The cavalry, but in fact the ancient tree of war has its own way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liya beckoned, the old tree nodded and stood up. I saw a branch of a curved fork suddenly becoming straight, and the leaves above it fell like snowflakes. The old tree of war pulled out the branch and wiped it with his hand. When Siegel looked back, the branch had become a javelin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old tree opened all its roots, firmly grasped the ground, then leaned back and lifted the javelin high. Zhang Da’s tree hole suddenly began to inhale, and the old tree seemed to expand and swell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud bang, and the whole ground was shaking. The old war tree threw the javelin in an instant, and the resulting airflow made the unprepared Siegel take a step back. The branch javelin instantly flew over half a mile and accurately hit a rock on the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock and the javelin were all smashed, and a cloud of white mist appeared in the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ancient tree of war was used to kill dragons." Leah said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage Rosian showed a proud smile. It is the wizard wizard who rediscovered the cultivation method of war ancient trees, and creatively utilized the characteristics of the ghost fog swamp, and arranged a huge law matrix to form the topography energy. Druid is responsible for improving the rune tree and combining the rune plants with the moss to mimic the ancient natural conditions that allowed the war to grow. The prayer of the priest of the Moon Temple allows the old tree to gain soul and can walk in the world. In addition to the dragon, who else is the opponent of this army? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient tree is very powerful, and the javelin thrown out is no longer a normal weapon, and even the strongest siege weapon can’t compare it with <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. If there is no protective spell prepared in advance, even the * division can't make a defense after the attack is launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh and blood is hard to resist this damage - after all, even the rock becomes a powder - the powerful body of the dragon may be able to withstand one or two shots, But only in this camp, Siegel saw four ancient war trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was shocked." Siegel said: "But it doesn't make much sense. I already knew that Heim's collar could not hold the full power of the elf. Attack. But if you break the rock, I have the same approach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly straightened his arm and opened his right hand palm in midair, with words in his mouth. A flash of lightning smashed beside the rock that had just been shattered, and the ground was also shattered. After a while, the sound of smashing and banging came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard wizard sucks in a cold air, so terrible casting distance! He is at the side of Siegel, can feel the gathering and casting of elemental power, can be sure that the lightning is called by the Master Lord. The location of the mine can be half a mile away! Even the Druid, which is best at communicating with nature, is only one or two hundred feet away from the thunder. Moreover, he does not need to prepare for the war-old trees. From raising his hand to falling lightning, there are three breathing time. If this is on the chaotic battlefield, who can guard against it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use the magic tower or the effect of the Elf Rune Forest, it is not difficult to accomplish such a thing. But Siegel is now in the Elf Camp, and there are no magic towers around. Rosian suddenly thought that as a lord of the mage, wouldn’t there be a mage tower in the city of Mith? He won't believe it anyway. If Siegel relies on the Master Tower, how far can his spells be attacked and how powerful is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Siegel with awe, and finally understood why General Lia was in the air and stopped the army. The Heim Collar is just a piece of land, no different from other land. But as long as you keep this land, you can drag the black-eyed mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he leaves the territory and harasses the elves, it is a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your spell ability has improved." Elf Lia said with a smile: "Every time you can surprise me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, there are surprises, otherwise I will not be able to go to this step today." Siegel's left hand in the sleeve loosened the core scepter of the elemental rune. Fortunately, the position of the rock is still within the range of the battle. He can manipulate the gas and fire mixing elements to complete the lightning strike spell. The hybrid element guard is just the technology that was mastered when the tunnel was drilled a few days ago. Energy conversion is the foundation of all this. Let the elves continue to overestimate the strength of Heim, which is good for the safety of the entire region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
