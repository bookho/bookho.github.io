			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good to see the sky again. ◎," the magic statue Reid stretched his body, and the metal and mudstone rubbed against the harsh noise. The konjac two toes whispered on the side, and the yellow-brown oil continued to flow from its eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Lord Siegel, and the sorcerer." The magic statue, Reid, bowed and said: "The sorcerer mana Very strong, just a blink of an eye, I lost consciousness, and then I opened my eyes and it is now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William smiled and then to Siegel Said: "You are really a strange thing here, the rare existence of the magic priest can also let you run. I have two free spins, one for use, one for you. Others are not Say, you quickly learn to return it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say this, I will give you a few more back." Siegel turned to Rui De, then said: "The next time you don't be so impulsive, the lich's life is not an ordinary magic item. Don't move again without the preparation of everything. But don't worry about the lich who escaped, I can hold him. Life, you can prevent him from causing harm. You can try the prophecy again, try to find the specific location of the underground volcano, I have been worried about this "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, I will work hard." Reid and the two sergeants waved goodbye, squatting back in the second oil To the unknown temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, the lich is different from the golem, it will be a problem sooner or later. And your brain has something wrong with the lich's life Carry it with you? You are not afraid of his subtle influence on you, and you will eventually become the undead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can I do, watching Alexander die "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? You!" After William was surprised, he quickly pressed the low volume: "Is the lich the lion? He is not dead? No wonder it is so easy." I have imprisoned the Golem. I have been wondering where you got rid of such a powerful undead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When did I get into trouble? All It’s trouble to come to me!” Siegel snorted: “Knox is a common meeting, an orc, an elf. Now it’s a dwarf and a goblin. Can’t you have peace in the last few years?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The farther your eyes are placed, the wider your mind, the more such things will be broken. Sunrise and sunset, it is possible that you can't touch a war for a lifetime. But you look at the multiverse, and don't all be in war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" When you say this, I really can't find any reason to refute." Siegel shook his head and reached out to hold it with the William sergeant: "You have to work hard and you are going to find the three hidden ones." Location."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, just like you like mining. I never feel hard to fly around to find something." William said with a smile: "You I can have one of the things I mine, and the source of my magic test will fall on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK, no problem. But You have to correct it, I really don't like mining."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't believe it, you are a famous civil lord!" William laughed and unfolded the dragon. Wing, screaming and flying into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ban on the wall-walled mountain range has finally closed, and it has been able to travel to and from both sides of the Wall Mountain Range by means of teleportation. The Williams told Siegel the location of several veins in the western wilderness and left a marker that could be used to transmit the position. Siegel is responsible for mining the mine and leaving the 10% of the net profit as a reward to the Williams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold, silver is an indispensable currency material for ordinary people. But for the Master they are just casting and alchemy materials. Excavating more gold mines can only increase the purchasing power of Heim's collar, and will not make real growth of magic materials. Therefore, only silver smelting, runestone, Mithril and so on are the favorite of the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are also a large number of smelting metals, iron, aluminum, lead and tin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a mining method that has never been seen in the history of the entire continent. The mine is 7,000 kilometers away from the smelting base. In the southern part of Mire City, Siegel started construction of a large number of smelting workshops near the large fractured valleys. All of them used the road signs to guide the elemental forces of the Miereng nuclear, and used a large number of advanced creations to join the smelting process. The method directly produces the billet. The remaining slag and the like can also be thrown directly into the Rift Valley, and even the burying effort is saved. He and the curse Villewood went into battle together, setting the improved long-acting portal to the smelting base, ensuring 20 hours of uninterrupted delivery to the mine every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the work of excavation? Despite the rich and healthy life in Hem’s years, the half-orcs in the Stone Village have shown a strong fertility, and the number has more than tripled, but the new generation will take some time to grow, and Siegel does not want to Orc residents are equated with miners. He will only send a few experienced people to the past, with only one task, managing the servant portraits and elemental miners' battalions used to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first materials obtained are all made to give priority to the servant's golem, increasing the number of workers, so that the work of mines and smelters can get faster and faster. And the servant Golem doesn't need to eat, he won't get sick, he won't complain, and he can work day and night. When I have enough raw materials, they are much better than using miners.” Siegel said to Verwood: “I have been I have an idea. After a while, I may not need a miner who will only work hard. But those who know the direction of the veins and who know how to build mines and organize production will be increasingly scared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are also fewer and fewer people who make the Golem." Verwood and Siegel check the magical array on the ground and look for each other's mistakes to avoid leaks. . "Fortunately, your Master's program is going very well. Some apprentices have been able to do simple work, and as experience grows, they will be able to handle the entire process of Golem manufacturing. The standardization and modularity you propose is very Well, the assembly line is also very powerful, so that these new wizards can quickly master the trick. But always so in accordance with the rules, it is difficult to appear master characters. Magic is ultimately art. Not technology."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right. Be sure to always be alert to this. Don't show any authority and say the same guy, such a mage can not go to the college." Siegel with chalk Draw a suspected error on the ground. He will not directly modify it, but will hand it over to Verwood. Similarly, the place that Verwood found was returned to Siegel. This is the case for the multi-person collaborative process. Although they help each other, don't help each other. It's okay to ask your own questions. Sometimes things that are different from the standard are not necessarily mistakes, and they are never popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What course has been recently. Especially about prophetic spells." Siegel suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you asking the apprentice who helped you?" Verwood shook his head. "Although the boy is courageous, it is not a practice." Material. Although very hard work, his induction of magic elements is really poor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to send him to the city to develop in the direction of the magic consultant. At least that young man is very hard at reading.” Siegel said: “No, I didn’t ask him, I want to go to class.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodwood stunned A moment, standing straight, staring at Siegel straight. "Well, ** 师师. I am more and more admire you. You can lower your body to attend classes, then other mage will have no worries. Everyone learns together. Teachers and classmates can not only make the learning atmosphere more harmonious, You can also avoid the arrogant master! How did you come up with this idea?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you want more? I have participated in the beginner’s salon, In addition to the five-day lectures given by Mr. Faranis, I didn’t have a serious study. Basically, I didn’t have any benefits. I became a sergeant and I have to worry about the Federation. Is it good for me?” Geer said with a smile: "Moreover, I do not understand a lot of places, just want to go to class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say? Anyway, I am following you. There are not many wizards that I can admire. You count as one and the only one younger than me." Verwood shook his head and continued to check the magical array on the ground. He casually said: "Sigger, have you found that you have become younger recently, no longer have a face?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Jenny Come back, so the mood will be much better than in the past. Siegel understood in his heart, but this is not necessary to share with Verwood. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the mine that Williams found for Siegel went deep into the wilderness, and the mountains that stretched for hundreds of miles were surrounded by a large swamp, becoming an island-like environment. If you don't need a portal, this is a hard-to-reach place, not to mention excavation. Monsters that survive in countless swamp environments, such as giant crocodile lizards, killer lotuses, snake lizards, tree rope demons, and naga, have drawn their own sites outside the isolated mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road from the swamp to the mountains is unreasonable, but the sky is unblocked. Many giant birds take this mountain as a rare resting place, even nesting and breeding in the mountains. Sometimes the creatures in the swamp will climb up and use the birds and beasts here as food to taste flesh or eggs. However, there are some powerful World of Warcraft on the mountain. A group of lions and beasts (winged lions), several groups of Dapeng birds and many feather snakes use this as a nest. Sometimes they also go to the swamp for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
