			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they left the Walled Mountains, the grievances had dispersed and finally the sun in the west could be seen. The light of the setting sun is about to be half blocked by the horizon, and it has begun to fade and dissipate, but still leave a trace of warmth to those who have escaped their lives. The wilderness in front of the country is covered with a layer of orange-red color, which is vivid and lively. This vivid color dispels the grayish black that presses on the clouds above everyone's head. They whipped up their last strength and walked down the last mountain road. When the sun slowly sinks in the direction of their right hand, the twilight follows, and finally they have to stop and camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, they have been sleeping for a whole day, with amazing perseverance to complete the distance that usually takes more than two days to complete. Although it seems to be temporarily safe, the threat of the orcs has not really been lifted, and it is not known how much the grievances caused the killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has established a campsite under the stars and the moonlight, and the conditions are extremely simple. Even the prince's Highness has no tents, let alone civilians with bare hands. Because I was not sure about the situation around me, I didn’t dare to make a fire at the beginning. Until the mountain knights carefully searched nearby, the fire was gradually raised after the heavy guards were arranged in key places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raw materials for the fire are collected from the trees on the hillside. After all, everyone has fallen below the forest line. Siegel used magic to ignite the first one, and then there was a little fire in the team. Everyone gathered around, heated food, melted snow, and stretched the tired body as much as possible. The morning priests blessed this time so that everyone could have a good night's rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill finds his disciple, "Siegel, can you use the magic to see things in the dark?" After receiving the affirmation of the Master, he went on to say: "Tell me, is the road ahead safe? Which direction is safe in the wilderness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to wait until my magic pet returns, I can know." Geer replied: "The grievances on the walls of the city are still interfering with my feelings. I always feel cold behind, so I can't tell the situation ahead. Maybe the pastors of the morning temple have better answers. After all, they can communicate with the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said that it will still be a dangerous night tonight. Don't rest too much, keep your arms at hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet will help me to keep the night." Siegel said: "You have to be more careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The theme of the next day is still a hurry, so the orc camp at the foot of the mountain is penetrated by the Paladins. There are no other enemies that cause trouble to the team. And they have a few more powerful forces, the survivors of the mercenary after the break, followed by the pastor, they also came to the Master to thank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your spells are really easy to use." The mercenaries received the reward, which is the happiest existence of the entire team. So they always smiled and said: "When they heard the wrong order, they stopped and looked strangely, thinking that we still had ambushes. Everyone took the opportunity to break away from the battle, although it was awkward when they fled. But I finally saved my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's what you deserve." Siegel said: "Hurry up to keep up with the team, there is still a long time." The way to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven Barron finally returned to Siegel’s sensing range at this time, and can communicate with it through the soul link. In the east of the team, there are two orc troops of two hundred in size, one of which is equipped with a wolf that can quickly attack. There are no enemies in the West, but there is no place to rest. The monotonous wasteland has neither water nor food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sporadic orcs in the South, and they are not a threat. As long as the striker moves fast enough, don't let go of any scouts, it will not attract large units for the time being. The Raven also reported. Outside the two-day walk, the human camp was discovered, initially appearing to be the mixed force of the deep water city and the grassland people. If you can contact them, His Royal Highness Prince will be much safer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After careful consideration, Siegel found the prince with the giant Kerry. At this time, Aaron was completely supported by the power of alcohol. Although it seemed to have strength, the journey of the journey made his body weak. When others don't pay attention, he relies on the saddle of the hexapod lizard to fight and try to restore his spirit. But as long as the prince is still there, the power of the morning temple will not be withdrawn. Everyone has always had hope, so His Royal Highness is also a source of many people. Many people want to lean on their side, and Count Todd always sends these people away without bothering. No, Siegel’s identity is special, and the count’s perception of him is also good. Naturally given release. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glass of red wine was handed to the hand of the temple in time, and the bright red wine warmed the dry lips, just like adding blood to him. Prince Aaron took a long sigh of relief and asked, "My Baroque. Is there anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, this is me. The loyal comrade-in-arms, the leader of the Jackdaw tribe, is also a well-known giant on the northern grassland, Kerry. Qinke.” Siegel said very solemnly to His Royal Highness Prince: “If the prince is honored, the giant Kerry will lead. His cavalry troops came to protect and fight for the honor of the starry kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry blinks, he is not stupid, knows that Siegel is Helping him, this time quickly greeted the attitude: "His Royal Highness, we have always admired the powerful starry kingdom on the grassland. I remember that my great ancestors once lived in the starry kingdom, but only after the emergence of the New World came to live here." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Siegel added: "Even if Deepwater City declares to be a self-governing leader, the Jackdaw Tribe has always maintained the life passed down from the traditional kingdom of the stars. Way. They are more farming, supplemented To nomadic, adhering to the custom of honesty and loyalty. This time it was also the servant rushed to the walled mountains to play for His Royal Highness. Their cavalry units were ready, and they could get to the Highness under a single command."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron is still a bit embarrassed, but Siegel’s words still listen to most of them. He kept his waking state and squeezed a smile and said: "Kerry, come to me. The kingdom of stars will never be ill-treated to friends. Other tribes on the prairie should learn more from you. You can take the lifestyle of jackdaws, That is, the custom of the kingdom of the stars teaches other tribes that they can accept your leadership and serve the royal family.” He paused. This passage has consumed a lot of effort and needs to regroup. "I will seal you as a knight, and a jackdaw will be your name. Go, go find your cavalry and bring them. I really want to see those prairie people, whether they are as strong as you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gestures to Kerry, and the two are thankful for the proper salute. “Is there anything else?” asked the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Master, the prince still has the spirit, and quickly said: "According to your previous orders, I have already conquered some orcs and used them as warriors. With them as seeds, the northern part of Deepwater City will gradually be intimate with the kingdom of stars. I think since the half-orcs in the Walled Mountains can be rewarded according to the battle against the orcs, can the grassland herders adopt the same policy?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince thought for a while and thought that the benefit outweighed the disadvantages. It has been a long time since Sham Shui Po was dissatisfied with discipline. They relied on the conditions of self-reliance to obtain secret funding from many kingdoms in the Old World. For the time being, the Star Kingdom does not want to use force to take back the city. The current direction is to enhance the right to speak in the city. Infiltrating and buying the lord's parliament of Sham Shui Po is on the one hand, and if it can enhance its control in the northern wilderness, it can have an effect of cohesion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the nomads of the grasslands want are nothing more than titles and belongings. They can't ride the sea on horseback, and there is no threat to the kingdom of stars. Prince Aaron looked at Kerry's tall and strong body and wondered if he would find someone to marry him from the family, which would further strengthen the union. However, at this time, his head began to faintly hurt, and the scene in front of him began to blur, and apparently the body began to become weak again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I agree. Count Todd will follow up on this matter." He waved to the loyal veteran and signaled it. Siegel once again saluted and took the giant Kerry away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they returned to the resting place, it was determined that Prince Aaron and Count Todd could not hear, and the giant Kerry asked: "Where can I find it?" Cavalry, they are all in the south of the grassland, I can't come with them here! And, along the way, you may encounter enemies, not only orcs, but also those tribes who are stunned. It is too dangerous to cross the grassland with troops. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, you don't have to bring troops after you go back. The Masters Federation sends a transmission mages, and it will come within a few days. The Prince will soon I will leave here and I will not be able to use the cavalry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, I earned a title in white?" Kerry still had some doubts: What's the use of this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you keep a good attitude, you can get all kinds of supplies and equipment." Siegel lowered his voice and said to the giant: "Don't you be the king of the prairie? Weapons from the kingdom of stars . To quickly grow your strength "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
