			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no rising sun in the sky, only constant collapse and withering, so the best way to calculate time here is to look at the process of breaking the edge of the Nethership. Siegel waited patiently until the collapsed area gradually approached the "minaret." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly stood up and ordered the energy body to stop absorbing energy and began to slowly release. Most of the plasma lines have been destroyed, but the remaining parts can barely work after getting energy. This can be a little help in resisting the erosion of the void, at least for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked slowly out of the energy ball and walked straight in the direction of the minaret. The surrounding elemental warrior has long since disappeared, and he is alone on the empty island. At this time, he could not judge whether the ruler was dead or alive, and he could not return to revenge. He has already achieved the limits of mortals, and the rest can only be given to fate and time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked in the ruins, then stopped, and he saw the wreckage of the konjac. The collapsed passages reached the body of the body, and even the outer shell of steel could not support thousands of tons of weight. The square body of the original square is now flat, the slender arms and legs are twisted and lying on one side, and the yellow oil flows all over the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the scene that Siegel wants to see, even though he is mentally prepared to cast his spells. He can't say that Dudu is a martyr, and he can't be called "a warrior who sacrificed for justice and kindness." The konjac was just an innocent person, and he was involved in Siegel's will to fight and was destroyed. In the middle of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before stopping in this body, Siegel is like standing in a darkness, darker than the void. He wants to cry, but there is no feeling of crying. He has been in the state of the undead for too long. It has been for a long time to forget the color of the living. In the world of black and white and gray, it is the most brilliant player in the world of calculations. The only thing in his line of sight is his game. Rules and intelligence are his pieces. Those feelings that are removed from the board are of the living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel lifted the state of the undead. Let the heart blood return to your body. Huge pains rushed like a landslide, and immediately crushed him, only lying on his back on the ground, his body twitching. This is the destruction of the body by massive energy, which is a symptom left by the transformation of plasma. However, Siegel should thank the konjac because it is the death of Siegel. Separated from the state of the undead. He allowed himself to be overwhelmed by all kinds of feelings, immersed in the sorrow of the sorrowful sorrow and the emptiness of the void, and the flowing tears diverted the physical pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mourning took a long time until the more powerful emotions than pain and sorrow took the initiative. Siegel’s body felt the thin air here. He also felt the threat of hunger and thirst and sent him a signal. The power of survival made him recover and wake up and stand up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out an elf biscuit, stuffed it into his mouth, and took a sip of water, which greatly satisfied his body and mind. . Then he took out the black dagger, cut the ruins a little bit, and dug out the body of the konjac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tombstone was made from a piece of metal. The above is written in the dragon language: "This place is sleeping with two beeps, a konjac, a singer. A happy and innocent creature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Void Ship" There is no dirt on it, so Siegel can't bury the konjac. The void will eventually devour everything, and the meaning of burial is not great. So the mage said that the tombstone was placed on the smashed body of the konjac and then prepared to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Siegel suddenly thought that there was a smoldering crystal in the hole of the original konjac head. It should be absorbed in the energy focusing lens spell. It is like stealing something from the dead, it is immoral and will be cursed. Siegel took out his own soul crystal. Then plugged in from that hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May you rest in peace." Siegel said: "There is no god here, the soul is not returning. But I still want you to rest in peace, not to be resentful." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after saying this, Konjac’s eyes blinked and his fingers began to tremble. Siegel was shocked and hurriedly stepped back two steps. He carefully observed the surroundings, maintained the highest alertness, and quickly placed protective spells on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The konjac is swaying, but apparently it is alive. His twisted outer shell limits the ability to act, the broken eyes can't see the surrounding situation, only the slanted mouth says the nightmare words: "The head hurts..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you saved me, human?" Two rhetoric said: "Thank you so much, I thought it was dead this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously konjac There is no connection between Siegel and the Scorpion of the flesh and blood, but this is not important. The mage only hopes that this guy will survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you feel now?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I have dreamed of a lot of things." The two muttered, apparently regained the spirit: "The ceiling I sent broke open, collapsed, and then I smelled the smell of blood oil and something, maybe rubber? I heard the sound of explosion around, then the flames and the ice were blown by the wind. What happened?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A battle, the master was driven out." Siegel said: "There is only you and me on this empty ship."<br /><br />&nbsp "Wow, that scene must be very exciting, but the one who was driven out is the master." Two beeps gave a sigh of praise. "Is it done? Tell me, are you right?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage nodded, then cast a floating disc, summoned a white force field tray, and held up the two. In this way, the konjac can follow Siegel to move around, but not at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no ruler, so are we all gone?" The konjac had big eyes and looked around with damaged lenses. He saw countless broken limbs, and the corpses that had been removed by the elements were like the dead branches in the winter forest, almost covering the ground. He sighed and said: "What a pity, I have seen a personality with a personality. But he likes to be too dazed. I have no patience to accompany him. Have you seen him?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After self-appearance, I have never seen what you said." Siegel said with a smile: "You have been seriously injured and need to recover slowly. It is better to be there." Take a nap on the floating disc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, I really need a break. You know. I sweat on my head and the temperature is very hot. May be in a fever." The konjac said: "I actually have a fever, it is a strange experience. The feeling of dizziness is such a thing, and my hand can not lift."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel put his hand on his head and silently recited the curse of calming emotions. At the same time, he was relieved of the pain. The konjac muttered and repeated: "My head is so heavy that I can't lift it." After a while, he fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage has performed a floating technique for himself, so that he can act in the ruins that have been demolished. He first came to dominate the room where he was. Looking out from the gap that he had taken apart. The endless void is so close to him that it seems that as long as one step is taken, it will be ruined. Siegel spent three minutes looking into the depths of the darkness, mourning for his enemies, and then began collecting spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other places, the magic devices in the void have no use, they are mostly dismantled into raw materials, used to make the sinister warriors and 骷髅beetle. The master does not need magic equipment, only knowledge from all kinds of worlds. So I built a room to store books. In the previous battles, the elements of the army had been destroyed to varying degrees, and here they could not escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no way. Siegel knew very well. There are too many elements, so it is impossible to get a command. And he can't perform precise battlefield command behind the energy hood, so he can only use the simplest commands. Fortunately, books don't seem to be threatening to elements, so they avoid the end of being broken like a warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the books on alchemy, the purification of substances from various minerals and the knowledge of making ointments. Very few are magic. Siegel can see familiar pictures but can't read the words inside. As a mage, he can use spells to help solve this problem, but there are more important things to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put most books into space bags. Siegel floated to the "spider" at the top of the Void, and he finally saw the whole picture of the conveyor. The so-called minaret is a spiral sharp corner engraved with a plasma rune. It is 10 meters long, thick and strong, just like the rhinoceros horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long corner is slightly bent downwards, and the tip points to a black giant slate, enough for the mountain giant to easily stand on it. The material of the slate is exactly the same as that found in the Rift Valley, but there are hundreds of grooves here. There are many gems in the original groove, different colors and materials to form a mysterious pattern. But in the great vibration caused by the battle, many gemstones broke and turned into powder in the groove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
