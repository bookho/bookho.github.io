Exhausted waves not only put all the enemies, but even the insiders who entered the enemy were not spared, so Siegel also loaned him four earth element rune guards to supplement the manpower before he hurried back to the spaceship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation of Viscount Bill is not very good, the body is extremely weak, I am afraid it will take a long time to nurse." As soon as I boarded the spaceship, Master Shelley took it. Come to a bad news. "You have to wake him up and ask him about the time and content of his last few meals. I need this information to dispense the medicine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought for a moment, I will do things according to the words. After Sir Bill wakes up, the first thing to see Siegel is to grab his sleeve and squeeze a hoarse word from his throat: "Find the history book, the seventh book of the history of the kingdom, Swan Castle. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Bill is at ease, I will find it. You are safe now, I have solved the possessed ghost. How do you feel?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very weak, never tired so much." His tight fingers slowly loosened and kept breathing. "Thank you for your help. I don't have much time to wake up. I can't write to you. I only have time to divorce her. It's really hard to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said Talking, while thinking about falling asleep. Siegel hurriedly asked about his recent diet and learned that he had not eaten any other food except wine and a small amount of cheese. After saying this, Sir Bill was sleeping again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"**, the person who has been possessed by the evil spirits needs a very pleasant environment, can no longer experience anger, sorrow or sadness. But can not suddenly Ecstasy and excitement, this may also cause wounds that cannot be healed.” Master Shelley said: “If you agree, I can show him some magical techniques to appease the dreams, so that he can gradually restore optimism and positive attitude towards life during the break. This is good for his health."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, I will hand you Sir Bill before returning to the king."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to Wangdu, Siegel will definitely go to the morning priest or the priest of the Temple of War. To rehabilitate Sir Bill, now he still has something to check. Sir Bill was photographed by the shadows of the dead, and there must be hidden secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he returned to Swan Castle and found the wiki in the hall. When the magic spacecraft attacked. There is a reception here, and many nobles exchange information with each other on this occasion and brew a plot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like the list of people in the Orthodox Association and all the interrogation materials? I don't think there is any problem with this." The wiki said: "You can help it is really good, many The puzzles can be solved. No capture operation can be as smooth as today, and it is very rewarding. Marquis adults. You helped me, I will help you, this cooperation is very enjoyable. This is the case in Wangdu, someone can help Stand firmer and look farther."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with you." Siegel nodded: "Aaron passed the throne to Egypt." How long does it take for the orthodox to have such a scale? Don’t you think this is very embarrassing? Where did their intelligence come from, and how much money? How did they contact and organize?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right, there are many questions, you need to slowly find out." Wiki walked to the table. Find two cups and pour the cool wine. The mountain area where Swan Castle is located is very humid and sullen, as if it is always surrounded by a wet towel around the neck, which makes people feel depressed. "The Marquis is an adult, but some things need to be decided as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the cup and held it in his hand, not in a hurry. "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Duke of Swan Castle gathered in a rebel party and couldn’t get away with it. Because he doesn’t have many relatives and friends, there won’t be any aristocrats. He pleaded for him, so he died. What do you think of this huge castle? The history of nearly five hundred years is a good place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want What the castle does. I already have Heim and Mystery." Siegel blurted out and then understood the meaning of the wiki. Right, he also has what he needs, so he said: "The castle is the base of the insurgents. All things are criminal evidence, I am not interested at all. But you said that there is a long history here, maybe there will be some good books, I I want to enrich my library."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. I thought about it, I don't want letters, you have to look for clues from those things. If there are any history books, biography, local history and other books with no rebellious information, you can sell them to me after checking." I am a sergeant, but I have to think about it for future generations. I can't just let them see the magic book. Are you right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original Marquis was on this If you are interested in selling, don’t say it, it’s an action to protect books. I’m happy to help.” Wiki said with a smile: “If there is something missing in the Royal Library, the Marquis can also tell me. If there is something missing, you can't let the first library in the world lack something. You say this is the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he suggesting, can you help? I am going to school to steal things? By the way, Janet once explored the important prophecy of Lehr to Aaron, who was only the great prince, and she sold the news to the Knox Association. At that time, she was not the official of the intelligence chief, but she was only a trainee spy. Since she can accomplish such a task, maybe the official spy skills will be even stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, as a Marquis, how can He De call the King’s agent? Perhaps the time is not yet ripe, Siegel reminds himself. Can't be too hasty, it's too dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he smiled twice and said to the intelligence chief: "You mean the library of the school city? I don't welcome me there, so I didn't have a chance to visit." Browsing. The Royal Library is the largest library for me, currently..." He sighed and said: "If this matter can be solved perfectly, maybe I have time to read the book. It can only be prepared like this. The winter ants have more reserves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Marquis, winter is coming." Wiki will drink the wine and drink it. Have a deep meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the intelligence manager is a very helpful person, using their mysterious contact information, some formal hounds and temporary recruitment "wild dogs" "Gathered together to help clean up the scene and hold prisoners." The books of Swan Castle were all piled up in the courtyard, and the letters inside were taken away, leaving only the books. Siegel summoned the invisible servants to move them over the spacecraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one book in it that is his goal: The Seventh Volume of The History of the Starry Kingdom, a total of eleven volumes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a three-finger thick hardcover book with a lock that is set with silver. The author was not found on the cover of the book, but there were some very strange scars on it. If rust is evidence that the metal is old and old, then the decay should be the fate of the leather cover? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decay of a diagonally across the cover leaves a strange trace of lightning, which is a far cry from the surrounding envelope. Siegel touched the impression with his hand and suddenly felt the shadow left by the shock of time. He carefully looked at it and combined his experience with the use of a virtual cannon to speculate that this lightning trace is a material manifestation of time. This book must have experienced time and space shocks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the book with 100,000 points of curiosity. The first ten pages recorded the marriage between the Star Kingdom, the promotion jazz and the lord. Nothing strange. But the subsequent sentence shocked Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aaron Stars inherits the throne and opens up the rule of forty-two years. During this period, the kingdom of stars ushered in another development, scattered in The power of the nobility was further concentrated in the royal family, and the starry empire finally conquered the elves and the dwarf kingdom and laid a solid foundation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this history book? Siegel sat next to Sir Bill and read backwards through the light. This book contains a completely different history and a history that can never be realized. Aaron is dead, and he has not left a real son, so the prosperous world of the starry kingdom written in the book will not be realized in his hands. Perhaps the Orthodox Church believes that this book is true, and they have the ability to reverse everything and let fate follow the lines in the book. But do they really think they have such power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe they are just looking for an interface for their ambitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently flipping through the pages of the book, Siegel carefully read. He did not find traces of Evan in it, nor did he have himself. There are only wizard associations, school towns, and no unions in the whole book. When he saw the entire book, he suddenly discovered that there was no mention of the New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
