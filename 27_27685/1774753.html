			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel swayed his fingers, and the bottle on the table flew up and slammed into the glass in front of Mana and Kenkey. The knight smiled and nodded, and the one-eyed knight seemed to be a little cramped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that the training of the territorial soldiers is very good in the South," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenke is a little overwhelmed. I just didn’t reprimand everyone at the meeting. Why do you want to say this now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About the judgment on the combat power of the elves, your opinion is very pertinent. Now is not the time when Hein’s army is confronted with them. Mana reports to me. It is said that there are a lot of knights in the territory who are asking to take back their castles. Not only are they Heim’s collars, but also some knights who are sheltering outside, aren’t they?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Lord, you are right," said Kenki. "They came almost nothing when they came. They just felt that they were already very good when they had eaten for a few days. They wanted to recover their homes. But I think they just want to attract attention. It’s good to earn a reputation for themselves. They are gambling. When the elves are really repelled, they will become a rebellious pioneer when they are transformed, so the title and territory are possible.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana looked at Siegel and said: "Kenke Knight is a very intelligent person, I am right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said to Kenki: "Although Heim’s collar was invaded The land to be recovered is also very valuable, but Heim’s collar is not a place for decisive battle. The current timing is not right. I have an important task that can only be given to people who are smart and loyal enough. So you really want to Think, then tell me what I just said, you understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A test is also a good opportunity, Kenji thought. He still has a good ear and a slap ear - this is his habitual movement when thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage is not in a hurry, pick up the cup and take a sip, keep looking at McGee’s expression and wait for his response. Siegel has a bold plan, must find a smart and capable knight responsible, and for confidentiality. Mana and Zucker were excluded in the first place. The lord recommended Kenki, so it is time to see if this person has a long-term vision and a strained ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, I understand this." Kenki said: "The elves outside the city have been taking siege, but now they are allowed to go out of town to cultivate. Although this is also a matter of want and supervision, I think they will maintain this state until the city of Deepwater is divided."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue. "Siegel nodded, not wrong at all." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The more reasonable guess is that the lord and the elf have reached an agreement to get this situation. I think. As long as the opposite elf's general has always been Li Ya, the agreement will be followed, and Heim’s collar is very safe. It is basic to take precautions, but there is no need to provoke the war, at least not in our own land.” He looked up and swallowed it. The wine in the cup then said: "No one, the lord of the South is not our real opponent, especially after such a long period of siege. And the elf is more prepared and takes advantage of the field battle. If it is now There was a large-scale battle in the South. If we get involved, then the advantages we have established will be gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel drums applauded, "Mana said, you used to For a long time, I am working as a mercenary?" He said: "I heard that the last poet who went to the Eckart Cliffs Estate to sing is actually a partner you met earlier?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers pay attention to their origins and take money to sell their lives. Mercenary career is obviously not respected in the past. Kenki looked up and looked at the two people in front of him. Mana has also worked as a mercenary, or that status is relatively low. Lord Siegel used to be a seafarer. He is generally considered to be a little better than a mercenary. But who knows if he has done anything like smuggling or pirates? Kenki judged it. I don’t think these two people are the kind of people who care about birth and history, so they nod and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am now a knight, a lord, and I can’t forget The partners of the past. They are very rules now. Baron adults, never provoke awkwardness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, at least you are very honest today, and have not forgotten A partner who has ventured together in the past.” Siegel said: “I think this task can be handed over to you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need you to secretly contact the various mercenaries, and may even include assassin organizations, robbers, bandits. Attack on the elves." The knight said: "The purpose of all this is to contain the strength of the elves and make them stretched in the south. But this thing must not let them find that Heim’s collar is behind him.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenke blinked and suddenly said: “Is it what we want? There are other actions, so I have to lead the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded: "When the elves need strength, they will inevitably draw up their enemies. Soldiers. Let them know about our training every day, just to give them enough reason to split their soldiers. They not only pass their own eyes, but also some people blow their hair in their ears. After your actions begin, Heim collar and ghost fog The swampy fields should continue to be cultivated, everything should be the same as before. I think the whole area that determines the outcome is in the north. I predict that there is an important battle that must be played, which is related to the trend of the whole war. So the elves can only be busy. Get up and pay attention to the city of Miele, then we can mobilize the army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenke thought, frowning: "After the war, most of the mercenaries Without business, there was no way to leave by boat, so many of them became robbers. These people saw the forgiveness of others, and many of them also robbed the refugees hiding in the mountains, but not many dare to scream with the elves."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you have to find a way. In the New World, the number of human beings is more than six times that of the elves, but a mess of sand, no deterrence. Plus the preparation of the elves is indeed more Full, so the soldiers are defeated." Siegel's eyes are sharp, and it contains cold eyes. "But the elf wants to occupy the walled mountains with such a small population. It takes a long time. Even if the trees are planted everywhere and the forest is used as a magical tower, the trees need the nourishment of time and power. They can't do it all at once! They want to plant trees, I will destroy and not let them go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unicorn knight touched the old scar on his chin, which was cut by a knife and later burned. It has been smoothed up now: "No wonder they have to plant trees all the time. It turned out to be sentinels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, their trees have not grown yet, otherwise All actions will become difficult. Kenki, how much do you think the mercenaries and robbers can forget the danger of the elves and dare to try to attack?” Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think five gold coins are fine," said Kenki. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Add to ten." Siegel said: "There is a magical item called the hand of the sage, hanging around the neck to expel evil. It's the best. The raw material is the right hand of the elf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenke shudders. The elf who lacks the right hand naturally cannot pull the bow, and it is even less likely to use the long sword. Completely lost the threat. And this also forced the mercenaries to come up with real battles, it is impossible to sneak into slippery. If you want to cut off the hand of the elf, you must have a real knife and an elf, which is much harder than a normal sneak attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Heim's collar. You can avoid spending money by collecting the elves' palms, but pay attention to diverting your sight. Kenki didn't know what the magician's hand was, but it sounded scalp. Use the hand of the elf's body as the raw material, and hang it around the neck all day. Only evil wizards will do this? No wonder the whole thing must be kept secret. Never associate with Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most important part of this is to cause some trouble to the elves, but it can't make them angry." Siegel said: "According to the character of the elf And tradition, it will not hurt ordinary civilians, but if they are rushed, only God knows what they can do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana went on to say "So on the bright side, we have to fight these robbers on the grounds of order maintenance, and even help the elves to catch them. Only in this way can our cavalry be able to leave the city, and the lords of the south can have space for activities." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unicorn knight took a few deep breaths to calm his mood, and then nodded heavily: "This can be done. I can contact a few mouths." The middleman, doing this thing is like the reward of the Masters Federation." Then he squeezed his fist and took the courage to ask: "The Baron, the robbers will not obey orders like soldiers, they are likely to Bring disaster. There is one outside the castle. Farmers hiding in the villages of the elves are likely to be hurt and hurt more than the elves. What will happen to these mercenaries when the war is over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Regardless of the outcome of the war, they will be wanted because of the atrocities against the civilians.” Siegel said: “If you want to stay in the New World, the starting point is a good choice for them. There is vast land and a lot of Opportunity, there are countless treasures west of the Walls Mountains, and the footprints of human adventurers are needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
