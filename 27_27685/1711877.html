			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep passage is dull, mixed with the pungent smell of dust. The sound of disintegration of the earth element oscillates in the channel, eventually forming a rumbling rumble. Several people looked at each other and waited until everything was silent before turning to look at the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Digging is so simple?" Fazak's shovel in his hand was thrown to the ground, as if he was too disgusted. "Is it less than half an hour, I dug it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s just going through the vein layer, and you have to dig it." Adjust your breathing, rub the forehead, and relax the tight nerves. "Now I need to go down and take some soil samples out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is so big, let me go." Mana stood up and said aside Remove the quiver from the back. "I am not affected in this passage, and the footwork can be faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can't see things in the dark." Siegel Shaking his head: "If you go to the torch, the air inside is not enough. Even if I keep pouring in the air, but the passage does not form a through loop, the effect is very poor. If you can't see it, the speed is too Affected, it is better to let Mike slow down and go back quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼克!" The Orc nodded. He unloaded his own equipment and left only his close-fitting clothing. On the belt, a wide-blade dagger and a sack were placed, and then Siegel showed him a light-hearted technique that would speed up the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This spell can also drive the air around you, making you breathe more comfortable." Siegel yelled at him before he left: "Don't be greedy, I only need some soil to do the experiment, and what we have behind is the opportunity to dig."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc nodded, then bent down and walked into the passage. Siegel then casts a spell at the hole, drinking the power of the element to gather, and then forming a breeze blowing into the hole. The swirling airflow makes a squeaking sound, like someone screaming at the mouth. About twenty minutes later, Zucker's gray face was drilled out of the passage, his face was a little red, but it looked pretty good. He untied the sack on his waist, which was filled with red earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel untied his water bag and handed it to the half-orc. Use magic to remove the dust from his body before checking the bag. "It's better than I thought. It's a red earth-type gold mine. It's easier to extract and refine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet came over and asked with a squint "I thought it was golden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. That is Shajin, although it is not necessary to refine, but it is very troublesome to pan." Red soil, then sniff under the nose. “The red earth gold mine is not as good as sand gold, but it is convenient to dig. The refining is not complicated. What is more important is that the red earth gold veins are generally stored in large quantities. You don’t have to worry, see me show magic.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he drew a magical array on the ground. Siegel has always planned to prepare for his own lord's path, especially how to quickly gather wealth through the identity of the lord, so as to support his mage to learn. He needs an alchemy magic array that can continue to operate on a large scale, whether it is refining minerals or purifying experimental materials, which is essential. This time his magical array was specially studied during the rest of the city. Although not the latest spell technique, the win is simple and rough, and no complicated material preparation is required. Use the casting material powder to draw it out. The only difficulty is the precise control of the spell by the caster. The higher the level, the better the spell will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red soil was thrown into the center of the magical array, and everyone was far away, and Siegel began to recite the spell. The magical array of spellcasting rituals usually takes a long time, and during this time the wizard is not sensitive to the surrounding situation and needs extra protection. Fortunately, there are no other creatures on this striped mountain, and several partners are also on guard (at least at the beginning). As the Siegel spell progressed, Janet and Zucker all turned their attention to the red earth that was constantly rolling and shrinking. Only the archer Mana resisted curiosity. Still vigilant, always observe the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soil is getting less and less, the magic array constantly squeezes it in the middle, and the impurities fall like a greasy glue. Siegel held his wand. The palm of one hand is grasped upwards, and the red earth gold ore is squeezed in the air. The process of refining allowed the magical array to emit a glaring flash and a disgusting scent, and the heat was infiltrated by waves like waves. Siegel has a magical array of protection, so it only has little influence, but others can only retreat until the edge of the cliff, where it is hard to support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wiped the sweat from his head, and the body of the distracted body swayed a few times, eventually relying on running and picking up Janet's arms. He made some adjustments with a short but deep breath and stood up again. "Nothing, you can rest assured that just letting these magics continue to make me feel a little tired, just take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he waved, the gold nugget was obedient The bird flew to his hand, but when he was in his hand, he felt that it was heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People come together to watch, and then take turns to get the hand. Fitzak also bit his teeth, and then smiled and said: "This gold is very good. If you want to make gold coins, you have to mix other things. Let's have money!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is a stable source of income." Siegel grabbed Janet's arm and happily took her into her arms. "With this gold mine, at least we can start building our castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak nodded and took another bite of gold. They stood on the cliff and looked at the land at the foot of the mountain. The quiet shield river provides irrigation for this area, and the forests of the north and the hills of the south provide a wealth of goods. All along, it is full of development potential, but lacks sufficient motivation. Now that there is a gold mine in the Striped Mountain, all ambitions can begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“With this channel as the core, it is best to prepare a ventilation channel for digging the ramps and shafts.” Siegel stood on the cliff and planned: “ It is not bad to cut the second mine hole at the foot of the mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where do we recruit miners?" Fitzk asked Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First ask if the half-orcs are willing to work. They all have the ability to see things in the dark, and the strength is big, it will be more convenient under the mine. Siegel looked at the half-orc, and said to him: "I will pay them the right compensation and try to ensure the safety of the mine. It is not a gold mine for slaves and slave owners, but a place of work." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc nodded, and the voice hoarsely replied: "哼克!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Then he said: "In fact, I hope that the Orcs will join the City Guard, especially those who have been trained in basic combat. But now the cost of supporting an army is too high, and it is still gradual."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very wise, the Lord," Fitzk said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the rest of our money, take some of the money and give priority to the gold mine. I will stay here for a while and use magic to speed up the construction." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't! You will be very tired." Janet said with concern: "Today you cast a spell and almost fell."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and said to Janet: "This is necessary. Casting magic is like learning swordsmanship. It needs to be practiced from time to time. Now there is an opportunity for me to teach and learn. And I can take this opportunity to adjust the composition of the spell. In fact, I have a few ideas to experiment with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying this, the wizard’s face glows Exciting and happy radiance is as pure and happy as a child who is the favorite toy. After Janet saw it, she would stop saying more, but her heart was a little restless. I remember that on the way to the Walled Mountain Range, when he was sleeping under the squid and the starlight, his face was like this. Can it be after that? Haven't seen him so relaxed and happy for a long time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord, how long do you want to stay here, do you need to prepare a camp?" Fazak asked carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without special preparation, I happen to climb the cliff every day to exercise. It is estimated that most of the time I will be here before the castle is built."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I know." Fazak nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people are not in a hurry to go downhill, and Siegel is taking the opportunity to arrange the work for everyone. As the first loyal warrior of the lord, archer Mana is responsible for patrolling and guarding the entire territory. Siegel used the half-orc twin brothers as her deputy to concentrate the fine weapons, first establishing a team of ten people and conducting daily patrols around the territory. The entire team's horses, except for the two left to the waiter Moore, the other are used by this team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
