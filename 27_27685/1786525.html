			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of attorney cannot be faked, and the two groups are exactly the same. Www*xshuotxt/com Especially for the four-person team, the marriage of their former teammates made the team lack support in the battle, so everyone still welcomes the addition of "Sor captain" and "Jie". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We want to travel to the town of Kaibu as quickly as possible, and then walk to reach the destination." Siegel took out the full mission letter to other People explained: "We will investigate a manor in the vicinity of the manor. The lord thinks that there is a hidden party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The voice of his voice is very good, you Don't you think?" Ai Meng licked Nina with her elbow and said softly in her ear. The exhaled heat made the glasses girl itch and his face became red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you setting up tasks, and what can't you tell us?" Narya pushed her glasses and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was prepared for this issue, and said: "This is a task of investigating the rebel party. I can be trusted by the lord. You are only professional. The ability is recognized. There is still a gap between the two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naria nodded: "A very reasonable explanation. If we find the danger beyond the profession The scope of competence, such as the army that has encountered the rebellion, what should we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You decide." Siegel straightens and puts out the gloves. . "As long as you have the professional ability, the rest is only related to the bonus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard it, bonus!" Ai Meng excitedly slammed his hand: " Can we set off?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan made a very elegant leading gesture and smiled and said: "Ladies, I have prepared a good horse outside, I am very I am honored to take you there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have a horse." Arnold said: "There are some of our equipment on horseback."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can follow, this is not contradictory." The gnome patted the pastor's knee and said: "More mounts will not be a bad thing."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anomen thought for a moment, "I put some equipment on the new mount, I still like my horse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Read and listen to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of ten horses sharing the load, but this has not made the journey easy. Siegel urged everyone to go south as soon as possible, and there was no time to appreciate the scenery along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little snow on the day they left the city of Mith. It can be returned to the sun less than half a day later. This is the winter in the South, just a gentle woman who occasionally hangs frost. The traveler manages this kind of snow called the kiss of the lover, because once there is rain and snow, the robber will not come out. They will be safe when they walk on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is just a paradox." Yao En sat firmly on the saddle and said to Evan: "No matter whether it rains or rains, the footprints on the ground are It can be tracked, so this is not enough to affect the robbers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't they come out?" Evan was very curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it rains, they can go to the bath." Yao En replied: "If you don't bathe, they will grow mushrooms."<br /><br />&nbsp "Hahaha, you are telling a joke, right? You are such a funny gnome." Evan is dancing right away, no one is more excited than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not say a word, leading the way at the front of the team. They marched along the southward path and crossed the entire Heim collar. Even in the winter, they can see busy people. The farmer who wants to make money becomes a laborer, and with the help of the federation apprentices, he repairs the road together with the earth elements. If in the past, the lord ordered the road to be repaired as a terrible servant, often accompanied by hunger and death. However, in the collar of Heim, like cutting a mountain. The heavy work of carrying earthwork is handed over to the earth element treatment, and the laborers are responsible for leveling the ground and doing the finishing work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel attaches great importance to the road and thinks that the road is like the ocean currents on the seabed and the routes on the sea. It is the orbit of everything, and these roads are also his claim to the lord. Protection. From the Rabbit Ear Harbor to the Walled Mountain Range, there are many caravans passing through every day. The trade hub between the two continents has gradually moved from the deep water port to the Heim collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the roads are quite frequent and the territory is safe, it is not difficult to find a place to rest after sunset. Although it is difficult to build a tent, raise a campfire, and arrange a night watch, these adventurers are involved. Ready-made residences are always much better than the open air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the good times are not long. After leaving Heim for two days, the road has once again become a path in the grass, and the muddy and rugged pits have become the main melody. The rugged roads spread along the hills that were ridiculously occupied, and the villages began to become alert and unfriendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The South is like this, in fact only Heim is good." Arnold said: "Siegel. The Earl of Squid is a good lord, just "Benevolence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meng inserted at this time and said: "The key is that he can pay on time every time, never owe, this is the most I like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like? I don't like this tone." Evan said with an exaggerated expression: "I also pay on time, why don't you? Like me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you mean I would like someone because I paid for it on time?" Ai Meng narrowed his eyes. "You are saying me." Is it a girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Star testified, this is my most impossible meaning." Evan immediately raised his hands over his head, on horseback Staggered. "I have not degraded your intentions at all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is still falling, and he hears his mount screaming and falls to the left. Evan twisted his body, kicked a kick on the horse's stomach, borrowed the force to turn into the air, and then landed steadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing!" Elmmon first jumped from the horse and reached for the horse's head. "Anomen came over to help, and the horse's leg was broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What am I doing wrong?" Evan asked Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel raised his chin and pointed to the gnome Yao En. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s normal for the horse to step on the pit," Yao said. "The horse is very smart and knows how to fall down and not hurt. I will try my best to protect the rider on the back. In the previous situation, you two should only have a slight scratch. But you took advantage of the force to land safely and aggravated the strength, so the horse fell even worse. The leg was broken." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome touched the beard on his chin and said to Evan: "Only the aristocratic rider will have just the reaction and action. Your coach is definitely not an ordinary person." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Evan looked at Siegel: "I didn't think about it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel patted his shoulder: "This does not blame you, sometimes the rider is much more important than the mount."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naria Help check it out. The broken bone of the front leg of the horse is exposed and difficult to handle. Imon jumped up from the ground and rushed to Evan's face and punched him in his stomach. "Bastard, you are a jerk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan licks his stomach. I took a breath of cold air, but I completely accepted it myself: "I played well, I didn't do it right, sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't tell me!" It was a little wet, and the fist dangling in front of Evan: "Go and your horse said, it is going to die here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death? Why? It’s just a broken leg.” Evan said: “Anomen is not a pastor, you will be treated, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Mother Earth shakes Shaking his head: "I can dress it up, or try to pick up the bones. But this horse can't walk, let alone keep up with the team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Doesn't you have to kill it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The village that we have just passed has passed for a long time, and the village in front of it is not known. Yao En said: "On the road, I saw traces of several beasts, wolves and bobcats. You have cured its legs, and it can only be left here to be eaten by wild animals." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Evan looked at his horse, walked over to personally check its wounds. As Arnold Gate said, this level of wounded horses will be killed on the battlefield, and the meat will be distributed to the soldiers. Was such a fall only caused minor injuries to people and horses? He thought about it carefully, even if he did not protect it at all. With excellent armor and a strong body, such speed and height will not cause any serious injury. Evan regrets that it should be a simple bruise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
