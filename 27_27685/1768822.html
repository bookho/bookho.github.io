			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you from, Mr. Soth?" Wendy took a gentle step, walked over to the table and picked up an orange. She slowly opened the orange peel with her slender fingers, revealing juicy flesh. Some orange juice flows down her fingers, and she raises her hand and gently sucks her finger on her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After only two seconds, Wendy suddenly felt that her behavior was somewhat out of date and quickly stopped the sucking action. She hurriedly handed over the oranges, but she rushed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am from Ximu Town." Siegel reached out and took the orange from Wendy's palm, took a sip of juice, and then placed two pieces of pulp in the mouth. Inside, there is Wendy's residual body temperature. After swallowing, he smiled and said: "You must have heard of that place. It is a bustling and busy small harbor. Every day, you can see all kinds of happy people. Various accents and customs will appear there. There are many everyday. Things can be seen, and many things can be done. What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am from Bunu City, a small castle in the eastern part of the Star Kingdom, my father is the lord of the lord. It is a beautiful place to produce the most beautiful diamonds on the entire continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a young lady." Siegel re-appeared and smiled and said: "It's a pity that Bunu City has lost its most beautiful diamonds, and only people in the hub can see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one has praised me like this." Wendy bowed her head and was a little embarrassed. She crossed her fingers and said, "I didn't like female red when I was a child. I have never had sewing skills. And my parents died early, there are no brothers and sisters. I am useless, even myself. I can't take care of it, I have never dressed up." Her blushing, said to Siegel: "I still wear clothes like this for the first time, I don't know if it is appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You wear this very beautiful, nothing is inappropriate." Siegel's words made Wendy tremble, then relaxed. He went on to say: "It is the most basic to make yourself feel comfortable. On this basis, there will be beauty. I observe you and feel that you are sometimes not confident. This kind of emotion is very bad for you. You need to learn to adjust your emotions. Knowing that adjusting emotions is often more important than learning spells. Did the accident that you almost appeared not long ago related to recent depression? Can you tell me what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Wendy nodded and her fingers tightened her clothes. Keep on gently. After the courage, she said: "I saw three shadows when I went upstairs. They... they talked to me. I don't know what happened, but I am sure it is not an illusion or a spiritual spell. I was scared at the time and couldn’t figure out why this happened in the Master Tower.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you afraid of the dead?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty looked up. Look at Siegel's eyes. He saw a pair of eyes filled with sorrow and sympathy, and a pair of eyes could understand her inner eyes. If at other times, she will be very careful with other mages, especially with regard to psychological weaknesses. However, under the influence of the Red Magic Tower, she did not feel dangerous. She only felt the faint warmth from Siegel's voice and made her feel safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if you don't want to answer," Siegel leaned back on the chair, a little farther away. The shadow of the hood just covered his face, and the eyes that made Wendy's favorite hide behind the darkness. Can't see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing." Wendy hurriedly said: "For the undead, I am really scared. When I think about it, my body will tremble. In fact, there is nothing to keep secret. Many people in the Masters Federation know this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't know before." Siegel rejoined and said to her: "I I spent too much time on my mission, not in the Sanfeng Pagoda all the year round, or I will know you long ago. I will definitely ask you about everything, then I will understand you and help you. When it comes to the undead, I will deal with the undead all the year round. Know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the Necromancer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, then I am You will be in front of you." Siegel shook his head and took out his wand. He gently recites the spell, and a creature summons the spell into a spell ball. Slowly floating in his palm. "Oh, I am a curse. I help others and summon others. I have been acting alone, but I often need help when I have completed various tasks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;After a moment of silence. Siegel reached out and pressed on Wendy's wrist. Wendy's fingers shook, and the soft feeling of his robes cuffs rubbed clearly, a mixture of spices and petals, and a man's unique smell. She looked down and found that Siegel's fingers were not as slender as other mage, but as strong as a warrior. The wide palms and strong fingers and the burning sensation came from the fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can't help but rely on the past, wondering if Siegel is also the same warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wenty, I really need help now, but I must be able to believe you." Siegel’s finger clicked on her wrist, then Said: "Can you tell me something and keep it secret for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I do it!" Wendy blurted out. She felt her lips dry and weak, and then added a small voice: "I will definitely help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at her step by step by spell Influence, the power of the magic tower has basically accumulated to the limit, if it accumulates a little bit, it may trigger Wendy's protective spell. This is a dangerous game that tests the ability to control spells and understand the state of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like walking in the narrow road next to the abyss, and stepping on the wrong one, there is no chance to recover. As long as any protective spell is triggered, Wendy will have a hot head and will inevitably launch a counterattack. Siegel needs to crack the opponent's spell protection layer by layer to regain the advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at that time the Red Magic Tower has been alarmed, and he will face the siege of several wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now you have to be careful, you can’t continue to add oil to the dry wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your heartbeat is very fast, but I need you to calm down for a while." Siegel followed the temptation: "I came to investigate the magic that occurred before this magic tower." In the accident, the three mages died here, and the reason given was that the spell experiment failed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard of this, this is an ominous place. Wendy licked her dry lips and said, "Sometimes, I can feel the uneasiness from the magical fluctuations. It seems to be mourning for the three dead people. Do you feel this way?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s lightly clicked on her wrist – a lot of information from the pulse – and then continued: “It feels important, But at the time of the investigation, the facts are more important. A mage tower that has not yet been built, someone will perform a spell test here. Is this too far-fetched? And, what kind of spell test will make people eat themselves?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty’s breath is rushing, her fear Now, the stable feeling of happiness is disappearing. Siegel can't let her emotions out of her control. Use her fingers to gently stroke her palm prints, and then lean closer, as the words can make their breath slowly deliver. "Don't be nervous, there is me here. You may have heard some news, most of them are true. The federation wants to know what the failed spell is. Even if it is dangerous and has the value of learning, I am investigating. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think?" Wendy's brief soberness made her eyes shine. She has not realized the change in her status, but then Siegel's answer will definitely affect her attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has a pleasant smile. What kind of answer does a young woman who is afraid of the undead and specializes in protective spells like? Is she trying to pursue the stimuli brought about by danger, or is it far from right and wrong? Is the desire for curiosity stronger or cautious? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently spit out words, just like the best mantra. "I want to know what happened, so that this tragedy will happen again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty’s eyes smiled, she was satisfied with the answer, relaxed again . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this pass, Siegel has the confidence to continue. He said to Wendy: "Would you see the ghosts that were the three dead wizards? I went around the tower to investigate. I found the place where they died, but only the tragic traces left by ** There is no energy fluctuation in the soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty squinted and shook his head and replied: "This tower has powerful magic protection and can continue It is normal to absorb the residual fluctuations around you. I also often visit the tower and reinforce the weakened magic array from time to time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
