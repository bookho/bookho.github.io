			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meeting is very different in every aspect. Www*xshuotxt/com Sigel, Mana, Alfred and Wendy have developed very detailed rules. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, this meeting was not held by the lord of the city of Mire, but the gathering between the mages, so every master of the meeting was the master. The owner is going to save money and only accept magic items - at least reels or magic potions - to get in. It is precisely because everyone is the master, there is no table in the venue, only a lot of identical chairs and a solitary floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no servant in the venue, so all meals must be prepared in advance and placed neatly on the table. In order not to make the meeting into a lengthy dinner, there are no cutlery and other tableware on the scene. All the food is very small, and it can be completely put into the mouth by hand. No one needs to use spells like invisible servants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor is covered with cashmere carpets from the north, and the taste has been treated, so there is no need to sprinkle spices. No open flames are allowed in the tents, all of which are illuminated by immortal flames. Except for the protection spells, other spells are absolutely forbidden. In the notice sent to each mage, they refrained from using words such as “invitation letters”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many people will participate in the total, do you have feedback?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty opens the bag and takes a whole number of functions, then says: "In addition to the stubborn deformer Telford, the other thirty-three federation members All claim to participate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Includes Edith?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the first A person who sent a letter of consent.” Wendy frowned at the undetectable, and said to Siegel: “Would you like to find a reason not to let him participate?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "Why? He is still a member of the Federation." Siegel said: "The Faranes once said that the most important thing in the Federation is not the Three Peaks Tower, not a magic book, but the pursuit of magical freedom. Ideas and people who work hard for this idea. Edith is a member of two mage organizations, but this is not unacceptable. I don't dare to trust him completely, but it doesn't mean I don't like him."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are handsome, do you know?" Wendy suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" Siegel still squinted and said: "I am a mage, not a warlock. Shuai is not handsome and has nothing to do with me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With me, Wendy thought. "I'll take a look at the anti-peeping array on the roof, and check the magic of the protection system by the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please, Ms. Protector."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also to avoid the impression of the conference owner. Siegel can neither go to the first one nor the last one. After about seventeen eight masters arrived at the venue, Siegel walked out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Edith on the stairs leading to the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf squats with a new staff and climbs up the steps step by step with both feet. Siegel didn't see anyone else, so he walked over and grabbed his arm. "No spells are allowed in the venue. You can't say you have to go up." Siegel asked strangely: "What about your apprentices?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I let them go early, and I want to go through this road." Idis said: "I haven't walked with my feet for a long time, and now I want to try and can climb up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are older, it is necessary to exercise properly." Siegel said: "It seems that the Master is the only one that is more valuable and more valuable. When the swordsman is at your age, he has been unable to move his weapons and can't get on the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I basically went to the point where I couldn’t display the spell. The elements will fail.” Ifdis pointed out: “It’s really time for your young people.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hope so too.” Instead of escaping, Geer said directly: "It’s just that when you have worked hard for your ideals, you finally find yourself achieving your goals. Afraid no longer a young man "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"It has already been used." Siegel said: "I met the assassin of the murder god some time ago and almost died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be united Will ask for help. The assassin of the murder god is a problem for all mages and must be solved. In front of the common enemy, the elf will also reach out to seek help." Itdis said: "This is an era of collaboration, Even if you are as strong as a mage, you can't take all your burdens yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right, this is what I am attending." Siegel helped Idis climb the top floor and came to the tent. The emblem of the nine-claw squid on the sergeant's robe of Siegel lit up. The emblem of Edith is half a leaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They left two magic scrolls and walked into the venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survivors of the Mage Federation are gathered here, and they talk to each other with a low voice. Some are discussing magic, and some are reviewing food. But most people put their gaze on the Siegel squid who just walked into the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the young lord, it’s amazing." Someone said: "Because you are twenty-two, you are already in both magic and politics." It’s incredible to have achieved success.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He’s just a speculator.” Some people are not satisfied with Siegel. "Think about the ruins of Deepwater City, and there is also his credit there. Now everyone knows that Heim has a very close relationship with the grassland robbers who have looted the deep water city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also heard about this. The carpet under our feet is from the grassland. Perhaps it is still stained with the blood of the Master of the Deepwater City Headquarters Federation." The speaker slammed the soles of the feet and mud Gray is applied to the blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But he defeated the elves and saved the living space of the New World." There was a mage who opened the shield as a tray with a lot of exquisite be careful. "Do you want to see him fail and accept the result of being driven to the sea? Don't be stupid, he didn't hurt you, why bother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hey, you are not sure to eat the goods, be careful to be sold and help the number of people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage gathered and scattered, news and views Spread in one small circle after another. Siegel and Edith stood by, and they were surrounded by spells, and no one was surrounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have a few familiar people in the federation, this situation can be understood." Siegel said to the half-elves: "But why are you? No one cares?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you believe that I can stand up, the distance of four or five steps is enough, and then you are left alone. Here,” Idis said. “I am obviously dragged down by you, so you can save those sultry words!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Since no one else can chat, Not as good as I want you to ask a question." Siegel's eyes brightened and he grabbed the wrist of Edith with his hand. Just like being afraid of him running. "If I need to pass an issue at the meeting, should I pay attention to convincing anyone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf looked at the Master of the Master, and he smiled twice. "You are really interesting about this question. If the proposal that everyone likes, you can pass it without persuasion." He found that this answer obviously could not satisfy Siegel. So he raised his hand and pointed to the people in the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The short stature, gray beard is neat, and the kind-hearted person looks like a curse to you: Weywood. Seven tails, there are seven mages here. It’s his apprentice, you can think of them as one; you see the woman in a black coat with a dark green jade necklace on the chest? That’s the Countess Shelley Salon, don’t look at her looks young. In fact, I am more than twice as old as you are, a necromancer. Persuading her is a difficult task, but she can bring you at least five votes - if the conference adopts a voting method."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The brains of the plastic energy system are relatively straightforward. As long as they are not the kind of conspiracy of turning around, they generally do not raise objections. But if you are not at ease, you can go first. To find out about Sementon, it is the fat man with a pear-shaped belly, a three-layered chin, and a pale yellow short-shoulder—or simply the fattest fat man.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Most of the change department masters have a good relationship with me, but I already Tired. Just eat something for a while, watch the performances of your young people. There are only two people in the Prophet's Master. Because of the relationship between Dr. Faranis, you should support you. The enchanted Masters have all become the Knox Association. Party feathers, there is no one inside the tent. As for the protection department, you know who to look for, you don’t need to talk nonsense.” Idis, licking his lips, said to Siegel: “Look at me saying so much, you don’t Would you like to give me some drinks?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
