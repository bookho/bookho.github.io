			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s body resilience is astonishing, and the wound under his ribs healed in just three days, which surprised Leia. Siegel attributed this to the magical ability of the Elf master, but the elf knew that this is definitely not the effect that simple magic can achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the wound is not good, Siegel can't exercise, he can only read in the carriage, he is still trying to crack the password book, and enjoy it. . Those irregular lines and symbols are constantly changing in his eyes, and it seems that the mystery will soon be revealed. This caused Lia's curiosity, she would take the book to see, but soon gave up. The elf thought that looking at this messy line was a waste of time, so after Siegel's wounds healed, he was forbidden to read again and must focus on training. In addition to continuing to upgrade the elf martial arts, in order to prepare for the later adventures, Leah also began to teach him some things about battlefield coordination and combat command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where two people want to go is the top of the Mora, a huge dwarf city, and the center of the dwarves on the New World. According to historical records, when the wall of the storm receded and revealed the entire New World, the determined dwarves were summoned and they came here in a ship that never sank. The elites of the original seven clans were joined together under the mountains. They found the walled mountain range, found the highest peak here, and named the mountain the top of the Mora. Later, the dwarfs built a rock kingdom here and lived and proliferated here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf's patron saint cares very much for his people, so the dwarves' expeditions are earlier than the elves, humans, and all other races, earlier than the dragons. Only because the dragon has wings and can fly directly over the ocean between the two continents, it only surpassed the sailing ship and arrived earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the dwarf city is above the snow line, which means that two people must prepare a lot of warm clothing. Fortunately, there are several villages and towns dedicated to the Kingdom of Dwarfs. There are countless farmers who grow oats and potatoes on the plains, make bread, brew beer, and trade with dwarves. There will always be a large number of warm clothing for sale and rental. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road from Hubburg to Mora is generally considered to be safer. There is no place for monsters to hide here. On this plain, there are many stone watchtowers. The Dwarf Intern Warrior will be here to guard against threats in all directions. Their watchtowers are as strong and efficient as other dwarf buildings. As long as the wolf is lit, the message will be sent out quickly. The dwarves have a reward for years to those who can help the watchtower in time. Whether it is passing the caravan's guards or simply adventurers, and even some residents around, are willing to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, this plain has always been a very popular land, with a large number of farmers living here, or farming, or grazing. There are many small villages along the way, most of which are warm and hospitable places. They have long been accustomed to passing caravans, and they are not afraid of mercenary mercenaries. Under the protection of the powerful dwarf kingdom, the residents here can hardly live and work in peace and enjoy a peaceful life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf’s interest lies in digging underground, and the huge mountains of Mora and the endless veins underneath it are enough to satisfy the dwarves’ hobbies, so this powerful The kingdom has never been expanded externally - it also gives the surrounding forces a sense of relief. Listening to Leah said that more than 100 years ago, some dwarves were willing to explore the vast unknown land west of the Mora, but their fate was unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you think Sir Bill is a serious and stereotyped person, then you will change your mind after seeing the dwarf Elinette." Say: "Irenet's last name is diamond, which is a family name of a dwarf family with a very long history. They have always been known for their perseverance and stubbornness, even with the standards of dwarves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Lia, how did you meet? I mean a human being, an elf and a dwarf?" Siegel asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirty years ago, Bill was not a jazz. He just made his mark on swordsmanship, so he came to the New World to participate in the Knights Martial Arts Competition in Hubburg. The winner will probably get the jazz title – you know, he is the champion.” The elf slowly said: “After that, he became the Knight of the Stadt family and needs to serve for at least twenty years. Then I was able to seal the territory. It happened that an orc came down from the northern plateau, looted the village and town, and even smashed into the deep water city. The dwarves, elves and humans united and decided to give these green monsters a profound lesson. We are Meet there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you see what I saw on the spot, I won't say that." Leah sighed softly: "For the soldiers on the front line, this battle is naturally full of honor. There are many stories that can be heard. For the commanders, war is another matter, a gradual game of numbers and politics. It turns out that external threats will always be defeated, but internal differences are fatal. Deepwater City became an independent territory and no longer accepts any leadership; Xinlin and Hubburg are guarding each other, and no one believes in it; the dwarf returned to the pit and announced that it would no longer mix other ethnic groups in the New World except for commercial exchanges. The situation of all this is more chaotic than before the orcs came."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can this be? You can't solve the misunderstanding, let's talk about it?" Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no answer to this question. In fact, not only between different races, but also there are many different factions within the elves. From the perspective of other races, the elves have long life, high culture, and powerful power. They are the spokespersons of elegance and civilization. Kelly knows that under this glamorous appearance, the elves are also facing divisions and struggles. Many of the elves' branches have acted independently, and they are no longer treated by the same family and compatriots, leaving only a cold political exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw that the master was not in a good mood, so he went to practice the shooting - his training progress was advanced again. Anyway, the bow has been destroyed in the battle, why not take this opportunity to start slowly touching the bow? As Sir Bill said before, the bow and arrow is the ability to use a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still using Leah’s longbow, and he’s excited for a while. "A real elf longbow! I wanted to touch it long ago." Siegel said so. The bow is made of walnut wood with a white silver wire on the surface, and the bowstring is made of animal bones, bamboo pulp and horns. It was very light to get it, but it was very hard to pull it up. Siegel had seen the master of Lia pulling the bow, and the movement was light and accurate. He never thought that this longbow was so difficult to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is not enough strength, how can the arrow shot out might have power?" Leah did not look at Siegel when explaining the problem, afraid that he would find it. The smile in my own eyes. All the weapons of the elves are only suitable for the elves. This is not only the cooperation of weapons and martial arts, but also the matching of blood. When people of other races use elf weapons, they will find it difficult to control, very awkward, and unable to exert the full strength of these weapons. Few people know about this. Some of the elf weapons that have been circulated outside are indeed from the hands of the elves. In fact, most of them are only "elf-style" weapons. After being transformed and weakened, they are completely inferior to the elves' exclusive weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t worry, I will show you the right longbow in the town ahead." The Lia elf said: "Or if there is a suitable material, I can also make one for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Lia, are you still a bowsmith?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. In addition, I will sing poems, sing, and train new recruits." The elf boarded his face, as if Sir Bill had returned: "Continue to do your training, don't worry. There is still a lot of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time never ends, but time will pass quickly. On this evening, the sky was covered by dark clouds, and there was a heavy rain coming down. But they missed the opportunity to find a hotel to rest, there are no villages in both directions before and after the road, only a small dwarf post is not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had to drive in the carriage to try their luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchtower is not high, only about 8 meters, but it is divided into three layers. If humans and elves go in, they can only bend down and it is very difficult to act. But this height does not affect the dwarf. The sentry tower does not have a general door. It can only go through the underground corridor to the inside of the tower through a downward facing door in the side yard. Of course, another way is to climb up from the outer wall of the tower, and then enter from the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel approaches the car, he can see the yellow light inside through the lookout hole of the sentry. The wind outside the tower has already brought the coolness before the rain, so Siegel feels that the bonfire will be warm and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a thunderous roar was uploaded from the tower, and Siegel saw a strong shadow climbed to the wall and shouted: "Stop! Don't come close! Explain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf got up from the carriage and said after the ceremony: "We are passing travelers, the original intention is to go to Mora After that, the storm is approaching, we are looking for a place where we can stay overnight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
