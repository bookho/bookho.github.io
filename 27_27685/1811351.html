Even if the hand touches it, it will be true. . Siegel tried all kinds of methods, and even began to excavate with the invincible gold cross, still can only see the endless mountain rock, can not find the entrance of the secret passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Lord of the Rings told him clearly that the passage was behind the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of using rules is not that simple. If ordinary means can be solved, what do the gods do?" Chanem sneered a few times, pointing The mountain wall said: "There is no use of the rules, the result is that the difference is different. Even if you use the meteor to explode the entire valley, you can't find it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to continue watching the fun here?" Siegel gave him a white glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to teach you how to use the power of rules. Maybe you have some sense when using legendary spells, but it is impossible to achieve my immediate demonstration. The level." Chanem put his fingers and said: "Look at the eyes of your mortal. In this respect, any saint is enough to be your teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unspeakable process. Just as a legendary spell can't be recorded with a scroll, the process of applying rules is hard to implement. Siegel looked at the common sense that he had established and was subverted, and the relationship between matter, energy and space was re-established. He couldn't explain the whole process he saw, but he was sure that everything was true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rules are the embodiment of order, but the world is more than just order. If you can know what is orderly chaos, what is called chaotic order, then you can Initially understand how the power of applying the rules is going on.” Chanem’s process of opening and closing the cave was demonstrated several times, and it was clear to Siegel. "You don't need to understand what I am doing. Your goal is not the secret rule of the murder god. What I need you to do is to believe the facts at hand and understand that everything is possible. If you can't even believe it, How can you understand, understand and master the power of the rules?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said that he understood what he meant. Human cognition always goes from phenomenon to essence, then from essence to phenomenon. Keep moving forward. He used to think that water is water and fire is fire. Later I learned that these are just the manifestations of the power of water and fire. After he used fireball, he tried to use the power of water to cast this magic, which formed an explosive puck. So he gradually understood that different elements actually have similar ways of using them in spells. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, through the resistance of the plasma of the syllabus, he found that the four elements can be interoperable and transformed, and ultimately he also studied between the elements The transformation relationship becomes a ** division. Ice and fire, gas and earth have never been contradictory. But this is still not the end of his cognitive world. Soon after. He constructs an elemental aggregate, allowing the four elements to be organically combined while maintaining their respective characteristics, creating a dynamic balance and even generating some intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the elements? Siegel saw that Chanem used the rules of the rules, and he had a new understanding: the elements do not exist. It is just a kind of idea, a concept that people understand the world, understand the world and transform the world. Looking at the world from the four elements, and looking at the world from good and evil, positive and negative energy, will get different methodologies, but these methods will only affect everyone's perspective. Will not affect the nature of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you stick to the use of elements to explain everything, then Siegel can never understand the power of the rules of operation. He can only touch the legendary spell seed at most, which is only a small part of the concept of world rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You believe in God, do not believe in God, will not affect whether God exists. As an individual, the power of faith that you radiate is too small to be ignored. But for the world level, these tiny individuals can form a general trend for the vision of the gods.” Chanem said: “Your mages like to use magic arrays, for you power exists in the lines. Straight lines, curves Round, rectangular, all of this. For me, the world is countless, some areas are denser. Some places are sparse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel suddenly realized, "All things are three, so you can't use both states and states to understand, but there should be a state, that is, there may be more and possibly less understanding. Not all The results are all deterministic, and the uncertain result is also a result. Does this mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of applying rules is to shake the world, to stimulate the smallest probability, and to use microscopic uncertainty to influence the macroscopic determination - if the scientific theory of the goblin needs to be explained. But for Siegel, he has a better way: the seeds of legendary spells are the best tools, and each seed represents a certain concept. If you want to do physical manipulation directly like Chanem, you need a lot of practice from Siegel, but using the legendary spell seed can be a shortcut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He learned something new, touched a new world, and wanted to give it a try. It was very itchy. However, he saw that Chanem was around, watching him with a pair of deep eyes, and he resisted his impulse. He deliberately made a mistake a few times, then asked in an incomprehensible tone: "Why tell me this, Chanem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am behind You are worthy of you. If you don’t have a skill, you can’t stand the power of the fire.” Chanem said: “On the other hand, if you find the power of magic and prophecy, you must have enough skills to conquer it. I can tear off the part that belongs to the power of prophecy. You can't just go unprepared, it just kills. After you die, I can't enjoy the power of prophecy, and the magic god will affect me. A plan to capture the power of the murder god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to be a magical god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Everything will die, only death is eternal." Chanem said: "You think that magic can solve everything. I think death is the end of everything including magic. You think I am losing, I think you are stupid, just angle The difference is so there is no need to have any disputes on this matter. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Segal nodded, be agreed with Chaney Farm explanations on the surface. However, he did not dare to take it lightly, and still took most of his energy to prevent this sacred murderer. As he raised his hand to open the passage door, when he led the way, when he led Siegel to the room where the fire was stored, Siegel did not dare to relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a cold, humid underground cave, only half a person high, Siegel and Chanem have to bend over and march forward. The sacred fire of the sacred god is placed on the skull of a dragon. The complex runes constitute something similar to the gods, protecting the fire from outside interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Shenhuo, there are three forked flames. The more the forks, the stronger the flame, the spirit of the spirit can have nineteen forks, and The ancient god of death had twenty forks." Then Chanem pointed to something like the words that flashed at the bottom of the flame. "That is the priesthood, a rune that can only be said to be unspeakable. The sorcerer's race god, with the ultimate goal of the proliferation of clay monsters, one of the most boring, useless power."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you still use it to make a clay monster warrior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is to get rid of and consume its power. "Chaney snorted and pinched his fist: "As a force, there is no difference in the fire, but there is a conflict in the priesthood. A murder-based god has more priesthood to ensure the continuity of the race, not only does not strengthen my strength," It also made me weak. The only way is to burn as soon as possible and let the glue blame a lot of death. I spent a lot of effort to make the dwarf the culprit to kill the clay monster. Fortunately, I finally separated this fire. And it didn't affect the essence of my saint's body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you let me use this sacred fire - and don't say if I will use it - don't it? Will you give me the sacred sacred duty?" Siegel shook his head: "Kill me too." I want to become the soft look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That won't happen." Chanem said: "First, the number of clay monsters has been Very few, it is good to be able to support a flame fork, so even if you consume one or two forks, it will not cause the turmoil of the priesthood. It will definitely be there, and will not pounce on you like a ghost. Second, I will not waste my fire on you. After the prophecy of the fire, the glue here is my supply, the important material I used to fight for the murder of God. You want to take Go, think beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shrugged his shoulders. "It doesn't hurt to ask more. What do we do next?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Showing magic to position is your master's skill, and your positioning spells have exceeded the general level, I have nothing to guide. Magic and prophecy gods will be their own God's fire is hidden, no one can find it, but you may find it. Now, ? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp to give you the purest Shenhuo isolated to this as a clue, it is not it can greatly improve your accuracy "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
