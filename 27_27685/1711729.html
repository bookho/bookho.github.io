			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill looked at the accountant and seemed to be holding back his anger. He said slowly: "How much do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! 200 gold coins! I can give you and your entourage 200 gold coins!" Tightly packed the bag, shouted: "Send these soils to the hub, and only half of the journey is left, don't quit halfway!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I despise your broken Money!” Sir Bill slammed the accountant and explained to everyone else: “This is not the soil used for fertilizer, but the ore soil. The master craftsman can extract the most from this soil. Sturdy metal - fine gold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you tell them what is the use of this? This is soil for them." The accountant struggled from the ground Get up and wipe the blood from the corners of your mouth. "Black, yellow, red mud is no different, just one sack after another, you can make money, just that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let him Nonsense. Siegel, give me optimism about him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the squid stepped up and pulled out the long whip at the waist and pulled it out hard. The whip fell heavily in the air and slammed into the mud next to the accounting buttocks. The muddy water splashed, and the hard whip shot a small pit on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't let me practice using the whip with your mouth." Siegel threatened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." The jazz was hard to praise, and then turned around and said to everyone: "The fine gold is extremely rare and the value is very high. It only takes a few grams. Gold can strengthen a dagger, and such a dagger will be cut into iron. You are transporting a batch of valuable goods, but it is not a simple soil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well...what can you know?" A driver took the wound that was bandaged on his head and braved the courage to stand up and said: "We can only transport these things, and we will starve if we don't do work. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill’s chest was undulating, he clenched his fists and closed his eyes in pain. What these people are saying is, what can you do if you know it? Even if you know that these fine gold fields are the wealth that the pen king has, they can only be transported when it is mud, and there is no craft to refine it. At the same time, whether it is a powerful dwarf clan or a mysterious elf kingdom, whether it is a mage in a tower or a pastor in a church, they have many means to find such cherished minerals and collect them to make powerful magic items. Even if it is a kind-hearted person, it will only be bought at a low price, and it will not be grabbed. It is nothing more than that - but there are too few such situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes robbers and those who are strong, even small troubles are not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiger-Bill slowly released his hand and forced himself to calm down. He went to the accountant and stared at his eyes. Under his temptation, McCarter tried to remove his sight several times, but he turned back with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz pinched the chin of the accountant and directly raised him from the ground: "I won’t want your reward, but I have to divide the money. Give every driver, live now, give it to my family, die. Your master wants to use the blind eye? Want to save money? But want to impose risk on these innocent drivers, think too beautiful! I Will follow the promise and help him to send the goods, but then I will find him to calculate the account!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accountant spit his tongue, nodded hard, he I am afraid that I will be pinched like a bug. The jazz let him go. Although the accountant is the employer of this caravan, there are people with the main things on top of him, and maybe the lord is involved. The jazz is self-respecting and will only go to the troubles of those "families". There is no need to continue to toss this little piece. Accounting McKate quickly took out the gold coins from his close pocket and gave it to the living driver. At this time, the drivers were thankful and happy to hide the gold coins in a place that they thought was safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accountant smiled and cautiously asked Sir Bill: "Adult, can we set off?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The promise is commitment, the journey will continue, and the caravans consisting of two carriages will once again follow the winding road. After two days of trekking, they crossed the vast jungle and entered a vast hill. There are no thick, low and twisted ghost trees here, but some tall and tall giant trees. The roads have become flat and clear, and they no longer step on the soil with the leaves, but the green grass with a fresh fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is going to eat at the end, and he still has work to do. After checking the condition of each driver's wound, he was sent to fill all the water bladders. McCarter wanted to reach out and help, and Siegel handed him three big skins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your help." Siegel said with a smile, sending an accountant to pick up the water, so that you can listen less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cool stream washed away the tiredness of the body, and the squid skillfully used the "fishing net" to catch a few big fish, and at night there was time to add a meal. They applauded loudly. Only the jazz frowned, always looking southwest. Behind the hilly tall woods, not far from the endless stream of ghosts and swamps. There is a clear boundary between it and this golden jungle, and it is as distinct as two worlds. But the jazz knows that this line can be crossed by simply stepping over, and the threat is so close to tranquility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue forward, the temperature gradually rises, and a sullen air always shrouds the caravan. This is the ghost fog swamp that rejects the heat that the sun gives to the earth, and discards it, so the swamp is much hotter and hotter than other places. Fortunately, everyone has enough water and the scorpion is full, so you can stick to it here. They crossed several low hills again, and at this moment, a strange roar rang from the ghost fog swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz horse climbed to the heights and tried to look inside the swamp. After the strange roar, a few horns rang. The horn does not have a solemn and honest feeling, but with a dying feeling of dying. The jazz came back riding and shouted: "Run! Be fast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is nervous, driving on the bus and getting on the road. The accountant took the initiative to throw the saplings on a car to the ground, reducing the total load. Then he arranged for two drivers to drive in each car. He only needed to keep the fine soil. Siegel asked what the danger was, but the Jazz did not tell him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If they are caught up, they can't escape, you and I can only fight." The jazz asked: "Are you afraid of death? Little scorpion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Afraid!" Siegel nodded. "But always have to fight before he dies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good scorpion, you will be a knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the hot sun disappeared, the mist shrouded, wet and cold. It is also not sure that the mist is wet, or it is sweating intensely. Everyone's hair is attached to the forehead. The intermittent horn sounded always behind him, and he followed the caravan with perseverance. Seeger looked behind him. He felt the fog twisting and twisting. It seemed that a monster had climbed out of the fog. A strong uneasiness rises from the bottom of my heart. He involuntarily reaches out and touches the machete, letting the skin feel the coldness of the metal, and slowly calms down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t stop for a moment, running from noon to the evening. The scorpion is almost overwhelmed, and they can barely take a step. It seems that they will soon fall from the mouth. There is no one in the caravan, and everyone knows that this may be the most dangerous moment. The seriously injured driver took out the gold coins from his account and gave it to a friend who knew him. McKate sighed and untied his backpack, leaving nothing on his body, ready to run in the lightest position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't talk!" The jazz whispered: "I heard hooves in front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp They suddenly stopped, no more unlucky than this. At this time the shadows of the night have been shrouded, and the tall trees on both sides seem to have changed in the darkness - they are like a pointed finger, bent from the center to the center, pressed over, the leaves cover the sky, If you are in a cage, hold this poor caravan tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hooves are getting closer, more and more, and gradually clearer. It is not a horse that is on its own, but a team. At this time, the moonlight sprinkled from the tip of the trees, the stars in the sky seemed to suddenly shine, and the cool night wind drove the cold and cold air. Under this halo, the fog quickly dissipated, and the trees on both sides returned to a vivid, straight posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn behind it fled quickly, mixed with anger, remorse and helpless sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of knights came from the front of the team, then slowly slowed down, moonlight and starlight shined on their shoulders. They all rode silver-white horses with pale green soft armor. The long hair and pointed ears of silk appear from the eagle's first helmet, and the bright and sharp eyes are like the stars. This is a team of elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
