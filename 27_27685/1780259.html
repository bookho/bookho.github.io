The Elves of the Elves walked and gave them two Explain: "The reincarnation is given by the god of natural priesthood, and I can only be a half-baked solution. But I can tell you with certainty that the reincarnation has been successful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The three of them came all the way to the deepest part of the Druid jungle, without encountering any obstacles. The Elf Saint allows all the elves to avoid this place, so that they can talk to each other alone. He took the whole scene with Siegel and Lia and talked about the attack of the black man. A lot of things are restored by the surviving elves, and some are inferred from the traces left on the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremonial table of the reincarnation remains as it is, but the blood is stained. Leah cried in the place where his father died, and Siegel looked at it quietly, and fell into a long silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet's soul is separated from her blood and then begins to reshape the body. But the mad believers of the murderous gods interfere with the process. They carry the murder Force is the opposite of the power of life, so there is no new body at the time. She is not dead, but there is no body, what do you think will happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Is it in the body that has no soul?” Siegel immediately thought: “Where are the elves? Will she control other people like the ghosts of the prisoner?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I discovered the action of the murderous god, I began to come. Those mad believers felt threatened and quickly evacuated. After that, all the elves I checked, no outside soul In this forest, only the spirits of the elves are floating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the most likely result is that Janet has been attached to a black man." Geer squeezed his fist and knocked on his forehead. "This can be difficult, where are they going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." said the Elf Saint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could you not know, you are the elf god, the race god, the most powerful kind of god in the world!" Siegel shouted. "You know for sure, but I need to pay for it to say, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Saint shook his head. In the face of Siegel's shouting, his face is still calm. "It is true that as a race god, I am the most powerful part, but it does not mean that I am omnipotent. The function of the murderer includes a part of the conspiracy. So he can manage to hide the lurking. And believe this time, He understands how much he can do in the mortal world, and will not lead to the coming of saints like me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mortal mess is also our own Going to clean?” Siegel sighed “God provokes trouble, mortals suffer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, huh, indeed.” The Elves are not angry at all. Instead, I laughed happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at his expression and couldn’t be happy at all. There is no information on the saints in the books of the Masters Federation. There are not many good words in them. The saint is the image of the gods condensing with a part of their power to come to the mortal to convey information. Since one of the functions of divine power is to create the realm of the kingdom of God, it can distort reality, so in order to obtain the real situation, the saints are not condensed in the process of being manufactured, but other aspects are still very powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the spirit of the elves, the body spans multiple fields, and has high attainments in martial arts, magic, magic, art, and so on. His saints also have similar characteristics. The creation of such saints is also very laborious for the gods. Ordinary gods often use dreams or decrees to communicate with the mortal world. Only those more powerful gods will condense the saints. Since even the saints have been sent down, plus the power of the elves, what else can stop him in the mortal world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the more important question is - Siegel thought - what did he come to find himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been confused for a long time." Siegel said: "Is not all God really will not respond to my prayers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we just disdain you." The Elf Saint answered with a face. He looked at Siegel's constantly twitching eyes and suddenly laughed, but he still didn't answer Siegel's question: "Don't care, make fun of you. We ignore you, don't you live well?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage's tone? When you negotiate with outsiders, it's such a tone and expression. It's really boring." The elf saint shrugged his shoulders and sighed: "The first thing, the truce. The war will increase the murder god." The power, especially the wonderful ambushes, raids and battlefield assassinations - the fair match between human knights is not here. But in the end can't be played any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I also have this intention. But I can't represent all the people who fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Heim is so horizontal from east to west, south Humans have ceased, and they will not threaten the Elven Forest unless they form a purely flying army. Deepwater City is self-sufficient, and those businessmen only know how to make money and have no ability to expand. As for the Jackdaw tribe, you can persuade them, isn't it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I do these things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, you are the most appropriate Mediator. Second, because I will help you find clues. In this matter, you Less than a better partner "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Siegel thought for a moment, then nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second thing, I want to take two people away from you." The Elf Saint said: "You have saved two people, and your brain is stupid. Silly, nothing can be remembered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel touched his chin, indulged for a while, then asked: "You want them to do two What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I want the hub, the two people are the keys.” The Elf saint said without hesitation: “The Statt family smashed and hurt me. The elves have been around for a long time, and they should be punished. I will use those two to control the hub and gradually incorporate them into the Elven Forest. As for the human beings living there, they will continue to travel to Heim’s collars. Anyway, you have enough land to house them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want two humans," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Is there a human race god coming out to discuss this with me? No one knows if human beings have racial gods, you are really poor. Guy.” The Elf Saint said: “Their two brains are broken, except that the material you use as an experimental spell is useless. Only I can cure them, but I will also have some other in it. Things, let them become admirers of the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel seems to see the two poor people who only know how to obey the orders, they drool Ask for food and avoid the expression on your face when you shine. When in the city of Miele, the two of them were placed in the cell, because even the best room was like jail for them, and the jailer was responsible for the care in the real prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their minds are like the Elves of the Elves, and the damage is beyond the scope of Siegel’s ability, and the basic repair is hopeless. He can only add a lot of common sense knowledge to their minds, such as dressing, going to the toilet and making beds. Can I be responsible for both of them? Siegel thought and thought, still difficult to make a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Saint took a snap and attracted the attention of the Master, and then said: "In exchange, I will take the Tower of the Tower of the Fort and all of the Masters' Unions. The members handed it over to you and changed them. But you don't want to play the Knox Commonwealth idea, I will destroy that thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third thing is the most important thing." The Elves of the Elves are hard to become serious: "Find the organization of the murder gods in the mortal world and destroy them." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means dealing with a group of assassins, killers, and unscrupulous poisoners. I usually see that these people are too late to avoid, and now they have to take the initiative to provoke. Although this is the most difficult task, Siegel actually did not hesitate to agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how can you talk to the gods without bargaining? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the lord of Heim, and if Janet is not there, I will maintain the operation of the entire territory." Siegel spread his hand, right The Elves of the Elves said, "I am so devoid of my skills, can I wholeheartedly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your energy lens spell has changed a lot, one of which is "Transfer Volume" Book, right? One of my elf believers mentioned this when praying. It seems that he also wants the book very much.” The fingers of the Elf Saint are constantly lit on the hilt and measured for a while. "It's better to do this. I will help you build a transmission array so that you can come back to Heim at any time and pass it back accurately. How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
