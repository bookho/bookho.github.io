Siegel is on alert While asking aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not very important, the important thing is that you can't go inside the Rainbow Light Wall." The halfling shook his head and said: "The things inside are not mortal. But, from what way do you know this place, or you just have to come here because of this, you should now look back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I be saved? You, let me know, "Siegel said so, but he was ready to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very grateful to you for helping me out of trouble, but you can't go." The halfling was short, standing between Siegel and the barrier gap, hands The fist is held high and the voice is louder than the height. "You can't go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak a little truth! Just now I can ignore your call for help, do your own thing first, let you stay in the body heap. Slowly decaying, but I didn't do that!” Siegel slammed his feet and the ground shook under the heavy blow of earth elements. The halfling shook and looked at him with a shocked look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not good at fighting, but I can bring the power of life. The magic is always exhausted, but the earth is endless." The halfling crouched down, The soft, fat short fingers are inserted into the soil, and immediately the grass begins to germinate, constantly pulling up the body and dancing in the air. He created a green dividing line in front of Siegel, and the grass was like a lined-up soldier, looking at the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Siegel already knows the identity of this saint. His power and the earth are closely related, not the level that can be achieved with simple soil control. And in his power, it also includes the vitality and strong defensive power, which is surely the Holy One of the Mother Earth. The saint who has never seen the mother of the earth is actually a halfling! Take this form, is it because halflings prefer to plant and maintain animals and plants? It seems that he is like a cute and innocent child, it is difficult to go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no festival between you and me. I saved you from the mortal crisis. In many cultures, your life belongs to me." I have to serve me. And you are blocking me now. Do you want me to throw you back into the bones?" Siegel frowned, the power of the second element was behind his back, black The flames turned into tentacles and the air continued to distort under high heat. The earth began to dry up. "I think that I have done good deeds, but I am only causing trouble for myself. Is your saint who is the mother of the earth punishing the good deeds that save lives? Is this not contrary to your essence?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halfling frowned, and there was a moment of hesitation. But soon it changed back to a strong expression. "Good deeds always have good news, but it does not mean that you can do whatever you want! I said that you can't pass here, then you can't pass, this is the order of Mother Earth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Even if the saint in the heyday is not invincible, although the mother of the earth is strong, she is not a god of battle." Siegel said, while condensing the power of lightning on the dust of the stars. "Look, this is a golden lightning, which contains the rules of understanding. When the ground is against lightning, it can only be passively beaten. There is no counterattack. Even if you can continue to regenerate, your power is in the bones. I have already consumed a lot, so I will definitely beat you and even erase your body. But I will give you one last chance: let go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The halfling looked at the golden electric light sword and the black flame tentacles. The light of the two colors shone on his face, leaving a faint expression. The vibration from the ground can be completely suppressed, but there is no good way for lightning and flame, only with his own body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general elemental power certainly does not hurt the Holy One, but what is the power that Siegel dared to use at this time? After encountering the sacred sinner Chanem. Siegel knows that his enemy will be at this level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy One has divine power but no godhead, which means that common spells can also hurt them. If it is a true god, only some of the legendary spells that call the power of rules can affect them. Fortunately, the true God is generally in his own God. Very few came out, most of them sent saints to walk in the mortal world. Siegel only needs to push the power of the elements up to form an effect close to the power of legendary spells, which is enough for the saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halfling stood in front of Siegel, his left hand stretched forward, and immediately a piece of grass climbed up. Touch his palm. Then the grass gleamed and turned into a staff, and was lifted by the halfling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the light curtain in front of him and analyzed the composition of his abilities at this time. He tried to strike with lightning and flames, and although he couldn't cross the barrier, he could tear off some of the energy from above. In other words, the level of power used by the Mother of the Earth is close to that of Siegel, not the power of the rules of pure power, but only the level of legendary spells. Siegel uses the current means to form a consumption situation with the saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he doesn't have that much patience. Since this saint does not know how to be good, then you don't have to be polite with him. Siegel nodded, only to see a flash across the corner of his eye, and the half-human head was blown into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the sound of the electromagnetic gun was slowly coming. Because of the attack, the invisible state of the star is lifted, and she is hovering in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The real authenticity of the game, the star cable." Siegel used her mind to connect with her, and did not praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Master, I have been practicing!" Xingsuo passed the giggle from the soul connection, it seems that the mood is very good. Not bad. However, she still had doubts, so she asked: "Master, why should you rescue him? You didn't expect him to block your possibility?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I thought of it," Siegel said. "The only thing here is the guardian, so I know there is such a possibility. The one I rescued must be the strongest of all, and the Holy One is the most likely. But when I can save him, To do it, that's not my style. Even if he is as rigid as he is now, and he doesn't know how to adapt, he is going to get in the way. Is it necessary for me to change his original intention? I will save him, but I will teach him some lessons." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-length man who was smashed by the fine gold electromagnetic bomb was planted on the ground and convulsed. He has been guarding Siegel's magic, but did not expect such a fierce physical attack. He had no time to respond and his head was blown up. The brain is scattered along with the debris of the gods. But under the protection of the rules of divine power, he is still slowly reborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a lot of power loss, the speed of resurrection has become so slow." Siegel walked over, using a small bottle with a lot of "God Blood "The fragments." These things are very helpful for studying the power of the gods, and maybe you can find the secret of the rules of divine power. Siegel's cloning can also try to use this as an experimental material. He intuitively found something amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotten watermelon head trembles and wants to stand up, Siegel pointed at it, and the star cable opened another shot. "Just like this, as long as he wants to reorganize, he will make up a shot. The Holy One can only exist in the form of entity, so you must have a complete image before doing anything, so you keep playing, what is he? Can't do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, God needs a face to work?" Xingsuo's words made Siegel laugh. Then she asked strangely: "Master, you can't just throw him directly back into the heap. Why bother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Throwing him back is It’s very troublesome, but he’s just an idiot who blocks the road. What kind of hate is it with me? What do I think of the sin? I found that the way the saints behave is similar to the magic image. It’s all the way the gods set the rules and they can only follow the path. They don’t have Soul, just 傀儡."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the main man, I am jealous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Not exactly." Siegel never deceives the stars, and some things are better to say: "While you are the core of artificial soul, but as complex as the natural fire, I can't directly Give you a real soul - that is what the gods can do - I can only build a platform for you to accommodate the soul. I teach. You learn, then you have to learn and think by yourself, just like you are learning Like magic. If you continue, you will have a real soul. I look forward to seeing it. One day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo replied with a firm tone: "Well! I must work hard!" Then I fired another shot and knocked the halfling back to the ground again. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought for a moment, left a space bag on the ground, and said: "Anyway, you are idle here, nothing to do, install some of the Holy Spirit Debris. Arrange in the order of the number of times you are smashed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no problem!" Stars cast two electromagnetic killer spiders. Specifically responsible for this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the halfling who tried to stand up again and then was beaten again and again, Siegel had sympathy, but he would not stop. The use of a sneak attack on the saints to break up his body does not mean that this type of attack will last forever. Was the dwarf saint not blocked even the goblin nuclear bomb? Although it is a trick of borrowing rules, once the saints are serious, there may be any means. Siegel can naturally see the move, but he comes with a task, this task does not accompany the saints to practice the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
