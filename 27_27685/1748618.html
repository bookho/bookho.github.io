			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out the long sword, and the cold touch of the star dust made him feel at ease. He stabbed the bodies on the ground with a long sword and determined that they would not get up. Then cast spells and let them float in the air to check for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of safety, he decided not to touch the body with his hands. Siegel had demonstrated his ability to manipulate multiple spells with the idea of ​​manipulating Faranes, and this skill became more and more handy as his spell power increased. The mage's robe in the body contains a lot of sundries, such as wands, spell kits, and all the light things. These are not the goals of Siegel. He is looking for the work plan of the dead wizards and all the intelligence information related to the Red Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can find nothing in these three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage continues to look at this room, why do they have to choose to die here? The blood on the ground is completely concentrated under the chair. There is no blood mark in other places besides flowing down the terrain. Obviously, they have been sitting in chairs until they die. However, Siegel did not find any traces of restraint here. The gate was also open and no guards were found. There must be something in this room to attract them, preferring to eat hungry, laughing and not wanting to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel followed the gaze of the body and could only see a bare wall, only a fireplace was installed on the wall. A glimpse of Siegel, from the outside of the magic tower, the whole building is completely integrated, and there is no chimney at all. Why is there a fireplace inside the house? Segal crouched down and used the dust of the stars to move the dregs in the fireplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely not firewood here, Siegel looked carefully, the gray after burning wood is not like this! He found a piece of hard gray-black debris in the slag, only about the size of the tip. Siegel picked it up with a spell and took it to his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shard of the soul of the soul!" Siegel finally recognized such a thing. He knelt down and looked more carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other debris is still unrecognizable, but he found some fragments of flaming in the corner of the fireplace. Siegel collected them, including a part of the "ash," all in the space bag. Maybe go back to the magic lab. With the alchemy tools, you can know what this kind of thing is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid being discovered by later people, the bodies of the three dead mage were put back into the chair by Siegel, and everything on them was intact. Siegel believes that there will be a map of the magical array and the magic tower outside, and at least there should be something like a log. So he continues to search upwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stairs have been extended all the way through the many rooms - there is a simple lounge, a warehouse ready to hold things, an ellipse with an enchanted workbench Shaped room. These rooms are empty and will not be filled until they are finished. Siegel walked and the stairs ended in front of a pair of huge bronze doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opens automatically as he approaches. Siegel felt that there was no danger around him, and he probed his head and looked inside. Inside is a wide brass palace, larger than the magic tower itself, and it must have been a space spell. On the walls of Huang Cancan, there are many heads of dead creatures, each of which belongs to a powerful population. Siegel saw a large number of dragons, saw the magic ball with eyes full, saw the devil of the first sharp corner, and even the silver-white demon head. They lowered their heads, looked down coldly, and focused their attention on the bronze gate. And the center of the palace. There is a lead-gray metal chair covered with thorns and barbs. I don't know anyone can sit on this chair? The back of the chair is studded with red gems. The largest and the most round jewel is set on the claw rest on the top of the chair. Next to it is written in the dragon language: "The flesh and blood will eventually die, but the thought is eternal."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with this sentence itself, but it’s a strange thing to write in such a strong head specimen, it seems to be showing off, or Coercion. Siegel looked at the head inside, and many of them could not recognize it. He can only guess the weird, distorted but deterrent heads, perhaps from other worlds. It is a museum here, and it is a carefully selected specimen that can be displayed. Siegel looked at it a few times and finally found the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no head of any undead creature inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not to mention the inferior souls. For example, cockroaches or zombies, these are certainly not enough to hang on the wall. There are also powerful blood races, death knights, night shadows (this body can't be hanged), dragon lichs, and half-god lichs at the top of all undead monsters, which are not reflected on this wall. Combined with the words on the chair, Siegel probably understood why the door would automatically open for him, and he did not feel any danger in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage keeps his body deformed. Step forward and kneel in this hall. He noticed that as he walked, the head on the wall would also divert his attention and kept paying attention to the Siegel. This kind of taste is not good, there is always a feeling like a mans on the back. Fortunately, he is now in a state of paralysis, and his heart is like water, which has strong resistance to this situation. After paying tribute to the entire brass hall, he was convinced that there were no other portals here, and the magic tower ended here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the file and information he is looking for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel turned his eyes to the chair in the middle of the room, and slowly walked over. The base of the chair and the floor are completely cast together, strong and inseparable. When you are close, you will find that the metal surface is not flat and there are many sharp protrusions on the surface of the chair. In the gap between the protrusion and the gemstone, there are many thin lines that do not cross each other. Siegel had seen this style of thin lines, on the golden warrior who was wiped out by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what these runes are for, but remember to study them slowly. Siegel took out the pen and paper and used the magic of the extension to record the surface structure and magic lines of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knox Association is associated with undead creatures, and this is basically confirmed by Siegel. Originally, he wondered why he would specialize in thinking and controlling spells. After all, the shortcomings of this spell are very obvious, especially when faced with the magic, elements and undead. But if they were originally connected to the undead and had such a strong ally, then they would make up for this deficiency and concentrate on controlling the living things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sentence on the chair: "The flesh and blood will eventually die, but the mind is eternal."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no place to hide things near the chair. After thinking about it for a while, Siegel restrained his curiosity and cautiously gave up and tried it. When he approached the gate, he touched a certain organ and opened the bronze door. Who knows what will trigger when sitting in a chair? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he suddenly clap his hands, the hard bones hit and screamed. This magic tower does not see the figure of the common sorcerer, only three former wizards of the federation. They can't always look at this bronze palace all day long. So Siegel withdrew from the palace and returned to the stairs. The bronze gate automatically closed behind him, quietly at the end of the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a deep breath and changed back to human form. He kept his eyes on the bronze door, reminding him not to look at the "happy portrait" on the stairs. He reached out and pushed the door open again. Sure enough, the room I saw this time was not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a library, warm and comfortable. On the wall on one side, the five-storey shelf is full of books, and the thick and thin backs are marked with silver dragon words. There are no candlesticks or fireplaces here, only the safe, immortal flames provide light. The soft white light illuminates the large table, filled with drawings and materials. Next to the ink bottle, the writing quill pens are stacked in the box, and if they are used, they are discarded in the paper basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clock is placed next to the table and has been stopped due to unattended care. Next to it is a couch with a backrest, a thick cushion and a grey rabbit fur blanket with an open book on it. On the coffee table next to the sofa is a tray. There are still drinks in the golden cup. Siegel looked at the past and looked at it, it was a copy of the broken black tea and "Silver Flame - Legendary Technology." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is also available in Heim's collection, and it is the original version, so there is no need to waste time reading the transcript. He only focused on the drawings he had not seen, especially the magic towers and magic arrays. The scrolls on the table clearly show the main points of the magical array outside the red tower, as well as a brief panorama. Siegel found blank large paper from the bookshelf, and the spells copied important information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of casting materials used in "transcription", all of which are used by Siegel. As he transcribes and studies the role of the statute, he finally understands the use of those mad laughs. The entire magic tower is a spell amp that enhances the strength and range of spells. This "joy tower" can create pleasure and happiness. In a wide range, everyone's emotions become uncontrollable joy. Except for the prepared caster, most ordinary people will be infected by this emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is used on the battlefield, let the two sides of the battle put down their weapons, this is indeed a good spell. But if you use the spell to the extreme. Or what happens if I get out of control? Infinite happiness can make people lose their fighting spirit and even lose the power to survive and fight. They will find a comfortable place, immersed in this feeling, and will not move until they smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
