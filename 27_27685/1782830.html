			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are new and old, the name of the old continent is only after the emergence of the "New World". Previously it was simply called the "world", or the image was called the Lei Wall continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The never-ending storm wall and endless lightning surround the entire continent, erecting an insurmountable obstacle on the sea. Magic here can't be used because of the disorder of the elements. The power of God will be weakened in front of the wall of the storm. With the power of *, it is impossible to resist the might of nature. Many people came to the wall of the storm, curious about the scenery behind, but there was no safe way to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters of the Masters Association can use the spells to travel to other worlds, but they will also return to the wall of the storm. Even after seeing many strange and eccentric worlds, the Wall of Storm is still rare and unique. The Masters believe that this involves major secrets of the world, and the pastors believe that it is a barrier separating mortals and gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, one day, everyone thought that the wall of the storm that had never changed was suddenly retreating, revealing a new continent. It was at that time that there was a fleet on the edge of the storm wall, and they were the first witnesses to witness this spectacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esloren is the owner of this fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the younger brother of the Star King at the time, a royal "freak" who loved to explore and challenge himself. One day he felt that he should go to the wall of the storm and set off with the fleet. He has no magic, swordsmanship, and belief in the gods but has not become the potential of the pastor. He just has an adventure that is not lonely. When he came to the wall of the storm and watched the surging sea waves connect to the zenith, the thunderclouds of the end of the world continued to drop lightning, and the banging bang became the only voice in the world. Even so, he did not have the cowardice, but the wall of the storm as the biggest challenge of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forced his boat to move forward. Drive to the end of the world. The crew naturally refused to die, immediately transformed and began to snatch control of the vessel. at this time. The wall of the storm receded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hahaha! I am coming, I see, I conquer!" Eslolen yelled and screamed, driving a boat. With the deeply shocked crew all the way to the west, before everyone else, even before the attention of some gods, set foot on the coast of the New World. Because the voyage exceeded the plan, the supply was in short supply, and all two ships immediately returned, ready to bring more materials and equipment and personnel back to the New World. This is the last time they saw Eslolon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened on the New World has never been known, and the rest of the ships have not been found. A few years later. When Eslolon was holding a piece of wood and drifting back to the wall of the mine wall, it caused a huge sensation, but at this time he had become unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missing Prince was found and immediately returned to the Stars Royal Family. His body was already paralyzed, and even with the best care, he had not spent a few months and eventually died in the hospital bed. The Stars Royal Family and the Masters Association recorded his mad words at the time. Siegel also saw the outline from the collection of the Masters Federation, but there was no mention of strange words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Prince is taken care of by the royal family. We have been together for a long time. We have obtained much more information than the Masters Association." Avon said: "There is a section." When he was slightly awake, he also made some written marks, but it was not a language at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you remember?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan shook his head: "Where is it possible. If the sword is almost the same. I have always wanted to take risks, and the situation of Prince Esloren is similar to me. But he is the younger brother of the king. He has his own surname since he was a child, not an illegitimate child. So I envy him, so I went to read his book. I remembered some symbols, related to numbers, and wrote it for you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any clue is useful, let alone a number? Evan looked at the scrolls. While writing in memory, he finally gave more than forty words to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the quill aside. "I can only remember so much. If you want to see it, you have to go to the King's Library. It can be far away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These numbers and some The verb should help.” Siegel licks his forehead and drinks a cup of condensed tea: “Let me try again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find numbers, find duplicate combinations Find those words that appear more frequently, and then start cracking based on the symbols you already have. If the numbers are growing regularly, it may be a certain age; the most common logical concept in words is "affirmation and negation"; the words used to frame the sentence structure will be repeated regularly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the field of spells, the world of analytical spells and linguistic spells. Siegel continued to use these two spells and began to analyze the text after the flip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The New World has been around for so many years, and this text is reappearing for the first time." Siegel said to Evan: "The Mage Federation, the dwarf for many years I have been collecting rare things all the time, but I have never found any words in the New World. Do you know what the discovery means?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only know this and Eslolon’s discovery was probably related to the fact that he was crazy.” Evan replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and stared at Evan: "Since the storm wall has receded, dragons, dwarves, elves, humans, orcs, goblins There are many races coming to this continent, where life has flourished. Everyone has found all kinds of beasts, monsters, undead, elements and some strange things, but only one has never appeared: civilization "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master pointed to the scroll in front of him and said to Evan: "This thing can prove that before we arrived, there was civilization on the New World, they left The text."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did they go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is! "Siegel knocked on the table and made a loud noise, like the same thunder: "I have a guess now, those grievances may be the residents of the original New World. But after thinking about it, the language used by the grievances and Like us, Nexus collects grievances in different worlds, making sacred soul crystals, showing that grievances are not special. So it seems that I can't explain the uniqueness of the language in front of me. I don't quite dare to be sure of my own inference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, be a mage So much? I am going to get confused.” Evan shook his head. “You think about it here, I am going to see Moore. As for the competition, you don’t have to worry. I will make sure he wins.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will tell you when there is news." Siegel continued his work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still tribes coming and going, but the number is significantly less. There are still ten days in the autumn month from the autumn. The contest finally started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is full of people, fighting, but this has nothing to do with Siegel. He was in a camp sheltered by thick layers of cursing fog. Deriving strange texts alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the research progressed, his eyes became deeper and the spirit did not weaken at all. He walked around the scrolls on the ground, always thinking of words, countless words growing out of illusory wings, and swirling around Siegel. Sometimes, his ideas will be interrupted, and some novel ideas will pop up. Like a spark from a furnace. He hurriedly wrote down, fearing that it would soon lose its luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he has more than ten words in his hand, but the speed of cracking has begun to decline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel, who was immersed in the research, had not finished the makeup for many days, and the beard on his mouth was so fast that he had half a finger. He was carefully opening a glass bottle, using a quill to gently rub the purple powder inside, and then quickly screwed the cap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time you use an analytical spell, you will consume a quill, as well as precious purple gemstone powder. But Siegel thinks that all this is worthwhile. There is a strong hunch in his heart, and the secret of the New World is in front of his own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea comes from both reason and intuition, and it lingers in his mind every day. Siegel feels that this state is a bit like a process in which a devout person becomes a pastor without training: the gods teach in their thoughts, dreams, and subconsciousness. Show me slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will continue to form a combination of flying words in front of them, even randomly selecting and disrupting the order, in order to inspire their own inspiration. But the door to wisdom seems to have no idea to open. All secrets are still hidden behind the endless runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dropped the reel and took the defensive staff out of the barracks. With the help of magic, he was like a gust of wind, and did not alarm the guards, and quietly went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a conference across the lake, and the top ten is about to be decided. With strong magical armor and magical weapons of varying abilities, Moore is like a moving fortress in front of the enemy. He can ignore most of the swords and focus on his own attacks. His victory is quick and direct, but it always leads to a buzz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
