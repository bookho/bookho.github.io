			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Islois represents the new hope, the earliest settlement of the elves on the New World. They brought the first French-style trees from the Old World, transplanted here, and then multiplied. After countless immigrants across the sea, the size of the Elven Forest has grown larger and eventually formed what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early morning Elf Forest is the most beautiful moment, the light of the East is sprinkled on the trees and the sea, forming the wonders of the golden waves. The blue sky washes the tired hearts of the people with swaying branches through the swaying branches. The meandering stream is not far from the road, with the sound of birds and leaves, playing the most natural music. Siegel looked around and saw white water from the shaded shrubs. This is a river that never freezes, only spring, summer and autumn, so it will always be full of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel first saw such a harmonious natural landscape, which is different from the vastness of the sea, but it can give people the best feeling. They walked on the forest road, accompanied by beautiful scenery and refreshing atmosphere, and even the footsteps became lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lumir is walking around Siegel and is very interested in this young human wizard. The proportion of wizards in the Elf is much higher than in other races, but few young elves become qualified mages. They are not as urgent as human beings, madly pursuing power with limited life. In youth, elegant music, moving poetry and beautiful love are the main components of their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the youngest human mage to come to the Elf Forest." Lumir said: "You shouldn’t study in the Master Tower like you, why? Running around?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the Elf Forest is facing a huge threat," Siegel replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the opening remark of all mage standards?" The elf snorted: "The end of the world seems to happen every day, always by all kinds of The Master found out. I remember that before the Battle of the Great River, the Master of a Federation brought a huge threat message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because this is the truth," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf waved his hand and said to Siegel: "The Battle of the River is only a battle of ten months, only in the life of our elves. In a short moment. You are a mage, naturally understand this calculation: a big river battle is equivalent to your human life for a few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Less than a week. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The longevity of the news you brought this time? Time will wipe out everything." The elf is very calm and seems to be worried about the outside. Threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned and replied: "Although your life is long. You can witness the sacred sea and feel that you have enough time to use it. But your death and other There is no difference in race, it only needs a moment of relaxation to complete." The Master also said in a calm tone: "I don't know how long this moment can be smoothed by a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf’s footsteps paused, but then resumed a calm and calm posture. Although he masked it very well. But Siegel, who also mastered the pace of the elves, was still able to detect it. He continued: "If it is not really dangerous, why should the Master come to the Elven Forest and make a bad crow? Why don't we want to live like a fairy, live quietly and peacefully, and use limited time to study the true meaning of life? Maybe you don't care about the one or two years of war. But we don't have that long life, so we become a race that cherishes more time. Because of this, we will worry about other people, even if many things are not in their view. Serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel finally said: "Caring for others is kind, so there will be messengers that bring bad news."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lumir nodded: "Young mage, your words are sincere and reflect the wisdom of mankind, but this does not mean that I will believe you, maybe the Moon Temple will have its own judgment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not easy to change the attitude of the elf side patrol captain. I think it would be a hundred times more difficult for the Moon Temple to value itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides a short conversation. The two will no longer have to pay more. Behind the caravan slowed everyone's progress, so when the sun passed over the head and began to sink slightly, they arrived at Isloris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People from the South can only move forward here, and all commodity transactions must be completed here. Others who want to go deeper into the Elven Kingdom, or who want to travel north through the forest, need to apply to the side patrol team. Then the pastor of the Moon Temple will decide whether or not to pass the application. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has expressed his wishes. Whether it is the Moon Temple or the Elf "Art Institute" - equivalent to the Masters Association, he has applied. "I came to warn the elf friends and have detailed instructions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also knows that the elf's reaction speed will not be as fast as humans, and maybe It will take a few days to get a response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these few days, Siegel waited. Nothing can be done, he simply began to appreciate the beauty around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He set foot on the hills where the green grass is everywhere, and then lay down and let this piece of eternal stagnation in the spring surround him. Passing through the outer Elf Forest, it is like a tunnel through time, from the beginning of the winter to the transformation of the season, to this spring-filled world. Even the sun in the sky seems to be re-filled with power, and the warm light shines on Siegel's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel feels that his breath is stronger and stronger, and it seems that the air around him is enough to provide all the vitality he needs to survive. This is an area full of dreamlike vitality and an eternal commemoration of the world's creation. The elf was born at that moment, and witnessed the beginning of everything with the dragon. So they use countless hours and efforts to reproduce the glory of that moment, and the Elven Forest is their hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel quietly looked at the surrounding scenery, listening to the sound of the wind walking through the trees. Although everything around it is endlessly beautiful, all the colors in the line of sight are fuller and more vivid than the outside world, but there is always a strange feeling in Siegel. He listened carefully and observed carefully. There are hidden mottled shadows in the golden leaves. Even in a place full of vitality, there is still a kind of affairs with the eternal existence of life in this land where there is no darkness, change and evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh and blood will have a death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Siegel seems to have heard the distant sigh in the woods, the sigh from all the beginnings, for the decline after the glory or for the right The fear of eternal silence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall of the storm recedes, revealing that the New World is like a new life, so here can make the elf reproduce the glory of the moment of creation - even if it is only a poor imitation Also enough for Siegel to marvel. But as time goes by, even Islos will be smoothed out, just like everything else. The golden leaves will eventually fall, and one day in the winter will come. Even if it will arrive after the millennium, it will not escape time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Siegel got up and he only felt uncomfortable. Is it that all efforts are only for the sake of turning into dust, and that only the unconscious elements in the world can last forever? He no longer went to see this beautiful but ultimately false scenery, and turned his attention to the caravans that were busy at the foot of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty around them makes them feel happy, but what makes them laugh is that their efforts are rewarded. They unscrew the spices from the open sea, the finely woven satin and the fine porcelain; then the aromatic elves are placed in transparent glass bottles, carefully stacked in straw-covered boxes; the harp made by the elf craftsman can Play the most beautiful music, and the tea picked in the Elven Forest is born with the power to nourish life. Merchants smiled, this is a good business, which allows them to earn a very high price difference. Although pursuing money is a human vice in the eyes of the elves, this money can enable the merchant's family to live a better life and gain a sense of security and happiness. For races that have only a few decades of life, safety and happiness are their most important needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth and demise of the world is a grand and distant issue, and the boundary between life and death is not what Siegel can now span. Even if people with rich knowledge and strong mana, such as the bachelor Faranes, is it difficult to solve this proposition? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked down the hills of the eternal spring and came to the crowd of joy and joy. Here, the elves talk with humans and appreciate the beauty of life from all angles. Many things are not as easy to price as spices and satin. For example, a pair of elves stood in front of a painting from the starry kingdom. They used their aesthetic eyes to appreciate human art and draw inspiration from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arts are only exchanged, there is no sale, so the traders who bring oil paintings are not in a hurry, and will not bargain like other vendors. The elf who likes this painting will naturally exchange it with another piece of art. He only needs to thank and accept it, and then safely bring it back to the starry kingdom. The nobility there has been vying for the elf art of the New World, and an auction that coincides with the opportunity will make the merchants rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
