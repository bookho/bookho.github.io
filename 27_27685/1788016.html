Big mouth swallowing ale. He took a sigh of relief, like a person who was about to drowning back to the surface of the water, regaining freedom and security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is Solidarity? A religious group?" asked Arnold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s a neighborhood mutual aid agency." Jagger’s mouth smashed, and a helpless smile came out: “People who attend the Solidarity must follow order, Help each other. Advanced and driven forward, everyone must work in unison for a new life. For the alien enemies, everyone must resist together, just as the deer encounter predators will be together, the antlers are all facing the outside."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it sounds very reasonable." Avon said: "This is not everyone helping each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought it was like this at first, but somehow, the solidarity will become strange. It may be after some slogans, uniforms, and constant learning. The first people who joined the Solidarity became Strong and unobtrusive, so more and more people join, even the lords of Kebu Town are enthusiastically involved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Later everyone Began to become crazy. In order to highlight the contribution and value of everyone, everyone uses the title to call each other The lord baron became the duke, because he has the leadership to lead the people and set an exemplary responsibility and obligation for the people in the territory. The best shovel is an earl, the marquis of the horse and the visor of the radish, even I have the count The title can continue to operate in Nanhai. Damn, here is Nanhaiwang, not the guardian castle of the South China Sea!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand." Evan scratched his head: "Jie, do you know why this happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and said that he was not clear. There are no large-scale magical fluctuations around the town of Kaibu, and there is no trace of the spirit-controlled spells of Knox. Can someone achieve this goal with only language and some code of conduct? There is something strange about Kaibu Town here, and he has an ominous premonition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jag, do you know a place called Shaq Manor?" Siegel suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome trembled and looked up: "Yes, I know. It is the headquarters of the Solidarity, just ten miles south of the town. One is near the sea. On the cliff." His eyes swept over the six people in front of him, and then said: "Oh, I understand, you took a certain task. Come here to investigate the Solidarity. Listen to me, let me go, the Solidarity is now It’s the town of Keb, you are not his opponent at all. And no one here will help you, from the time you enter the town. There are many eyes staring.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Would you like to ventilate?" Yao En asked: "Are we safe at you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You rest assured that old friends, about your truth I don’t know anything about it.” Jagger said: “But as soon as you act, you are likely to be exposed and lose your life. Listening to me, it’s the only wise choice to go.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's tell us about this Shaq Manor. Siegel sat in front of Jagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome stood up fiercely and shouted: "Which of the things I said you can't understand? Go away, leave here! Fools!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s palms are lit with light, and the spells flow like music. The excited dwarf eyes were attracted by the light, and the rapid breathing began to calm down. He swallowed and sat down again. The eyes are softened and the eyelids are somewhat dangling. In the end, he nodded and said, "I am willing to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shaq Manor has a history of more than 100 years, is the home of the three generations of former lord's wife Manor, she was the daughter of a wealthy merchant at the time, and the manor was her dowry. The dock and warehouse were originally built in the manor, but the landslide caused by an earthquake turned the original port into a rocky coast full of big stones. Only the small port in the east can be used, and the manor is just a beautiful house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Later, the manor changed hands and became ten years ago. The current owner, a wealthy businessman named Dorn Scott. His wife is a native. Later he was sick at the seaside, so he bought it. He heard that his wife died, and then Dorn Few appearances, except for his former friends who came in and out. The manor has always attracted the attention of many people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your advice, and tell us something about the manor environment." Siegel swayed the glowing palms in front of the gnomes, and Jagger looked straight and said everything without reservation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel listened carefully, not letting go of any details. The letter of the Elf Saint is unknown. Even the Solidarity has nothing to mention. It can only rely on the intelligence obtained from the gnome to plan the next step. The spell he casts can guarantee that the gnomes will not tell lies. However, this spell made the gnome very tired. He only insisted on sleeping on the table for more than 20 minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your spell?" Naria asked, "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am Jie, the adventurer who comes here to complete the mission. If you doubt me, then apart from the answers you have made in your mind, what I say is really irrelevant." Siegel wants to lead the topic. So he said: "When Jag wakes up, he won't remember what happened, so don't tell him about Shaq Manor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The spells you cast when you are fighting a vampire are strong, but I thought it was a special ability for you. But the spells that you have just exerted affecting the mind are more complicated, and only the specially trained wizard can do it." "Naria looks very nervous, and the fingers holding the powder of the casting material keep shaking. "If you put the spells on us just now, can we resist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to Arnold's hope, all three of you will Being controlled by the spell, and forgetting the spell being cast afterwards - but I won't do that." Siegel said: "As I first told you, this task only requires your professional skills. And with honest and trustworthy professional ethics, other things have nothing to do with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yao En grabbed Naria’s hand and shook her head: "No It is necessary to be so nervous. Otherwise, the task has not started yet. We will first concentrate on dealing with Shaq Manor.” He looked at Siegel and asked: “Jie, Shaq Manor is the destination, right?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. Investigate the murderous stronghold of Shaq Manor." Siegel said: "Maybe the Solidarity is a subordinate organization controlled by the Temple of the God of Murder. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also have this kind of thinking. So Who according to the original plan of action. "Nalia dwarf let go of the hand, female mage heaved a sigh of relief, temporarily no longer tangled Siegel's identity, but many more vigilant eyes of Italy. "Anomen you must be careful, the priest of the murder god is likely to regard you as a threat. The Solidarity may find ways to stop your missionary action, it is not strange to use all means."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Holy Light of the Mother Earth will protect me, and of course the sword of Sol." Anomen did not seem worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I and Jay went to scout the Shak Manor, and I love you and Naria temporarily stay in the hotel, don't go anywhere." Yao En said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why!" Ai Meng smacked her cheeks and said, "Isn't that we are responsible for buying things?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation has changed. For your safety, it is better to take a day off. And you are not doing nothing. In addition to setting up Jagger, you should take care of the horse and let them be at any time. Being able to get on the road. Maybe we won't be here for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood up and patted the shoulders of the gnome. Go out without saying a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meng used his elbow to smash Evan: "What happened to your friend? He was very anxious all the way, and now he is getting impatient. "It's very uncomfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is always calm, serious when he is like a mountain. But he is very stressed, I can feel it. So, he said that he is not as good as me in this respect. You see me, the pressure will not affect my good mood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Called no heart and no lungs." Ai Meng sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the gnome Yao En pushed the door out, Siegel was taking out the pipe from the space bag. He hasn't smoked for a long time, and now he needs this thing to calm his emotions. Six points of tobacco, three cents of Ningshen, a spice, you can already smell a strong aroma only at the fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
