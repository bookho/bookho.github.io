			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: The chapter number in the previous chapter is wrong, it should be 278. This chapter is 279, continue to the back row, ah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day when Siegel returned to Heim’s collar, Elijah Liya took a 30-guard and four war-old trees at dawn. Time came outside the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They raised a green banner with olive lines on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly report to the lord, the elf wants to see him." The knight who had participated in the aristocratic battle recognized this mark: when there is a need for dialogue between the army generals, The olive flower branch will be used. If the other party agrees to the dialogue, the same banner is used, and then the two sides, in the witness of the god of war, vow to guarantee each other's safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the elves began to attack the three towers of Deepwater, Ximu and Hubburg, they will definitely come to Siegel, which is in Siegel. Expected. For a long time, in order to avoid revealing the secrets of making ancient war trees, Elven Masters have severely cut off contacts with the Human Masters Association and its branches. The elves never go to the federation, nor do they recruit non-elf mage apprentices. There are few wizards who want to communicate with the Elven Forest, and they are always under strict isolation and surveillance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the elves are not clear about the progress of the Mage Federation in recent years, let alone the new crimson minaret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel once provided them with a sketch that roughly depicts the magical array of the outer red tower of the hub. In the temptation with Hubburg, the Crimson Minaret used only conventional defenses and did not open the magical array on the periphery, which made the elves worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They thought of Siegel again. Since the city of Mirius is still surrounded by the layers of the elf army - the thoughts and facts of the elf high level do not match, but Leah does not want to clarify - so why not negotiate with him, let Siegel more reveal some secrets? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Lia accepted this order and took the team outside the wall in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim does not have the same banner, but Siegel solved the problem with illusion. The Elf Master saw the image of the olive leaf banner in the stillness, silently stopped counting, and then said to Leah: "General, it took four minutes to share."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What is the speed of this reaction among humans?" Lia asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's already very fast." An elf warrior keeps his eyes open and observes the movements on the wall. He said: "According to the map. This wall is the farthest from the castle of Mire City. It takes two minutes to ride the horse. It can be done so quickly, indicating that Mire City has a good junior officer and the information transmission is very fast. Seeing the guards at the head of the city. The half-orcs and human soldiers are not confused at all, and the cooperation is also very tacit. Even if we use the banner of peace, they are ready to ignite the rocket's brazier, open the anti-arrow shield, and will vote The spear and the rolling stone were transported to the city. I also heard the sound of the winch. There should be a trebuchet behind the wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the lord here, Siegel He was able to reach the city wall so quickly to deal with the unexpected situation. It seems that he is very alert." The elf warrior said to Leah: "Although he is a mage, he can use the spell to transmit to all corners of the territory at any time. But his weakness is that there is only one person. So if you want to attack, it is best to invest in more than four directions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea Shake Shaking his head and talking to the elves around you "There is more than a Serge in the city of Mire. There is a laboratory here, and there are at least four mages in there to handle daily affairs. Although adding these masters will not interfere with our final Victory, but it will definitely increase the loss. Continue to take the arrangement of monitoring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People including Druid, Luna priest and Master agree . After all, now that the elf has the hard bone of the Masters Union, there is no need to trouble yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lia also received an order to transfer the elf wizards from all over the place to Ximu Town, ready to concentrate on destroying a Master Tower. The wizard wizard she brought this time will soon leave, and it is even less likely to launch an attack before the wizard returns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very gratifying for Heim’s ability to respond so quickly as a master. The battlefield organization is a course she taught to Siegel, which is undoubtedly excellent from the current performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking to a bird made the soldiers very uncomfortable, but this allowed Siegel to know what happened on the front line for the first time. Compared with riding a horse, this speed of communication is "as fast as flying." After he heard about it, he sorted out his clothes. Convenient to use the transfer to the outside of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Lia saw him from afar and he dismounted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Lia, is there anything?" Siegel said to the elf with a smile. Fortunately, he had long expected that he would not stay in the hub, otherwise he would definitely be stuffed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know the Alliance's attack on the elves?" Lia asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, I haven't contacted the federation for a long time." Siegel shrugged his shoulders. Smiled: "There was information from the beginning. The federation asked all the official mages to go to the Sanfeng Pagoda and defend the federation. But I am still a lord, I can't live without it, so I didn't go."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I last met, you said something about the Knox Association, their drawings of the Red Magic Tower. Do you have more detailed information here?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned and made a thoughtful expression. The elf's reaction was in his expectation, but he must not make a preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't provide the wizard with drawings of the magic tower. I don't know the manufacture of the magic tower at all, or I will give myself one." Geer smiled and said to the elf: "The Masters Association promotes the exchange of knowledge and the exchange of equivalence. Under this premise, I can talk to the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea Also laughed, it seems that his apprentice is mature. Human learning ability and growth rate far exceeds the elves, and Siegel is one of the best. Lia has seen the speed of his study of elf martial arts, and he is even more astounding in terms of magic. It is only two years now that he has become a lord, and he has been able to handle war and diplomatic affairs skillfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very pleased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, I believe what you said before, Knox is a very dangerous enemy. The elves have at least not destroyed the world or sacrificed souls. The idea. I think you should understand more than I do, otherwise... otherwise you will not go out of town to negotiate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, too No longer bend around, said directly to Leah: "In fact, I have no other requirements, just want my people not to starve. The elves are so besieged, our food is always exhausted. Yes, the elves have not killed Can our people, too, not let us starve to death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't always let our elves provide food?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head. "The stupid request, I will only be laughed at by you." He scratched his head and said to the elf: "This is good, you draw a region. Come, let my farmers go farming in the spring. My idea is to be on the coast of the Shield River. It is also convenient, not far from the city. Or it is the part of the original ghost fog swamp, which is also very suitable for planting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can be discussed, but mainly depends What kind of information can you provide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a spell of Knox Master, the spell inside should inspire your mage." Siegel Say: "This book was obtained a long time ago. It is not the same as the Knox spell book collected by the Mage Federation. It is an uncut version."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You can get the cultivated land along the shield river," Lia said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knox Association’s grievances are hard to deal with, even groups of dragons will be defeated, so your war ancient trees are also Not safe. Do you think of a solution now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't tell you this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, don't say it. I used to study how to prevent the grievances with the dwarf clerk, but I did some dispelling runes with good results. The door of Mora closed the door, I may be the only one in the New World." The person who made the dwarf runes. Either I continue to study with your elf's caster, or do I sell you some runes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
