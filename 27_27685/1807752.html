			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single can only observe them, learn them, imitate them, and find out how to not touch the alarm. Method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after waiting for hours, there was no movement in the forest. The cat-like earth elements are still spinning around, constantly digging the mud under the leaves and looking for good clods. It is reasonable to say that the energy outbreak of soil elements of such a scale should be able to alert the caretaker. Is there no one here to care? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe the caretaker’s mobility is worse than imagined? Siegel continued to wait patiently, never closing his eyes in the dark. The quietness of the woodland and his more anxious mood formed a strong contrast. Maybe the previous plan was problematic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the dawn of the next day, no one cares about what happened here. Siegel came out of the hidden place and found elements that had been dug in the woods to cultivate a pit. It was very comfortable, taking the moist soil as a quilt and watching Siegel motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You little thing, it seems that they can't attract their interest!" Siegel smiled and looked at him, then took it out of the space bag. A khaki jewel. "I don't know if your luck is good, can you really own this gem and become its master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a earthen stone, which contains The very essence of the earth's elemental power, formed deep in the ground, is very precious to the people on the surface. It is a favorite food of a series of underground creatures such as Sol Stone and Wood Tribe, just like the attraction of dessert to children. However, the earthen stone is not moving after it is formed. They have the ability to move in the rock formation, just like a small fish moving along the ocean current. Sometimes, where the earth element is concentrated, it is possible to find the earth stone, which is another way to find such minerals besides excavation. However, sometimes the outbreak of earth elements may be caused by earthen stones, and the two are difficult to distinguish between each other. It is with this characteristic that it is not entirely impossible to have earthen stones in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth stone is often used to strengthen the magical effects related to earth elements, and to make magic wands such as fossils for mud or stone skin. Earth elemental creatures are very sensitive to it. Because earth elements can use this stone to strengthen their core, which can absorb and condense more elemental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, it is getting bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Siegel took out the stone, the earth element cat jumped from the pit he dug. Raise your hand and throw a few mud pills to the face of the ** division. At the same time, it lowered its body, compressed itself like a spring, and then leaped violently, rushing to the hand holding the earth stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple attack will naturally have no effect. Those mud pills only need to be sideways to avoid, and the earth elements that jump into the air are also caught by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't struggle, it's not to harm you." Siegel stuffed the earth stone into the arms of the earth, and then gently recited the spell. If you let the soil elements absorb slowly, I am afraid that they will not grow up in a few months. However, Siegel mimics the process of super-large soil element fusion, which can greatly speed up its growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth element is stiff and motionless. But when the mage puts it on the ground, it continually twitches like an electric shock. The concentration and distribution of the elements began to change, triggering the out-of-phase of the flying sand. Siegel immediately retreated and was far away. And carry out his secret observation again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small, medium and large, only used for an hour, the original small earth element is already close to three meters high, the energy that can be grown still does not stop . The place where it was originally, the earth element has been absorbed almost, and it can't be replenished at a time, so the elemental creatures rushed toward the depths of the forest immediately, and he felt that more elemental power was in that direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees that block the road are directly knocked open by it, even if the big tree that the three people hold together does not look much stronger than the seedlings. The animals that inhabit the forests fled in the middle of the fright, and the screams of the ones accompanied by the collapse of the trees. Spreading far away in the forest. This time it is impossible to find the threat. If a violent earth element settles down, it will seriously affect the elemental structure of the surrounding magic array. It won't take long for the earth element to find the flaws of the magic array. Then, like the otter sucking blood, all the elements of the flowing inside are sucked out. So the magicians are temporarily summoning elemental creatures, not directly like Siegel. No one can afford the assimilation and destruction of the element itself, unless it is a near-infinite source of energy, such as the Mirin nuclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even without internal organs and related feelings, the earth element understands what is called hunger. In addition to absorbing the strength of the elements from the earth through the feet, it keeps grabbing the soil with your hands and slamming it into your mouth. Inadvertently it found a dwarf runestone and discovered the power of the above essence through contact. These old stones, which have been left after six or seven hundred years of experience, are not a low-grade meal for earth elements. Then the dwarf's rune stone was pulled out one by one, and the bite was crushed and swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the runes are hidden under the tree. After this rule was discovered by the earth elements, the trees along the way were all smashed. It is difficult to excavate the vegetation of the elves with manpower, but the exercise of the earth elements is the power of the earth. The roots of the trees are not very useful at this time. In order to find the runestone, the earth elements all smashed all the trees encountered, and the whole forest was in ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alarms of the elves and dwarves are touched, and the threats are getting worse. Siegel became more and more careful, far following, and did not dare to expose his place. But after waiting for a long time, no one has stopped it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too unreasonable! Siegel looked at the earth-going giant who was rumbling and had a weird idea in his heart: Is there no guard at all here? He stopped and thought about this possibility. Of course, you can follow the earth element and let it help you to open a path. But such unusual abnormalities have to expose themselves, and there is no way to remain secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it doesn’t make sense to continue. Making such a large earth element is already the limit of natural power. Siegel can't think of it more than this, and can find a "reasonable" explanation in the current environment. With his spell, of course, you can create a group of elemental creatures and even summon the undead army. However, such a move can no longer function as a temptation, and it is completely exposed to itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, now follow the earth element all the way forward. Or gamble that there is really no guard here, everything can be smooth; or it is here with The watchers confront each other to see who has more mana and harder fists?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so... Siegel looks at the land that has been completely overturned . Using a foot to sweep a part of the soil, I simply portrayed a subpoena. He contacted the magic spaceship star of the Star Fortress, awakened her from meditation, let her invisible and then came to the forest of Asia and Asia to provide support at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The plan can't keep up with the change. I didn't expect the sneak into a forcible breakthrough. I hope that the current situation can be maintained until the Yari Valley, although not afraid of them, but... Siegel thought about it and thought that he was too pursuing perfection, so he laughed at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which things can be planned in advance, and everything can evolve according to your own wishes. In many cases, there must be a planning mind and a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After thinking about this, he felt that his thoughts were suddenly clear and he was less depressed in his chest. Although I don't know why, but this is a good thing. He marched on the soft road that the earth element opened up. Stepping on the soil that has been sucked aside. The swelled earth elements and earthen stones have destroyed the balance here, so the winds rich in elements are produced in all directions and concentrated in this area for replenishment. This is still a normal natural phenomenon, but Siegel has enough control to use and transform these complementary elements to form his own spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these spells, he lightly pushes the nearby detection mists and delays the time they reconverge into the fog wall. At the same time, he still carefully observed the situation around him, so as not to miss the enemy under the hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not much different from what I did before, my mood is different. Siegel himself did not know. But the veterans who have been through the battlefield are actually very clear: what is really unbearable is not the moment of engagement, but before the war. The kind of waiting, jealousy, jealousy, and nervousness can eat a person alive. Siegel’s participation in too few adventures, his high savvy really made his strength increase rapidly in a short time. But the mood is not enough. Just as he was in the life of seafarers, he relied on experience and ability to avoid dangerous storms - he lacked the power to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s different now, this power has sprouted and will not disappear again. The sharp-edged sword will eventually leave the sheath to be lethal, and a powerful spell will have an effect when it is pronounced. Siegel now came to the sun from the shadows and left the hesitation of hesitation. Lightly loaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may have brought good luck, and no one has appeared along the way. This forest is full of magic enchantments and traps, but there are no patrols and counterattacks. Even if it is a long time, those druids have left, and should there be a few things like the Golem left? The ** division did not believe that the magic array here is completely a display, which is specially used to scare people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
