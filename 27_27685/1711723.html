			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, after eliminating the impact of beer on the body, Siegel spent a morning practicing the sword, reading the fun all afternoon and evening. Books. Such a quiet and good day is a rare enjoyment for him, just as pleasant as the downwind and fine weather in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the third day, the squid woke up early, every time he had enough to eat and drink, his head was very good and he could sleep a lot less. He heard the sound of chopping wood in the backyard and was trying to take this opportunity to exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, squid, you are getting up so early!" Timothy is holding his sleeves, revealing a strong arm, waving his big axe, slamming his head Open firewood. “Why didn’t you go to the port?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Going to the port to dry up? Is anything happening?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You haven't heard of it?" Timothy explained: "A very beautiful golden battleship is docked with a banner of a starry royal family hanging on it. I guess it is a prince outing, or at least a royal duke." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does the royal family do here? Are they not all docked in the deep water city in the north?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Who can know the thoughts of the lords?” The innkeeper shook his head. “The biggest fun of them is not to see a piece of land, go over, point to the ground, and then say 'this is mine', so everything inside is It’s his. If the land already has a master, it’s better. You can play one and fight for a few years – anyway, you are all poor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Do you mean that they are in the town of Ximu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, there is no master here, everyone is not The lord tax, stealing music for so long, should also be content. It is estimated that the prince or the duke feels that his treasury is not full enough, need more slamming voice, so he came by boat." Timothy forced the firewood to open, just like the pirate's head: "I can't do anything about it, I look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s very curious, he wants to see the big golden ship. After sailing for 16 years on the sea, he has seen all kinds of ships, humans, elves, orcs, even the dwarf wide-body ships have seen such strange ships - dwarves hate water, let alone sail - But he has never seen a golden battleship. He bid farewell to the innkeeper and go to the dock with his belongings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Battleship is a five-masted ship that occupies a row of berths in the harbour. The huge hull shows a non-offensive temperament. It uses the image of the starry angel's bow, the carved angel closes his eyes, and does not care about the creatures that crouch under her. The angels held their swords in both hands and pointed obliquely to the surface of the sea, which was exactly the collision angle of the battleship. Compared with it, other sea boats are like poor children, and they can only hide and play in the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battleship really hangs the banner of the royal family, and the big tree badge that hangs down the starlight will not admit it. Next to the royal flag, the angel flag of the morning church hangs, explaining the identity of the soldiers standing on the deck like a statue - the morning guardian knight. There are also many flags of the aristocrats hanging alongside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a flag that no one knows, the pattern is very simple: the red bottom is painted with a white double vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the towering portholes, the radiance of the sun shines over the harbour, paving a golden glow for this rare tranquility. The seafarers are all knowledgeable and well-known people. They wait for the golden battleship to make an action, and then dare to decide the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Prince Andrew, this is a chaotic, low-lying city that requires order and noble managers. But this manager will not be himself. A small town has at most one baron, and it is accompanied by a loyal tax officer. Mooring the boat here is enough to make the whole city tremble, no longer need the prince to personally press. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the town of Ximu? Are you sure you want this place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called by the prince For 'you', there are some people wearing robes. They held their staff and untied their hoods. Everyone didn't leave their hair, only the vortex marks on their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the robes came out, he was clearly the head of this group. The man walked to the prince in a respectful manner, bent down and bowed, kissed the prince's ring, and said: "His Royal Highness, Knox will be happy to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Knox Association has acted radically and has developed rapidly over the years and has gathered a large number of talents. The Dawn Church is also paying attention to the rise of this power and has sent many "Star Eyes" secret agents. From the feedback situation, there is no evidence that Knox will be doing evil, so the morning knight will not stop their contact with the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Andrew sits in a chair with a high backrest and looks at the very discerning mages who have been performing in front of him. It's hard to see their thoughts. The prince thought that these Knox people must have a purpose, otherwise they would not apply to build a mage tower in this harbor city. ‘Who can tell me the answer? When the prince missed the star-studded kingdom, the consultants who had the school city were always confused, and they could only rely on themselves in the New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you want to build a mage tower here? Although it is a seaport, it is convenient to transport, but the population is small and the order is chaotic. There will be a lot of energy involved here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Royal Highness, we will work hard to make you satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; 'This is not the answer I want to hear! Prince Andrew wanted to shout it out, but he knew that doing it would make him think he was ignorant and shallow. With a sincere smile on his face, Andrew said: "Ximu Town is currently under the custody of the Chamber of Commerce, and does not belong to the seal of any country. I will serve as a witness to negotiate the redemption between you, but will not favor any party. And if No one can talk about violence or other means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be your will, Prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew waved his hand and let the responders rush back. He took a glass of wine from the maid and then drank it. After that, he looked at his attendant officer, Earl Todd. This persevering warrior is already in his 60s. As a grandfather's knight, he joined the battle, and later assisted his father to rule the country. Now he is teaching himself. As long as he is around, all the courtiers and princes will understand who will be the king of the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Earl, the ship’s things have been processed, can you go ashore?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is one more thing, His Royal Highness, 'The letter'. Master Lear wants to open before boarding the ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no Wrong, the wise Master Lear said this. I remember to hand over the box with the letter, is it, Mr. Count?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Brought to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince took the box, the sealing wax on it was intact, and the dark lines were not destroyed, just as Master Lear handed it to him. The same time. Andrew let everyone leave, leaving only the prince, the count, and the morning guards in the cabin. In addition to Prince Andrew, the others automatically turned their backs into a circle, and placed their hands on the long sword on the waist, guarding them, not letting anyone close to the voyeur. After everyone stood still, the prince took a deep breath, crushed the sealing wax, opened the lock of the box with a ring, and took out the letters inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knox is a sword, use it carefully, make sure that only the enemy is injured; the morning church is a strong shield, patiently check to ensure that there is no crack. The shadows enter, the stars are not destroyed, and the king follows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading, the prince lit the letters with flint and burned it to ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I can finally go ashore. In addition to watching Knox's mage blow up an orc pirate ship, there is nothing fun. It is said that there is nothing fun. There are many rare customs in the New World. It is rare to come once and naturally take a good look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chamber of Commerce has been arranged, His Royal Highness. They are Waiting for you on the shore." The count answered, leading the way ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, the Knox Synagogues who left will gather in their cabins and form a circle of protection. Ordinary mages cast various protective spells to ensure that no one can peep into the situation in the room, and their leader, the Casper who has been responsible for dealing with the prince, is being protected in the middle of the circle. There is a basin of mercury in front of him, and the sleek and dexterous hands of the sergeant move on the mercury. The magical energy makes the mercury look perfect and displays the image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the image of the prince who opened the letter of Master Lear in another cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
