			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times, planning, vision, and predictions for the future are just illusions. Everything is just the illusion of walking in a strange street in the fog, a strange corner, An unidentified street sign can make everything change. Oh, this uncertainty makes people pray to God for guidance and help, but can God make the right choice? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think, Yao En?" Siegel sat in the position of Regis, and he was opposite the gnome who was thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are too many variables, no matter how you do it, you can't guarantee it." The gnome said: "I want to continue the original plan at this time." He exhaled a long breath and shouted: "Pan Lin! Don't hide, come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The little fat man rushed from behind the bar. "I didn't see anything, I didn't hear anything, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not. You know that there is a dispute outside, it will be innocent. The passengers scared away.” Yao En said: “The passengers didn’t even pay for your meal, you cursed them and watched them go in the direction of Kaibu Town.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Panlin nodded: "I understand, things are just like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan licked his hair and sighed and said: "That is, how can this rabbit soup not drink? Is it... unfortunately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, can feed the horse Already very Arnoldman said: "This battle is a warm-up, at least let us see your swordsmanship, and really said it is very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Evan heard this sentence, he became happy and left the rabbit soup thing behind his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the quirky six-person adventurer left, Pan Lin took his little friend and picked up the vampire behind the yard. Throw into the river and destroy the dead. The four servants died because they were pierced by the sword from the ear to destroy the brain. But there is not much blood left. It’s very convenient to pack, just throw it into the rushing river. As for the three hard big stones - seeing them under the armor, selling to the black market can make a lot of gold coins, Pan Lin and others have also spent some effort, all handled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, these people are really good at knowing if they can live from Kaibu Town." Pan Lin wiped his sweat from his forehead and licked himself. Round belly. To the side of the road: "Oli, do you have any hunch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a witch, Pan Lin, so don't ask me foreboding Things." Orly is thin and small, like a rabbit that is hungry for a winter, even the fur is dry. "I just think that the key to everything is on the priest of Mother Earth. With God's blessing, they can be spared, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe yours The hunch is not working this time." Pan Lin said with a smile: "The key is probably not the pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome Yao En has been to Kaibu Town, but that It was a thing more than twenty years ago. Far before the current team is formed. In his memory, this is a town that relies on sun-dried salt, salted fish and honey red wine. A place of peace and happiness in a southern territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I have to admit that the house here looks a lot like the past, but the name of the street is definitely not like this." The gnome stared at the street sign. The instructions of the Duke of Stodd Avenue slashed his head. "I can only walk slowly with the impression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's ask someone to ask." Evan jumped from the horse and grabbed a hug. Middle-aged man walking along the road with a jar. "Hey, do you know where the Nanhaiwang Hotel is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Nanhai Wang? I have already changed my name. Now it is called the South China Sea Castle, along the way. The Duke of Stodd boulevard heads west, then head south to the Marquise of March, smelling the smell of the sea breeze. The old gnome Jagger Carter has just become the Earl and won the name of the castle, you are going to congratulate him. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are going to eat something good, and now we are hungry." Evan let go of his hand: "The villagers who haven’t asked good intentions yet." What's your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I don't have any special skills, just a small digging knight." The man looked very embarrassed, holding the jar and retire It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whatever you are, you are not a knight or a jazz noble." Ai Meng grinned: "Let's go to the big castle first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people wanted to ride horses In the past, after all, it was just a small town next to the castle. It should not be walked into the castle. However, they soon found out that they could only dismount, because their posture on the horseback violated the rules - the rules between the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Viscount of Vale's Valles, why don't you be a civilian adventurer, don't leave the horse, or let the road go?" The old man said: "The Duke of the Duke is still waiting to eat my eggs, you will let it go! Don't delay the time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viscount of the chicken? Siegel thought that the "earth of the hole" was already outrageous - it used to be the baron of the mine - but he could still have the Earl's style when he put on formal clothes. The old man in front of him is sloppy and messy, and there are several large abscesses between his hair. It doesn't look like a viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just hesitated on horseback for a few seconds, and six people gathered around and stared at them with reprimanded eyes. Several guards with long squats turned their heads and cast their attention. Siegel and Yao En basically dismounted at the same time, and others continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are here for the first time, and forgive me for forgiveness," Yao said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should go to the castle to learn the rules and manners, which is good for your future development and growth." The Viscount of the chicken coop took a shot The horse, even left some chicken on it. His tone is very sincere, just like the elders are educating the younger generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have time to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd sees the scene in harmony and order Dispersed, six people were able to take the road. From entering the town to the guardian castle of the South China Sea, about two miles away, they learned to walk on the left side of the road. At the intersection, they should stop completely to confirm that no pedestrians will pass the horse. The horse must let the cart go first and push. The car must let the pedestrians go first. Everything must be rules and order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not allowed to dump garbage on the street. Even splashing water is not allowed. Even if it is sweet well water. Except for the absence of petals and incense, the entire city is as clean as a princess's boudoir - this is Evan's original words. To achieve this, the most common job in town is garbage cleaning and fecal collectors. The six-person line encountered three different groups of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The execution of the offender is being carried out while passing through the town square. Because they don't know what other weird rules are there, they just look at it from afar. The bulletin board next to the square reads the crime of death row: sympathize with the elf enemies and provide them with war preparations, including three-person marching dry food and two rain-proof canvases, with a penalty of five fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love Meng. You should be careful, it is best not to speak. Your elf accent is light, but it can still be distinguished." Yao En The partners waved their hands: "There are strange things everywhere, let's go to Jagger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The periphery of the town is better, the closer to the castle The more you can see the strange place. On the adobe façade of the house, on the fence that is close to the wood, you can see regular phrases everywhere, such as: unite to destroy the enemy of the Kabhu people - the elves; or labor brings freedom, prosperity and greatness And work together, help each other, eliminate all difficulties, create new situations, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan caught up with Arnold. Knocking on his shoulders, he lowered his voice and asked: "Besides the one that hits the elves. Others are pretty good. Which church is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am not sure." Arnold said: "I am a battlefield pastor. I don't have much research on this knowledge. Maybe you can ask Yao En."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome shook his head: "Don't ask me, I am also worried. Let's go to the South China Sea and say it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South China Sea Castle is a loft The two-storey wooden house has four chimneys, and there must be a very comfortable room. Most of the windows are not covered with canvas curtains. It seems that there are not many guests here, and the stables behind the yard confirm this. There is no other means of transportation other than a truck that is loading and unloading barrels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
