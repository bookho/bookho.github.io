			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of sound came from the beginning, but it was the weakest percussion, and then it became a harsh friction. It seemed that sharp objects were struggling on the glass. Yes, it may be steel, maybe stone. [[,,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel dangled his head and "woke up". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been two months since the fall of the Great Curse, and he has lived a life of self-exile. Although he still leads the city of Heim, his daily activities are just a small space in the underground library, about five meters square. This is a single room that creates a quiet and isolated work environment for the scribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it has become a "cage" for Siegel's "caught". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He exerts his magical knowledge and rune ability, and the walls are covered with dense magic lines to prevent his negative energy from leaking out. Although negative energy is a beneficial thing for the undead, it can greatly increase the strength and strength of the body, but it is a kind of destruction to the surrounding creatures and environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life and death cannot coexist, just as water and fire cannot be harmonious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, Siegel once put a pot of flowers, but it wilted in less than two hours. He also tested the viability of various organisms in this environment. No animal can persist for more than two hours. Even the Raven Baron, who is connected to his soul, mourns to hide away and sends a warning signal to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only with magic protection with defensive negative energy damage, others can get close to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally Siegel believed that this energy only affects living things, but did not expect it to affect the environment. In his long-lost place, the soil appeared grayish black. It becomes loose and cannot be cultivated; the water begins to become cloudy. It smells sour and smelly; the air is filled with odor. The flies fly and then die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel tries to consume the negative energy of condensation, the quickest way is to use the plasma energy to cast spells, and then supplement with negative energy. He used almost no consumption of spells, first built two magic items, and then began to strengthen the energy focus array. Such a move greatly enhanced the strength of his body, and the state of the plasma circuit seemed to be getting better and better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a stronger bone is a good thing, but the most proud thing he did was to learn a new spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is since he became the lord. The most time to calm down and learn magic. The advantage of becoming a dead soul is that you can sleeplessly, without feeling tired and hungry on your body, and you can make full use of it every minute. Losing the temptation to demand from **, Siegel found that he had more time every day and his thinking was clearer. He can always stay in the best condition, never waste a minute and a second, his spellcasting level is increasing rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he paid a price soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintaining the state of the undead for a long time is a damage to the soul, and the negative energy that hangs over him deepens the damage. He soon became immersed in the study of magic and could not extricate himself. Any interference would cause him to react violently. Other mage walked through the door, the light shattered by the negative energy of the flames, and even the sound of the pages of his own book would make him angry. He forgot humility, forgot to be gentle, and forgot the most important virtue as man: tolerance and understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until once he was angered by the spiritual link from the raven. Furious, and then felt its grievances and sadness from the magic pet. This wakes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dropped the spell book and found a mirror to examine himself carefully. The look of the cockroach is very horrible, and the green lines exude a faint glow, making the atmosphere even more horrible. From the mirror, he saw that the soul fire in his eyes had begun to fade, from the original bright red to the gray. According to the relevant records of the Masters Federation, after the caster is transformed into a lich, a similar process will be experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immersed in negative energy, it is a "comfortable" feeling for the undead, making the caster more and more like this state, which translates into Pure undead. The solution to this state is simple and it will return to humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it and changed back to the flesh and blood. He heard the sound of the heart beating in the chest, and he could breathe and feel the fullness of the air entering the lungs. He can see the color through his eyes, no longer the black and white world of the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he re-feeled the feelings shared by all the living: the fear of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mirror, he clearly saw the effect of the Great Curse on the living creatures: the skin became old, as if the decades had passed Wrinkles and markings climbed up together, and the black color of the hair faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then his body became weak, weak, sore. From the skin to the muscles, from the internal organs to the bones are all exhausted. The heartbeat began to become disordered, and the chest and back were clamped by huge rocks, and it hurts. The stomach and the stomach are mixed together, and I feel like vomiting. However, his throat was tightened, and only the blood from the lungs could emerge from his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly looked at the horror of being surrounded by negative energy, and the death knell of death echoed in his ear. Tears flowed from his eyes, along the wrinkles until the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to live, Siegel understands this strong feeling and vows not to forget. Being alive means going to experience, feeling the beauty around you with a limited time, and living a good day. The undead is constantly repeating each day, and loses fear in repetition, although it can still be active, but it is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear can save lives, and Siegel understands this in Wendy’s mind world. It is the fear of death that can understand the beauty of living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless curses that come with paralysis, deafness, nausea, stiffness, and then blindness. But Siegel can still see with his heart the way he slowly dies in the mirror. Despite the pain, he was grateful, because the experience between life and death is very valuable, he wants to understand a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that the death of the old captain was the reason for him to leave the ship, but in fact he had the idea of ​​going ashore before that. Although the sea is vast, the world is more extensive. Repeating the same day every day makes him bored. He wants to see different landscapes. He wants to move on to the end of the world. Even going to a more awkward alien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to live wonderfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he died and turned himself back into a state of paralysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse of the big curse can not help him, and then it seems to be a sigh, but can only continue to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockroaches in the mirror are no longer aging, and the green stripes of the whole body are bright and beautiful. All the painful feelings disappeared, and the surroundings were calm and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Siegel remembered the pain just now, and he will never forget it in his life. On this day, he rarely had a book. Instead, I looked at the mirror all day. He thought of a lot of past things, and those things that he thought he had forgoing regained his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered his excitement when he first eliminated the kobold and got gold coins. He remembered the grand banquet in Ximu Town, who took risks with his partners. The time of laughter together, the world without war. Then he thought of a lot of people, the kind old captain smiled and stood on the side of the ship, watching him swim in the sea, even the waves could not cover it. That happy laughter. He thought of the stern Sir Bill and ordered himself to continue to learn and exercise, but he would also care when he was injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last. He thought of Janet. There are not many time for the two to get together. There are always a variety of things that will pull Siegel away from her. They were once blocked by the walled mountains. Once blocked by the void, the Great Curse now separates the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; often not together, many times forget to miss, but when they are together, they feel that the days are average, there is nothing to commemorate. Only when I calm down now, I find the emotions contained in plainness. Siegel thought of and Janet, all the way through the hardships, and often spent the hardships and hardships as the whole of life. Kesig now understands that the tragedy of life does not lie in how much suffering has been suffered, but in what is missed, forgotten, and lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
