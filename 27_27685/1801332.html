When the spell effect that causes the plane to move is gone, the astral projection can still return to the body, and death is only a clear memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mobility is still a very dangerous situation, Siegel quickly responded, the power of the spell is still running in his body, the four veins of the arrow are coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my wildest guess, I felt that the person on the ship was you," the silver-white attacker said. He has an authentic star-studded accent, and his voice is full of unique charm-like magnetism, which will not be forgotten once he has heard it. The great prophet Lear said: "Now there is no need to fight, Siegel, let's say a few words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel would not listen to him, The four-pulse arrows are fired as usual. It is difficult to resist the four-pointed arrows with elemental spells, but it should not be so simple and so easy to smash Lear's body. Siegel narrowed his eyes and looked at it. He saw the silver thread on Lear's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was forced to return to the body, he immediately returned, intact, and looked at Siegel with his still calm eyes, the silver line on his head still shining . "Stop this meaningless move. Let's just waste each other's spells here, and we can't do anything. Why not talk like a calm and intelligent mage?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at him and looked at Lear’s fearless look. The current situation is not good for oneself. There is no support for the secret nuclear, and the surrounding environment is completely strange. Although the thick trees and the canopy of the sun are good cover, they can help to hide the figure while moving, but this is nothing for Lear, who is a big prophet. It is not helpful to change the current unfavorable situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lear Master said a bit better, as long as you can't destroy the silver line with certain means, then everything is nothing but work. Siegel doesn't need to be educated many times like a goblin to understand this truth, so he just puts the four-pulse arrow at his fingertips. Then I asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is this? What spell are you using for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lille’s face was smiling, he replied: “This is a rare forest on the planet, just in the mountains of the south where you expect to land. There are no mineral deposits, no people, so it’s very rare here. Save it. As for the spells you use, it's a legendary spell that I designed for you. You should be proud. Can you guess, what effect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know legendary spells," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, let’s talk honestly, because you know very well, you can’t lie to me, I can’t lie to you. Even if you get it through words in a short time. Some advantage, but it will still disappear after a while, I am right, Siegel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the fire swayed It is getting stronger. The more this is the case. The more you need to be calm. Of course, this is only for the Master. If it is the barbarian in the North, then the violent is the only way out. What Lear wants is very clear. He used to be a scorpion, Evan’s one hundred scorpions, and other possible scorpions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the scorpion is not around Siegel, the higher artifacts can't be projected, and now they are all in the underground caves of Heim's collar, which is very safe. After trying to understand this, Siegel mobilized the elements to break the spatial movement of the body. While talking to Lear: "You are right. I have read a lot of information recently. I have already started to contact legendary spells. The spells you just used for me include instant casting, forced transmission and space blockade. This combination is basically It is the strongest catching spell. I really should be proud."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s quite right. But not comprehensive enough.” Lear said: I never underestimate my enemies, so for the success rate, add a spelling spell to your personal spell, a chain that will send me along with you, and a legendary spell component that avoids triggering your spells. There is no small price to pay for this spell, but the purpose is not to hurt you, just to say a few words to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, it's a scorpion. What else can we have? We don't have to waste our tongue." Lear said: "If it is not a star projection, I have already made you feel different. But there are two problems I can't solve, one is projection. I can't take the scorpion on my body. I have already experimented with a hundred scorpions. Another, I don't know where you put the scorpion, and you can't even find the big prophecy. Are you very happy to hear this news? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I took a sigh of relief!" Siegel exaggeratedly said two times: "You only have one choice, that is to find a way to let me Hand over the dice. Why not try the mind-controlling spells? Maybe you have a chance to succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to rule the magic rules of the whole world, so Don't look down on my understanding of magic. Your deep guard against the Knox Association will make you the ultimate in mind control and defense. I won't waste my time." Lear's tone is awkward, from aggressive It became amiable. "I admire you, the elemental rune warrior, the energy focus lens, the secret energy core and the magic spaceship. It is incredible to have so many new spell spells from a wizard! If you push forward In the last millennium, I will definitely make you a magical gods, give you the power of God, and live forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second time that Leer is The discourse reveals that he was a magical god. It is obviously a kind of deterrent. He wants to bring pressure to Siegel and make him yield. Siegel constantly reminds himself that the magic god has divided his consciousness into Lear by giving up his divine power. He is only a master who masters the legendary spell, not a true god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I first saw the magical spaceship of the Federation, I said that this is really the most beautiful magic tower in the world, no other magical creations can Later, I heard the apprentices say that the celestial star in the goblin world has already had a conflict with the goblin, so I will come over immediately. Do you know. Your zenith starship has refreshed my aesthetic. Let it reach a new height. My desire for it was almost the same as that of the blind man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for complimenting," Siegel is courteous but cold Recalling: "But neither of these will give you anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three." Lear said: "A spaceship, and two dice You also have a blind man. I guess it is right? I don't know which one. But I know that your nephew has protected Evan's face and avoid being detected by the big prophecy." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your big prophecy needs to be strengthened, why not share it, maybe I will "Good idea." Siegel said: "I am very good at hiding, whether it is free thinking or a hundred-faced scorpion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As I said, I admire you very much." Lear is not in a hurry: "I can improve your spells so that it can pose a greater threat to the Nass, but I can't make a secret, my creativity is not as good as you. I admit it. But on the other hand, I am very good at it. That is the management mages. I have been managing the mage for tens of thousands of years. Seeing that they are learning, growing, and maturing, they are sick and old, even though few wizards worship me. But as long as they are still using magic, I understand their thoughts and modes of action. In this respect, my skills are unparalleled, so the Masters Association will always last forever. You are also a Master, so I know how to deal with you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So confident?" Siegel said: "Let's say, let me be happy."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a variety of wizards, different personalities, different abilities How do you manage it? I have seen more Masters, knowing that there are things that can bind you, such as power desires, such as greed, such as love." Lear waved his hand and smiled slightly: "Don't nervous Siegel. I know some Means, but not so despicable to use your family to deal with you. I have to be mentally retarded to what extent, will the only kite line that binds you, and liberate your hands and feet? I will not threaten you, No need, because you will eventually give me the scorpion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. I don't think so. Siegel said: "No matter how you say it, one thing is the same: the scorpion does not belong to you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hundreds of scorpions don't belong to you, so you have to look at the problem from a dynamic perspective, Siegel. Lear said: "You are still very lacking in this area. Oh, don't admit it. Take the goblin. Do you think your plan will succeed?" With a single word, the castle you built with sand on the beach - a seemingly sturdy and gorgeous castle - will vanish. Although it is said that you can do this step, it is very close to victory. The goblin giants are waiting for you, they will give you the most warm reception, and even bow down to the court. You continue to play as your Zenith star, thus controlling the goblin - controlling for a while. What do you want to do next, educate the goblins, let them learn to compromise, and have the opportunity to sign a peace agreement? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
