			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have lived here for ten years, came one after another, and killed one after another, but still can't see the end." The words made other people shudder, and the killings he sent out were as real as they were, like a cloud of armor, shrouded outside the robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every time I think, when can you come in? I know that you know that I am here, and I will certainly take precautions, so I will be The person I am murdering is either not you, or not enough to cooperate with me. But I did not expect that you will be an old-fashioned person. After all, you have always been known as the leader of the young mage, the genius in the genius. I didn't think of it, you actually chose to explain your identity and respond to everyone with the true face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When your face is more handsome than the changed face, You will also make such a choice." Siegel said with a smile on his face. He looked at Chanem with sympathetic eyes: "Ten years? I will wait for the night on the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flow of time should be modified I found it when I came in. It's like what you did in the room, that is, it was used by the half-orcs, causing the gnome and others to die." The murderer, that is, Chanem said: "I always believe You have a strong insight and analysis skills, so tell me how you found me and what did you find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been very early It is predicted that there will be a trap left by that one, so I have been very careful and have been observing the situation here. The main purpose of the entire Magic Academy is to train the Master - I think you can learn the spell for this reason. All the excessive cost Things that do not serve power and do not serve the main purpose have never been used in planning, so I will first determine which ones are true and then look for fakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney nodded, "The School of Magic and the Magic Tower should be Actually, there is no problem at least in the general direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be no problem to change the content. I believe that I can throw magic on me. The ability to not trigger the protective effect is not simple, let alone to dig the essence of the character and make corresponding changes. This kind of wasteful energy will not be made by the one, otherwise it will directly kill the entrant with a lethal spell. Is it safer? I will look at the source as a real thing, then I can find you in many ways.” His vision turned. Looking at the Orc Master, said: "And you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chaney, you are simpler, because your magic is bad." Siegel Said: "I know that the lich changes are difficult. It is more difficult to use worms. After all, worms are still creatures, have their own life, and it is a skill to get eternal life based on biology - I have done this. The research, this road has not been passed, can only be opportunistic. Can become a worm wizard. Your spell ability should be higher than me, or at least similar to me. When you are killed in the magic tower, there is no trigger The protection of the defense, it is so straight and dead, which is obviously unreasonable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Later, I saw the guardian of the fourth floor, also I know who killed you. His destruction of lightning is indeed very strong, and the anti-magic force field is even more difficult to guard against. But the anti-magic force field is not equal to the magic effect, it can suppress the role of various defensive spells, but not Will make them disappear. So you are .. But with no real trigger guard those magical aura and volatility is just a cover-up, lie with it "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Chaney Farm hum twice, noncommittal. However, his attitude is equivalent to acknowledging that Siegel is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still trace the source, but also trace the source. I have been thinking about it after the lamp god said this. I was changed to the old man, of course I know the reason. Inferences can lead to a lot of interesting things. In order to prevent being exposed by living habits, the race will not change and the gender will not change. I know that you are not a person, or a creature, you are still very difficult to be Kill. Even if you die, you can resurrect many times. So guessing by the Master is that you are only a matter of time. After all, I have expected you to be inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Chanem nodded, took off his mask, and changed back to its original appearance. This young, serious but handsome face appeared in front of everyone. Although it is much better than the past, it always gives the illusion that there is a worm crawling under the dough. It is estimated that this feeling will not disappear for a while, and will exist for a long time like a heart disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for this half-orc, I just made a bold inference, until I decided not long ago." Siegel said: "I didn't expect to be here." I met another saint, and both of you are holy people who can't be magical. Now it looks like a model. Those ice storms, fireballs and thunderclouds are not easy, orcs?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel really wants to laugh, but he is worried about annoying this orc saint. At the entrance under the wall, the elite orc warriors armed with shields gave him a hint. Although they are all dead, they can only stand like sculptures, but who else can direct them to do things except the orc holy people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney is the saint of the murder god, the avatar of the concept god, and actually has no image. The orc saint is a genius of genius, no matter how it changes, it does not take off. Siegel began to think that this is really a half-orc with great perseverance, overcome the disadvantages of ethnic origin and learn to become a magician. But then, according to meticulous observation, the way of fighting in the bones is quite different from that of the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among all, the longest surviving is the Orc Saint, Anna and Chanem, and in this order. Anna said that she survived because she could identify lies. This is his ability to be a teacher. Those who can threaten a sergeant are not simple characters, and must have their own one or two hands. However, from the way the Orcs cast their spells on the time oscillating field, he is not the guy who is so proficient in spells. Violent, fierce, but not efficient, which caused Siegel's suspicion. Chanem is a saint, the god of murder. There must be a reason why he can make a half-orc live for so long. With the aid of information outside the School of Magic, Siegel assumed that the orc's saints also came in, and the results were consistent with all the clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But someone still can't understand. The dwarf finally couldn't help it. He asked: "You can understand this outside, but who is the person you said? It seems that you seem to know who changed the rules here?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and acknowledged: "Yes, I know. But I can't say his name because it is very sensitive. You are a mage, naturally know The name is magical, otherwise the Magic Academy will not disguise everyone. I know that he has made a tampering, and naturally he is worried that saying his name will cause bad things, so it is still not good."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney said to the Orc: "Hey, I said that he is very smart and very cautious. Do you understand now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only care if he has the ability to crack this situation!" The Orc said: "I don't need to tell the story, I just need to be able to do things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Be patient. It’s not a simple matter to crack the trap of that person. It is necessary to rely on the power of the Magic Academy itself.” Siegel said: “First of all, points are always good things, and you have to find more ways to prevent accidents.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This everyone knows, there is nothing to say." Chanem nodded: "As long as no one comes to me, I will temporarily stop the game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "He is telling the truth." Elf Anna pulled out a smile and explained it to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first floor of the Magic Tower is the classroom. You can earn points by learning and copying, so you can go to the second level. But for a caster, it is impossible. I have been learning and copying for a lifetime. I think that each layer has the means to get points to learn the different stages of magic. Here is the School of Magic, not the Master's College. It is possible to have a warlock or some natural creatures. I saw a demonstration of the spellcasting action on the second floor. There are some gestures and spells that are not standard. Those are the manifestations of the blood caster. Inverse, there must be a means for the bloodcaster to get points. The problem is How to find them out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A reasonable inference." The gnome nodded. "You mean, no matter what you find, you have to Let's share and share together. I agree. Let me talk about it. In the room, you can use points to exchange precious materials for magic experiments. You can also use the points to repeat the tests you have done before. The ink can transcribe the scroll, but I deliberately changed the ink with the points - I wanted to try the difference between the materials here - and then made a reel and found that I could use the points for the exact same copy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyebrows are lifted up, which is a very important news. Gnomes have opened a good start for everyone, and everyone has begun to exchange the secrets they have discovered. Although there will definitely be some reservations, there is a lot of progress than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the points remaining in addition to climbing up the magic tower, don't use it easily." Siegel said: "I need everyone to get together and then The lamp gods are all repaired at one time. Only in this way can the true face of the school of magic be preliminarily opened to have a credible source of information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
