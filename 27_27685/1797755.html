			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to help you, but there is no way." Capricorn squatted on the mattress in the bedroom and buried her head in the pillow. The screaming noise. According to the servants, she has been like this for two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Capricorn, are you not feeling well?" Siegel felt the faint Longwei in the air. He recently studied the Dragon Curse, which has some knowledge about how to use Longwei to distinguish emotions and understand Dragon thoughts. He can only distinguish a few meanings now: irritating, so sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, he can also see a large amount of elemental energy through the spirit of energy to continuously enter the dragon girl's body through the power of the energy focusing lens. Capricorn crouching on the bed, like the maelstrom in the ocean of elements, hunger and thirst without endless absorption of the power of the nucleus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then "咕噜..." a clear muffled sound came from the dragon girl's belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyes widened and pointed to Capricorn: “Have you been... hungry?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon girl lifted her face from the quilt, and her eyes were red and gnashing and said: "Hungry! Hungry! Starve me! I can eat a mountain now!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't..." Siegel originally wanted to persuade Moss to eat something, but he also knew that the dragon girl insisted on being so tough for so long. The will of her own, a lightly floating sentence may make her feel offended and angry. "Do you have your body?" Siegel can only ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can!" Capricorn replied hard: "I need more elemental energy, the more the better. Only by absorbing enough strength, I can get better. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an idea, I don't know if it works." Siegel thought after thinking: "What you have to overcome is the body for eating." Need, but you can't absorb anything except the elemental power. I don't want to make all kinds of elemental creatures, such as water, fire, gas, etc., and then you eat them all, will this make you Is hunger better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure this is useful?" said Capricorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be useful." Siegel replied: "It's like a bread made with magic. The taste and satiety are good, but actually It's just a lie to the body. The real energy is the cast material and the magical elements, not the changed bread shape. Some wizards save things. Eating this magic bread all day, the body is thin and weak. So later Classify this bread making spell from the spell system to the enchantment system - the deception of the senses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the element delicious?" The corner of the mouth has left a saliva. Obviously the answer to this question is not important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not too weird to feed the dragon with elemental creatures. Siegel has also seen lava lizards that prey on fire. But this kind of thing can't be carried out from the city of Mire, which will definitely cause panic among the people. Siegel had a good idea. He took the dragon girl through the serial transmission array to the island in the middle of the sea. There were no witnesses within a hundred miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the energy focusing lens, the elemental flow of the Miereng nuclear is continuously launched into the portal and onto the island. Siegel waved his wand and recited a spell. Cast his Elemental Corps summoning spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn silk shows the true body, the rainbow-colored scales shine in the sun. Her slender body rushed into the camp of the elements of gas, and easily tore their lines of defense. The claw with the strength of the element and the long tail like the whip are her most powerful weapon, than her teeth...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not fight with the elemental army, they are I am in control, forgot?" Siegel looked at the dragon girl's full-strength gesture and shook his head. If it weren't for the sake of image, he could even have these elements lined up in a straight line into the mouth of Capricorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Girl also reacted and stopped her body in midair, converging Longwei and Breath. Focus on using your paws and teeth and start eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dozens of medium-sized elements were eaten by her, the state of Capricorn became much better. His face began to become rosy from pale, and the message from Longwei was more satisfying and enjoyable. However, Siegel is sweating and his body is shaking. He just found himself plunging himself in. The summoning element is not the magic energy when eating food. It is completely his own spell power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel needs to maintain control over the elements throughout the process, even if they are in the process of digestion - at least until they pass the powerful stomach of the dragon. Fortunately, the elemental creature does not feel pain, so there will be no painful feedback, but Siegel still feels that he has been bitten by a dragon, chewed it, and then swallowed in her slippery throat. It falls and is surrounded by strong acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a situation that has never been proven to be very relevant to the present, saying that when people are swallowed by giants, they have not waited until they reach the stomach. People have already died because of fright. Siegel faces a similar feeling, which is a very big interference for maintaining spells. He tried to put his attention on the spell model instead of thinking about the strange feeling of being swallowed. Focusing on how to enhance control over spells and trying to make constant improvements to spells can effectively distract and alleviate his uncomfortable feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon girl's strong stomach finally broke out after a few hundred years of rest, and the process of letting her engulf the elemental creatures never seem to end. Just on a small island in the middle of the sea, a *master uses elemental monsters to feed the dragon. Longwei, which was born out of a powerful appetite, allowed the marine life within a few tens of kilometers to retreat, far away from the island. Even the slow-moving starfish are trying to move and touch the seabed. The saliva left by the scorpionfish when it was eaten dripped into the ocean and remained for a long time. Those who are sensitive to smell do not dare to come here anymore. Even the most powerful Naga people misunderstand the things here, thinking that a powerful dragon chooses this island in the sea as a resting place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chain transfer array is turned on from time to time, and it also emits magical fluctuations. These magical fluctuations combined with the atmosphere of the dragons put an end to the possibility of the island being captured by other creatures, inadvertently eliminating the considerable troubles of Heim, but it also caused inconvenience. In order to maintain unimpeded shipments, Siegel is planning to recruit some workers to establish a “station” on the island where the transmission is located, to protect the transmission array and to assist in transportation. There are two transmission arrays on each island. After the goods come out from one, they have to go in from another. This is about a few tens of meters away, and it needs people. Those who keep the island want to improve their lives by fishing in the sea, but find that there are no marine life except kelp and seaweed around the island. It is difficult to get some shells. They have never understood why this is, after all, they do not know that Capricorn had eaten here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than an hour passed, Capricorn was finally satisfied, and lazily recovered from the dragon shape. Her little face rose red, constantly rubbing the corners of her mouth with her hands and wiping the residue of elements that did not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you feel better?" Siegel wiped the sweat from his head and gasped.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Much better! I haven't had this feeling for many years, thank you." The Dragon Girl is very polite - she will be like this when she is in a good mood. Think about Siegel's power for himself. The dragon girl said: "Siegel, I can't help you find a spell book from other dragons. Although the dragon does not need to learn the spell by reading the wizard's magic book, but from the mage The items won there have always been of high value. You also know that there has been war between the dragons and the wizards. Many dragons who have experienced the war will have a collection of spells, and these dragons have suffered in the war. Hurt. They live for a long time, their strength is strong, and they look very heavy on these past things. It is basically impossible to get a magic book from them."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it not a method of exchange?" Siegel asked: "They have nothing to like, what kind of collections they want, or what they need to give to others?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't use the word to help, for those dragons, it is safer to use only the word effectively." Capricorn thought, warm and comfortable belly Let her mind wake up a lot, she can calm down and think hard"Siegel, you promised me to help me find my father, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this is my promise, I have been constantly Deep research on the transmission of spells." Siegel is right: "Do you have any clues?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you will not forget." Silk smiled, it looked like a girl. "I was still with my father when I was born, and I was brought to this world by him. I stayed here. At that time, I was too young, and because of loneliness and fear, many memories were blurred. I need to go to the New World West Dragon. Living in the Huanlong Mountain Range to meditate and restore your memory so that you can find more clues to find your father. I will ask other dragons together to see how I can get some high-level magic books." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you so much," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
