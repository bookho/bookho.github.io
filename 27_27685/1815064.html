In order to deal with the enemy of the siege, Lear continued to display a wide range of high power magic. The meteor storm was summoned, and together with the thunderstorm storm and the serial lightning and the yang explosion, formed an offensive covering the entire seventh floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then three people will have to switch from offensive to defensive, in order to survive the raging energy frenzy. They have to worry about the safety of their teammates and cannot be as unscrupulous as Lear. Moreover, Lear has now restored the identity of the saints, his resilience and resurrection have been strengthened, and the field of the School of Magic is naturally much stronger than the dwarves and dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney's shaded shield protects Siegel from the spell. Meteors and lightning strike above the enchantment, and although they do not harm his body, they are quickly consuming his power. Siegel still frowned, closed his eyes and fell into a state of contemplation. "You bastard guy, no matter what you want to do, it's faster, we can't hold it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille’s crazy offensive, even at the expense The structure of the magic tower. The magic tower, which was unharmed in Siegel's activation of the earth's magic, finally collapsed in the internal explosion. From the bottom, the wall cracked and was crushed by the upper layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a new building on the edge of the square, first the classroom, then the spell demonstration room... the magic tower split and changed the floor below. Transfer to the outside of the square to form a new wilderness. Until the end, the center of the square was only the shimmering shimmering crystal, the constantly attacking Lear and the trio who were bitterly suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome doesn't need to climb to the top because the top layer has come to him. He summoned the Golem Legion, but sadly found that the Golem Legion could play too little. The Golden Golem and the Mithril Golem are indeed very powerful, but they can only adapt to contact encounters in a limited space. For the bombing scenes in the open area, there is more than enough to defend. In the end, they can only get together, and the magic-imposed body blocks the magic for the trio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several times from the death of the dead spell, the three people have consumed their magic items such as scrolls. Their purpose is to come here to learn, unlike Siegel and Chanem, who are rushing to the fire, so the preparation is not so full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a tough battle of the spell, and all must be done - it is clear to Serge before this mission. He is still absorbing knowledge about what is God and what is God. He found that what Chanem told him was correct, but it was not the most appropriate and effective; he knew that if he was in accordance with the teachings of Chanem, he would definitely die, but it would be enough to separate the priesthood and the fire, leaving it to be investigated. Nem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is a little angry, he understands this practice. After all, it is the saint of the murder god. His own interests are the first consideration. Immersed in the knowledge, trying to receive the information from the magic tower, the twentieth scorpion shines brightly and shrouds him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he gives Siegel enough time and points, he can finish this knowledge - the extraordinary understanding given by Xunzi makes him a great study. However, the situation on the battlefield is not allowed. Despite the helper, the trio did their best, but the crazy Lear did not hesitate to lose a lot of holy power in exchange, constantly exerting a strong magical approach to miracles. He ascended to the sky and used the shield of the Holy Force to gain time for himself. After a minute of preparation for the spell, a huge lava cloud of ten miles was gathered in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the blood shrouds the earth, the fire clouds are still at high altitude, and the burning has fallen to the ground. Trees, turf and broken fabrics have begun to burn, and even the spell of protective fire has begun to become unstable. The wreckage of the magic tower, the surface of the hard stone, the blue smoke, like the lit firewood. Only a few rooms protected by the Fire Rules can remain intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are hiding in, you don't need you here!" Chanem narrows the area of ​​the shadow shield, although it will be closer to destroying lightning, but he There is no other way. "I have never sent any kindness, but you should not die under Leer. Roll, go back, don't get in the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not a few The Golem, the trio can't reach the entrance of the room at all, let alone open the hot door. After their figure disappeared, Chanem looked up at Lear, who was like a god in the air. Behind the dragon wing is the background of the lava cloud, which contains the energy that the general gods dare not match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear completed the cast, with a triumphant smile, waved his hand. This wave, the intensity will not be more powerful than the gentle woman to say goodbye to the lover, waving the handkerchief to say goodbye, but it caused the disaster scene of the collapse of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blazing sun is falling!" The high temperature of the top melts everything, even the air can't keep its own shape, all become a lightning bolt and dazzling Fluorescence. The black shadow couldn't resist this light. Chanem's eyes were lit and burnt, and his whole body began to melt, but there was a black sacred protection that would not be erased from the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hand with a wreck of lightning caught it and made Chanem feel refreshed and pleasant in an instant. Even knowing that destroying lightning is just as dangerous, but at least it is more comfortable to die. He felt his shoulders sink and he was thrown out. Glow and heat suddenly disappeared from the side, he is like being in paradise - or for him, in the bottomless abyss of peace and security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't stop it, you can do it, then what to do." Siegel's voice echoed in Chanem's ear, although it was a bit fuzzy, but still Can be distinguished. "But still thank you, for the time for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the scope of legendary spells, Chanem quickly used the Holy Power to repair himself. The light that entered the body was the most troublesome, and it took a lot of time before I finally recovered my vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought that he would see a battle between the wizards, but Siegel and Lear stood quietly across the fire, staring at each other, motionless . Siegel held a chain in his hand and slowly showed a twenty-faced scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is wrapped in the scorpion, and soon everyone can't see its true content, only the light. No matter what kind of magic works, there is a blank, only the vision of both eyes can determine that there is indeed something on the chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I have been wearing it all over, and you have not found it." Siegel said: "The scorpion has many functions, one of which is to block all detections. If I want to, you can't see it even if you bring it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's hand is shaking, the tail is swaying . There is a thirst in his heart, and for this craving it gives up the godhead and the priesthood and comes to the mortal world. He has no later memories, and now he is completely in a state of abandoning his priesthood. So he didn't have a memory of satisfaction when Lear got a hundred-faced scorpion to study. His ** was at its highest point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything starts with it - all the trouble, all the damage." Siegel said: "I want to be a god, I I don't need it anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear sneered in his heart: God, what joke? From the beginning to the realization, it is only a little more than an hour. Even if there is no stagnation, all the knowledge is fully understood in the first time, and there are still no key points. The last obstacle he left in the magic tower is the teaching of the knowledge of the gods. He can only speak slowly from beginning to end. He can't ask questions, can't jump, and burns points. This is more acceptable to the Kingdom of God than to be completely discouraged. It will not be modified or even erased because of exclusion, but it will waste a lot of time and enough Lear to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No key information, no individual can bear the flame. Or, to be more precise, can't bear the fire of this level of power. This is also clear about Chanem, but he does not know what to do. Although the god of colloidal monsters is a race god, the power of less than three forks is not impossible for the body of the saints, and Chanem also abandoned some of the power in time, and this will be withstood. Every more of the fire, the power will multiply, and to the fifteen forks of the magic god, that power will be devastating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that will be destroyed will be the intellect. Losing consciousness and losing oneself is just the beginning. Just like the huge noise that cannot be distinguished, people will collapse quickly, and they will no longer be able to recognize the surrounding, unable to think and control, and become a complete madman. After the collapse is the body, which is a process of liberation. As long as Siegel puts his hand on the crystal of the fire, he will be burned to fly ash, which is convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he has points that can be traced back to time, but he still can't get rid of the fate of failure. When Lear woke up from meditation in less than three hours, he knew that he had won. Except for his "old man" who is very familiar with the fire, no one here will succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes stared at Siegel, trying to see deep thoughts from his eyes, but only to find calm. Siegel has already thought about everything that follows, and made up his mind that there will be no more shakes. So his mood is completely undulating, everything looks very natural, just like the daily breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
