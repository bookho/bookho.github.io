			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orc Fazza is standing guard for the Karuig adults today. His duties are very simple. He is standing at the door and not letting anyone in. In order to be strong, he deliberately put on a slightly smaller iron armor, which makes the muscles feel tight. But this armor made him tickle - or caused by bed bugs? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel entered the wooden house of the Witchcraft, the orc Fizza was still worried about itching. He saw someone coming in, quickly stopped twisting, stood up straight, and lived like a clown trying to become majestic. "The Witchcraft adults have orders, and no one can disturb when casting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you kidding?" Siegel stood in front of the orcs, and the thick mask was also Can't cover his sharp eyes. "The Karug Witch Festival wants to see me, but does not let me in? You have a last chance to think about what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witch Festival Adult I don't want anyone to bother." Fazza's tongue trembled, and it was hard to finish the sentence. He only felt that his body was like a hail, his fear was constantly shaking, and he could not feel itchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linco once said that the most dangerous role in the entire orc society is the witch festival. Those who have mastered the ability to cast spells, no one knows how much they can do. Unlike the orc generals, they kill except the fight. Witch festivals are much more savage than they are, and the means are more diverse. Lin Ke said: "Siegel, we don't know what a witch festival will do when facing another witch festival, but fortunately there is very little to see between witch festivals. But if you run into it, you will ask for it. Dofu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the orc guards. If the swords are facing each other, this guy insists on three times of breathing time. But when I first came to the town, I killed the guards of the local witch festival. How come in the next few days? But then again, if you let Karrug's squatting, then there is no deterrent in the next few days, so what about getting information? So he approached the orc, almost his chest against his chest, and then gently said in his ear: "Wurant adults do not want someone to bother, but you will not reach out to stop me, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazza is stiff, and at that moment, he seems to hear the voices of countless poisonous snakes. When he was a child, he was mistaken into the cave where the snow snake hibernates, and the irritated snake bit him half-dead. From then on, his body could not be as strong as the orcs of the same age, so the snake was the most terrible creature for him. Siegel used the fear curse in the blood magic, and the memory of the viper at the time of the orc's blood was directly triggered: Fiza's body quickly produced anti-drug elements, rapid heartbeat, and a lot of sweating - these He used to save his life in snake venom, but now he continues to deepen his feeling of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw the effect of the spell, so he strode over the orc and entered the house of the Karug Witch. When the door was closed, Fiza fell to the ground and foamed in the mouth. His narrow armor almost strangled it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house of witchcraft is almost the same, the medicine table, the storage cabinet, the brazier, the bed, all for the purpose of casting spells and preparing potions. Karrug’s house is bigger and there are more treasures inside. Seeing that Siegel came in, the witch festival, which was originally sitting on the ground, stopped the spell being cast and stood up. "It's you!" Half of the tone of the witch festival is elated, and half is disgusting. Siegel does not know how such feelings are blended, and can only be attributed to the weird nature of the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing here?" Karrug looked at him with a pair of tiny turquoise eyes. The eyes of these eyes are very small, almost shrinking into a small point, like a snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will naturally not return to "I asked you to come", this time he seems stupid. "I naturally have a mission when I come here, but it has nothing to do with you." Siegel thought about it, and decided to say that it was better. "This is a test for me, don't interfere, don't damage my reward after victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bacon town belongs to General Kaka, and I am His witch offering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and said, "You belong to the orc god, not a common man."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, mask people, don't play with your tongue." Karrug said: "A town with a thousand captains can only have one spokesperson of God. This is the oldest rule of the witch festival. One. If a witch festival does not receive an invitation, it is impossible to enter another witch festival area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! I naturally have no rules of destruction." Gore was in a tit-for-tat and immediately said: "Peeling Kaka invites the head of the town to come to the town of bacon, so I can come. You invited me to your house, so I came here. Why, do you want to provoke a fight?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
