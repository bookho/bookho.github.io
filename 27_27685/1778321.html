There are many "legends" about this spelling lab, most of which are synthesized from various folk stories of evil wizards. They are spread after deliberate processing. For example, if the wrong statue is turned into a cockroach, or because it is eaten by a terrible ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in addition to some warnings and defensive spells, Siegel did not use any vicious deformation and necromantic spells. However, these stories effectively prevent the curious from scolding the spell lab, and Siegel is too lazy to argue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaac was lying in the arms of the maid, clutching the feathers of the Raven Baron with a small hand and gently touching it. He looked at the spell lab with a curious look, and lost interest only after watching a few eyes, focusing on the toys in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid’s legs were fighting, and it was not easy to put Isaac in the arms of the lord, and then said: “The lord...the grown-up, the lady is gone.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I found her, you don't have to worry." Siegel comforted her with a smile and said: "The whole castle is under my perception, my wife is fine, We take a break and go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good...the lady is fine." The maid barely smiled and asked: "The Lord, what else? "Is it right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Preparing Isaac's dinner, if we haven't gone out at sunset, we will be here." Siegel from the hands of his son Pull out the magic pet and throw it outside the door. "When you come, you will talk to the Raven. It will open the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being robbed of the toy, Isaac is not angry, looking at the big round eyes Father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved the staff, and the candlelight of the lab lit up, giving off a soft glow. He summoned a ball of light in the hands of Isaac to play for him. He didn't expect the little guy to squeeze it with his hand. The ball of light swayed a few times and was crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son, it seems that your elemental affinity is good, can affect the effect of simple spells." Siegel smiled and summoned the Angel of Light. Another small ball with a pale yellow glow flew over and kissed the baby's face intimately. Then let him catch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is much stronger than the dance technique, and has a certain sense of autonomy to accompany the children. Siegel summoned the floating disc and placed Isaac on it. Then I took out my hand to take care of Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has slowly slowed down from the pain, ** opened her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't been able to suppress this time, you have turned." Siegel described her situation at the time. "The situation was urgent at the time, and even Rhett could not subdue you. The guards of the castle had picked up the plasma and had a hairpin. Fortunately, I came back, but then I couldn’t imagine it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Janet squinted. Looking at Isaac, who had a good time with the Light, he took a sigh of relief: "The child is fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is causing "Siegel said: "How come so suddenly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not very clear, some memories become blurred." Jenny Wrinkled and tried to think back: "It seems that Isaac fell from the bed and cried. I don't remember the later things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This matter has gradually lost control, and you have been unable to suppress the process of being erupted by the devil's blood." Siegel took Janet's hand and passed his mind to the body temperature, softly said: "You must make "You can't make it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only killing once?" Janet bit her lip, still shaking because of tension: "I am scared. I am afraid of me." Once you close your eyes, you can't open it anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Siegel said: "But you Completely turned into a devil. Nothing is gone. I entered the thought of the bone demon, this is only evil, horror and killing, there is nothing that belongs to you. What is the difference from death? In that case Next, I don't think you can control not hurting others. I have magic body protection, what is Isaac? What if the devil wants to hurt him? I can't always be with him."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the kitten's stubborn eyes, Siegel sighed and sat closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knox will no longer pose a threat, and the elf is also badly hurt. I hope this will give Heim a peaceful time. Time, I will spend more time with your mother and son in the castle." He said: "But I can't do anything about your current situation. I can't force dangerous spells on you. At present, reincarnation is the best choice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you are scared, but you know, fear is a good thing." Siegel said: "You have to maintain a strong survival." Improve the success rate of the resurrection. In addition to the lack of spell level, if the soul does not want to be resurrected, then the strong spell can not bring it back to the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Really?" Janet smiled weakly, still clinging to Siegel's hand. "Give me more to say, what will happen to the reincarnation spell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish." Siegel kisses Janet's back and says "Reincarnation will change your race. Strip all your abilities, including blood, and reproduce your memory and soul in the new form. The devil's curse is passed down through the blood, so there is no Then I will influence your approach. After that, I will make a necklace for you, so that you can still use the current body shape and face, and continue to be the lord of the city of Mire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Janet smiles, but more is to make myself look more relaxed. "Well, Siegel, I will go to reincarnation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyebrows are still full of exhaustion, and the clouds are not strong, Siegel Not the case. But if there are other ways, no one wants to go this step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaac made a screaming voice and tried to climb over to his mother. Siegel hooked his hand and floated to the side of the sofa. Janet reached out and hugged her son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord sorted his hair for his wife and found that the delivery headdress was not there. He asked strangely: "Where did I give you the headband?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't remember a bit," Janet said after thinking about it: "I feel very tired with the headband, and it seems like a lot of work." Dream, I went to a lot of places in my dreams. I took it off a few days ago and put it in the room. I vaguely remembered that the Capricorn had come, it seemed to be related to the head ring, and the others were very vague."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel closed his eyes and communicated with the defense defensive array of the Territory. He found that the Dragon Girl was staying in the room and seemed to be resting. "You should be glad that this time, Capricorn has not joined the battle. With her ability, the bones will die, and you will die together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I know, I know..." Janet obviously didn't want to continue this topic, hiding her face beside Isaac's round face and kissing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is no longer saying anything more, just sharing the warmth of reunion with his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle was attacked by the devil and there were various rumors. Siegel came out to clarify that this was an attempt by outside lawmakers to try to break through the city of Mith, and was discovered by Pastor Reid in time. Fortunately, no casualties were caused. As for the collapsed horse shed and the chicken coop, it will be repaired in one day, exactly the same as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel told Janet that he was preparing to reincarnate and told the half-elf wizard Idis, who smiled and promised to contact. The news of Deepwater City has come one after another. The elves have begun to suspect that Siegel participated and led to the defeat of the Northern Elf Corps, thus strengthening the encirclement of the city of Mire. Farmers who want to go to the Ghost Fog and Swamp Farm are beginning to accept more rigorous inspections, and the frequency of war patrols is increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Mid-Levels Road has begun to run into trouble. Although the elves did not board the city wall, they began to attack the caravans on the mountain roads with the ultra-long-range strike capability of war trees. The truck that was hit will explode and become a piece of debris under the influence of the impact force. Therefore, some road sections that are vulnerable to blows during the day cannot pass, and merchants can only rely on the cover of night to pass through dangerous areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Elf Masters have lost patience with the city of Mith, and there have been six attempts to sneak into the air in three days. The first two came in was the Master, one of which was disturbed by the spell of the energy focus array on the transmission site, and the twisted transmission magic was torn into pieces. Another successful attack triggered an early warning spell that was discovered by the guards. In the face of a steady stream of arrows, the wizard Master knows that he can't do anything, so he sends away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
