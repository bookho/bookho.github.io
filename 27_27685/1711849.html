			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea at night is very calm, only the sound of the "squeaky" sound of the front bow and the swaying of the sails on the top of the head are constantly coming. Most of the passengers fell asleep in the cabin, and their snoring and vomiting did not reach the deck, only a slight smell. When doing seafarers, Siegel has long adapted to this environment, and even using magic tricks to dispel the taste does not have to be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the brazier is warm and bright, and the font on the spellbook is very clear. Siegel once again read the spells of the blood magician and the common wizard, and combined his own personal experience to intercept the most essential spelling ideas. His research on the power of destiny in the magic notes of the comrades of the comrades caused Siegel's interest. He read them one word at a time, trying to understand their research context. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this research note, they mentioned an experimental spell called Star Track, which is the combination of astrology, questioning, and destiny. Features are combined. After years of improvement, the chances of successful spells are high, and you can always get some information about fate. One of the important casting materials is Yan Lingjing, and Siegel still has a lot of debris left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ready to use this spell after a good rest, and he must ask some questions. Most people sleep in the cabin, and only the Siegel and his magic pets remain on the deck, and now it is the time to cast this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fire basin, Siegel put his nails, hair and a few drops of blood together. Then he needed a hand to reach the stars in the sky, and the other hand stayed at the top of the flame, revealing the veins of the palm. Then recite the spell and let the red magic fire solve the fate problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel concentrates on casting spells, but does not receive any response, just like his prayers. He then changed the object of the inquiry and tried every god he knew. Whether it is good or evil, no matter what field they work for, this spell has no effect. This is inconsistent with the notes, because each soul is made up of a variety of traits. These qualities correspond to different gods. Do not say anything else, Siegel as a sailor, now on the ocean, but why is it the water king or the god of storm. Nothing reflected? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is real, and many people have personally talked to the messengers of God and witnessed countless miracles. Captain Ma Lin had had a long time of contact with the incarnation of the god of the storm, and he had mentioned it to Siegel more than once. In the books of the Masters' Federation, there are also many records that enter the Kingdom of God through the barriers of the world. Some powerful mages are also able to get the gods' interviews. In addition to God's chosen people, even high-ranking pastors can pray and receive responses from multiple gods at the same time—just the reason and strength of the response are different—but never heard of someone who is completely unresponsive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame continues to burn the palm of the hand, and as the spell approaches the end, the palm gradually begins to heat up. Siegel decided to try again at the end, but this time he no longer asked the gods, but chose the shadows of the dead. This is the most mysterious existence that the Master knows, and they can also open up the new power of the scorpion before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell got a response this time, and Yan Lingjing slowly melted in the brazier, like it turned into ice. The familiar white shadow appeared in Siegel's vision. It was exactly the same as when it was encountered in bacon town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have helped me out of the orc's search, now please help me sort out the clues of fate." Siegel said, then heard the dead The singer replied with an eager voice: "Listen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is different from the sound heard in the bacon town, but it evokes Siegel another A memory. He had done dreams about the past, and a majestic voice once said in his ear "Look!" so that he had the vision of a possessed mouse. The voice of the soul in front of you is exactly the same as the voice in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No god will respond to your prayers and calls." The shadow of the dead said: "But you are not alone in the world, they will all look after For you." Every time he said a word, Yan Lingjing will disappear a part, and Siegel will take out all the soul crystals and put them on the side of the fire basin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this why I always have a bizarre experience?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The answer to the first question: Yes or no." The death shadow replied: "Your destiny line does not exist, no gods can influence or In this case, no matter what method you use, you are free at this point. But at the same time, you need to carry a twenty-faced scorpion and take on the fate of the scorpion. You have been separated from the scorpion for too long. After reconvening, let you There was an illusion." A piece of flaming soul crystal burned out, and Siegel quickly added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The answer to the second question: the existence of this thing can not be examined, the god of the world is not clear, only know that it is the thing that bears the fate, and goes further than the burning soul of your burning. There are four scorpions in the world, you have One of them. If you meet other people, you can also disclose this information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflammation is burning faster and faster, Siegel will All the stock was thrown in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, if you want to break away from the strange fate, just discard the dice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The answer to the third question: that will lead to greater fate entanglement, sooner or later. Except for the four of you, no matter what the existence, you can't bear the influence of the blind, it belongs to you only, obeys you. If you try your best, you will return to your hands. The longer you separate, the bigger the counter-attack. Look!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Siegel looks from the flame To a scene. Under a sky lit by lightning, the storm raged and the waves continued. The lucky Sos was struggling at the cusp. Its mast was broken, the bridge was broken, and the hull was squeaking under the distortion of great power. It is no longer lucky to evade the storm, only to tremble under the power of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This ship has been carrying the scorpion for 16 years, before everything was safe, now it needs to be repaid." The shadow of the dead said: "But this is not Will affect the crew, because they did not make the same move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflammation Crystal only left the last point, Siegel looked up and looked at the dead黯影, suddenly felt that he gave himself a very familiar and intimate feeling, just asking about this, but the heart was like a heavy blow, a bloody top to the throat, pressed his words down. Just listen to the shadows of the dead and say: "Don't ask some questions, because the answer is hidden in the treasure at the end of the world, I hope you can arrive. Use your nephew, it will help you when you need it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the last flaming soul crystal burned out, the flame burned the Master's palm, and he immediately retracted his hand. The spell ends, the white shadow and the other outs are completely gone, as if it had never happened. Except for Siegel and the Raven, no one knows that there was a white shadow on the boat. They all slept heavily and were very sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s brows are wrinkled, and the words of the passing of the shadows are heard over and over again, and one word is not missed. If there is still Yan Jingjing, he will not hesitate to devote himself to the flame, in exchange for the answer to the question. For the whole night, he sat down on the side of the fire, his eyes fixed on the flame until it went out, leaving only a smoke. The half-orc, who was up at night, thought that Siegel was ill, and quickly re-ignited the fire for him and burned hot water for him. This is the time when Siegel came back. He can't explain these magical things, he can only express gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-faced scorpion hung on his chest and now becomes heavy. Since having this thing, Siegel’s life path is completely different. The old captain’s handing the scorpion to his hand seems to have happened yesterday, and everything is vivid. Time is like completing a reincarnation, and above the sea, Siegel once again examines the scorpion, stroking the patterns and patterns above. Unconsciously, he already had a familiar feeling about the blind man, no longer the curiosity and strangeness he just got, no longer the surprise and confusion when he first opened the ability. The problem he cares most about is how to open the scorpion's ability. According to the meaning of the deceased, the scorpion seems to have his own thoughts and arrangements, "will provide help when needed." Siegel kisses the scorpion and puts it under the collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened another spell book and put it on his lap to start reading. At any time, regardless of the ability of the scorpion, it is still more important for Siegel to be a spell. Because only through the spell, he can have the power to complete his dream and become a hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the next few days, the sailing was very smooth, and the wind and the ocean current pushed the big ship to sail south. The orc pirate ship was not seen within the field of vision, and of course the merchant ships that ran the route were not seen. According to the time, the warships from the starry kingdom should arrive, and the fleet of orcs in other seas may be being cleared. Thinking of this, Siegel did not expect to encounter warships. After all, they are now riding the orc's paddle sailboats. What if they are destroyed as enemy forces? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the seventh day of the voyage, Siegel revised the course again and began to turn west. He found the Deva brothers and asked if they wanted to go ashore in advance. The two orcs did not insist on the original idea this time. After seeing Siegel's spell ability, they decided to vote for the Master and use the sword to serve them. Siegel received two soldiers in accordance with the mercenary's treatment. In addition to armor, weapons and food, he paid three gold coins a month. The two orcs initially thought that the price was too low, which was worse than the cheapest slave of Macabu. After Fazak explained the three gold coins available in Deepwater City, the two people readily accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
