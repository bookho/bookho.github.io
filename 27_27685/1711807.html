			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people sit on the back of the takin and cover the soft long hair as a blanket. The body of the magic takin naturally exudes warm body temperature, allowing the legs to rest and recover. When they left the snow-capped mountains, there was only a thin layer of linen wrapped on their feet, which was when they fled. There is a warm, warm-haired foot now, just like it seems to be in heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking behind, the majestic volcano reveals a gloomy atmosphere, and the hills are shrouded in gray clouds, with red flares coming out from time to time. . I don't know if the eruption of the volcano will affect that passage. For those who imprisoned him, Siegel naturally had no good feelings, ‘I hope the lava swallowed them’. Just don't know if there will be other prisoners inside, will they be affected? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of their advancement is not affected by the volcanic smoke, the stars in the sky are brighter, as if they are close at hand, at your fingertips. A crescent moon hangs in the clear night sky, making you look great. Siegel stared at the starry sky and judged the direction through the pattern of stars. He found that the direction of the downhill was to go north. If the mountain behind him was the walled mountain range, then he had crossed the human castle defense line and reached the orc-controlled area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very difficult to go back from here, even if the travel mages William Eric, his footsteps rarely set foot in this area. I remember that there was no volcanic sign on the map of the Wall Mountain Range in the conference room of the Masters Federation. It is probably an unknown land here, but how did you come here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is immersed in thinking and trying to remember what happened to him. He only remembered that his eyes were smashed by the spell wand and then the cavalry hit the cliff. It seems that I have not fallen to the solid ground. The moment when the feathers come into effect may fall into the river. Only this can explain why the injury is so light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then maybe the river has been drifting with himself for a long time? Siegel thought about it and thought it was very possible. Although he was wearing a breastplate at the time, thick clothes and cloaks were cumbersome, but feathering did make him float better on the water. Even if you can't be as light as a feather, you can get the same buoyancy as wood without difficulty. What happened after that? River water can only flow from high to low, can not always cross the mountains and mountains, take yourself to the north side of the mountain? Siegel can only speculate that he has fallen into the underground dark river. If this is the case, he will sigh his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened after that was nothing more than being discovered, plundered, and trafficked. Since Siegel has escaped, he no longer thinks about these things. He is now only worried about Janet, and of course Sir Bill, Evan and His Royal Highness. I don't know how the Schlint family of Black Blood Castle will treat them. From the situation of the war, they should capture the prince for the most important purpose and will not harm their lives. Is it for ransom or for political purposes? Siegel is not known. Considering that the starry kingdom is still the most powerful country on the old and new continents, the safety of the prince can still be counted. The power of the nobility is not to be underestimated. The Count of Todd has two large castles and five small castles. He can mobilize more power than the Black Blood Fortress. Moreover, between the aristocratic battles, it is customary to pay the ransom to save their lives, and they should be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet, I only hope that she can survive with the ability to transform. Siegel thinks this should be no problem. After all, she is also capable of deceiving... just like turning malt-little fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pondered for a moment, then prayed to the god of the storm to bless them. Then he closed his eyes and concentrated on the Ravens. It is estimated that the distance is too far away. It is difficult for Siegel to observe the situation around him through the eyes of the magic pet. He can only use the idea to give instructions and let the Raven Barron start to look for erupting volcanoes in the wall mountains. As long as you find this landmark, you can gradually recall the magic pet to your side. With the eyes of the sky, Siegel's next move, whether it is to go back over the mountains, or go deep into the orc territory to see the situation, there will be more choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volcanic eruption scared away many animals, at least they did not encounter it during the downhill journey. Two people are hungry and actually want to hunt some animals to eat. However, it is too difficult to find food in a complete snow and ice environment. If there are no takins to save their feet, their physical strength is not enough to ensure the consumption of the downhill. If that is the case, Siegel can only choose to open the key space, risking the complete exposure of the secret, and take out the food inside - he really does not want to do so. However, after a night of trek, they finally reached the forest line. From here down, there are some trees growing on the slopes, mostly pines and spruces, and some bare ground with moss. Having plants means that there may be animals living, and there are foods. Siegel decided to temporarily slow down here to find food and shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zike." The Orc jumped off the back of the takin and pointed his finger at the neck of the cow. He made an incision gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, no, this is the creature that summons, killing will not have a body, can't eat." Siegel explained. “We have to find food from other places.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The takin licks its nose, which opens its mouth and tells the mage to add charcoal strips. In the hands of Siegel, only the last one is left. In order to cast other flame spells, the takin can no longer be given. So Siegel also jumped down and patted the bull's head and called it back. The takin finally screamed and turned into dust and dissipated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼克 surprised to see this scene, the prisoner is increasingly invisible. He has magical power, just like the witch festival in the village, but it is not the same. The witchcraft in the village can not change so many things from the majesty. During the half-month that he was kept in the cell, he had already pulled out the cakes, bottles, and woven into the net with the wool there. This man can actually pull out a cow when he goes down the mountain. This can't be summed up simply by the magic word. Perhaps the witch festival in the south of this mountain is different, is it the soul of the birth? Why are all spells inseparable from the next three? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this Southern Witch Festival is a man, where is his stuff hidden? When he was just thrown into prison, he didn't wear clothes. All the upper and lower parts were exposed. He had already seen it. There is nothing to hide. Zucker suddenly burst into a shock, ‘does the following words be fake? In fact, she is a woman without a chest, so she can hide things? The more he wants to be more and more, the more he wants to be more curious, the problem has been bothering him for a long time, and today he must understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the half-orc went to the front of Siegel, and the "crack" screamed, saying hello for the next thing to do. Siegel naturally did not understand what it meant. He saw that the Orc suddenly grabbed his lower body and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too unexpected. Siegel thought that the half-orc exposed the true face of evil and attacked himself. He tried to kick back, but the snow that fell into his ankle affected his speed, and he was caught. This kind of severe pain is very tolerable, and the ice spells in his hands are out of control and are not able to be stimulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc caught a bit and felt that it was true, so I couldn’t understand it. He licked the short hair on his head while licking "Jack??". Siegel fell to the ground, grasping the snow on the ground, and using magical power to shape them into ice blades. He was about to fight for life and death, and he saw the half-orc with doubts and turned to walk in the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is this doing?" Siegel had no venting, and could only hate the back of the half-orc. "I really don't understand what is going on in your mind. If you dare to reach out to me suddenly, I will cut your throat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half The orc shrugged, "Mike, Mike," he replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel groaned, and snorted again, and suddenly looked at the ice blade in his hand. He recalls the state of the dagger that was just created, which is the result of a fully concentrated spirit and just the right magic control. The shape of this dagger is very similar to that of Siegel's obsidian dagger, which may be the result of subconsciousness. The spell he used was very simple, just the basic shaping and change curse, but in the process of making this dagger with a spell, Siegel realized a new experience: magic is a regular learning result, but it should be free to do whatever it pleases. The process of creation. Siegel wrapped the dagger with a cloth, as a grip, this is his best weapon at the moment - except those that remove the key space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked forward on the snow covered with pine needles while advancing while observing the surrounding situation. Zucker discovered an ant nest and saw a lot of hillocks piled up by fermented decayed needles. The half-orc folded the branches and opened the hills, and saw countless black and big ants crawling up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't want to say this can eat?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike, Mike!" The Orcs quickly denied. He took off his linen clothes and dug a small pit and laid it inside. Then he digged the ant nest and slammed it down. The black ants crawled around and tried to avoid this "natural disaster." However, Mike was unmoved and shoveled the soil with a stick. "Zike!" He whispered, then grabbed a large ant with his hand and placed it in the pit. Siegel looked over and found that there were a lot of eggs and some whitish larvae. The frightened ants rushed to carry the eggs back, leaving the crawling larvae struggling in the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
