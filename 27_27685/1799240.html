Because of hunger, cold, and deteriorating wounds in the abdomen, the dwarves in front of them are dying. But he still clung to the stone in his hand, ready to give him a head when Siegel approached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel squatted and said to him in a pure dwarf language: "Let me see your wounds."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-sighted eyes of the dwarf, he looked at the goblin in front of him, trying to discern the authenticity of the language from the golden eyes. Siegel quietly looked at him and quietly waited for him to make a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf leaned back and tried to straighten up the upper body, then said in a dwarf language: "I will not let go of the stone in my hand, let's see it!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goblin Taka nodded and climbed over to open the dwarf's coat. The dwarf was hit by a musket and left an infected wound in the abdomen that was beyond the scope of the healing potion. Only the dwarf priest was able to practice the spell himself. However, taking him back may cause a chain reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have the ability to take you back to Mora, or you can find the dwarf priest to cast spells for you and heal your wounds." Siegel said: "But This will expose me to the situation of the crystal wall passage. At this stage, I still want to keep it as confidential as possible. I can also find a non-dwarf priest to treat you, although the effect is worse, but there is also a great cure. But you need to assure me that you can never pray to the god of the dwarf. As soon as you pray, the god of the dwarf will immediately know that I have the channel of the crystal wall, which is still contrary to my original intention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me, the person disguised as a goblin," the dwarf said: "You are the enemy of the dwarf or a friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Friends, comrades, not enemies." Siegel said: "Can you swear to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf loosened his hand and let it touch his palm The blood stone rolled to the ground. He shook his head. "I can't do it. I can't abandon my god. I can't deceive you. My children and brothers are dead in this world. Only I am left behind. I live only for two purposes." Revenge for my loved ones, and return to the side of the dwarf god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the two choose one?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf made a series of laughter and said: "Any dwarf will tell you. Let go of hatred to find peace and find peace of mind. My son and When the brothers died, they were at the side of the dwarf saints. They have already gone back. If I can reunite with them, what hatred can't be put away? You don't have to treat me. Just take me back and let me die. In the world where the god of dwarfs exists, I will always be grateful to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That still reveals the secret of my own wall channel," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... you killed me." The dwarf suddenly said: "I have lost a lot of strength, and the goblin will find me sooner or later. Here I am going The gods of the dwarfs don't get any response, so I know that my soul has no place to go, no relief. They... their machines have strange powers, maybe they can torture my soul and discover secrets. You kill I, then burned me, turned me into fly ash, and their machines couldn't catch me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really determined to die?" Siegel took out the knife. Hold it tightly in your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf nodded and closed his eyes. He muttered to himself, doing prayers before his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pierced the dagger into the dwarf's chest and gently touched the heart. The dwarf's facial muscles twitched, but after all, there was no resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dagger was pulled out and there was no trace of blood on it. The dwarf opened his eyes and looked at Siegel strangely, asking his eyes why he was still alive. He saw the goblin put the dagger aside, then smashed it out of his pocket and took out a thumb-sized diamond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember. You owe me five thousand gold coins." Siegel put the diamond on the dwarf's forehead, and then he recited the "eternal stagnation" spell. Isolating the whole body of the dwarf from reality and letting him fall into a false animation. His wounds will not heal. At the same time, it will not deteriorate, and everything in the outside world will not hurt him. He does not produce odors, but also isolates the possibility of being detected. Then Siegel used teleportation to throw him into the ice crystal cave, and when he went back, he could drop him on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masters have a variety of ways to solve problems, but the goblins of war and chaos are really a big headache. Siegel knows that they are respected by the strong, they are greedy for wealth, and they may be greedy for power. But the goblin does not seem to respect the promise, and does not value credit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has tried to behave harmlessly and tried to maintain a certain stable relationship by showing force, but these failed. He was alone on his return journey. At this time, his weapon has been replaced with the most advanced "five-figure automatic rifle" with "grabs" in his pocket and bullet-proof steel helmet on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the two cars parked on the road, two bodyguards sitting on the roof and warning around. Then a car lowered the window, and the fat goblin said a few words. A bodyguard took the gun, then the light flashed, the white smoke rose, and Siegel’s chest was shot and fell to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguards packed up the camp and the two cars drove off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t care about the process of pursuing the action? Just because I was alone, I didn’t have a living dwarf around me, so I shot and killed it? What does life mean in the eyes of the goblin, and how Siegel can't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lay in the snow, his eyes staring at the blue sky. The sun came out from behind the white clouds and looked directly at Siegel's face, but he couldn't feel a warmth. What can be done to achieve a certain balance with these goblins? Even the orcs in the north of the Walled Mountains are not so difficult to get along with. At least in the orc city of Makarbu, the human captain can still do smuggling and black market business. Both parties will respect contracts and contracts and will not betray each other before the contract is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least they know how to measure the strength of their opponents, know how to obey the strong, and know what they are afraid of. If they are orcs, they will first ask Siegel about the process of hunting and get something useful for themselves. Then I will think about "this person has no use for me, killing what he will get, what kind of risk it will take."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes are far away Gun, right in the chest. After Siegel fell down, there was quite a feeling of sorrow and laughter - even the corpse was too lazy to come! He lay in the snow for half an hour and then sat up. Chased down the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s getting dark, according to the habit of fat goblin in the past, they have to stop and sleep after dark. According to their speed, they should be able to reach a small village with a hotel before midnight. Do you want to catch up with them in that place? Siegel’s mind is also uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car can’t be opened on the snowy road. At least certainly not as good as the sorcerer who uses the spell to fly. When the fat goblin stepped off the car and entered the hotel here, Siegel was already watching. When the light in his room lit up and went out, most of the people in the town went to sleep, and Siegel gasified himself and flew in through the cracks like a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First surrounded the room with an enchantment that separates the sound. Then Siegel put his hand on the head of the fat goblin. He hesitated for a moment and thought that he should still understand the idea of ​​goblin, and then consider whether he absorbed his knowledge and memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the teacher changed the spell and replaced Knox's Mind Spelling spell with a soul link. If there is a priest here, there is a spell in the power called the domain of honesty, which can make the goblin only tell the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wake up, don't sleep." Taka took a long shot and licked the head of the fat goblin and awakened him. Just before the call was about to burst out of the thick throat, the cold barrel was stuffed into the mouth and forced against his teeth. “There is a business to talk to you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this communication can create a stable and sustainable relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Taka. You are not dead!" The fat goblin pressed down the sound, and everything in front of him subverted his cognition. He saw Taka being hit by the ****, and saw the blood flower in front of him, and even saw the broken bones and internal organs, how could survive in this situation. Even if he survived, how did he catch up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came back to get my money, 25,000 yuan. Although I did not find Zhuofu, it is not my responsibility. Your men are on the way. Attacking me, causing the mission to fail. Tell me, are you letting them start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only when you find Zhuofu, they will kill you. "The fat land is honest and replies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is your money?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes did not say, but his mind gave the answer. Siegel reached out and took a wallet from under his pillow, which contained a lot of colorful cards. There is also a whole lot of high denominations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I belong to me is 25,000 yuan, and there are about 30,000 in your wallet." Siegel smiled and threw the wallet to The other party: "You see, I can take it all, but I only take my part. Do you know why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat Gnome shakes his head, but in his heart They are all contemptuous emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as I follow what I promised, then Star God will bless me and protect me from death and injury. Your men shot me in the air." But that kills me. Star God repaired my body and took me here to get back what belongs to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Star God Really great!" The fat goblin exclaimed. It is a pity that he does not believe what he said at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I take it for me, and then I will leave here. As long as you don't play, don't chase, then no one will know that I have been here. You Sitting in your car, I am going to my jungle, we are irrelevant, no longer have to meet." Siegel pointed the gun at the head of the fat goblin and said in a word: "If you break this agreement, then the star God will bless me out of danger. Then I will find you trouble. I will follow you, hurt you, slowly dismember you, let you suffer three days and three nights, then you will ask me to kill You. Everyone has asked me, you are not the first, and will not be the last one. So, do you agree with the proposal I proposed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you obey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, of course Swear by the name of the Star God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Swear by your life!" Siegel is making the final effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swear by your life! You walk quietly, I will never catch up and retaliate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The fat goblin is not thinking like this, he has no idea of ​​respecting the vows. When Siegel said that he had a way to live, he had two seconds of joy, and then vetoed the possibility of hiring Taka again, and then all thought about how to retaliate. He did not think about whether such revenge is reasonable, and how the benefits and costs are. He thinks that Taka will not give him any more income, so he only has enough revenge, so it is simple and direct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the other party in the oath is not good for himself, the oath will inevitably be violated, and Siegel only accepts such information. Isn't the goblin stupid enough to not understand what is a threat? Are they arrogant or self-destructive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the spell is wrong, after all, the other is a goblin, and it is a goblin of a different world, and the deviation of the mind link is normal. With the last hope, Siegel opened the window and made the illusion of leaving the room. In fact, he has been invisible and continues to observe the actions of the fat goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big sigh made Siegel’s hopes shattered, and the fat goblin chose to ignore the threat and ignore the agreement. "Come, come on, Taka is nearby, find out, kill him, kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound will of course not be outside People heard that the Silent Circle eliminated this threat. Siegel slowly appeared in shape, carrying a rifle standing in front of the fat goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat goblin broke out with incredible bravery, and the claws fluttered toward Siegel. The wooden butt hit his chin, knocked out six teeth, and knocked the heavy and fine counterattack on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't understand why you made this choice." Siegel said: "I said that Star God will bless me, you believe now. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the fat goblin thinking, there is still no answer that Siegel wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t even get along with each other, how can you get along with each other? Siegel had to give up the idea of ​​convincing the fat goblin and cast a charm and hints on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
