			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarves are passionate, stubborn guys who like to dig, forge, drink and fight. They love their families and clan, never timid for themselves. The people fight. Well, the dwarves firmly believe that they can overcome all difficulties as long as they are united. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time there is no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William sighed. "Mora's scorpion, the most embarrassing gem of the Dwarf Kingdom! The god of the dwarf instructed the dwarf to settle there first. All of them simply thought it was because of the rich mineral deposits and the difficult terrain. Yes, these two reasons There was nothing wrong with it, but it was not enough. I used to cross the mountains all the way to the west, where there were better vein areas than the Walled Mountains and the Mola."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Please tell me where I am," Siegel inserted. "And then please continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dwarf God on the Mountains I am very familiar with the rock. He should have discovered a secret of the walled mountain area very early. The dwarf has been digging down there over the years and finally found the barrier of the world. At the deepest point of the Mora, the naked eye can see the way. Another world's wall barrier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knocked his teeth twice and then took a breath of air, which is a big news! In addition to the ** division, only a small number of people who specialize in the multiverse know what is called a crystal wall. To put it simply, the crystal wall is an eggshell that wraps a world inside. The world is likely to be very large, with thousands of stars; there may be only one planet, or even only one continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sergeant, it is not difficult to walk through the world. The only difficulty is to determine the position of each world. Different worlds are wrapped in their respective crystal walls. Some crystal walls exist as entities. Some are just invisible rules and energy. Before crossing. It is difficult to know the internal properties of the crystal wall from its appearance. Some of the world's crystal walls are inherently isolated from magic, and if Siegel walks past with a spell, it will most likely be a one-way trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, starting from your own world, entering another world is simple, you only need to follow the rules of the starting point, but you need to see the return trip." The other person's face." The mages will pass through the crystal wall system, or simply "crossing" as a dangerous action. There is also the phrase "passing through risks, being cautious." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many worlds surrounded by crystal walls, I am afraid no one knows. Even the power of God is not universal in every crystal wall system. Most of the gods do not place the body in the crystal wall system, but on the more stable outer plane. The sum of all the crystal wall systems is called the main material plane, and the outer plane is the outer plane, which is characterized by a fixed tendency for each outer plane, such as the paradise mountain of good and lawful rule. Only good and lawful creatures will be born, and only creatures with these two qualities will be able to live completely here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil lives in the lawful evil Barto Hell. The devil lives in the infinite abyss of chaos and evil, and the konjac is born in the mechanical environment. That is where a lawful force reaches its peak. The reason why Erdu left the mechanical environment was because he had a "failure" and it was no longer completely orderly. Naturally, he would feel "incompatible" and eventually squeezed out of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge is popular here. (In detail, you can have tens of thousands of words on the water). The sergeant that Siegel had encountered was a kind of scavenger race that was usually hidden in the void, ready to return to the outer wall of the crystal wall and then eat the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divine power can't cross the rules of the crystal wall, so putting the real body into the crystal wall system is a kind of self-binding behavior. In general, it is the limit to "throw" the next saint, just like Chanem or the Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The walls are generally far apart, and it is rare to be able to touch such a crystal wall." William sighed and said. "In general, such things should be collected by the Master, the priest, and all the understanding of the existence of the crystal wall principle, in order to decide how to do it. After all, this is all about the life of a world, but this time the dwarf did not. I am The message from Mora's Guard is that the dwarf patron saint descended on the sacred priest and asked the dwarf to open the barrier to the wall with all strength, and then migrated to the opposite world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Why is this? It seems to be abandoning the ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A large number of colloidal monsters appeared in the walled mountains, attacking the rear of the dwarves, cutting off the connection between the Mora and the beachhead fortress, causing the situation to turn sharply. Gum monsters are rarely smart and tactical, using them in cave environments. The adaptability, the attack everywhere, let the dwarfs run hard. In the end, the dwarf's conquest battle failed under the colloidal plan, a large number of dwarves died, and the beachhead fortress fell. In order to prevent the goblin counterattack, the dwarf saint sacrificed himself and blocked it. The crystal wall channel allows the opposite side to be worn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "Very heroic, but also stupid!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is stupid. The rune of the dwarf is not easy to use when it comes to the multi-dimensional surface wall barrier, far weaker than the mage's spell. I found the opportunity and destroyed it. Anti-magic area, then leave there. As a traveler, how can you not go to the opposite side?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the sake of safety, I use the astral projection again The projection acts as a pathfinder and passes through the wall barrier. There are still four elements and magical powers on the opposite side, although the spells are weakened, but they can still run barely. The opposite goblins have only a very basic magic, but they have made great progress in machinery and metallurgy. The level of living creatures. Although the defense is not enough, the power of the attack is far beyond. They think that the opposite is a dwarf world, and is preparing to organize the army to launch a retaliatory expedition. The dwarf saints block the passage, they are ready to use a certain A very powerful explosive device forcibly broke open."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My thoughts are different from them. Since the two crystal walls have a touch point, it is hard to guarantee The second one. I cast a spell in the world of the Goblin, and I found another place with three weak walls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, William pauses for a moment and sighs. Tone. "The dwarf has already let the goblin shed the first drop of blood. This is a very difficult thing to end. Once the news of contact with another crystal wall system is spread, except for the dwarves, it is difficult to guarantee that no other ambitions want to conquer it. Although I don't want to Things may be weaker, but when it comes to fast travel and finding specific things, no one in the world except the gods dares to say better than me! So, I want to locate the three weak points before everyone else, best Can close them forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close? Why close?" Siegel is puzzled: "If you say reinforcement or unilaterally prevent them from crossing I can understand this. But must I completely close it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William suddenly stood up and looked at Siegel with a vigilant look. The face is dignified: "You will not be one of the ambitious people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t worry, listen to me." Siegel waved his hand. Signaled that William sat down first. "Since a mage's point of view, the closed-wall channel is more beneficial than the disadvantage. The opposite is not a magical world, and the two worlds have been dragged into the war by the dwarves. In order to avoid further escalation and expansion of the conflict, you take There is nothing wrong with the method. But I would like to ask: If the explosive device made by the goblins can really break through the barrier set by the dwarf saints, what about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought of Rhett’s prophecy. Will the volcano exploding from the ground be a masterpiece of the goblin? Moreover, who said that the passage has been closed, what happened to the bodies that drifted out of the walled mountains? Since the body has a way to come, can the bomb not be used? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he told William about this, and the latter became silent after hearing it. If the goblin finds a way to invade through the barrier, then the situation is another matter. As a person in this world, you must have all the channels in your hands, in order to gain "land advantage." In the state of confrontation of the crystal wall system, the geographical advantage is extremely important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now our only advantage is knowing that there are three places, my advice is to find them, hide them, use them secretly. I am attacking goblins. There is no interest in the world, but this is not a reason for self-discipline and unpreparation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William pointed out the window: "The Federation's spacecraft is also preparing for you." Is there an action?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but I didn't know the crystal wall system at the time, just saw a lot of dwarf corpses. If it was really For a world, flying ships are a lot of water, we need more and stronger things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Preparing more swords will only make war more prone! Countless Life will die, the winner will only get the land of dead bodies, and most of the time there is no winner!" William said loudly, "Do you also choose to drag the world into the battle?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
