			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Siegel's standards, a race with the ability to cast spells has a good magical talent and can be taken to the Temple of Magic. This includes humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, dragons, and so on. The undead represented by the lich is also among them. The mysterious sea Naga is also hard to get on the shore, watching the surrounding scene with wet eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some races don’t have such a good cast talent, but they are also very large, such as orcs, halflings, wingers, etc. They also have a seat in the conference room. . Originally, this room was not used for a large number of people. After seeing the number of transmissions used by the magic god, Rhett Reid could not help but start worrying. However, as Siegel folded the space and made the room hard, he sighed and let go of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clones continue to bring people attending the meeting and arrange seats for them. There are grievances between many races, the orcs are the most hostile in them, and then the undead creatures that are disgusted by all living things - but fortunately they have not caused trouble around for years, so there is no direct hatred. Siegel has no intention of mediating their grievances, so the requirements for each race are the same: sit well, don't move, shut up! The pressure of the formation of the fire of God is always hovering over everyone's head, not trying to break through this pressure, but no one can succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stayed in the conference room is actually a clone, his real body came to the starting castle. Here is his last nephew compatriot, the wife of the starting lord Moore, the daughter of Dio: Nata. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would not find Nata directly, and then said to her: "You come with me." Maybe Green Dragon is doing this, then the end is The whole body was beaten and cracked. Siegel came to the city's main government, knocked Morr's door first, and then pushed it straight away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Lord?!" Moore's eyes widened, and the report in his hand was directly smashed. "I don't know if you are coming? Is there anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked into the room. It still maintains simple and clean furnishings, not because it is located in an important trade node, because wealth is going to luxury. "There is a meeting that requires you to join with your wife. I am here to pick you up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor is a little embarrassed to scratch his head: "Recently and She had a fight and was awkward. I am afraid she would not listen to me. Can I not do it myself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't do it, But Nata must go." Siegel closed his eyes and opened it a moment later. "She was in the garden crying, we find her." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "This can not cry now she would beat me with their fists ah???!" < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are neither stronger than her, nor know her..." Siegel shook his head: "Forget it, I didn't teach you. After all, I myself It’s just a little better than you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel deliberately stepped out of the footsteps to inform Nata in advance. Taking a few seconds of "warning" time, Nata packed up her face and hid her sad look. When she saw Siegel, she obviously stunned. "How did you come in, Marquis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I didn't knock at the door, use it directly Transmitting came over. But this time, I am looking for you and Moore to go to the city of Mire, there is an important meeting." Siegel came to the door and said: "No matter what contradiction between your two couples, they are just There is nothing wrong with the trivial things in life. Come on, I will take you with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nata looks at Moore and considers it for a moment. She didn't want to go, but she also knew that she couldn't let Moore not come to Taiwan, so she nodded. She let Morla live with her hand and then walked into the portal opened by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of Siegels in their eyes. There are always portals that open and close, and every time there is a Siegel who comes in with a certain race. "Now the lord of Heim is Isaac. After the meeting, you will swear allegiance to him again." Siegel led Moore and Nata to his son and prepared a seat for them. He particularly reminded Nata: "No matter what happens, just watch and listen, don't say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously, completed the task-oriented clones They all gathered in the "ontology" sitting in the upper position and then merged together. Siegel also returned to the position, slowly recovering the deterrent of the fire, so that the people present can breathe a sigh of relief. After a few more minutes, no one came again, Siegel snapped a finger, all the clones disappeared, and his voice spread throughout the corner of the venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the magic god and the only one who stays. I have only one purpose to call this meeting and save you." He knows that there will be many people who ask questions, but now is not the answer, or no Time to give them a solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took twenty scorpions from his neck and turned off the "invisible" function so that everyone could see it clearly. Just like in the School of Magic, he originally told the whole story to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything starts with the relationship between the wall of the storm and the scorpion..." Siegel puts the essence of the devastating storm, the origins and special effects of the scorpion, the gods The plans and arrangements as well as the recent events have all been told. When he took out his nephew, Nata was already stupid, and Moore’s eyes were also surprised. Evan had known that the origin of the scorpion was extraordinary, but he had not heard the secret behind it. He put all the things in tandem while playing with the scorpion in his hand. When every detail is perfectly explained, he truly believes in Siegel's remarks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is based on the scorpion, there is no real bloodline with the starry royal family, which will directly threaten the basis of his rule. Fortunately, Siegel did not say who the nephew holders except him were, and kept this secret for Evan. But Evan decided to talk to Siegel after the meeting, this must have a perfect solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet holds Megan sitting beside Isaac, she never knows that there will be so many things, and now I don’t know what to say. . It turned out that from the beginning, it was the divine curiosity that turned into greed, which led to all the things that followed. Siegel went out again and again, and it turned out to be a piece of pure land that was constantly trying to get from God's hand. In order to achieve a beautiful, safe and happy home, for this dream, he has paid so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fact that you became a magical god directly led to the departure of the gods, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Siegel naturally heard this voice, and the devout elf has not yet been awake from the situation of losing power. "Yes, you are right to say this. But the most fundamental reason is that the elf god thinks that you have no need to save this group of elves, and no one will pay attention to this place in the multiverse. Are you satisfied with this answer?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingers only pass from each race, orcs, dwarves, halflings. "I am not targeting anyone, but everyone in your room is abandoned! There is only one way to save yourself. If you want to waste precious time, go find those gods who have abandoned you and ask clearly, please I am not responsible for explaining anything to other gods. I only say my own plan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venue was quiet and the whispers disappeared. Although representatives of many ethnic groups are still immersed in grief, they have to play the spirit of listening to the idea of ​​the magic god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world of thunder walls has become very unstable, although I love this land very much, but I don't have much confidence in stopping the advancement of the storm wall. It is necessary to evacuate here, and at least most of the civilians without magical ability should be evacuated. I will open the portals around the world so that you can collect materials, organize things and spread the news."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only place in the world that is sure to go is the goblin world, at least in the depths of the ground to avoid the dust." Siegel looked at Evan: "Although the ground The environment was completely destroyed by the war, but fortunately the planet did not break. All the creatures with the ability to dig caves must be concentrated, plus all the dwarves, to build underground refuge for the entire thunder wall world."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King stood up and said: "His Lord of Magic, I am not raising objections, but such a large project between rushes can not be completed, the dwarf can not work under unlimited "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our undead can." A lich said: "But I need a permit, I want all the bodies on the wall of the mine to be transformed." Cheng Yu and zombies. Of course, in order to take care of the meaningless feelings of these strangers, we will not move where there are tombstones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is absolutely impossible. The undead is evil. If it increases in a lot, it will cause trouble!” The dwarf king blows his beard: “We dwarves will not work with you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel looked at the dwarf king, tapped the table gently, and said, "Let's go, ask the god of the dwarf god and ask if he is against it. If he objects, you ask by the way. Who will save your dwarfs. Of course, if he does not object, you will work honestly, saving yourself and saving others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
