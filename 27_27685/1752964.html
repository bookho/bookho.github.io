			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel carefully examines the fragments of the magical figures in front of him, and is impressed by the designer's whimsy. Many of the spells are broken up, and the pieces are recombined to give a new effect, supporting every feature of the Golem. This requires the manufacturer to be proficient in all kinds of spells and to the extent that they can be integrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a certain way for Siegel to go, but his purpose is not to create a high-end warrior like the elemental demon. He needed a simple, low-cost figurine to guard the Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the core of the Elemental Golem and began to transform the Golem shell by his own means, simplifying its function as much as possible. With magical resistance and melee ability, Siegel focuses his attention on these two aspects and then minimizes the size of the Golem. This is not a simple job, and it takes a lot of effort to stand on the shoulders of the predecessors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Shiya is not a good test site, so Siegel commissioned the dwarf to transport the spoils to Heim. He also did not forget the things in the original cave. Since the magic images of the door have all been killed, everyone can safely enter the cave to explore other treasures. The dwarves are rejoicing, because Elinte, on behalf of the gem family, has promised that half of the treasures will belong to the expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel carried two of the Golem cores with him, and then proceeded to the north and marched north. Also with him are Leah, Kerry and Moore. Their goal is still the Golem, but this time it is not for fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never stop during the day, as far as possible to the north. The rolling city walls are always on their left side, and when you look up, you can see the mountain passage connecting the castle. In this season, it is often not good to see a pedestrian for a long time, only those on the hills and the fortress, as well as soldiers patrolling. They saw the passengers riding at the foot of the mountain and waved their hands to say hello to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ore boulevard gradually narrows and then disappears into the wilderness. Now there is no road in front of everyone, and everything is ruled by the wilderness. The weather is getting colder. The ground has been covered by snow unless it will melt until the next spring. Only the rushing river will not thaw, and it will continue to flow from the mountains. On these rivers, several people sat down to rest. And add the water bladder on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This river originally flowed to the Jackdaw tribe, a river that my brother and I often drank." Kerry apparently came to this place and was deeply touched. "We call it the Silver River, because it will not completely freeze in the winter. There are some slender silver fish in the river. It is rich in fat and is our favorite food in winter."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he rolled up his pants and walked on the water. "You don't want to come down, it's so hot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has inspired the ancient blood of the Frost Giant, so these cold rivers can't really hurt him. He took the ice gun with a careful countercurrent flow, so that his smell would not scare away the fish. As the artifact rifle stretches out, there will always be gains. Most of the fish are only as long as the palms, but enough for everyone to improve their meals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol is busy making a fire, then taking water to cook. There are no trees here. Naturally, no dead branches can be found, but some dry moss and dry grass are enough to ignite a small fire, enough to heat food. Siegel sat on a sheepskin blanket and read a book, raising his eyes from time to time to watch Moore busy. This young boy is very hardworking and smart, and he is very fond of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All lunches are grilled fish and thick noodle soup, and a few elf biscuits are given as dessert. Moore loves this kind of elf food very much, only one small mouth at a time, and the rest are all collected. Siegel saw him and gave him all his elf biscuits. "I have enough food in my space bag," Siegel said. "If you like it, just take it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant catches the fish . Sitting next to the fire, I looked at the river in front of me without saying a word. When Siegel saw him so silent, he walked over and leaned on his side and asked, "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought about the past," Giant Kerry said: "If my father and brother are still alive, how good it is. I can concentrate on raising my children. When the tribe needs to fight, fight when the brother needs help. Don't worry about how to organize. Grazing, how to coordinate the relationship in the tribe, do not have to guess the minds of the generals. I am not as smart as you can understand these complicated things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Really?" Kerry looked suspiciously at him and said, "Do you care?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and said to the giant: "If you let I went to plant the land, and I was able to grow things. Even if I was lucky, I didn’t understand these things. Why should I point my fingers? I am mainly in the territory to judge the right and wrong, so that the people have a place to resolve the dispute. Then try to protect them. For the rest of the time, I can safely learn magic and improve my knowledge and strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I am more than you Qualified.” Kerry’s cloud was slightly reduced, and he said to Siegel: “At least I will raise horses and know how to sow food and harvest. Although not as good as my father and brother, I am better than you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not necessarily a few years later." Siegel said to him with a smile: "Don’t look at Heim’s collar is small now, but it will come to a certain ratio. Your jackdaw tribe is much better. Although I basically don't know anything, I have one thing to do well. It is to let everyone go further in the field that he is best at. The new products I designed have driven the business, the mines I have built have made me have a steady wealth, I can attach dwarf runes to the weapons and armor of the territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry patted his hands gently: "Well, there is one thing you are definitely not as good as me. I will conquer the entire grassland with the soldiers of the Jackdaw tribe, any dissatisfaction The disciplinary tribe will be eliminated. Can you do this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head. Although he has the power of magic, and as time goes by, it continues to increase. He is very confident in himself and will be able to walk very far and stand tall on the road of the Master. But will he be as full of fighting spirit as Kerry - or aggressive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm afraid it's hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that your territory was attacked, isn't it?" Kerry raised an eyebrow: "The war of the day is the first good song. But I don't like the ending. Why do you want to talk to the aristocrats in the South? Why don't you kill them all? Those who have the heart to attack you, if they are not afraid of you, will come back to you someday. Trouble - because they never believe that you will forgive them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not like this," Siegel waved his hand: "You don't understand the process, I faced the common enemy with the southern lords and finally reached reconciliation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still have another enemy when the enemy appears?" Kerry stunned: "You don't worry about they unite to deal with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't think about it." Siegel admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry scratched his head and sneered two times: "Siegel, you are a good brother, very smart, but you never This is not the case. My father taught me and my brother. He said that the Jackdaw tribe is quietly cultivated on weekdays, but if someone does not want us to plant it, it is endless hatred. Until we scribble the roots, and Feed on the enemy's body, otherwise you will never talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled at him: "Oh, you are now a tactical master." Kerry brothers, you are relieved, I have a few hearts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant nodded and said to Siegel: "If you need help, just say." Our cavalry can help you south at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry, you know, I have started learning to send spells. When you need help, maybe I can appear in front of you with a sigh of relief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This I believe." Standing up, patted the ice and snow, and then said to Siegel: "Let's separate here, I will go east from the river, then turn back to the tribe, and will not send you anymore." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel hugged him hard and said, "Thank you for helping me get the core information of the Elemental Golem."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the thank you for this." Kerry said: "I'm afraid it's time to fight when I meet next time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Siegel's face was determined and dignified, nodded: "Prepare more, see you in battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Kerry left on horseback. He first went to the site of the original Jackdaw tribe, and there was no new grass growing in the grassland burned by the dragon fire. The snow in the sky fell, and the waste heat from the ground melted and flowed away along the black soil. The curse caused by the red dragon flame and the dragon's blood will exist for a long time, but it will one day be able to re-emerge and grow new pasture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
