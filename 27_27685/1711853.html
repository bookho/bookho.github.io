			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Kerry hugged together, they were called life and death brothers. "Siegel! Ah, it’s good to see you, especially when you see that you are still safe and strong." The giant carefully looked up and down, then laughed loudly: "It’s a little thin."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just sneaked back from the north side of the Walled Mountain Range and sailed for ten days at sea. I haven't eaten anything since I got off the boat at noon today. Can you say that I can't be thin? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, not only Siegel, the giant Kerry also became thinner. A few months ago, after the dragon attacked the jackdaw tribe, Kerry and Siegel each embarked on a difficult journey. The mage had a magical experience, making heroic feats at the orc's base camp, and the Frost Giants have been leading the tribe's survivors, struggling to survive on the edge of the main battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry’s tall, his fists can bring down the most robust bison, but he can’t make food out of thin air. Although the Jackdaw tribe found a lot of food in the ruins burned by the dragon, it was not enough to support them to eat forever. Because the original pasture was taken over and the cultivated land was destroyed, the Jackdaw tribe needed to find a new destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Giants are all focused on this matter, and they are not as strong as they used to be. To say that a few months ago, he was still a tall, energetic man with a clear, energetic look. Now he has a beard and a mess, and he is almost ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to my house." Siegel said: "I am a lucky person who can enter the house with my good brother." He looked after Kerry. Go and find that the team behind him consists of five cavalry, including two old and three teenagers, all of whom are squatting, but carrying short swords and shields. This is the largest type of weapon that Deepwater City allows foreigners to carry. Longbows and hard shackles are even more prohibited. From the tattoo, only five teenagers belong to the Jackdaw tribe, and the other three are not very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about your wife? How can you not see a child?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry suddenly showed up and scratched his head and said: "Siegel, in fact, we came here for..." The words have not been finished yet. An old man behind him said: "Great king, be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I saw my brother, the original plan naturally gave up." I waved my hand and said, "Siegel. This time we were going to rob you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief’s brain will understand the meaning of the giant: "You are Said to be ready to rob Trinity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the name." Kerry spread his hand and explained: "Our department is implementing no money, and there is no exchange. Everyone needs to eat, so they can only rob. With weapons and armor. Together with the grain, we are ready to kill the grassland and occupy a place. After the snow melts, we can plant it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are really a good idea, it is stupid to rob this thing." Siegel’s words caused dissatisfaction among the five knights, and their hands were put on the dagger. Ready to pull out and desperately insult the people in their heads. But what Siegel said next, let them re-emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master said: "Why not rob this kind of thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staying in the house The Trinity legs that were ready to be greeted were soft, and they quickly came out and threw them in front of Siegel: "Adult, I have been working faithfully, and I have not been deceived!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "We both want to rob you, are you ready to resist?" Siegel said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleek businessman looks at the northern savage. Look at the crimson robes on the Master, and there is absolutely no chance of thinking in any direction. He was crying and sorrowful, his tears falling from big to big, and he finally appointed and said: "I give up on resistance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK, don't cry, put all The goods are ready." Siegel gave him a look and said: "You listen to me, that's right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trines After hearing this sentence, I thought about it. I was able to make a lot of money in the war with the orcs, which was the news that Siegel had revealed to him in advance. One step faster, faster step by step. Many merchants want to establish a relationship with the Masters Union. After all, the Three Peaks Tower is the highest-end customer in the New World. The dwarf of Mora can only rank second. And just the eyes that Siegel had made to him might mean a better business, so think. Being robbed once is nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry, this thing is solved, come in and eat." Siguel’s giant hand said with enthusiasm: "I can't wait to have something delicious."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Dip prepares exquisite banquets, including spiced ducks, roast goose and squid with herbs. The staple food is the bacon pie stuffed with carrots and mushrooms. Pears and apples are boiled in boiling water and immersed in warm red wine, next to a round of orange-yellow hard cheese, salt and black bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who share the bread and salt under the same roof enjoy the protection of the guests’ rights. The owners of the houses must protect their safety, and they must not harm them. To respect the owner equally, otherwise it will be cast aside by the gods. I don't know if there is such a custom in the culture of the savage, but Mrs. Dip still prepared these things according to the habit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the long-lost Siegel, Mrs. Dip is very excited, but she still works as a cook, only when Siegel greets her. Happy nodded. Her son, Karl, became a big man, six feet tall, wearing a large silver robes, and the waist wearer's crescent moon emblem. His face was very clean, and there seemed to be a bright reflection in his eyes. After seeing Siegel, he quickly reached out and held it together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, move a stool and sit down, then we will start eating and drinking." Siegel knows that the prairie people are not so much, their straightforwardness is famous. of. "Carl, congratulations on becoming an official pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My practice is not enough." Carl replied modestly: "The work of self-purity and dissemination of the gospel is still There is a long way to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he is really good at learning, Siegel thinks. He moved to the stool and sat down, and Kerry sat down beside him, and Carl seemed calm. However, the five men of the Giants were somewhat cramped. Their short swords and shields slammed together and could not find the place where they were placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing, throw things out of the door, then sit down and eat." Kerry snorted and shook the plate. Then he suddenly thought of something, and quickly said: "Ma Kui, you should not eat, go out to tell my wife, I said that I met Siegel, things to get things, eat here, robbery is exempt "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" A young man who followed him replied quickly, and several other people seemed to be no longer nervous. Just before Marquee ran out, Kerry added: "Tell her, I won't go back at night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After everyone sat down, Siegel Separate the bread by hand and sprinkle the salt to hand to several people. Kerry took it and took it, then he took the red wine in the cup and drank it. He looked so hungry. Several other people have the same kind of learning, and they have put down their enthusiasm in the temptation of food, and each has launched an attack on the food they like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The siegel knows the origins of several knights, the young Dailin is the surviving warrior of the fire dragon attack night, slightly under the blue eyes A generous big lip, now as a guard and follower of Kerry; another taller and thinner young man from the Yucai tribe, their chieftain Siegel’s uncle, the two tribes now acting together, will The most promising rider, Kirian, was sent over. The two old men are from the Red Riding Tribe and the Black Wolf Tribe, and Kyco’s “cutting the throat” and Marjorie’s “snakes”. They are all masters who plundered on the grasslands and have already taken out their own names. The time spent by the jackdaw tribes was too long, and many tribes have forgotten the origins of the jackdaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the year is good, the horses are actually the same." Kerry cuts a large piece of cheese and drinks it with wine: "But when When others don't want us to be better, we don't grow up grazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut throat Kyco took a table and shouted: "Yes! Good Everything is won by a sword, but it is not bought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marjorie is somewhat dissatisfied with this sentence. After the beginning of this war, if it was not for Kerry to go south, through the advance troops of Deepwater City to buy supplies, especially tents, blankets and charcoal, the jackdaw tribe could not spend the cold winter. "The dragon has killed too many people, and now needs a break for the time being." Kerry resisted the pressure at the time, preferring to avoid all battles, knowing that he would be deceived, and choosing to trade instead of looting. The largest of these businesses were made with Trinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the Red Ribe tribe, the chief of the Black Wolf tribe is the father-in-law of the giant Kerry, and the aunt of Kerry has long been married to the Black Wolf tribe, so two The relationship between the tribes is very close. If you talk about it, Ma Qiaoli was the first person to be a jackdaw tribe. It was the guardian of the giant Kerry aunt. Naturally, Kuqa could not be cheaper and sold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
