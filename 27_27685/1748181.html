			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning is cold, the sun is sighing with helplessness, and the light golden light shines on the earth, shining the hoarfrost. A team of 20 people approached the hub from the west, and the breath of people and horses formed a transpiration of white mist in the cold wind. Four wooden carts made a squeaking sound, rolling through the roads reinforced with stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is mixed among these people, pretending to be dressed as a knight. He squats and yawns on horseback lazily, no different from the mercenaries who are lazy and addicted to gambling. From time to time, he picked up the skin in his arms and took two drinks. At this time, he opened his eyes and observed the situation around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no difference in the sky above the hub, there is no magic wave, only the silky snow that floats slowly. The red magic tower that has been erected from outside the city is located about a hundred meters from the outer wall of the castle, and is closer to the residential area than the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards in front of the gate are also listless, they are even too lazy to pick up the canvas on the carriage. The caravan from the Mola’s squad had to go to Ximu Town and met Siegel on the road. At that time, he ran away the black bear alone, and the team’s people looked at each other. The black bear was naturally changed with illusion. This is the "experience" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His asking price is not high, as long as three meals and one silver coin per day, to ensure that when the danger is in full help. After joining the caravan, Siegel also appeared very low-key, never asked, not much to say, although a lazy look, but very alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravan even wanted to hire him all the way to Ximu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to try my luck in the Cavaliers." Siegel said after entering the hub, and then left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wants to know the structure and use of the Red Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knox Association’s magic tower is built on a slate-covered floor with a smooth, flat surface, like a beetle’s shell, with no curvature. , all are monotonous planes. It uses a different angle to present an irregular polyhedral column. There is no window in the tower, I don’t know if there is a mage inside. However, Siegel felt that there was no need for a mage. The tower itself seemed to have eyes and sneak a stare at the people living in the hub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the tower has not been completed, because Siegel found some magical array around it. Some lines are also broken and misplaced, and they need to be processed. If he did not learn the manufacturing process of the magic tower with Mr. Edith, he could not understand the magical array on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden and alert, these are all enchantments. The damage of protective elements is also very common, but why are there so many unfinished laughter marks? In Siegel's knowledge, the maddening imprint of this spell can cause the enemy to fall into irresistible laughter and lose the ability to fight. But compared with the disgusting nausea, the mad laughter receives restrictions on the other's cultural and linguistic abilities. Not very general. So this spell is mostly aimed at ordinary human civilians, and basically has no effect when facing the knight or other wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood by the window of the hotel near the Magic Tower, covering himself with curtains and observing it in secret. During the entire daytime, no Master came out to depict the phalanx, and the construction site was as ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, residents of twos and threes pass through the magic tower, stop and look up. Some passing merchants will also come here to make a sound of praise for the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one will enter the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not a ruthless person, he can't pay to hire someone to explore dangerous moves. So he changed his makeup, masked the black-eyed features, and then cast invisible spells. Going to the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He passed through the crowd, avoiding the walking body and the shaking arm, and did not attract their attention. Every step, he must carefully observe the fluctuations of the surrounding magic, ready to use any door spell to break away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I looked at this magic tower, I felt that it was dark red in the whole body, but when I got close, I found that the wall was filled with many gray marks. These gray patterns are not on the surface of the wall, but in the interlayer in the middle of the wall, only because the translucent outer casing is visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This anomalous phenomenon caused Siegel's vigilance, and he thought that the tower could not be considered in the usual way of thinking. He remained in a state of recession and did not recklessly step into the open door of the tower. Instead, he walked around the tower and finally found a clue near the base of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several hidden lines of the law are buried in the gaps of the slate, squatting to the corner of the courtyard. What is this used for? Siegel walked along the line and found a hidden door disguised as a slate. There are complex magic enchantments on the door, including protective detection, protective elements and counter-attacks that release the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seam between the dark door and the surrounding slate is only a lot of fine sand. There are no signs of any plant growth, so it is exposed. Maybe the sorcerers will use them here to illusion and cover up the truth with the illusion of resident. At that time, the secret entrance was completely hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disassembling a spell trap is a dangerous job, and it can be ruined with a little carelessness. But for Siegel, he has two abilities that other wizards don't have: dwarf runes and dwarf ring tricks. In particular, the latter has magical effects when dealing with detective spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t make targeted changes, a lot of detection enchantments on the items will fall into a loop of contradictions: what is there, look, see You need to look again, find a detected array, detect unknowns, and continue to investigate with the new array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a loop will soon make the detection matrix ineffective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spells used for alarms and counterattacks will not be touched after the parts are not identified. Siegel used the dwarf's runes to make the mechanical parts of the dark door work, and then sneaked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found himself entering a stone hall, illuminated with an indelible light yellow candlelight, reflected on the gray stone walls. On one wall is the slogan of the Knox Association: attitude determines everything, and the other side of the wall is the "know yourself" of the Masters Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long carpet on the ground, once gorgeous, and the silver silk on the fabric is faintly visible. But it has recently experienced a fire, with large pieces of burnt black burnt all over it. Siegel’s armpits measured the amount, and each burnt was basically the same size, which was the radius of a palm. This is very similar to the effect of throwing a spell with a fire, but this spell is used to deal with weak and scattered monsters, such as spiders, mice or sporadic kobolds. Is there such a biological invasion near the entrance? Siegel expressed doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken carpet absorbed his footsteps and led him to the hidden wooden door. Siegel heard the sound in the wall, it seems that some mice were scratching the stone wall with small claws, making a small and busy scraping sound. Siegel thinks that this is not normal. How can a magic tower inexplicably attract rats? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound quickly diminished, and only a few occasions will sound inadvertently. Siegel crossed the half-covered wooden door and walked into a room. He was surprised to find that it was actually a bedroom and it was almost identical to the room in the city of Mire. He blinked his eyes and only felt that the illusion was more realistic and became exactly the same as his own memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful woman is lying on the bed, and the tulle-like quilt can hardly cover anything. She and Capricorn have the same face, but they are more tempting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled a little, knowing that he must have triggered a spell, reading his memory and creating an illusion. He blinked his eyes and used his scorpion's ability to turn himself into a beggar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion disappeared, surrounded by icy gray-white stones and pale yellow candlesticks. The half-covered wooden door does not exist at all. It is actually the organ that triggers the illusion. The guilty thief will always try to reduce the damage to the surrounding. It will not be difficult to open the door that can be drilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues to move forward, the passage all the way to the ground, it seems that he has penetrated into the depths of the red magic tower. The surrounding walls finally turned into a red hard shell, and a spiraling staircase attached to one side of the wall, leading to the height of the magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray traces seen from the outside correspond to the position of the stairs. For every five or six steps, a decorative oil painting is hung on the wall on one side of the stairs. The patterns inside are different, but they are all a theme: laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are human men’s laughs and human women; there are old people, children; there are elves and dwarves. A strange smile was condensed in a picture and appeared in the magic tower. A smile can trigger a smile. Even if he is a beggar, Siegel can feel the joy in the oil painting, and he also wants to make a giggling laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
