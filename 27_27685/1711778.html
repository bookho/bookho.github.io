			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel let Janet hold him up, and then they saw the cavalry on the horizon. There are a hundred horses carrying a hundred strong riders and holding a hundred machete. They made an arc in the distance and went straight to the camp. Kerry walked out with the tribal warriors, seventy infantrymen and more than thirty riders. The horses were lost too much, and the equipment was almost burned in the fire. Even the usual shooting guns can't be done by one person. Kerry stood at the forefront of everyone, holding the ice gun with stability, hoping that the weapon's prestige could shock the enemy - but he hoped that it was not the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the enemy’s friend who looks at the distance of the last two hundred meters. If they don't stop, but move on, then the Jackdaw Horde will let the cavalry start from the flank and let the soldiers prepare for the cavalry's charge with flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry is getting closer and closer, then starts to slow down, just stopping at a distance of more than two hundred meters. At this time they only played the flag: a square flag depicting the plains and the sun. It belongs to the Red Ribe tribe. Unlike the Jackdaw tribe, they have always lived on nomads. They will rob other tribes when they are short of food and clothing. This is also the case when there is a lack of entertainment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only sent the second son of the tribal chief to participate in the Harvest Festival of the Jackdaw Tribe, but they brought the heavily armed brigade to the next day. Kerry is very nervous. I want to know how my father will respond here. What will my brother do? He was not prepared to become a chief at all, nor did he receive relevant teaching. He has always been a warrior, a pure warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time that the Red Riding Horde’s team stopped, two of them escaped from the team and slowly moved forward. They are young and young, short stature, but they are straight and straight, and they sit steadily. The rider's skin was reddish-brown, and the beard on the chin was braided. There were seven people at the older age and only six at the other. According to their tribal tradition, only the warriors who killed the enemy can make the beard braided, and then increase the number as they gain new combat power, but only the chief can use seven, the general can use six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that person is too young to look like a twenty-something, not a general, so Kry guesses that he is a prince, just like Kerry himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stopped at a distance not far from Kerry, just in the Giants' wingspan plus the length of the ice rifle plus three steps. Kerry is not so sensitive to the battlefield, but Siegel, who has been trained in dwarf combat, has accurately calculated this distance and understood the meaning of the two: the two men are absolutely war-torn and have a keen battle instinct. Maybe they still haven't given up their plans for hostility. So Siegel took the wand in one hand and the other hand took the dry food from Janet, slamming the two to restore strength and energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant is tall and tall, standing on the ground can also look at the chief who rides on the horse, which makes the two people of the Red Ribe tribe very embarrassed. According to the etiquette on the northern grassland, when the equal parties meet, one party stands on the ground, and the other party should not be on the horse, otherwise it will be regarded as an insult. However, after the horse is down, they can only look up to the giant according to their height, and the Red Chiefs do not want to get down the wind, so they pretend that they don’t understand anything and still ride on the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giant, really worthy of a name, like a big bear." Red Day Chieftain Sana opened the door and laughed as he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry’s head is bandaged on his head, as well as on his shoulders and arms, under the bandage is burnt skin, and then under the anger. But he has been restraining himself, ‘the king should not be angry, only majesty’. This is what his father taught his brother, and Kerry was right there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he extended his big hand, pulled off his bandage, and re-exposed his wound. As the bandages came down with some sticky skin, the ointment smeared by the wizard slideed down the giant's strong chest muscles, leaving a deep red mark. Kerry slammed the rifle to the ground, and the blood of the Frost Giant came out. The body immediately covered a layer of ice crystals and re-frozen the wound. The ice-cold guns echoed, and the snowflakes flew around the tip of the gun.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry walked two steps forward and snorted, as if a Titan Standing on the ground. The two horses were soft and squeaked, and the rider hurried off the saddle, lest the wolverine fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too rude to see people on the head. You can’t let the distant knights see the face.” Kerry waited until they stood up before they started talking. His body size can catch up with the sum of the two opposites, which gives him an advantage when he speaks. "Now everyone has seen it. I am the giant Kerry, the new chief of the Jackdaw tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I welcome you to do this." Kerry looked at the other person's eyes and said slowly: "But who is the enemy, who is innocent, we have the final say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, then we are not a mercenary? Have you been mixed up?" The Red Chief slammed his whip and spit on the floor, then screamed. "You are a stupid little devil's head. It grows tall and has a hair, and it is not a camel! This wolf on the prairie only needs meat and blood. The grazing and the rot are obedient."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry went one step further and shrouded everyone in the attack. He picked up the long gun and stabbed it. He directly penetrated the horse head of the Sana’s chief and nailed it to the grass. The two men were shocked and quickly jumped off the sides. They slammed the scimitars with them and the blades were white. The soldiers on both sides nervously looked at the three people in the center of the field, all clenching their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant stepped forward and ripped open the flesh of the horse's neck, and the blood spurted out to form a stream. "Come on, the chief of the Sana, the flag-bearer of the Red Sun tribe, thank you for sending the blood and the flesh. You see that I just hit the rack, I was hurt, and my appetite is just right!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he leaned down and sipped. The throat trembled and the blood ran down the corners of his mouth and neck. The two men of the Red Sun tribe armed with weapons stood in a step away from the giant and noticed that his neck had no protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can’t be said that there is no such thing. There is a layer of burnt flesh and a layer of ice crystal armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time of God, Kerry looked up. His mouth was stained with blood, biting a piece of raw horse meat, chewing it twice and swallowing it. Kerry held the horse's neck with both hands, and the two blue eyes looked at the Red Chief, saying, "Will you eat meat together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Day Chief Haha laughed and walked up with a scimitar. He cut the horse's stomach, reached in and pulled out the heart, and handed it to Kerry: "This is the gift I gave you, the chief of the Jackdaw tribe, the giant Kerry. You are so tall and strong, you should eat. The real good thing is!" Kerry swallowed the heart a few mouthfuls, and then the two men hugged a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the Red Sun tribe has been a loyal follower of the Jackdaw tribe since that day, and the two tribes later maintained this bond through marriage. More secure. At the tribal group king meeting, when someone sneered at the height of the chief of the Sanna, and doubted his bravery, the chief would say: "Mom, you think you are tall, go to Kribby! We But I ate on the ground to eat the horse's friendship. Mom is my own horse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Sun tribe only left 12 cavalry to protect the chief, and The prince and the other riders turned around and went back to the tribe to prepare some tents to be transported to help the rebuild of the jackdaw tribe. Kerry’s wife, Mesera, sent a messenger to let the father and brother of the Black Wolf tribe also lend a helping hand. She only married for two years and still maintained a high prestige in the original tribe. After the <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, everyone can finally start to concentrate on the things that are rebuilt from the ruins. Kerry also swayed to find the rest area of ​​Siegel. The giant had already arranged a warrior to help take care of his brother. He had already set up a fire for him, while cooking the meat cut from the dead horse in the pot, and roasting a few potatoes with fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry let the soldier leave and he personally started the servant. Janet felt that Kerry had something to say, so he used an excuse to go out and find some kind of soup like wild vegetables. When there were no other people around, Siegel found that Kerry was pale and shivering. "I thought that today is the end, I was terrified." Kerry admits. "When I saw my father being swallowed up by the darkness, I felt that I could not escape bad luck. The death is coming; and when I saw the tent being lit, When I thought that Mesilla was still inside, I was desperate, just thinking about grabbing her body and then dying in flames. Only you are still fighting outside, so thank you for saving me and saving the entire tribe. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also saved Janet, isn't it?" Siegel said with a smile: "We are all survivors, so don't say so much nonsense." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The survivor, what a heavy word." Kerry looked down at the fire, then shook his head: "The living is higher than the dead, the father used to be so educated." I have always thought that the right to survive is above all else. Now I understand that it is because the living person has a greater responsibility and burden on the shoulder. It is like a mountain, so it is higher than the dead. Just a while ago, I I thought it would die under the impact of the cavalry of the Red Sun tribe. The only thing I can do is kill as many enemies as possible. Do you see our weapons and their gaps? I saw short bows beside their horses, and they can consume us by archery. In fact, red The Japanese tribes are not the most troublesome, like wild bears, broken bones and rushing. They have been suppressed by us, and maybe we are looking for opportunities to find us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
