			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the outbreak of the sacrifice site will sooner or later attract attention, so it is necessary to speed up the action. Siegel brought all of the 100 cavalry, plus more than forty dwarves who could ride horses, to form the assault team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Getting started," Siegel said to Mana. The latter immediately set fire to the soldiers and broke the tank in the siege car. Large bundles of firewood and sacks of sawdust were all thrown into the fire, and the efforts of the Southern Allied Forces for many days will soon be turned into nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis Master and his several apprentices, holding Serra first. That armor will also affect the ability of the surrounding mage to cast spells, so you can only leave by walking. When Sir Brown saw the half-elf mage leave, he went to Siegel and asked when the raid troops would leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master shook his head: "These people are not coming to put a fire." He looked at Brown's eyes with a majestic look, and said with a firm tone. "Tell me, where the lords live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown was taken aback, looked around the eyes and replied quickly: "They all Living in their tents is not concentrated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I knew they were not concentrated, otherwise they would not come here first." He patted his shoulder hard and sighed after two laughs: "It’s going to look at your appetite now. Which territory does the Leicester family look at? Tell me where the lord is, I will Make sure you do what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This?" Brown turned a lot of thoughts. He really didn't expect Baron Siegel to bring the troops to the Southern Allied Forces so easily. This is an opportunity, a rare event. He hides great ambitions in the depths of his soul, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since cooperating with the city of Miele, participating in this game, why not gamble bigger? Since Siegel wants revenge, let him go. What are those people who died with me? There are too many lords and too few castles in the South. Only war can make people who are stronger, smarter, and more able to judge the situation rise. He was already ahead when other lords were still resting in their dreams. Why not take big strides and keep them out of reach? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Baron Siegel, I have a suggestion." Brown took a moment and said: "It’s better to have the staff ready. I will light the warehouse first. Then they will I have to send more people to fight the fire, and the defense of the camp will be even weaker. My knight will lead you forward and completely overwhelm the entire camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel nodded and reached out and held it with Baron Brown. The alliance reached this. "Just like this, let's go," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The southern coalition’s camp alarm rang and screamed all over the place. The blazing fire and the clear slashing sounds continued to come, causing no small confusion in the night. Many soldiers hid in the dark shadows of the tent and shared tension with the people around them. They managed to courageously with each other, comforted each other and were able to go home alive and paralyze themselves for the same reason. Whenever there is footsteps close, they will grab the spears nervously and breathe. Keep an eye on the direction of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some old soldiers have encountered similar nights, and they know that the situation is not good. Every lord is looking for his own soldiers, and those in steel armor can't wait to take everyone in leather armor as a guard. Various versions of the news were flying around, and the conflicting orders exacerbated the chaos in the camp. The veteran simply grabbed a few of his fellow men and hid in a corner where the fire could not shine. While he was concentrating on weapons and armor, he waited and watched the situation and waited for an escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take those lords to die!" they said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim’s troops marched on such a chaotic battlefield, destroying all resistance along the way. The Brown Warrior’s human warriors set fire everywhere, and the Orcs fought side by side with the dwarves. This is rare in the history of the entire continent. They are strong and powerful warriors, one is rampant under the mad burning of war, and the other is relying on strong battlefield discipline to gain strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is at the forefront of them, in order to deter the enemy. He cast illusion for himself. The armor is covered with gray mud and red blood. In many places, there are burning black marks. The blue flame rises from the armor, making him look like a fire element, which is very obvious in the night. The silver-white long sword hangs down and there is constant blood dripping from the tip of the sword. The cloak has no wind and automatic. The sound of hunting is heard. Behind him, the white air that the half-orcs and the dwarfs spit out gathered together to form a cloud of clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana and her ten half-orc archers watched cautiously around them, and those enemies with slings and longbows were their primary targets. Although Siegel used dwarf runes to defend the arrows and constantly called for the elements to form a wind wall, they would still be damaged if they were attacked by the enemy with their bows and arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He led dozens of fighters to fight, the rest of the people divided into two teams of light rides, interspersed on the left and right sides. In addition to throwing torches, creating chaos and killing enemies, they continue to send intelligence to Siegel. The stone throwing workshop has completely become a campfire camp, and the fire in the warehouse has also burned. In order to be able to delay more people, Siegel put a fire in one or two stacks, forcing the Southern Allied Forces to save. The group led by the Baron Brown looked for beautiful tents and wooden barracks where the lords lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many lords are still wearing armor in a flustered manner, although the sturdy body armor provides good defense, but there are dozens of different parts of the belt that need to be tied up. The emergency is too late. Siegel chanted the spell, blowing the tent with strong winds, sweeping the food on the table onto the delicate carpet, and splashing the lord's body, they finished half the number of belts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I surrender!" The lord stood up and half of the armor was still behind him: "I ask for the treatment of the captives and the appropriate ransom."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I refused." Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana shot an arrow and hit the eye socket of the person, wearing it from behind her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good! When Sir Brown saw this scene, he only felt that his roots were cold and he couldn't help but take a breath. Fortunately, standing on the winner's side, you don't have to suffer such a fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of dignified people came over. They were a group of guards who walked with horses and had a coat of arms on their chests. This is Ampa. Family crest. They did not pay attention to the friendly forces who asked them for help. Everyone looked the same dignified. Look at the army of half-orcs and dwarves in front of them. They just returned from the task, so they wore neat full-body armor and stood out in a panicked camp. The lord of Ampa was in the barracks not far behind them, and had not had time to explain the completion of the mission. The panicked lords were on the battlefield - but they had just been riding the whole day, and important news was not reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Ampa Family Guardian Knight is a knight with a beard and a neatly tied beard. He took a deep breath, righted up the helmet, and slammed the sword. Yizheng’s words shouted loudly: “Invaders! Stop your steps!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and his men all laughed, not stopped. The pace is gradually accelerating. “Say well! We are the aggressors on our own land, specifically invading those uninvited eucalyptus heads!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dark vision, everyone has seen To the strong, beautiful barracks behind the group of guards, according to the Baron Brown, many nobles were there. What are the dozens of guards in front of the Cavaliers? The dwarves and the half-orcs are holding high arms and sipping and rushing upwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chong!" The knights turned over and the horses that had just rested for a little while under the command of the master, began to charge. Siegel recited the spell and applied fear on a large scale. Warriors who are full of fighting spirit will not be easily controlled by fear. But those tired horses are not like that. The knights suddenly found their mounts violently lifting their front stalks, or slamming the horse's head and becoming uncontrollable. They have to work hard to maintain balance and try not to fall off immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple javelins flew past, then Siegel’s lightning. Metal armor caused the power of lightning to increase, and many knights twitched and fell. Most of the horses are trained and will not be afraid in front of the flames, but they have never been trained to be familiar with lightning. Under the common control of dazzling flashes and fears, they confuse the ranks of the Guards cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hustle and bustle of the Hu Knight jumped off the horse and only had time to take the long gun on the saddle. Lost the rest of the equipment - including the bow, net, warhammer and shield. He turned and looked at the enemies in the blue flames, only feeling that his throat was tight and his lips were dry. He wants to call the charge, but he knows that the possibility of living in such a state is too small. There is no need to bind the comrades with the vow of the knight. Just let me rush up alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a determination to light the flint, stepping on the mud, flat-end long gun, close his mouth and rushed up, rushing to the person in the flame. For a moment, his brain was blank. No longer want to win or fail, live or die, give everything to the training of the temper, let the weapons lead themselves to storm forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
