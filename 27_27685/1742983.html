			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Knights finally settled in the cell, a temporary house built by the villagers with long strips of stone. The entire house looked staggering because no glue was used. When the wind blows, it is accompanied by a squeaky voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cell is like a rotten old man, and it may collapse at any time. What makes the prisoners fear is that the dwarves smashed them with chains. On the stone wall, and left a sentence: "If you force this chain, I promise that it will not fall off the wall, but the wall will not fall off the roof, I don't know."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc is responsible for feeding the more than a dozen captives. Every time he leaves, he will forcefully close the wooden door, and then the whole house will make a rumbling sound from the roof. A lot of dust fell on the top. After Turner and other people clashed, they dared to bow down to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ransom is handed over to Fazak, and Siegel will not do too much for it. The Knights' horses and weapons were handed over to the Orc patrols, and the big men were working hard to learn to ride and fight to form combat power as early as possible. "Siegel's Elemental Guard" encountered a bottleneck, and the research work on how to enable the Dwarf Runner to use this spell was temporarily suspended. Everyone tried their best to make the runes drive themselves. It was like an infinite loop with chickens or eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also gave himself a day off, which means that he does not spend too much brain power on spells and spells. Since Janet and Moore are not there, he made a simple breakfast for himself and then he treated the territory while smoking. Several peasants had contradictions for the division of the fields, and they came to the lord to make a ruling. Another family was rushed to the roof by heavy rain, hoping that the lord could send a masons to help him repair the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former quarrels and talks, until everyone has a stick on their legs before they can talk. “The farming of the fields has always been the responsibility of the villagers themselves, including the division and determination of the boundaries of the fields.” Siegel ignited the pipe and asked Fazak to record the order: “Verify the population and farmland reported by the villages not long ago, and give them the last The opportunity to report the real situation. As for the two quarreling farmers, because the village is not accompanied by the elders, so immediately rushed out. Let the elders find Fazak as soon as possible to explain the situation, and punish two silver coins." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers who need to repair the roof brought five eggs, which is something that he managed to accumulate. Siegel left one of them and rewarded the other four with their own bottle of wine. Give the masons who are willing to run. Someone took the job and believed that the roof could be repaired soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many trivial things to worry about, and in the future, with the establishment of the guards and the expansion of the castle, these things will increase. Fitzak is good at intelligence and accounting, but it is impossible to pick everything up. It is time to find a general manager. Where can I find it? The people who can serve as the castle's general manager are all trained by the nobility. In order to protect the secrets of the castle, they are all serving the same owner for generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the nobility, Siegel thought of the captives of his men. The Freedom Knights really consisted of idle descendants of nobles, all from the various lords of the South. Turner’s surname is Kuyi, his father has two castles and five sons, Turner happens to be the fourth; there are Siqi from the Mulun family, Sauber of the Blebar family, and the Meriville family. Mi Mi Mi and so on. The trickiest thing is that the archer Marana shot the horse and lost the life of the Uther family's Callent. He used to use the gold from the robbery to give his father a fourth wedding gift. According to Mana, it is a skilled young man. Riding and shooting were very good, but unfortunately encountered a full set of protective archers, completely useless. She was very worried about asking Siegel if it would cause him trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s answer is: “The dead bandits are never in trouble.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Lord Adults, there are two things that you need to decide.” Fazak stepped forward and said with respect and respect: “Your territory and castle need to be named. It’s always called the Heim hills that are not solemn. It’s just a ransom. At that time, the name of the territory will be called out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is convenient to change Heimqiu to Heim. As for my castle..." I thought about it and took the combination of the secret method and the Siegel word. "It is called Mire City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak then said. There are no more things today. At this time, Janet came in and followed her gnome "陂 duck" behind her. Siegel smiled and greeted him. He first embraced his fiancée and then looked up and down his good friend. In a tone of tone, he said: "How do I find out that after you have passed this time, walking has become a lot more balanced, but it is really a blessing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will return things back. I think the ransom of one thousand gold coins for everyone is a good start." Siegel said to the gnomes. "You used to say that I have been at sea for a lifetime, I can't find a beautiful wife. How is it now, my Janet is not very beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitten is blushing A little, I said that my body was a little tired, and I quit early. The gnome and her waved goodbye and said to Siegel: "I have to say that your fiancee is very mysterious. But she always gives me a bad feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You see all the people who are taller than you have a bad feeling!" Siegel did not care, said with a smile: "I invite you, except that I want you to open the grocery store to me. Besides, I want to learn a technique from you. What is the pure water filter that you made with ruby ​​(actually Yanshenjing)?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The thing is killing me." The gnome smiled bitterly: "It does work very well. Every day, energy sources continue to produce clean water that is easy to preserve. But every half month, you need to add it once. Gem powder. The water I sell is not enough to pay for the value of the gem powder.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And then you threw the thing?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity to throw it, I just sold it and gave it to an interested businessman. I finally earned the cost." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you draw the design out?" Siegel asked: "How about making a discount on a friend?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you spend money to save me, and then prepare to use the ransom of the free knight to help me build a grocery store, I only charge you money - parchment And the ink pen is enough. Then, what do you want this thing to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dwarf is currently studying a spell array, but can't let him I drive myself, so it's a headache. I remember that your device can do this, tell me there is a trick." Siegel said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ding Bao stepped back two steps, then laughed: "I didn't expect you to have a headache because of this, laugh at me, and say yourself all day long." Very clever! Of course, there is a flaw in it, and it is very simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around in the tent, found a blank stationery, and tore it up. "You see, whether it is a magical array or a rune matrix, there is always a long string of heads and tails that do not interfere with each other. The shallow control runes and the energy structure of the internal action are like the two sides of this paper, not Mix it up, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomish paper The strips are distorted, and then they are joined end to end to form a weird ring: "Look, there is only one side of this paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s Looking at the note in front of me, my mind could not turn for a moment. He draws lines on the paper with an ink pen. After reversing, the lines pass through all the faces of the paper ring and then end to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Control is the role, the two are combined into one." Ding Baoxiao said: "This method can do not reach the circular runes. Effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...but the runes don't work like this. The circular runes that are connected end to end are strictly limited. If you are not careful, you will You burned it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can lie to it with illusion, let Rune think that he is not a ring." The gnome grinned, nothing Great look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that your gnome is quite talented in illusion, but I have never heard of illusions that can deceive rune items." Siegel only feels today The new thought accepted made his brain crack, as if there was a new door in front of him, and there were some strange things inside. He took a deep breath and carefully looked at the twisted paper ring in his hand. After calming down, he said, "But I believe you can do it. Tell me how you used illusion to deceive items."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, it is not difficult to say." The gnome will carry his hands behind his back and shake his head like an old scholar, walking around in front of Siegel. "You know that sometimes the magic items detected are deceived by illusion, and you get the wrong conclusion, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
