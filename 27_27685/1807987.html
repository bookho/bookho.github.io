The wall behind the steam appeared a two-meter-high hole, enough for Siegel to pass through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xingsuo, remember, if the steam disappears, you should immediately notify me." Siegel said by subpoena: "If I have not yet, When you come out, you create a fine gold cylinder with a higher creation method and stuff it under the wall. Unlike other substances, the fine gold will not be dissolved in an instant, but you can hold it for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long can it last?" The sound of the star is shaking, apparently a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can stick to me, I will never be trapped inside." Siegel smiled and strode in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After turning around, Siegel took a deep breath, which showed a slight concern. Can you not worry? All the information about this place comes from the Green Dragon. It is said that the owner of the ten-faced scorpion is waiting for him here. There are important things to talk to. The Green Dragon is a friend that Siegel had known many years ago. He lived in the role of a shape-changer for many years in the Jackdaw tribe, but still cannot rule out that this is a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as it is still within the scope of the secret of the nuclear, even if Lear took him, there is no way. If there is a trap in front of him, specifically targeting his cage, using his curiosity to lead Siegel into it, this possibility does not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time travel is there, Siegel has seen himself in the future, and has seen books that have traveled through time. If someone returns to the past from the future and then lays out in advance, it can be said theoretically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you can do this, why not go back to the past and take your nephew when you don’t have a secret? Although there is only one present, the past and the future are endless, and every minute and every second represents a possibility. Siegel thought about a dizziness after a while, and there seemed to be many logical contradictions that could not be explained. If you can use your time travel spells in the future, then it is absolutely safe to represent yourself. At least until you master time travel? Things will be so simple? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among all the rules, the rules of time belong to the most difficult class, and Siegel just thinks about it. He knew that stepping through the Rainbow Light Wall was an adventure, because of the tension and more thoughts. He quickly adjusted his mood. Focus your attention on what's going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the wall is a forest, and then the forest disappears, but there are also grasses and the like, but on the other side of the wall is a complete wasteland. There is no grass here, and there are no things like moss and lichens. There are only stones, sand and dust in the area of ​​view. The only thing that is active is the smoke coming out of the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The thing is poisonous, twenty faces." An old male voice rang from Siegel's ear and almost shocked him. "Go along the rift valley on your right hand side and turn left when you encounter a road. You can see the cave where I live after about three miles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Can you see me, should you be able to hear what I said?” Siegel asked: “Do you know what I am looking for? It’s better to speak directly.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are afraid, twenty faces, this is a good thing, fear makes people focus and grow." The voice said: "You want to know the answer, you want to seek wisdom. But even the most Good things are also dangerous, not to mention wisdom and answers. What you want is only incomplete by ear, you need to use your own eyes. And I have nothing to ask, just want to see you with your own eyes, then know what I am doing. Everything, my dedication, my sacrifice, everything I gave up for it is worth it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice suddenly became sharp, angry and violent, It brought a sting to Siegel's ears. Along with this sound, a few pieces of raw stone scattered on the ground burst open, and scattered fragments of debris flew around. The poisonous gas that emerged from the ground also violently erupted, making a loud whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry. Twenty faces, I am so excited." The voice gradually recovered and became acceptable again. "Come on, I am here waiting for you. Remember. There are still traps set by them. You must only take the road on the left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK, I believe in you, the road on the left.” Siegel repeated: “If you want to go out, go back to the right side of the road?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel applied a protective spell to himself and summoned the esoteric rune guard to be by his side. Then he held the dust of the star in one hand and raised his bright wand in one hand to find the ramp leading to the depths of the Rift Valley. The terrain here is like the mother of the earth being torn by the hands of the giant, and the wounds left on the skin, broken and decayed are the only themes here. The rock walls on both sides are more than 20 meters high, and the outside light passes through the narrow crack at the top, and only a few can reach the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no living things around, and there are no signs of any living things. The elements are very dead here, and they only become active again when they are around Siegel. The new world is full of energy, and the elements are like boiling water; only those worlds that are about to die will be as quiet as ice. Within the scope of the Rainbow Law Wall, it is this kind of grave-like silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life and death are relative, and Siegel discovered it when developing cloning. The place where there is a lot of life is also prone to death, after all, the latter comes from the former. However, in this canyon in front of you, there is no possibility of the existence of a dead creature. Here is complete silence, the end point without any vitality, even the dead creatures will die in this environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in the canyon, except for the hard and crippled gravel, which is a lot of forked intersections. Every time Siegel meets the pass, he goes to the left and never dares to miss it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A lot of people have been here?" Siegel asked. But his voice echoed in the canyon and was repeated between the rocks, but there was no answer. Then, not his voice, nor the voice of the guide, just a few small and hectic scratches appeared, let him think of the mouse. It seems that the element of gas is also inductive. It raises the fist made of wind and clouds and slams on the ground. Numerous lightning chains are flying in all directions, just like the net under the power spider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of scratching disappeared, but the new voice sounded like a human whisper. Siegel constantly reminds himself that this is not true, and that it is reinforced with a spell that sees illusion and protects the mind. But the whisper did not disappear, but became more and more clear and more specific. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he heard the voice of the old captain. Accompanied by the sound of the waves hitting the bow, accompanied by the snoring of the mast after the drum was full, the sound that had been sleeping for a long time in the depths of memory reappeared in the ear of Siegel: "Squid boy, what are you doing, go Look at the whistle to see the direction of the cloud!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel raised his head subconsciously and saw a mast in the cliff, the familiar lookout is still the past The appearance of the rust marks caused by the wind and the sun and rain are no different. To think of that lookout, you need to climb and leave the current path. Siegel took a deep breath and closed his eyes, constantly meditation in his heart: "You are already dead, I see you are dead, don't use him to lie to me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the eyes were opened again, the captain’s illusion and illusion disappeared, leaving only the road that needed to go left, so he moved on. Why can you see the complete illusion instead of cracking the spell, why are you still affected by emotions? With all the senses, Siegel pays attention to the fluctuations of the surrounding elements, but they can still only find them like a pool of stagnant water. What kind of power has caused the opposite? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s divine power, child, you know very well.” Dr. Faranis sat in a cushioned rocking chair with a coffee table and a pipe on his hand. A light gray feathered falcon stopped on his shoulder and stared at him with bright yellow eyes. Siegel seemed to have some impression of the bird. In the orc territory, he looked up at the sky and flew over the falcon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, continue our course, dealing with the daily relationship between the gods and the territory." Faranis looked sly and raised his finger to the opposite seat. "Time is running out, come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel raised his hand and a bolt of lightning penetrated the body of Faranis and penetrated The illusion exploded on the back of the mountain wall. "The real bachelor will block this magic." Siegel shook his head and continued to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill stopped his way, holding a sword in his hand. Siegel was very impressed with this sword. His early dream was to have a sword that could really fight. Sir Bill lifted the shining sword to his chest and said, "I am very disappointed. Why are you going to be a mage? I have forgotten your knight's way!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel had just met Sir Bill recently. The teacher didn't mind if he learned magic. He only taught him to still use the rules of the Cavaliers to restrain himself and do good deeds, so in front of this Bill Sir It must be an illusion! The illusion of Sir Bill's sword slammed, and even a trace of wind could not be brought up. This level of illusion was too lame...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
