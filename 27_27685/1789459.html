			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laboratory door was originally closed, but it made a "beep" and the keyhole closed. The slight sound seemed abrupt and clear in the still room, and Reese looked up and looked at the direction of the door with a puzzled look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strange, which assassin will do this kind of thing, lock the door?" Reese waved his hand and first showed himself a defensive shield, then Stand up from the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seat shines brightly, and the second anchor spell manifests itself into three silver chains that hold his waist and block the ability to transmit space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who! Who made it?" Reese waved his hand and recruited the summoning staff placed in the corner. It is very convenient for a person who uses this staff to use the devil as a helper. Reese stared at Siegel and said evilly: "You have been in the lab, who came in and did all this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's me. Siegel smiled and replied: "I broke free of the chain, unplugged the dagger, cast magic, and set a spell. You are now smashed except for the hand, and only the ruined end is left."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a big joke." Rees showed the detection magic, but the magic items in the lab were many, and it was difficult to tell which one was a spell and which one was magic equipment. Suddenly, the entire lab was illuminated by a burst of dazzling light, and Ress was caught off guard, and was swayed into the eyes, hurriedly raising his hand to cover it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he doesn’t know that he has been attacked, it’s a fool. When he read a spell, there are seven or eight protective spells that light up from the body, and each one can win a situation. Living in the assassin's lair all day, he has already prepared for the sneak attack, and he can't think that he can sit back and relax because he is "useful." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel had long expected this, and he let the light aim at Rees, but he was not affected. Although the magical protection of Rees is basically simultaneous. But in fact, there are first and second. Siegel concentrated his mind and identified the protective spells he used, and what they did. In what order is the protection. Being able to know this will give him a big advantage in the spell showdown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gently shakes his hands and feet. It was liberated from the shackles. At the same time, his pre-ambushed curse energy ball flew out from the corner of the corner and attacked according to his orders. Spells and spells cancel each other out, and the elements have similar effects. Siegel chanted the spell with a soft voice and began to crack the protection spell of Rees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese opened his eyes vigilantly, and he was surprised to see the naked testicles standing on the cold floor. He exclaimed, pushed down the chair and stepped back, looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you looking for this?" Siegel picked up the obsidian dagger. There is still a flash of light on the handle of the silver smelting: "Seal: Elemental spelling, this is something that can determine the outcome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rees did not answer, his eyes were on Siegel, the obsidian dagger and the spell ball move back and forth. His eyebrows couldn't help but his fingers trembled, and it seemed that he hadn't awake from the shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light that dispels the magic flashes, and three layers of defensive spells are lifted at once. Rees never imagined this situation, because it means that the person who casts the magic spell is higher than himself in the spell. The same spell has subtle differences in the hands of different casters, which can affect the difficulty of dispelling magic. To improve the success rate of dispelling magic, you must first be familiar with the target magic, and then you must be able to pass the changes in the elements. Learn about their role in the spell structure before you can find these subtle differences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is still enough control over the elements. Siegel has already prepared materials with different elemental tendencies throughout the laboratory. It is to prepare for the magic of the spell ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss is still somewhat unbelievable, but has regained calm: "It seems that you have hidden a lot of strength, young mage. Who sent you? , Elf Saint?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, reached out and grabbed the air, and took the defensive staff in his hand. He hit a ring and put an opaque mage shield on himself. After all, the body is always not good. "The Elf Saint is not here, he is in charge of the other direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled, but what worried Rees was the confidence in his eyes. Although only a short day to get along. But Rees knew exactly what kind of mind the person standing in front had – quick response, active thinking, and amazing observation. It seems that it is a step mistake to show the colloidal warrior magic scroll in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you also thought about it." Siegel said: "By reading your scroll, I learned a lot. Especially your cast style and Magical ideas. What are you good at, what you are not good at, and what methods you might use to arm yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mage who can't keep secrets doesn't last long," Rees said. : "Congratulations on getting the first opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Siegel nodded lightly. The magic array that he placed around the lab came into effect, separating it from the outside environment. The general mages or pastors will not be aware of the things that are going on here, but they will not be able to win the sacred sacred person but he does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a very thoughtful mage, no longer serve the god of murder. Just stop using magic to persecute other intelligent life, why not join the Master now "Siegel said: "Only you can improve your research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me become a subordinate of Siegel and bring my own research results Reaching him?" Reese screamed: "I miss you! I will kill you here, even if I lose the template. I will dig your mind, absorb your wisdom, and make you my nutrient. Perfect my colloidal warrior!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am Siegel. Squid, you always want to kill and surpass people." The hand was on the face, revealing the original face. Black hair and black eyes have unparalleled confidence, and the power of magic surrounds him, forming a colorful band of light. Siegel gave him a simple salute, but his smile was no different from death. In order to provoke Rees, he deliberately said: "I am the one who laughs to the end and masters everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees Reese's face become like The dead body was pale, and then turned to blue. There was a fierce cry in his throat, and the power of the elements gathered around his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the bursting flame swept the lab, and Siegel immediately raised his hand to resist. He commands the elements to calm down and uses a unique technique to transform the flame ball summoned by Rees. The robbing of other people's spells is the unique ability of Lion King Alexander, but Siegel's strong form transforms the elemental energy of the opponent's spells. The fire elements of several key structures in the flame ball are transformed into water elements, causing the spell to collapse on its own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible!" Rees yelled: "You have not released the spell, how can you counter my spell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s deceitfulness, the more able to strike against Reese, the easier it is to defeat his will. This is not the fight between the two Shuhan, you are a punch, but the multi-faceted confrontation of the spirit, the mind and the knowledge. The young mage said: "In fact, you already know the answer in your heart, but you don't want to admit it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible, you can't have become a teacher." Rees waved his hands angrily and shivered from his throat: "You can't exceed me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desk in the center of the lab flew up, Come to Siegel’s head. The young mage lifted his staff and blew it into harmless pieces. Reese's arrogant voice penetrated the flying sawdust, and he held up the summoning staff and was singing a powerful spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is a master of the master of the spell, and recognizes the spell at a glance and immediately responds. One tries to open the channel and releases the devil of hell, and the other exerts a protective spell that reinforces the barrier of the mortal and prevents the devil from appearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A long sword stained with blood is sticking out from under the floor - the ground is not broken, the broken structure is the space. The long sword is followed by a black arm burning with flames. The twisted muscles contain the power of tyranny, which makes people feel very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come out, my servant!" Reese's face was as distorted as a hell monster. "Catch him, tear him apart, but leave his brain. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One shoulder squeezed out of the space crack, then half a head. The devil seems to be made up of lava, and his white hair in his mouth and eye sockets is like boiling iron. Just looking at it will make people's flesh like a half-burned by a soldering iron, not to mention the fear and shock that the ugly, sinister image brings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
