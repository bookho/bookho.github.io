			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel put his hands on the shoulders of two people and then recited the spell. The power of the elements forms a vortex that creates a spatial channel. He took the two to the past and went outside the castle in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transmission of the spell caused the reaction of the detection array in the castle, and some of the runes on the wall in the tower were lit up. The patrolling guard looked curiously at these runes, but did not know the meaning he represented. Only Viscount Plan frowned, and looked at the warning thoughtfully, then called the servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to Mrs. Dampia to see, bring the monkey in the cage, and say it is what I want." Then he called the knight The attendant, confessed: "Let the guards gather, gather at the door of the crying tower. Armed, put on the amulet, perform the arresting task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need to ride a horse? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this fog, your brain is broken?" Count Prang sighed and said: "Still take the horse, maybe Can be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people who left the dungeon landed in a farm and stood in the muddy fields. Not far behind you can see the vague shadows of several towers of the castle, and there are a lot of bells coming together. There were still some errors in the transmission of the spell. Siegel had to stop on the clean and avenue, but now he is standing in the mud, and the feet are entwined with the vines of the potatoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage Master, can you still identify the direction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female Mage with Iron Hold your knees and slowly get up. She looked around with an excited look and breathed the damp air in her mouth. When she saw the castle in the distance, the body could not help but tremble, and quickly turned her eyes away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You really decided to let me go?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you hand me the "Moonlight Moya", you can be truly free." Siegel said: "I will supervise you. The things that are owed to the Masters Association are returned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Master who can use the transfer, even in the Masters Federation, I have never seen you. Zhang face, I have never heard of it." McGonagall said: "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not important." Siegel said calmly. "You are going to continue chatting here, wait for the bells of the collection to sound, and the viscounts of Prang to chase them, or move on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will summon Is the phantom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out his wand and summoned three horses. He helped McGonagall to the horse. Let her lead the way ahead. As the control of Siegel's spells has increased, the power of the phantom has also been improved. The muddy ground does not affect it now, and even the swamp will not slow it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dense fog obscures the line of sight in front of the three. Black mud everywhere covered the road. The moon and stars in the sky are hidden behind the dark clouds, and it is extremely difficult to distinguish the road. Only people who are very familiar with the environment can find directions based on the growth of trees and the architectural features of the roadside. Others only have to get lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With McGonagall, there is no risk of getting lost, but the fog has seriously affected the speed of advancement. Siegel took out the core of the elemental runes. Summon two gas element guards, let them use the ability of the whirlwind, forcibly blow open the dense fog around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of gas are very hard, but they return that the fog here is extremely heavy, and it contains the power of magic, not a complete natural product. The two elements work together to form a whirlwind around the three people, but they can only sweep the space around the radius of ten meters, or ensure that there is no occlusion in the distance of thirty meters ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This and the distance barely meet the requirements of three people, although the phantom can not advance at full speed. But it can be a lot faster than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind element opens in front, and Siegel uses a wand to illuminate the surroundings. Ever since the Ghost Fog swallowed the wasteland, no one has seen the real environment under the fog for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being different from what everyone imagined, the swamp is not the kind of black mud, but the soft earth mixed with green moss. The moss has a pentagonal shape, no bigger than the gravel, and the stars are scattered all over the mud. When the horseshoes step on it, the moss will hide under the dirt, as if it had its own sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pulled out a plant with the hand of the wizard and carefully observed it. This strange thing has a part of the characteristics of the mushroom, with a slender, bearded hyphae under the foliage. Gently swing in the wind. The vibration it feels tries to curl up the body like a frightened animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what this is?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I saw it for the first time." Master Meg squatted on the back of the phantom, and looked at these strange with doubtful eyes. biological. “Ghost fog swamp is one of the objects of my research, but I have never seen it. But this soil is indeed a ghost fog swamp.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Isn't the swamp made up of mud and black water?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage Master shook his head: “That’s the periphery of the swamp. The depth is Another time. I rowed into the swamp's hinterland several times, originally looking for the legendary swamp monster, but I found nothing. But I saw that the swamp is full of life and the soil is fertile. If it is used to grow crops, there will definitely be Excellent harvest. Unfortunately, this fog always covers the sun, and there is nothing but some reeds, mosses and insects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Geer then asked: "I have encountered an expanding ghost fog swamp on the Cloak Avenue. It seems to be full of horrible things. Did you encounter any monsters when you entered?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some fish people, lizards, but they are concentrated in the periphery, it is easy to play "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no undead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magg shook his head and said: "Many people It is said that there are ghosts or sorrows in the ghosts and swamps, but many are legends and stories, and there is no actual evidence. The undead does have, but there is no necessary relationship with the ghost fog and swamp. At least I know that it is not because of the swamp that the undead But the periphery of the swamp does have the unique horror of the dead, like the feeling of the ruined cemetery in the dark night. This breath is like a very obvious warning signal, like writing a 'dangerous Don't enter the 'warning sign.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the ghost of the Morritt wilderness? Many people say that the monster can wear the victim's skin. Make-up travel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meggie Master snorted. "Do you believe this story? The monster in the human skin is actually the robber knight under Puland. The land area is reduced, there are not enough mushrooms to maintain normal business, so there will be The monsters attacked the caravan. Guess where the goods brought by the caravan went?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought of the rich food on the table of the Viscount, and thought of him. Hospitality provided by fine wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you increase the purchase price of the goods, you will always attract businessmen. Plane doesn't need to destroy all the merchants, just grab the richest ones. It is a good idea to push everything to evil ghosts and horrible swamps. The fog of the sky can always cover up the facts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel rides on the horse and clenches his fist. The lord like this is completely unqualified and lives like a locust on a corpse. Maybe before the ghost fog swamps, he can barely let the people under the control live a life, but now it has gradually become a robber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thinks about this problem along the way to avoid falling into the same situation. They marched in the fog for dozens of miles, and the swamp at the foot was able to flood the knees. However, the phantom shadow that the magic summoned ran easily, only falling into the depth of the horseshoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other roads to Meg's residence, but that needs to walk from the ridge, but also to go around the road, the Master does not like to go around the road, it seems It is the same as the ridicule of the ability of the spell. After more than two hours of trekking, they finally reached their destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage Master's house is a simple two-storey house built with stones and iron plates. The towering chimneys are on the sides of the house, one belongs to the kitchen and The bedroom has a fireplace and the other belongs to the Alchemy Lab. There has been a looting here, and many of the things in the house have been thrown out, and the furniture has fallen into pieces on the ground. All the doors and windows were damaged, and even many of the iron plates for reinforcement on the walls were removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage Master's items are all over the place, including clothes, food, and various cans. From the outside, there are scorch marks in the house that are exploding and burning. It seems that the people who searched also suffered a big loss and were not cleaned up by various magic traps. They also saw the bodies on the ground. Some of the cultured small animals, including cats, white rats and bats, were killed. Several stout pythons were also cut off, but only the snake head was seen, but the body was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
