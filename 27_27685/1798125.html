			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star whales stupidly go ahead and go straight to the "elemental elders". In its view, as long as the mouth is opened, the elemental elders are swallowed, and then the abdominal pain of a period of time is endured, and the body's strength can be absorbed again, and the body shape is further expanded. This is a big meal that you can't make a loss. It must make sure that the elders of the element don't be scared away before they arrive, or they are swallowed up by other astral monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then... then his second half is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star whales have no idea what happened, even a little pain, and the volume has been reduced by 60%. He looked around in horror and could not find traces of the attacker. Even if the power is in the astral world, will it leave a trail? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried hard to remember, only remembering the flash that was uploaded in the original direction, only a short moment, but the light is very dazzling. What is this, is this flash hurting yourself? The Star Whale writhed and re-condensed into the smaller one with the remaining 40% of the volume, and then quickly fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The follow-up attacks he envisioned did not arrive. Just as he was glad that he had escaped his life, the huge roar was late. The thunder of continuous sounds is like the roar of the god of war, with an imposing momentum, crushing the entire astral world. The Star Whale immediately speeded up, no longer dared to hesitate, and did not return to the depths of the stars. He didn't believe that it was just an elemental elder. It was definitely an abomination or a god (two powerful creatures of the outer plane, named after different ancestors). Today is a bad day! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even more strange than the Star Whale is Siegel, the performance of the Star World Virtual Cannon is completely unexpected. As the projectile continues to accelerate, the entire void gun seems to have increased its weight, and the floating island of the base that carries it is pressed out of the crack and collapses after launch. After that, the broken array is the transmission array, but the strength of the space in the shock does not spread far. It was dissolved by Siegel's spells. This time, the projectile left a long string of flashes and roars in the astrology, hitting the star whales with unstoppable anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projectile then produced an effect similar to the annihilation of the black hole, causing the back half of the astral whale to disappear. But in a creative place in the astral world, it is impossible to annihilate a black hole. The two rules are not compatible, which is why the Astral Whale does not know what type of attack they have suffered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of the "tear" of the projectile has been restored for a while. △ £ △ £, continue to scatter the brilliance of the spiral in the void muzzle. Siegel has repeatedly tested several rounds to determine that the virtual gun model is very stable, and the power and launch accuracy are guaranteed. As long as the duration of the transmission array is adjusted, the projectiles can be produced at different speeds, as well as the launch power and transmission frequency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded with satisfaction and then dissolved the astral void gun with elemental aggregates. In this way, even if someone wants to use the prophecy spell to reproduce the experiment, they can only see the erratic flow of countless elements, and can't see the virtual cannon. He ended the astral projection. Back in the city of Miele. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chiefs of the various factions all want to know what Siegel has tested, and all that is available is the rejection of the smile of the sergeant. "The idea of ​​a spell device is not yet fully formed. The creation of the astral does not mean that the real world has the same processing capabilities, and I am still verifying the effect of the spell."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also true, after all, the imagination can be very fine, but the hand of the processed item is not so accurate. And in Siegel's plan, the Void Gun is something to be equipped on the Lucky Sos, and certainly not only one or two. So he must find the right way to complete the physical manufacturing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth of a new magic device is not full of twists and turns. Thousands of failures will have a success, but this success will be enough to change the world. Siegel focused on the manufacture of his electromagnetic vacuum gun. The Federation is also working hard to make magical spaceships and trying to mass produce goblin explosives. William is still looking for Alexander everywhere, hoping that he can help the Federation to supplement higher spell data. Capricorn is still trying to fly to the West, and the Huanlong Mountains have already appeared at the end of the field of vision. It is estimated that there are only a few days left. The Mage Association has begun to operate near the crystal wall passages of the Eastern Continent, and the first wave of Pathfinder Masters has secretly sneaked into the opposite side. Collect information about that world. On the one hand, the elves cooperated with the Masters Association, and on the other hand, they also had a headache for the recent events in the hub. With the intervention of the dwarves, the human aristocrats and the merchants joined forces to try to overthrow the rule of the Starr family, so they wanted to maintain the hub. The management of the fort is getting harder and harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is Evan doing? According to the consensus reached at the Dwarf King Conference. The kingdom of stars should be the main force for exploring the "earth". However, Evan made up his mind as early as the meeting, the kingdom of stars must have the ability to control the situation, can not be dragged into the abyss of infinite war by the goblin. Therefore, he first dragged on for a period of time, and then began preparations for the wedding. Just as the dwarves and elves began to urge, a large lord raised the flag of rebellion very "reasonable". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are busy with serious things, some are busy acting, and in short everyone is very busy. In this atmosphere, time lapses, everyone thinks that their plans can be successful, everything can be developed step by step, but history tells the world over and over again that the only truth in the world that will not change is that everything will change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the day when Heim’s army began to change guns. The Federation has finally completed the mass production study of goblin explosives, reducing manufacturing costs to an acceptable level and not complicated to produce. The internal numbering of this formula and process is “No. 56 Alchemy Explosive Formula”, so the ammunition and weapon series produced by this method are numbered 56. In order to better allow the knights to accept such weapons, the craftsmen installed a long-range gun with a bandwidth blade under the muzzle, and said that this is the latest version of the plasma burst, which can be used for charge - this is Heim's collar. The famous "56 rush". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, this kind of weapon can only be equipped with less than 300 people. Only the most loyal knight can have this honor. Then Mike took these people to practice using the new equipment to verify that the tactics they had previously envisaged were effective. It is said that the dwarves have begun to equip such weapons on a large scale. Large-scale weapons at the siege level were also built on the basis of hand-held muskets. But because of the embarrassing status of Heim's collars and federations, whether they are dwarves, elves, school or wizard associations, they don't have to wait for the federation - so they can only rely on the news from adventurers and full-time spies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has his own intentions, he has long set the target of war weapons as magic spacecraft plus virtual air cannon. For regional strikes or siege-level battles, his unstable elemental aggregates can also play a significant role. The Cavaliers equipped with "56 rush" are mainly used to train more fighters, so that Heim leader can smoothly enter a new era and play a role in deterring the enemy and defending the territory. Siegel did not expect to rely on a warrior with the same level of weapons as the Goblin to conquer a goblin with a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another fall. It has been a year and a half since the meeting of the Dwarf King. The first magical spaceship of the Star Kingdom has been delivered and the second frame has been basically completed. As the Federation's manufacturing capabilities have been squeezed to the limit, even with the help of the "manufacturer" golem and the assembly line, Heim's lucky Soss is still not finished. Siegel has a dangerous hunch that is about to come, so he urged the Federation many times, hoping that they will complete the order for modular magic array parts as soon as possible. For a while, he personally started to lead the first generation of magic craftsmen to work as soon as possible on the assembly line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The busy life is exhausting, and Siegel is also divided to manage the territory and educate his son. He often uses deep meditation to replace sleep. This saves three to four hours a day. In the middle of the night when the moon was the most round of the moon, Siegel suddenly woke up from meditation, and an inexplicable heartfelt feeling caught him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical enchantment of Heim’s collar is exceptionally quiet and does not touch any danger. Siegel frowned. "Some of the prophetic spells?" His first doubt was Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After scrutinizing the fluctuations in the surrounding elements, there is no indication that the spell has been cast here. Just as he was puzzled, the whole Heim shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden earthquake awakened most of Heim’s people from their dreams, and the entire territory suddenly flew. Fortunately, the duration of the earthquake is very short. The whole time also shook a few breaths. This is certainly not a natural earthquake, because all animals did not have any signs before the earthquake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bad! Is it the underground volcano and lava that the statue of Rhodes said?" Siegel immediately got up. Commanding the lights to protect the family, then awakening all the earth element rune guards in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet woke up, but Isaac was still asleep, so he didn’t wake him up. "Siegel, what happened, why did the god of lights activate the protective spells in the room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am checking this. I am afraid of this earthquake. It is artificial. Fortunately, the duration is very short, and the intensity is not too big. There should be no great danger. The energy focusing array has begun to mobilize the strength of the earth elements and repair the cracks that may occur under the city of Mire. Patrol, I am waiting for their feedback."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. If this is the case, then you are busy." Janet sees no help, comfort After a few words of Siegel, I concentrated on comforting the children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about an hour, another earthquake occurred, with the same intensity and duration as last time. Since this time Siegel was prepared, the spells of detection and protection were running, so more information was captured. The power of the earthquake came from the northwest and the depths of the earth. It seems that apart from the rift zone, it should not be enough to cause damage elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
