			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s back is tied with a leather pouch, tied with thin threads, and the work is very rough. Siegel dismissed it and threw it out on the ground in order: Flintstone, a row of unknown beast teeth, two deep water city silver coins, a bright green feather, a withered blue Silver badge with color flowers and crows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear tip that killed his spear was made of stone, the work was rough, the traces of the polish were very new, but there was nothing special about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is nothing to look at, a bad luck. Maybe dying from a spear, perhaps dying from witchcraft, no one can say no." Going down, standing on the side of the body, the eyes looked around. "Since all are down, don't let him expose the dead wilderness. Let's dig a pit and bury it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel immediately promised that he Pull out the shrubs next to it, revealing the soft soil below, and start to dig the pit with gloves. The troubadour also came to help. Jarrell suddenly took the initiative to work, and this strange move caused Janet's suspicions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They worked hard for about an hour before they finished this thing. When I returned to the Rift Valley, the clouds had gathered in the sky. On the west side of the horizon, you can faintly see a few black tornadoes, wrapped in lightning and unscrupulously twisting in the air, releasing devastating power. The air will be moist and cool in a short while, and it is estimated that there will be a heavy rain soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's hurry to find a place to shelter from the rain." The poet said: "And the heavy rain in the tornado sometimes hits over. Like a slap in the face, it is very unbearable. I suggest that we still go back to the ruins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and several people quickly walked back . The troubadour poeted off first, and he rushed back to support the canvas and ignite the bonfire. Siegel let Janet sit on his own, holding the injured horse and walking slowly behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still thinking about the body, so terrible. Who do you think killed him?" Janet asked. I don't know. The spear and the missing internal organs make me feel uneasy. Whispered: "The crow in the sky, the crow under the body and the crow in the pocket, this should not be a coincidence. Or the soul of this grassland is guiding us, let us find the body. But what is its real purpose? So? Let us find out the murderer, or just remind us of the danger here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, we will not psychic spells, can't find someone to ask Ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful. After I entered this grassland, there was always a feeling of discomfort, as if there was a kind of power that interfered with my mind. I always feel nervous. So the kitten, you must help me to look at my back, I am also optimistic about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenite is a little bit harder Head, hum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two returned to the ruins, the rain has not yet come down, the air has become more boring, and people are breathless. They found the horse of the troubadour next to an abandoned tower. Jarrell found this place to shelter from the rain and ignited a bonfire inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pasture burns quickly, and always produces a lot of smoke, very horrible. Siegel cut the branches of the shrubs with a machete and piled it aside, leaving it as a spare fuel. Janet flexibly climbed the broken wall of the collapsed building and propped up the canvas at the lee to form a simple roof. The singer poeted the dry meat with a whistle while blowing an unknown song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the rainstorm is approaching, the horses start to tremble, slamming their heads violently, kicking the ground on the ground and making a nervous roar. Janet hurried down and went to appease the horse. She seems to have a strong affinity, always able to quickly calm the animals. Although the horse looked listless and very reluctant, but finally began to obey, standing on the side of the tower to avoid the wind, no longer calling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this weather so bad?" Siegel stood up and looked around. He saw the heavy rain in the distance, pouring down from the dark clouds and completely obscuring the horizon. In the rain curtain, there is a huge shadow, like a lizard crawling on the ground, the tail straight up, and the lightning is kept on. From the distance, there was a loud rumbling sound. I don’t know if it was the sound of the Thunder or the stepping sound of the lizard. Siegel blinked and found that the lizard had disappeared, and only the endless rain was forced to the abandoned tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
