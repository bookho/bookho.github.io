			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire cast a swaying shadow on the wall and shocked Siegel. He looked at it carefully and found that it was just his own projection. ‘What is nervous, shadow! ‘Siegel cursed, adjusted his mood, relaxed his breath, and concentrated his senses on the surrounding environment. He stalked the little parcel and got closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the top of the head began to bang again, and the channel was accompanied by the scream of "Don't ~~~Help!~~~". The troll was woken up, sneezed, rubbed his nose with his hand, and his eyes were slowly opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel desperately, pick up the parcel and return to run back. He kicked the bottle on the ground and made a squeaky sound, which made his heart rate instantly high, and he could not help but speed up a few points. The trolls looked up and almost saw Siegel disappearing into the corner. At this time, a tied man slipped from the passage and threw himself to the ground. He struggled hard, and the bottles on the ground swayed and made a lot of noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two trolls sat up, staring at the fallen man with ugly and huge eyes, and then said a few words. The man tied up was terrified, and the whole body couldn’t stop shaking and snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, what good have you done?" A trolline began to use lingua franca, although it was still heavily doped with a strong nasal and molar sound, but Sig I finally understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I... I stole the silversmith of my wife, took it for money, and was caught." The man said intermittently with a trembling voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This story is not good, let's eat him," said a troll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t worry, let me ask, he must have done more than that." The other turned and said, "You will do it." Is this a bad thing? This story is not enough to break your teeth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I still..." The man could not move his hands and feet on the ground. Distorted like a cockroach. The trolls stepped on a big foot and the man couldn’t struggle at once. "Speak your story!" shouted the eater. Under the fear of death, the people who were tied up began to talk nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not only this story, of course not only..." The man said: "I think... I am the lady's groom, but I don't work all day. Concentrate, always make mistakes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is wrong with the point? This story is not good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... Ah, there are, of course, there are good. The reason for my mistake is that I have an idea for the lady. I have a lot of ideas about her, and not only have ideas, but also started." "The man began to make up the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two cannibals sat down with great interest, holding a huge glass of wine in their hands, and sipping a swig of ale Listen to his story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story is getting more and more outrageous, and the groom is a big bad guy in the story. He raped his wife who was kind to him, killed her family in person, held hostages against the guards of the town, and then slaughtered the hostages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you get caught?" The slayer looked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When... of course being sneaked!" The storyteller quickly filled the loophole. "It was the lady who sneaked from behind, and the monk hit my head. Look, I have a wound here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the head of the groom There is a large area without hair, but it is not a wound, but a mole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a sobering adventure story!" The two trolls said: "If you want to join him, I like this villain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, okay! I want to join you!" The man shouted: "I am very willing to be your companion!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will take him to the commemoration ceremony, you will pack the chicken in the bag, and then come to have breakfast together." Another eater sucks his eyes and stands up, his whole body The meat is shaking with it. He smiled and said: "Today, you can change your taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel witnessed all this and he was so nervous. ‘Let’s go, you stupid, you can’t save him. He said to himself, there is nothing to see, you are not the opponent of the troll. He thought so when he took the contempt. When he pulled out the scimitar, he changed his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I want to try! ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He secretly looked at the trolls in the room, and the situation is right. The huge humanoid monster is facing away from Siegel, blocking the front of the campfire. He was making a groaning noise and pulling his hair from the chicken with huge fingers. The slayer is completely unaware that there is a hidden killer behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel picked up the bow, and then thought about it, and found that the short scorpion is likely to shoot the thick skin of the eater. He put down his bow and held a machete in his hands, walking towards the back of the eater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster didn’t notice it, it’s good news for Siegel. He aimed at the direction of the heart on the left back of the monster - Siegel guessed that the heart of the monster should be in that position and then slammed it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect this to be cut down on the bones, the scimitar was bounced off, just padd a hole behind the trolls, let it shed a yellow-brown blood . The trolls screamed and turned to see the enemy attacking him. He yelled angrily, ready to stand up and fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not expect this to be the result, but he did not panic. ‘If you can’t do it, come back! He lifted the scimitar again, and this time he slashed at the waist of the eater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoiding the shoulder blades and ribs, the blade smoothly cut through the skin of the trolls and went straight into the internal organs. Even for the trolls, which are thick and hard, and hard to bear, this is unbearable. It erected the elbow and swung back hard, aiming to fly the thief behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel only felt the wind blowing, a short stature and hiding. He made a rollover to avoid it, and the hard-working elven war dance played a role this time. Siegel’s flow of water generally took the right pace, still staying behind the trolls, and seized the opportunity to cut a knife at the ankle of the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This failed to cut his right foot, but it also made the ogre action unbalanced. The monster tried to stand up and tried to turn around with the good leg as the axis. It clenched his fists in both hands, giving him enough strength to prepare a critical strike for the sneak attacker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kesigel did not stop, he was like a fallen leaf, with the wind of the trolls, the lightness kept behind the enemy. He took a few knives on the thighs, knees and back to give the shemale. The trolls are furious, and they turn left and right, but Siegel can always stay behind the monster. After dozens of knives have been cut down, even if the resilience is strong, the trolls are hard to parry and the strength is getting smaller and smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the battle can be divided, the trolls no longer turn around, but rushed to the wall and slammed on it. Siegel understood its purpose in a single moment - as long as it turned around against the wall, it would be impossible to continue hiding behind it anyway. He thought of this, quickly retreated, and scorned from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squeaky laughter in the throat of the trolls, back against the wall, turned proudly. He knows that he can rest for a while, and his wounds can be recovered. And as long as you catch the little thief, eat it and eat it, you can heal the injury, but also the heart of hate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally saw the sneak attacker, a strong young man. Then I only felt the light flashing, and the eye sockets came from the pain of the heart. One eye was shot directly by the sputum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, ah! The trolls shouted, and they did not take care of the bleeding wounds. They danced their claws and rushed up in anger. Siegel had no time to re-wind, and he could only take the bow and pretend to aim. He shouted: "One more eye!" The sinister believes it, and raises his hand to cover the only good eye, blindly rushing forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel threw the bow to the head of the eater, rolled from the ground, picked up the scimitar, and gave the eater a knive . The trolls have no matter what they are, just thinking about killing Siegel. He completely ignored his injuries and pains, and took advantage of his ability to recover in the morning and evening, and he was desperately trying to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows that if he is more than endurance, he will die in the hands of the trolls. He is currently feeling exhausted, but the monster still has strength. As long as you wait a little longer, Siegel may no longer be able to keep the elf dance. The human body could not stand several times under the hammer-like fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
