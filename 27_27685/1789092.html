If all those who have hatred of me come together, they can form an alliance. www.xshuotxt/com" Rees Don't care, use a knife to scrape down the sika's disguised beard and bring a layer of paint. He put the knife in his mouth and tasted it, then excitedly said: "Sure enough, as I expected, this is the technique of the dark fire sniper spies. But I have never heard of the dark fire, there will be a fight?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to dispense the pharmacy, and his mouth sang a strange little tune. The "dead" lying on the anatomical bed shook a few times and even gave a bloody cough. Reese walked over without hesitation, picked up the axe next to him and slashed it, and his head fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can't bother me to sing." Rees continued to work in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is purely a madman. Siegel's wrists were dark and the iron rings that make up the chains were entangled, twisting them together like a lever. If it is possible to reverse the wrist like Janet, she can make the palms thinner than the wrists and easily break free from all kinds of bindings. Siegel tried a variety of methods, including the sailor knot is useless, until the force field spell can block the strong kitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and ordered himself to calm down. When he opened again, he regained his state and his mind was concentrated in the current environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special solution for makeup remover was quickly prepared. Rees poured the solution into a smudge-filled rag and then wiped Siegel's face hard. The bloody smell of the monk went straight into the nose of Siegel, and there were a few more suspicious pieces between his lips. Fortunately, they all spit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this face looks familiar, I must have seen it." Rees wiped out most of Siegel’s makeup and thought hard while The place is coming and going. "You are the friend of Evan, the one who took him out of the cave. But the color of your hair and eyes did not change the color of the hair and eyes when Siegel left the Morah, and Rees had never seen it. His true face. Haha, I know this must be right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and then he got three knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are still alive? I remember you fell off the cliff. Just died next to me." Rees said: "I remember taking off your clothes." I also threw you into the waterfall in the mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My life is hard," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Life is hard," Reese patted her hand like a happy child. "Life is a good thing. You can make more clay warriors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of use is that kind of thing? Awkward, easy to deal with. Don't Say a warrior like me, only the ordinary cavalry is a charge, then the stuff will fall into pieces.” Siegel smiled and said: “You can print the martial arts into the muddy brain, and you can’t The reaction on the spot is given together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right." Reese doctor squeezed his chin: "It seems that you are very vulnerable to the vulgar warrior's weakness." Be careful. But you have to admit it anyway. This kind of thing is an epoch-making initiative!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the pride of Dr. Reese, Siegel knows What kind of method can be used to deal with him. "Well, I admit that I have never seen anything like a clay monster. You can make so many, but they are equipped with shoddy armor. Let me guess that the cost of each clay man is very low, low to you. I am too lazy to equip him with equipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, of course, the glue is just a waste"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "As a consumption, it is really not enough." Siegel said: "The real consumption of the elements of the Heim collar cluster. Under the power of the Faction, hundreds of elemental warriors rushed to the enemy, forming an endless stream The offensive. That is really powerful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elements are powerful, but the Hem’s tactics can only be used for defense, without the ability to attack. Rees shook her head and her expression was very convinced: "As long as there is a better template, I can make a better glue. The elements are always the same, and the glue can be upgraded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Difficult, difficult, difficult." Siegel sighed: "Your glue Technology is certainly not complete, I have seen its biggest drawback "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;This pain only makes Siegel scream, and relentlessly screams: "You can only use humans as templates to make clay warriors? Otherwise, you have long used ogre, giant, or centaur, is it better? Good choice?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “That’s right. You are smart, I want to leave you as an assistant.” Reese jumped and jumped. "I can finish such a feat one day, hahahaha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a small problem," Siegel said: "If it is a dragon, he You become a human figure, or you are deformed into an adult shape. Can you use him as a template?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rees stunned and looked at Siegel without moving The eyes looked at the front with a sluggish look. After a while, he woke up, then came over and embraced Siegel, and left a saliva on his left and right cheeks: "You are the smartest guy I have ever seen. This idea is really good. Their Although the body is human, it is actually much stronger than ordinary humans! The value of utilization is higher. What about their martial arts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still I don't understand how you managed to transfer martial arts. How can you answer your questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's better for us to make a deal." Rees said: "I I want to borrow your good brains and help me think about my ideas. As long as your ideas can satisfy me, I will guarantee that in the course of the experiment, no matter what happens, you will not feel the slightest pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's better to let me go directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, I am not stupid," Rees said. . "Accept my condition, or not accept, only these two choices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I should be a good start." Low profile, let Rees in the control position, but from time to time to challenge, so that he has been providing intelligence. "You say, I am listening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My technique combines Knox's mind control spells, blood magician's blood transfer, and the Master's Association. The magical figuring technique is quite complicated to explain.” Rees took out four large scrolls and placed them in front of Siegel: “I need several hours to prepare the solution and prepare for you to become a template. This scroll you Look at it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just a swordsman, how can I understand it?" Siegel deliberately said: "Do you not understand yourself? So, throw this thing at me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, no one can understand this thing, even the blood magician can't see the whole picture. If he can understand, he will not force the blood transfer and strengthen the attempt, and almost killed my experimental materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean Two princes, Evan and Aaron?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two princes? Hahaha." Rees said: "Before the blood magician. There is only one prince. Although Evan is an illegitimate child, there is no star. The blood of the kingdom. The blood magician wants the blood of the royal family to add, and also wants the power of the divine and the power of the devil to coexist, so the blood of these people are all mixed together. He thinks too much. The result is to put his own strength Used to maintain a fragile balance of the law, it will make you a martial art ruin. It is me, and today I can only transfer the blood of Aaron’s royal family to Evan. The fate of the starry kingdom happens at that moment. After the reversal, Evan also had the opportunity to touch the position of the king who belonged to Aaron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this all done by you? I don't believe it." Geer's two voices: "I haven't seen the change of blood. How can it lead to the change of the throne? You are just a coincidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be a kid You are just a layman in the field of spells, you don't understand the mystery." Long sighed and said: "Now only two or three mages can admire me, others are not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to listen, The powerful Master of Rees and the people who admire?” Siegel’s eyes kept looking at the scrolls on the table in front of him, but his mouth did not stop: “You just said about the technology of the Masters Association, then you must know the Lear’s prophet. "Does he count as one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lonely ignorance, Master Lear is a student of the city, although it is also part of the Masters Association. But after all, it is different. Rees said as he dispensed the pharmacy. "Come, this is a good guess. Who else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
