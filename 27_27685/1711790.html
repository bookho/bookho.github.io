			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet fell asleep, but Siegel had a lot to do. He walked over to the robe caster who was killed by the wand and examined it carefully. This man is wearing a robes naked, his clothes have neither pockets nor accessories, and there is no tattoo on his skin. It can be said that there is no clue to his identity. His muscles are dry, the joints are prominent, and the blood vessels bulge under the almost transparent skin, like a curved shackle, very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel opens the palm of his hand, swaying from his fingers, and then smelling under his nose. He smells a mixture of sweet and foul-smelling powders, which are the flavors of various casting materials. In addition, a bloody smell flutters on the tip of the body's fingers, like the smell of a butcher or a scorpion, like blood magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel abandoned the body and began to inspect the room. Judging from the furnishings on the ground, the table here was built in a very long time, but the newly built blood trough on the ground is not. At most, only a few months, Siegel can also find clear traces of carving. There is a layer of slippery material on the bottom of the blood tank that keeps the blood from solidifying during the flow. The blood of the morning guards was led to the dragon skull on the table under the influence of this battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does a skull need to do with blood? Siegel is very curious. He used a spell to look at the magical traces around him and found that the skull was intermittently exuding a strong aura, bright and dark, as if the heart was beating. The brilliance of the brilliance, but did not give any sense of danger, Siegel felt that it was born with vitality, like the seeds that are about to sprout, the eggs that are about to hatch. Siegel has difficulty judging the level of this magic item, but its performance is absolutely very powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop the spell, the magical aura disappears, and the giant bones are still quietly placed on the platform. Siegel didn't dare to touch it directly with his hand, so he used a wand to smash it. The skull swayed, with no magical reaction, like ordinary decorations, just like the animal specimens hanging on the wall by the aristocratic bureaucracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who guards the blood sacrifice with the morning sun must be an enemy, and it is generally correct to destroy what the enemy wants. Siegel knows that the requirements of the magic array are precise and stable, and the movement of the core items will definitely destroy the effects of the spell. He estimated the weight of the skull by the touch of the wand and then extended his right hand to prepare the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When his hand touched the skull, the change occurred. The original hollow eyelids on the skull blazed, the bones became crystal and round, and a layer of pale pink light flowed over the surface of the skull, showing the dragon's muscles, skin and scales. The skull floated and turned to Siegel's direction, and two flaming eyes focused on him. A voice that only heard in Siegel’s mind: “Who are you? Why is the blood of Taikoolong?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel feels a magical The tremor spread through the blood vessels of his body, which in turn controlled his muscles and bones. His tongue involuntarily said the truth: "My name is Siegel - squid." But whether he has the blood of Tai Gu Long, Siegel himself does not know the answer, so he can't answer this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's flame flickers like it is blinking. His voice is curious and seems to have found something fun: "Strange people, why is your blood unity changing? Dragons, Titans, gods, and shadows, your blood is ever-changing, but not constant. What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel swallows, the dragon's deterrence makes him only tell the truth: "I cast a spell called blood. The secret key can deceive any item that needs blood circulation to use." He is about to continue to say that a strong sense of hunger suddenly comes up, just as he gets rid of magic every time, Siegel's magic Resistance works again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curiosity of the dragon is even higher, but his pride makes him not use the magic again to trap Siegel. "Interesting young people, interesting magic. Why do you wake me up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I definitely don't have this idea." Siegel said: "I don't know who To wake you up, but this person killed four morning guards and watered your skull with their blood. And these morning guards protect the people I am looking for. Can you understand what I mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand, little guy. Tell me, what are you going to do next?" The flames of the dragon's eyes became thinner and brighter, just like picking up same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't want to do anything with you, I just hope you don't help my enemy. But those guys want to use what you do, don't do it!" Geer thought about it and said to the dragon: "I also know some techniques for using magic to display magic, but that is all my own blood. It is evil for the guy here to make the circle with the blood and life of others. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarves I know are pretty good, passionate, serious, and very easy to get along with." Siegel tells the truth, there is no idea to lie to please the dragon: "I have only seen a red dragon, he burned down. My brother's tribe killed countless creatures. I don't like it, but I forgive it. Because I know that the dragon was riding by a death knight, and the killing of the village may be the order of the death knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant faucet bone flies high and trembles fiercely: "Dead!!" His voice roared in Siegel’s mind, like a thousand Lightning falls at the same time. "The dragon will never obey the dead spirit! Forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was slammed and wowed a blood. He repeatedly stepped back and regained his balance. The dragon skull also noticed this situation, gradually stopped the shaking, and slowly drifted from the height to the platform. He weakened the strength of the soul message and continued: "Little Master, you are too weak, but the potential is good. I am the Taikoo dragon, Long Kelga, the father of the dragon and the mother of the dragon. Every piece of my scales Become a dragon, every bone is turned into a kind of magic, every drop of blood ignites a soul. I am powerful and knowledgeable, you wake me up, it is necessary to reflect my value. Say, little wizard, What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stared at the dragon's flame eyes for a long time, then looked at his head and thought about it for a while. When the dragon was about to be impatient, Siegel rubbed his hands and smiled and said, "Can you help me save my companions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You want this thing? You can have wealth, knowledge, strength, power, but you want me to do a slave to you. I am a Taikoo dragon, my strength is beyond your imagination, you Is it a fool?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To tell you the truth, dragon. Say I don't want anything, it's hypocritical." Siegel shrugged his shoulders. It looks very relaxed: "But after you just denounced the dwarf's greed, I also asked you some non-pointing requirements. That is a fool. What you said: Power, I am not very eager Maybe I will want it later; strength, I don't know what the essence of power is, not very conceptual; knowledge, I really want it, but I like the process of learning, so I don't want to bother you; wealth, me I have seen incredible wealth. I was able to overcome the temptation of wealth at that time and be able to respond with a normal heart. So I decided to make a small wish to help others and help myself - help me save my companions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon laughed, The sound echoed in Siegel's mind, but it didn't hurt people. "You little wizard..." The dragon said with a smile: "Since I was born, there are a few fools like you? There are not a few, few, little Master. So, once again, I am Taikoo. The dragon Long Kelga, a poor creature who was made into a dragon horn after death.” The fascia bones swayed up and down like a nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel-Squid, a sailor, knight and apprentice mage, is honored to meet you." Siegel bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry that I can't fulfill your wish, apprentice mage Siegel. I have memories, so I can give you knowledge; I also know the location of the dragon treasure, So strength and wealth can be satisfied; I can let the descendants obey your orders, so the power is also at your fingertips. But I am also trapped here, as a bait to attract other dragons into the trap, sad and painful torment, can only Let people enter, can't make people out, so I don't have the strength to help you out with your companions. But if you listen to me, I will tell you what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Siegel nodded and thanked the dragon for his help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My consciousness can be spread throughout the fortress, I saw a powerful blood mage has come to the end of life, but he wants to use his magical power to deceive death He now has the blood of the true king, the blood of the golden dragon, the blood of the light, and the blood of the mortal, but he also wants to get the blood of the ancients from me. He wants to change the fate by rewriting the blood. You have a special The ability to break away from magic, but this ability has limits, you can't fully expect it. Every flesh and blood is fragile in front of the blood magician, so you need help. I will give you directions, in this city. There is a wisdom golem, he may be able to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I will try it." Siegel said: " Can you take care of Janet after I leave? And, please don't help the blood mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You wake me up, others can't control me But you must not fail because the blood mage can pass I command you to come, he is a master of playing with blood, no stranger to manipulate people. "Dragon skull on the back landing platform, two eyes in flames die down. He passed the map of the dwarf cave to Siegel's mind and re-disguised it as a quiet skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
