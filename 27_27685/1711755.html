			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines through the gaps of the velvet curtains, and the air mixed with the flowers and fragrances also flows in with the wind, and the incense and ink fragrance compete for the dominance of the sense of smell. . Outside the door, a knock on the door sounded, three long and three short. Then there was the sigh, the sound of the tray on the ground and the footsteps of a person leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel slowly woke up and only felt backache. He studied spells too late at night, and fell asleep on the table. Standing up, I stretched out. The black tea placed next to the table has cooled, but Siegel doesn't mind, pick it up and drink it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a three-story building in the northern part of Deepwater City, with its own garden and stables, just next to the "Three Peaks Tower" of the Masters Federation. A quiet place where few people come. The original owner here was a businessman named Dip, who was later taken away by the wild man in the north of Deepwater City. After the bankruptcy, he died of a heart attack. His widow wants to sell the house and pay back the debt so that the child can continue to receive education. It was the time when Siegel came to buy this place under the matchmaking of Marcus-Gonen (the owner of the bubble barrel pub). After hearing the story here, he kept the poor widow to stay here, on the grounds that he wanted to learn the spell himself, so he needed someone who could be responsible for eating and cleaning. Mrs. Linda Dipp was very grateful and promised to keep her duty, so she moved into the servant's room and stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deepwater City Masters Federation has always been an open and inclusive organization that has helped all Masters who have come to the New World. Here is the most important transmission array on the New World, which can be connected to the Supreme Library of the Old World in an instant, which is the core of the Masters Association. Therefore, when necessary, the Federation can get strong support from the Masters Association, and no other forces dare to move hands and feet here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this kind of enthusiasm, the Masters Association opened the "Study Salon", which opened the way for beginners who are interested in mastering magic. The price of learning is very expensive, and it is a very loose form of self-study. It is only a fixed time to organize some masters or bachelors to teach classes every week, and teach the apprentices to get started as soon as possible. There is also a regular salon event where apprentices and new wizards can exchange experiences and promote magical learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has sufficient financial resources, so it is easy to get a name and get books and experimental materials related to the course. Learning at the beginning was very difficult. After all, Siegel had never been exposed to formal education, so he needed to tutor too much. Accurate pronunciation and correct writing, preliminary calculations and classification methods, a large number of material properties and animal and plant illustrations. For those aristocrats with good family, this is the knowledge that they can slowly master during their growth. Siegel needs to learn quickly in a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in addition to one hour of high-intensity physical exercise every day, Siegel spends all of his remaining time learning. With the tenacity of training at sea, he spent two months to fill the foundation, can understand the elementary course, and quickly learned the language of the dragon - the language used by humans to recite magic spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week ago, in an important course, the official wizard of the Federation taught the spell "Calc Interpretation". Its role is to create magical spells on paper, and all wizards must learn this spell, which is the basis for learning and transforming magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a long time to master this magic, and then practiced continuously, using the "manipulation interpretation" to learn magical textbooks, has been busy until late at night, and finally completely Master this spell and become an apprentice mage. This means that he can learn to learn spells by reading other people's magic books, which is already a simple introduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, he was excited for a long time. There are two spells of the primary spell in his hand, which are the items of the Knicks in the Knox. He also found a spell in the Rubik's Cube, but now I can't understand the spell above, so I can only let it sleep in the key space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has been practicing basic magic through two primary spell books. He has amazing savvy and learning ability, and he has misunderstood and cast spells, and his body and mind are ready. In the absence of knowledge, Siegel began to use the deep waters to contact the spell, and in less than four months, he was able to perform multiple basic magic. This speed is unprecedented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not care about his own record-breaking things, still immersed in magic learning. He and Linda had a prior agreement to send breakfast every day, but if you didn't open the door, you only need to put the tray outside the door, and you can't push the door in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
