			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The library’s reading room was smoky, and Siegel’s pipe glimmered with light, reflecting on his serious face. At present he has come up with two ways to treat Janet, but neither method has a great grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replacing Janet with his own blood, this crazy note emerged in his mind. Through Isaac's physical characteristics, Siegel knows that the descent's lineage has no effect on his own weird ancestry. The son is completely a replica of himself, and all physical features are not related to the devil. So he thinks that his strong blood power may be used as a prescription. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Eld, the elf pastor of Rhett and Mother Earth, has no hope for this method. "Someone thinks the risk is too great, and the body and blood will be mutually exclusive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbott said: "I have seen evil blood magicians take Innocent villagers do such experiments. Even with superb magic, the bodies of the people who are being tested gradually become necrotic, whether it is internal organs or skin, first all kinds of pustules, and then lose vitality. You must not do such cruel things!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel promised two priests, so things went back to the blood magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to look for various spells of blood magic, hoping to find out the relevant information of that magic array. It is very rare to extract blood from the body, condense it and then strengthen and replace it. He rummaged through the library, thick materials from the table to the ceiling. Whether it is ordinary blood magic skills or only the theoretical prototype of the spell, or even a paragraph in a blood magician's notes, he carefully scrutinizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congrave as the founder of the blood magic spell series, his ideas have been expanding and refining in the later years, just like trees. Leaves, open different flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many spell spells are recorded as a complement to the power of the Masters Association. Even if some of these spells are weak and difficult to perform, they are not worth learning, but they cannot deny the value of the ideas and thoughts they carry. Siegel gradually grew from the stage of mastering the spell to the extent of mastering the method of thinking. Embarked on the right path of understanding and transforming the world with ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines of blood magic meet in his mind to form a clear map. Many clues point to a collection of spells called "The Book of Moonlight Moya." It is said that this is a travel expert's way of encountering a blood magician underground organization, being plundered and practiced. Fortunately, after taking the escape, the volume book, which contains many secret spells of blood magic. The book is collected in the Masters Federation, and there is a copy in the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel found a lot of things based on the reading notes of other mages, especially the records of some prophetic masters. Predicting the Master of the Master is often "inspired" after looking at the book. Some people have also written a record similar to "the power of the blood to carry the fate, after the good use can accomplish many incredible things." Later, according to the inspiration of this book, the Master predicted that the spells and combat techniques of the Tianyun Masters were gradually improved, which shows the power of knowledge in this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Master has also mentioned that the spells in "The Moonlight Moya Vol." can be used as a spell component to recreate the body's resurrection? “The method of safely transferring blood has given me a lot of inspiration”, which records “may be able to discover the secrets of healing and resurrection in the gods.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Moonlight "The volume of Moya" is not in the library, including the positive volume and the transcript, I have not seen it." Siegel asked the two administrators of the library: "Is this book not brought from the Masters Union?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the administrators should have paid attention to this book in the past, so he immediately replied: "The book was originally written by Mage McGregor more than 30 years ago. Tas borrowed from the Sanfeng Pagoda and later did not return it. The Three Peaks Tower left three copies. But afterwards, he lost. Francis asked Mage Master to return the book before his life, although he received a reply to the consent, but there has been no Received the original book. Adults are getting worse and worse, plus they have applied to the Masters Association for a copy of the book, so that they can be put on hold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is McGonagall still alive? Where is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's her," said the administrator. "She is a very talented mage, but it's hard to interact with other people. I studied with her at the Magic Salon. She always likes it. The teacher and other classmates were difficult to solve. At first, her question could always be answered. Later, even the wizard who taught the magic spell would be stumped. But in my opinion, she is not trying to get the answer. It just likes torment. The process of other people's brain power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Siegel goes to the Masters Association. Otherwise, McGonagall is his only hope. If you know Janet's situation earlier, you can ask the Master of Idis to take the copy of "Mountain Moonlight Moya". Perhaps this time the Masters Federation has received a copy of the Master Association, but Siegel did not dare to appear in the Sanfeng Tower. Knox will not send someone to find him in the city of Mire, but it will not be polite to the Master of the Master who is sent to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought of the "shackle armor" that restricted the Master. He didn't want to put it on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Heim’s collar is back on track, and Siegel decided to take this opportunity to find this book. Solve Janet's worries as soon as possible. Heim’s success has successfully brought five castles into the bag, making Siegel one of the strongest lords in the South. The best performer in battle is Kenki, the smart man with only one ear. Instead of sending a soldier to attack the Enkat Cliffs Manor, he let the best of the mercenaries sing to negotiate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron of the original manor also wanted to resist, claiming that if Heim stepped into the gate of the manor, he would burn everything in one fire. Off, leaving only the ashes and ruins to the rule of Hessig. The singer did not have nonsense, sang the "One Day War" twice with a sly voice, and then waited for the Baron's reply to become silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time the song was about Uther’s failure, and the second time was the demise of the Dark Guide. The baron of the Enkat Cliffs Manor came back from the battlefield not long ago and witnessed the process of the owner and army of the city. The night attack of the camp laid the victory of Siegel, and his "one-day war" was well-deserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tough words are stuck in the throat, why not dare to say it. After a long silence, he took the sword and threw it on the ground, demanding a decent surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He eventually retained his title. In addition to the baron's armor and weapons, he and his family can take away the property that can be lifted and choose to live under any of Heim's collars, except for the Cliff Manor. They chose Secret City and may need to retake the Cavaliers' path to rise again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel left a castle to McCann. And promoted the singer as a servant, after the inspection of the character or as a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc is the most exciting person in the war. He ran a lap in each castle and "grabbed" a large number of sword weapons. All brought to the front of Siegel. "Help me to see which one is best," he said, pointing at the weapon. "You promised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and used detection magic There is no magic sword in a pile of weapons in front of you. He took it up for inspection, first removed those decorative effects significantly greater than the practical value, and then selected from materials, workmanship, counterweight, maintenance and other aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finds an epee. That is, it can adapt to the steel sword with one hand and two hands at the same time. "Follow me," Siegel said, then took him to his spell test site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What effect do you want the weapon to bring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough to pull the wind!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Siegel knows that it’s totally meaningless to ask the Orc about magic weapons, so he can only play freely. After thinking of it, it is possible to face evil creatures such as grievances, and this weapon must be beautiful enough. Siegel thinks of using elemental runes to transform it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need a few days to work, don't bother me. Take my space bag and hand it to Moore, let him prepare for the faraway, complete the weapon I am going to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Where are you going this time?" Mike said excitedly: "Bring me!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stone village cannot be separated from you. Mana also needs a helper. Now I have just received several castles and need a stable army."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼克撇撇嘴, whispered: "No, I am actually fine..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still want your magic weapon to listen My!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gram was sent away, Siegel began to mobilize the power of the surrounding elements. Just as the energy of plasma is extracted from the sublimation of gas, light energy can be extracted from gas and fire. On top of the four basic elements, Siegel began to build new levels and add his own understanding of the world to magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
