			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hay’s Knight’s ceremonial ceremonies were held the next day, and the time was rather rushed and the preparation was not sufficient. The place was held in front of the castle. Only the residents of Heim’s collar were present. It was not enough to be represented by representatives of other nobles. After the war, there are still many traces left by the war, some wreckage has not been cleaned up, and life is far from being back on track. However, the ceremony was a good new start, and the new knight represented new hope and brought confidence to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaac was held in his arms by his mother and attended the ceremony. Heim has the heirs, which makes the Cavaliers more assured when they play. Besides, Siegel is younger than most of them. Now he has become a famous lord of the New World. He believes that Heim will have greater development in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana became the agent lord, responsible for dealing with territorial things when Siegel was absent. Zuck took over the management of the Mire City army, and he was responsible for the recruiting and training of the recruits and the defense of the castle. Many human knights are not optimistic about the half-orc, but think of the hard stone village and the zebra mountain gold mine. Most of the people living there are half-orcs, so there is really no better candidate than Mike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel understands his ideas. He does not support any ethnic prejudice, but will make up for it from other aspects. It is a good idea to promote a few knights, but the reward of the castle is beyond everyone's expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is powerful and inspiring: "The aristocratic bandits in the south have provoked the war, and this matter cannot end when they want to end. Starting today Sir Mana will lead you to attack south and capture the castles and manors that do not surrender, lest they continue to provide convenience to the enemy next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a good thing for a knight to be a professional, especially if there are three pieces of land that will be given to the knights before the occupation, which makes the fighting spirit of the people more exciting. The big family looked at Mana with eager eyes, knowing that this woman as the commander and acting city owner is the key to everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am now a baron, or a double-baron in the Star Kingdom and Deepwater City. Although I can only promote jazz and knights, it may not be so afterwards, so You must work harder. Go forward with me.” Siegel said at the end of the ceremony: “All said that the New World is a place of hope, full of opportunities. I am deeply convinced that I don’t know how you think?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Heim's collar!" The knights kneeled on the ground and took the sword in front of them. Reaffirm the vow to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Siegel saw the three butlers selected by Fazak and arranged for them to be responsible for the daily affairs of a castle after the war. It was assessed by Fitzkack after the year. One of them will become the head of Heim’s collar and gain the status of a knight. Whether in status or in taxation. It will be a lot better than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These things Siegel had a draft, so it was handled very quickly, and what really caught him was Janet’s situation. He tried to find someone to help him, but there was no good way to do it in a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, someone can only suppress the transformation, comfort, and no ability to get rid of." Rhett sits directly on the ground, but still better than others Be taller. He squinted his head and said with a sigh of relief: "It is her own vitality that causes this situation. Someone's healing ability can only strengthen vitality. It can't be killed, so it is not enough to face this situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sat opposite him, nodding his face. In the past few days, he has tried various common magical methods such as lifting magic and eliminating curses, plus using the magic array to enhance his spell strength, or to perform spell operations more accurately and meticulously, but no matter how hard he works. The power of the spell directly penetrated Janet's body and disappeared without stopping. This shows that magic did not find a target that could work, and the choice of the spell was completely wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone used to treat them with toxins and diseases. But it was not found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Thank you, Rhett," Siegel said. "I also found this situation. Janet was not weakened, but strengthened. The blood of the purgatory, which was originally very thin in her blood, is now able to show If this happens, it will be released on the warlock. I am afraid they will also cheer because of the strengthening of their abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golem nod, "But the Warlock is I am motivating my blood to strengthen, rather than being subjected to external forces. The transformational power of Janet talent leads to the gradual loss of control of blood evolution, which leads to the loss of reason. Someone finds that the root of the induced force has been combined with her transformation. The roots can't be eliminated, and alienation has always existed. Janet can only control the emotions through more and better control, and then control the transformation to slow down the process of devilization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone will pray and provide all the help they can." Rhett said: "But if Janet is completely converted into a demon and loses control, someone will not let her hurt others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stared at Reid’s eyes and pointed to his chest and said, “If that happens, I will handle it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone understands that someone will come to you first, but someone can't sit on the danger and expand." The Golem has his own insistence, but he promised to keep the secret, just like before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel remembers that when he was fighting blood magic, he saw the blood of several people being mixed together and became a tool for blood magician manipulation. Clearly remember the pain of suffocating and suffocating the imported cavity. What secrets are hidden in the blood and blood, why can the blood magician be so fascinated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Janet had a fever, her body was extremely weak, and she was almost taken away by death. Dr. Rees’s prescription cured her. It is full of doubts about this matter now. That was the pharmacy for Evan, because he forgot to eat and just one more. The influence of the blood magician has not found the roots until now. Why can the Rees doctor find the relief medicine so quickly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After learning a lot about alchemy and medicine, Siegel knows how difficult it is to formulate a drug. The differences in race, physique, and age, combined with various situations, are difficult to find medicinal herbs. What about medicines? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few people in the cave at the time, Evan, Janet, Aaron, a paladin whose name has long been forgotten, and the Count of Todd-Siegel Er shakes his head, Count Todd has not been drawn blood, not counted - of course, himself. In all of them, there are no symptoms at all, which may be related to their different roles in the blood magician ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan and Janet took Dr. Rees's remedies and recovered very well. Just don't know what Evan is doing now? But if you want to come to him, there is no demon blood, you will not become out of control, and you should be innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was shocked and thought of Prince Aaron. His weak constitution afterwards. What is the performance of alcoholism? Is the blood magician still a physician? Why is the heir of the royal family getting worse and worse? When I finally returned to Deepwater City, I could hardly control myself. Even a simple ceremony could not be sustained. More precisely, how can you not even have a illegitimate child? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear conspiracy, and it can no longer be an accident in an adventure. Knox will cover up the prophecy of Master Lear. Leading the prince to a reckless adventure, leading to the blood magician, step by step led to the current situation. What is it all for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there are layers of fog covering up in past events, and terrible conspiracy is hiding behind the fog. Siegel knew that the plot could not be directed at himself or Janet, when they were just unknown, the first-time adventurers. Only Prince Aaron is worthy of such a move, and the starry royal family is the target of conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only knowing their motives can infer their means, knowing what kind of hands and feet the blood magician has done to everyone, is it possible to prescribe the right medicine. Find ways to stop Janet from getting worse, so the roots of everything are still in the blood magician. Thinking of this, Siegel went out of the study and went straight to the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless reels of thousands of books, manuscripts, and research materials. Fortunately, it has just been built soon, and after accurate classification, it is more convenient to find information about the blood magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several thick books were placed in front of Siegel, and the disciples of Edith were looking at Siegel with a weird look. They have doubts in their hearts but they dare not ask. After all, not all wizards like blood magic. In some areas, blood magic is considered a different kind. Has embarked on the astray of research. As in many folklore, blood is used to summon demons to gain strength, but few people know that using blood can also summon angels. Blood sacrifices are often associated with the existence of foreign bodies, and the Master has better means. So basically abandoned the blood magician's method. He secretly hoped that Siegel Lord would not embark on this path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some books in the library that record the discussion of some magic spells by the Association of Masters and Masters. There are a lot of crazy ideas and a lot of unrealistic thoughts. The dragon that does not eat meat has a stronger magical power, which Sigel once read in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
