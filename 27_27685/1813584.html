At this time, only Siegel was alone in front of them, and even the gnome Ke Ke was sent back to a relatively safe personal room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney looked at Siegel, his face was as calm as water and he said nothing. His fingers were gently rubbed on the robes on the outside of the thigh, and he could pick up the poisoned dagger from there at any time. The Orc Master did not have such a good temper, and roared in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind erupted from him, violently and violently sweeping across the ground, rolling grass, soft mushrooms and small flowers all over the air. The magic tower and the room where everyone lives are emitting a layer of bright silver fluorescence that keeps the air out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney swayed in the wind, his body was blown away like black smoke, but he quickly reunited when the wind was quiet, unharmed. He is the shadow. With the shadow of light action, how can it be hurt by the wind? Siegel was not so convenient, although he could control the flow of elements, but he was forced to step back a lot, until he lifted the dust of the stars and cut the wind in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard kid, we will be attacked as soon as we get to the fourth floor, we can't move on! Do you know this already?!" Half Orc I took a sip on the ground and said evilly: "If you can't get to the top, why are we still wasting your time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at himself Next to Chanem, he snorted: "It's better to kill you all, and then naturally go up and down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very likely "Siegel nodded. "The identity of the two of you is different from those of us. If I say that God has set a limit for you here, I am not surprised. In fact, you have until now. It’s my strangest thing to stay here all the time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Little bastard, you actually despise me!” The Orc rushed without warning. Up, the high fists are filled with the power of magic, and the four elements are combined with tremendous power, such as the pressure of the mountains. Before Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't want to run away, unless you are a coward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel slightly sideways. The long sword and the staff roll together, like the leaves that rotate in the wind, fluttering and flashing the wild boar. The dust of the star slammed on the shoulders of the Orcs, and the Frost Curse from the Staff hit the half-orc's back. But there is no ability to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the pace of the elves and the dwarf's combat skills!" The orc saints are well-informed, and naturally they see these two techniques at a glance. Both the elves and the dwarves are guilty of dealing with the orcs. The experience accumulated in the War of the Years is integrated into the martial arts, and the orcs are well targeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As an orc saint, you can learn magic. But unfortunately you can never learn the elf's pace and dwarf skills." Siegel dabbles his fist While waiting for an opportunity to fight back. The current situation is that the orc saint can't help Siegel, but Siegel can't hurt him. The orcs have always been physically strong, thick and fleshy, and the orc holy people have played it to a certain extent. Unless Sigel takes out heavy siege weapons, even the skin can not be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be bound by the rules, subject to divine power, you will always have something you can't learn. This is fatal for knowledge clerics! If I am it I also boycott you." Siegel slammed the words into his face, because for an orc who was fighting. This is the only effective way to communicate. "You don't understand. From the very beginning, you can't get the final inheritance from the two! The priesthood can't fall on your head, at least it's impossible for the body of the saints! Ah! Let the great god of the orc come down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard, you still want to set a trap to kill me!" The orc saint is more and more angry, but he I found myself unable to violently in any way, and could not stimulate the strongest strength in the body. He can make his eyes red, he can make muscles bulge and tremble at high speed, but he can't make a violent momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I can get mad, you are dead now! I will hold your small skull and crush it into dregs! Nothing left! I Will scatter your soul. It is like blowing out a candle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Saints did not speak this time, just yelling "Ah!" and launched a more rapid offensive. Siegel knows that he is venting his anger. As an orc, he only has a way to vent. Siegel had great confidence in his close combat ability—at least much better than the other Masters—and decided to resist the offensive in order to avoid causing too much damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the School of Magic, the spell will receive preferential treatment, the ** will be suppressed, and the wizard's battle is like this." He used the illusion again to deceive the orc, using The elf pace quickly opened the distance. If it is not possible to use flying and any other spells, Siegel has long used mobility to gain an advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't help, but I can!" Siegel waved the Staff: Summon Elemental Legion. The magical element's highly active elemental environment makes this spell particularly powerful, with a variety of elemental creatures appearing in the open space. The earth and water elements line up on the ground, and the assault is like a mudslide. The gas and fire elements fly in the air, they don't fly with magical power, so they don't fall to the ground because of magical restrictions. Siegel ordered an element of anger to fly to the sky and then issued an order for the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Saint was immediately overwhelmed by the surging elemental frenzy. It is very difficult to kill him, and it is impossible to do it with an elemental legion spell. But it made him feel embarrassed but it was not difficult. Only the ground orcs with hands and feet immediately fell into the trouble of being besieged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large scimitar forms a whirlwind, and it can be used to cover large soils on the body of the earth, but it is of no use to the other three non-solid enemies. The half-orc roared and took out his real weapon: the orc double-headed axe. The two axe blades exerted double power and took him to the battle group to kill and kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the current situation, the Orc Saint can solve the more than 50 elemental creatures in front of them within ten minutes. But if he can't solve the problem of flying, he can't hurt Siegel in the air, and he will lose the battle. Maybe the orc holy people are busy fighting and didn't expect this. Chanem, who can be seen on the side, can see clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He initiated a communication technique to Siegel: "Do you have a solution to the problem that we can't go to the fourth floor?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth floor is a threshold because there is a powerful six-armed lamp that can use the power of the destruction rule. On that level, only the rules of the lamp god can be fought, so the two saints are completely out of position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next level is the crystal ball room, where the power of prophecy is stored. It is the goal of Chanem. Although the Lord of the Rings did not feel the presence of divine power at all, it was difficult to ensure that Chanem had the ability to extract enough power from the crystal ball to complete his original goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The six-armed god is also one of the objects of my research. I have some eyebrows, but the distance is sure to solve it." Chanem said: "I haven't seen any signs of being tampered with. So I haven't decided if I want to crack it. You two are special, all need to be considered with one question: it is the ultimate risk Everything may be in vain to destroy this light god, so that I have the opportunity to go up higher; still believe in my credibility, waiting for me to fulfill the promised part of the agreement?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney smiled and responded very quickly: "Of course I believe in you. From any angle, you are the most promising guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really think about it, Chanem? Think about it, don't regret it, it will not look good at the scene." Siegel couldn't believe him easily. So ask. Through this attitude. He can also let Chanem know that he is not perfunctory, in order to better stabilize the impulse of the sacred murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard of what you did in the goblin war, and you have heard about the conflict between you and that person, so you still have confidence in us, even us. I gave up, and you will stick to it.” Chanem nodded and said, “I am not like this stupid orc, I am more rational than him.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Thank you, you need the power of each of us to achieve the goal." Siegel constantly summoned the elemental army to supplement the consumption caused by the orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an earth-shattering battle, and the legion’s shouting has not stopped for a moment. The sound of the intersection of the weapon and the body is so long that the ears are long. After more than three hours of fighting, the orc saint finally screamed and took a step back from the elements around him. He took the opportunity to say to Siegel: "The bastard mage. I have tore all these beaters, I am tired, don't want to Hit it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
