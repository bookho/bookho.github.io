			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel dispelled the spell, which made him feel weak and weak, so he quickly sat down on the chair next to him. Pastor Cooper showed him a spell to get rid of fatigue, but the effect was minimal, but a glass of ale brought by Sir Bill was much more useful. The mage swallowed a cold, fragrant wine, and the foam was covered with chin. Taking this opportunity, Siegel thought about what happened to the one-sided scorpion. He finally decided that this matter could only be investigated slowly and could not be made public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the Shadow Obelisk? What is Jinlong and Black Phoenix referring to?" The count looked at the prophecy written on paper and said to himself: When I meet, I am talking about what happened before the blood magician. Those who have been infected with the corpse are warnings to us? If you encounter it, what is this? After he died, he was born." He swept past Cooper, Sir Bill, and finally stopped his eyes on Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Baron, what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, he already I completed my earlier commitment and didn't want to waste more energy on this matter. Besides, explaining the prophecy is inherently a difficult matter. Most of the time, only when things come to the end can you understand what the prophecy refers to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a Lear master, prophecy is not my specialty. I am sorry that Mr. Count, I can do nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rejection, Count Todd was not angry. He knew the content of the prophecy and then put the focus of concern on the prince. Aaron, who has taken a sleeping pill, is sleeping very well now, but when he wakes up, he will probably have a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can't help with the treatment of this headache, professional things are handed over to professional people. He just saw Evan and found the swordsman's expression very strange. Evan relied on the wall, and there was no focus in the open eyes, and one hand instinctively twirled on the golden chin of the chin. What is he thinking about? Siegel is very curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Evan can help find information about a hundred scorpions, he is the illegitimate son of the king, and it is more convenient to move around in the capital. But then Siegel thought about the situation of his nephew. Does the blind man really bring bad luck to the holders who are not their masters? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of scorpions, Siegel’s heart is pondering, what is the use of things in the end? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time. The room was silent and everyone was thinking about their own thoughts. At this time, the sound of the horn came from the castle, and "呜呜呜呜" kept ringing. "Damn, who violated the command to blow the horn? Don't you know to keep silent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is still down. There is another second voice outside. Dangdang’s alarm bell was ringing, only to show that there is a huge danger. The count of Count Todd and Sir Bill changed, leaving only one sentence: "Evan, guarding the prince of the prince!" Then they ran out of the house with the cousin Cooper. The sound of the horn spread throughout the castle and it was impossible for everyone to miss it. Even the prince of the prince was blind and sleepy. Struggling to get up and get up. He looked at the two people in the room in confusion and covered his head with one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My head is so uncomfortable," said His Royal Highness, "It’s like someone is ringing inside and blowing a number."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was not caused by a headache." Evan replied: "The bells and horns are indeed ringing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Are there any enemies?" Prince Aaron asked, and Evan and Siegel nodded. "Help me get a glass of red wine and put on my armor. Even if I can't appear in the first line of killing the enemy, I can't sleep in bed with silk pajamas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Evan, you help your brother, I need to contact the magic pet." Siegel concentrated on the spirit, calling out to the Raven Baron. He kept the magic pet outside the castle. As a guard against the pastor. It constantly observes the movement of the castle and is ready to display illusions at any time. As long as the orcs on the mountain road are still there, the magic pet will have enough deterrent outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron received an order to jump out of the hidden tree hole, and then saw an incredible sight: more than fifty different colors The dragons are flying from the south to the north, and they cast huge black shadows on the snow. Both small animals and orcs flee in these shadows. Most of the dragons are yellow, with golden and orange, and the rest are silvery white and grayish white. For the dragon, Siegel knows relatively little. They are Jinlong, Brass Dragon, Silver Dragon, belonging to the kind and simple dragon. But these dragons did not attack the orcs under the mountain, and even did not even look at them, so it is difficult for Siegel to guess the purpose of these powerful creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron raised his neck and poured red wine into his body. Then he stood up and entangled his feet in the middle of the quilt and blanket. He kicked the pile of things and pointed his finger at the lock on the nearby wall. "My sword!" He said: "When I hold the sword, the power will come back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, things are not what people want. His Royal Highness finally got a long sword after the second drink. Evan looked at his brother with great pain and reached out and held his arm. The prince smashed his hand and tried to get rid of Evan's help, but in the end he succumbed to reality and relied on most of his weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the knights and priests in the castle are enemies, and they have gathered together under the prince who stood on the wall. Some mountain knights want to climb to the summit to act as the first line of defense, but their mounts are all scared to the ground, whispering, and the scales are shaking. If not well trained, these hexapod lizards are likely to have a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the dragon is not interested in us." Siegel looked at it with a squint and then said to everyone: "The dragon is going to have something else." The enemy has to deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Evan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look at their condition, whether it is scales or claws, all at the peak. It is said that a little damage is not seen, I even saw it. The traces of polishing, which means that they are all ready for the battle.” Siegel analyzed: “From the perspective of body shape, these dragons are more than 20 meters long and belong to super large, at least have lived for more than 300 years. It is the backbone of the Dragons. And Jinlong, Brass Dragon and Silver Dragon are very rare at the same time. It seems that they are encountering enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However, Siegel added: "I don't know what kind of dragons are silver-gray." When he said this, he took his eyes back from the sky and saw Janet facing him in the distance. Waved. In order to protect the safety of His Royal Highness, the Paladin separated most of the people. Do not let them close to the temple. As a "mainly monitored" person, Janet will definitely not let her come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cooper Pastor avoided Siegel’s gaze, and at this moment he would not compromise. So the Master sinned. Leaving from the side of His Royal Highness, crowded the knight’s line of defense and came to Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I heard the alarm, I was shocked and thought that the orc had come up." Janet snorted and gestured to the Master to hear: "I When I came out, I left my mind. Just saw the knight and the jazz running out, but there was a place to open the door. I sneaked in and found some good things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;?&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah?" Siegel was a little worried. "Is it just a little while?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet has a red face, but proudly said "In fact, I have been staring at it for a long time. I have never had a chance. Besides, I am very strong as a spy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next time Do this kind of thing." Siegel said: "Let's take a look at this time. If there is something they don't need, use it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Follow me." Janet said with a smile: "It's actually something they don't need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Todd Jazz under the command, the castle and the alarm horn all shut up. Everyone was quiet and waiting for the dragon to fly out of sight. Many people pray that these legendary beasts will not look back, and never be interested in the castle on the ground. When everyone looked up at the sky or whispered to each other, Siegel followed Janet and sneaked back into the castle. They walked through the hall and drilled into a small room in the tower of the tower. There are only two meters square, no windows, and it is completely illuminated by Siegel's bright spells. On the wall are some arrow rods with no feathers installed. There are more than 30 short rods stacked in the corner, and the metal tip used as the tip is wrapped in cloth and placed on the shelf on the other side wall. Janet closed the door. Take a half-man-high hemp bag from the back of the door. The weight of the things inside is not light, and when they collide with each other, they also make a rumbling sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are the equipment brought by the Temple of the Morning and the mountain knights, but they seem to have no intention of distributing them to the jazz lords, all stacked in the vault." Janet Squinting and said: "I don't take much. Just no one finds such a sack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you give you enough strength, you will put Have they finished their things?" Siegel smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the Paladin's sabre or mount equipment, Siegel will definitely send it back. But what are the items that are piled up in the warehouse, if not used, is it not a waste? Siegel and Janet whispered and opened the bag and took things out one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A long sword was specially taken out by Janet. It has beautiful scabbards and hilts with gems. "I deliberately brought it to you." Janet said: "You are all scarred on the sword now, just for a new one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took out the long sword and looked carefully. "This is a pretty good weapon. There are runes on it. I can feel the magical power flowing inside. But this is not the power of the Lord of the Morning, it is definitely made by a mage like me. Let me analyze it. The above mantra should be able to know more about its origins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a good eye?" Janet waited for the Siegel praise, but was held by the Master. I kissed my face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't make a sudden attack." Janet wiped her face with water, "Look at the spoils!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing that these are stolen goods, Siegel is not willing to modify the Janet "trophy". He exchanged the long sword that he had found in Makarbu and the magical sword, and placed the new weapon on the belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long dagger in the bag, basically catching up with the length of the short sword, which Janet has prepared for himself, as well as the treble and two boxes of exquisite Projectile, a pair of beautiful hand guards, the role and arm shield is similar. Unfortunately, there are no darts or daggers here. After all, these two are the weapons that Janet is familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found a folding bow that looked very interesting, although it won't work, but I still brought it." Janet took out a treasure Heap of complex components, after a few fiddlings, is indeed a composite longbow. But I don't know where the organ is, so the shape of the bow can't be fixed. Siegel tried it a few times and couldn't find the trick. The part is still the pair of parts, and there is no intention to become a longbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was the first time I saw this weapon." Siegel said: "I always thought that I had seen all the equipment in the dwarf Elinette. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, there are good things." Janet said: "I saw a lot of bottles and cans there, but I only recognized them." One of them is a therapeutic ointment applied to the wound for hemostasis recovery; the other is a sharp-edged oil that can be applied to the weapon to enhance penetration. How about three bottles per person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage nodded and looked at the remaining bottles. "These are you out of your hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you tell us what they are for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This takes time," Siegel said. "The spells that prepare the item need a quiet and secret place. Do you know there is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm afraid it's hard." Janet shook her head: "I found The Paladins have stepped up their alert, whether it is patrolling or searching. It is more frequent than before. Unless you tell them to let the paladin help you guard, there is no quiet place, let alone secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it." Siegel said: "What else is in the bag?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Several pieces are exuding The singular sweet smell of incense is the same as that in Cooper's stove a few days ago. I like it together.” Janet said: “Reassure, wait until we are separated from the morning priests. They won't let them smell the smell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not for dressing up," Siegel whispered. "It's meditation incense, used to enhance The communication between the pastor and the god is only useful to the clergy. Any pastor is willing to spend money to buy this incense The market is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to be a seafarer, Have you forgotten?" Siegel said: "Which goods are worth the money, this is something I must keep in mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you sold this thing." Janet put the incense in the hands of Siegel and said, "I know that it takes a lot of money to learn spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
