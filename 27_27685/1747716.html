			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is beginning to sink, and the winter days are always short and weak. So far, they have not encountered anyone on the road. This situation can be understood, after all, just after the harvest season, everyone feels rich in the warm house, no one will come out easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The north wind is getting up, but there is not much chill left. After all, it is still in the south, and there is a tall walled mountain block on one side. Since they set off in the afternoon, they couldn’t get to the next stop. They can only stay in the wild tonight. There was some light in the sky, and Moore rode the horse to the woods to pick up some branches to make firewood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel certainly has a variety of ways to make a flame, he can even take out the fire from the water. However, Moore’s actions reminded him of the time when he was a knight attendant. He said that this young guy also needs to exercise, so he is busy with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, what to eat at night?" Moore lit the fire and untied the bloated backpack on the horse. "I brought sausages, bacon, this year's beets, onions and freshly baked bread in the morning, and a trout in the river, cleaned and salted. I have three bottles of red wine to choose from." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First eat the perishable things, put the bacon in the end." Siegel said: "How do I feel the outing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are already the Lord of the Lord." Moore replied: "In fact, there should be a whole cavalry escort you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to cook for all the knights together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you agree." Moore said: "I am early The desire to be a chef is to have a hotel of his own. There are many rooms to live in, and then cook and listen to the guests' praise. Of course, I don't mean that I don't want to be a knight, but I never dare to think about it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Moore's skillful setting up the pot, chopping the fattest sausages, To the oil. Then add the onion and garlic to taste, put the flat cut salmon into it. Then he added a little red wine to the fish and turned them over. And roast the tropical bread next to the pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s more fluent than when he served Sir Bill, Siegel thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no contradiction between becoming a knight and becoming a chef." He said: "There is a knight named Don Tulles in history, very loyal, in case Some people poisoned the food. They cooked for the king. His craftsmanship was widely praised, and many dishes in the kingdom of the kingdom were improved. The pot and shovel were specially drawn on his family logo."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a jazz?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s a pity, but it’s a pity His children only inherit the title of the Viscount."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Mohr asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king eats more and die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Morse’s expression, West Geer just wants to laugh happily. Count Count Tules does have his own people. But the death of the king is not his intention, he is just a poor cook to be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, I have restraint. Even if you do it better, I won't die." Siegel pointed at the pot and said: “Is the fish fast?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, they ate the fish soup with hot bread and ate the meal. The night vigil was handed over to the Raven Baron, so Moore could also take a good sleep after taking care of the horse. Although the ore boulevard in winter is inaccessible, there are not many beasts. Therefore, the first day of going out is a very peaceful ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, they have to speed up. For a day in a row, Moore suffered from the pain on the horseback, and the scorpion that had been ground out on the inside of the thigh and knee was opened again. It hurts him to take a cold breath. Siegel looked in his eyes, but said nothing. In the evening they passed a hunter's hut, although there was no one inside, but there was a stove inside, and there was piled up firewood. Siegel decided to rest here and let Moore continue to prepare dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a small injury, an adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since we are on the road together, even if I am the lord, you are a servant, but still a dangerous companion." Companions are taking care of each other. You feel that your injury is a trivial matter, but it is a big deal for your team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out a bottle Treat the ointment and hand it to Moore: "This is to buy the wound medicine from the elf, put on some, keep it for you tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor slashed the head , smiled and took over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Don’t be so nervous when riding on horsebacks. Let the horse take you away, relax the muscles of your thighs, and use more effort on your feet. It will be better." Siegel finally yelled at him. "Cut some firewood early tomorrow and add it to us. This hunter's cabin will welcome other guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the road gradually goes north, the two people do not have to rest in the wild. The hotels on the road are very welcome to such guests. The knight and the followers will not be as arrogant as the mercenaries, nor will they be as picky as a businessman. As long as you compliment the compliments such as "adults, adults", you will be rewarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenfield Inn is such a place, Simmons and his family in their 40s run this seven-room hotel for the guests service. There are several fruit trees behind the hotel. A small piece of land is planted under the tree to grow vegetables, and pigs and chickens are kept in the circle. Therefore, the materials used in their kitchens can be prepared by themselves, which is considered to be a very good hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already the periphery of the hub, and you can see the Mochi Castle, one of the outposts of Hubburg, two days east. Siegel deliberately asked about the situation of the hub, and Simmons did not have any concealed meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now everything is fine." Simmons said: "The caravan went in and out, and there was no impact. Whether it was to the top of Mora or In Ximu Town, the cloak avenue is still busy. The lord of Mullen is orthodox, it is just to be able to recapture the castle on his ancestors, and it is rare for him to maintain kindness. The entire hub has only recovered in three days and calmed down. The knights are also loyal, and it is fortunate that there is no war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us have a drink for him." Siegel took the ale and took a sip. Later, he said: "It is said that there are more magic towers in the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is a good thing." Simmons said: "Deepwater City can become the New World The largest city, do not rely on the magic tower of the Masters Union to sit in the town. This union also built a magic tower for the hub, the surrounding will become very safe, and our days are better."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you not afraid of a magician?"<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m afraid there is a little bit, but I am a natural timid person, I am afraid of anything.” Simmons wiped the foam on his mouth and went on to say: "Adult, you are going to the hub for the job." What? Is it also necessary to join the Knights?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, I just passed by and wondered if the lords there were fair and kind.” Siegel replied. "If it is an evil person, it will be sanctioned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a paladin." Simmons was surprised. His eyes turned and he licked his lips and said, "If this is the case, there is something to talk to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smile Encouraging him, the shopkeeper said with a low voice: "It is said that there are a group of robbers eating people near the northeast mill here. They have already hurt five caravans since the fall. Mochi City sent soldiers to pay and retrieved them. Many of the skeletons that had been cleaned up and claimed to have eliminated the robbers. However, according to my friend, none of the soldiers were found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a recent incident of eating robbers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simons shook his head: "The man is not lost, but I lost two pigs." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will the pig run by himself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, that's impossible." Simmons waved his hand: "Pig is my baby. Every day I check the condition of the pigsty and close the door tightly. Besides, if the pig runs, the door will be closed again. ? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp case ah "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
