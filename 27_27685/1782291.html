			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremor of the long sword is getting stronger and stronger, and the sword begins to show tiny cracks, from which it glows incandescently. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM Siegel strokes with his fingers to strengthen the spell's stability and the crack will heal. But after a long time, new cracks will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will only drag the time longer and longer, eventually leading to the failure of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several ways to temporarily improve the substance, and Siegel has already used it in the cast. Only the skills of blood magic have not been tried. Using the caster's blood can increase the effect of creating a magical object, and it will be easier to use. Since this long sword is for Evan, then let it go from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan, scratch your fingers, and then drop the blood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon Do what you want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the blood seep into the cracks and then use the spell to give it vitality. Evan's blood, coupled with Evan's sword, and Serge's constant healing spells, finally smoothed the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the sword began to darken slowly, but the energy it contains is more and more restrained. Through a layer-by-layer overlay, Siegel successfully released the spell of the element transformation to the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the sword, the body is gray and the blade is bright. However, if you look closely, you will find that there is a rainbow of luster on the bright white blade, and the blade has a very pale green current pattern. The sword is a little sinking, but the balance should be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sword was completely cooled down, it immediately played the role of "devil". The spell that Siegel used to support its floating in the air was reduced to the basic elemental power, and it lost its effect. The "bonfire" fell from the air, and a bang was inserted on the slate floor, and then stood there obliquely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, this is your campfire." Siegel wiped the sweat and said: "You come to be the first person to use this sword." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan screamed excitedly and rushed straight up. He was satisfied with the work of the sword, and continued to spur in the air to adapt to its feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s good, I can still feel it is my bonfire. It’s only stronger!” said Evan: “Really, it’s a brand new, I think it’s used. It can be invincible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved his hand and smiled and said to him: "That must be your illusion! Progress is never ending, you How do you know that I can't make better weapons in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Wait until you become a teacher, I will find you to strengthen the bonfire." Evan Lehe Returning the dust of the stars to Siegel, holding the bonfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the bonfire can't be strengthened anymore, unless it is ruined." Siegel said to Evan, "The function of this sword is Decompose spells. Restore them to elemental state, so there is a demon effect. So once formed, it will be very difficult to cast magic on it. It can only be filled with a powerful force that is extremely disparate, but that will definitely destroy the sword. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Paladin of the Dawn Church has a sword that can dispel magic, called the Holy Guardian. The weapon needs divine power, only the Paladin can use it, you It's not convenient, but it's really convenient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The principle is different." Siegel shook his head. The function of the "Holy Guardian" of the Temple is to cast spell spells, just like a person is casting a spell. It's just a process of recreating magic, and it's the same with a fireball or a lightning spell. But the "bonfire" is simply the power to break down the elements and destroy the structure of the spell. Although the four elements are not the perfect condition for all the spells, no single spell can be completely separated from the participation of the four elements, and it will always be more or less shackled. However, such a reason is too cumbersome to explain to Evan, and he does not necessarily like to listen, so Siegel will not be too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new magic weapon feature that poses a great threat to the caster. From then on, the magic shield is not a panacea, and the magical attack will not have an absolute suppression effect on the warrior. Even some areas of magic protection enchantment are no longer safe. Siegel looked at Evan, who was dancing, and wondered if he would realize this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smashed his hand and summed up the gains and losses in his mind. The magic array and the crystal column all exerted the expected effect, and the shortcomings of the material also tried to make up for it. But when transforming the sword, Siegel left a loophole that he had discovered in the process. But it did not make up for it - there is no magic array on the hilt of the "bonfire", and there is no effect of breaking the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use a telekinesis, you can grasp the hilt and control the sword. Spells like driving away from metal can also affect the hilt, which affects the sword and the swordsman. The most ideal situation is actually a magic sword that is integrated into one, but as a mage, Siegel does not intend to create a long sword that breaks the magical attributes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the onlookers, the ideal situation in their hearts is completely different. They want to see the long sword that burns or the magic weapon that emits the power of lightning, and even can fly to take the first level. It's not something that is bleak, uncharacteristic, and has no magic. The elements of the four regiments were very beautiful, and the lightning that appeared constantly was very exciting, but the long sword made them extremely disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheats! You are magic, not magic!" Someone shouted: "Jianghu Warlock! Liar!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lingua franca is not yet familiar, but everyone can understand. Some people agreed with his thoughts, but he dared not say it when he was close to the guard of a hundred guards. He just snorted and shook his head and turned away. Some people yell and scream, hoping to "go again, I haven't seen enough!" This completely makes Siegel a magician of performing arts,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Siegel looks around and captures the look of the onlookers, judging how familiar these people are with magic. Just like in the city of Mire, all the elements and golems are seen walking around, the wizard's mage and the elves are all making magic arrays together, people are used to it, thinking more than surprise, not very Excited. However, it seems that people on the grassland rarely see the spells of the four elements, which means that they have insufficient knowledge, use and prevention of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few people are observing spells, and from the attire they may be priests and warlocks. The believers of the god of the wilderness are mostly druids, but there are also many "priests". The chances of a sorcerer who is a spontaneous caster in the wild blood will be greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any of these people want to go to the contest, it may threaten Moore and should prepare a full set of enhancements for him. Siegel is thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some things should be done in a big way, and some things need to be kept secret. Isn't there a lot of people who don't understand the power of magic, and there is no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four element furnaces on the ground do not need to be removed, they can continue to operate. Siegel closed the crystal column. Take out a sterling silver stick from the bag and place it in the original crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can continue to build the camp, don't worry about me." Siegel said to Moore: "I will use protective spells and let everyone guard." At that time, you can save some strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the Master of the Master once again runs the Elemental Furnace. Power your spells. In addition to reducing the burden of a part of the element passing through the body, this can also be used to verify the imaginary tentacles behind the element's body. If there is a suitable medium, can you use the spell's principle of making a "delayed" spell ball to form a structure of a spell outside the body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without conscious control, a single element is always biased towards chaos, and only a mutual fusion can form a stable and orderly structure. Using the Array, magicians can simulate consciously existing situations and build spell elements. Siegel wants to push it further and to derive a more basic, flexible and adaptable legal system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He operates four elements and puts incense, sulphur, thread, oil and a few drops of his own blood as a casting material. Feel the process of forming a magic spell. This spell is called "Copper Wall Iron Wall" and is a spell that the Master casts to protect large buildings such as castles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer the long-lasting spell casts, the longer it takes to complete the "bronze wall" in half an hour. Siegel just uses this time to slowly understand the spell. The secret. Adjustments, controls, advances, and superpositions, one after another spell effects begin to appear in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is a barbed iron railing that rises up and wraps around the camp; the spider crawls on the railing and weaves a thick, sticky net; Beside the real camp, there are constantly false tents and phantom guards; a thick layer of fog is produced by the setting sun, and the evening wind on the prairie can't blow it away. Soon, the people in the tribe could not see the camp built by the outpost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
