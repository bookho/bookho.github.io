			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, it’s my fault, I didn’t find the missile, I was hit.” With a cry, after seeing Siegel, I vomited. "You suddenly disappeared, I am so scared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay, it's not your fault, it's a trick for me." Siegel comforted her. Dao: "I didn't expect the Masters Association to have made a big layout in the Goblin world. It has been able to control the heads of some countries. And..." He said after thinking about it: "I used magic to do things that I can fool. Goblin, but it is not the same as the Master's Lear, this is the biggest loophole."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, is it really my fault?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you have done a good job." He took a sigh of relief and patted the core crystal of the star with his hand. "The time spent playing outside is not short. Let's go home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two released the astral projection and returned directly to the underground dock at Heim's collar. "You have to stay here for a month or so to complete the installation of the outer armor. At the same time you have to learn to control the electromagnetic spider killer, teach them to attack, retreat and defend. I will often go down and see your progress, all of which are done. Then I will take you to the ground, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"喔..." Xingsuo is not very happy, but still promised. Siegel understands that she wants to go out to play. A spaceship should belong to the sky, not to the bottom of the earth. The sound of Xingsuo is soft, and Siegel has to say: "That's it, the outer armor must be installed. It's like a little girl has to have beautiful clothes. I will take you out when I dress. If you can be here Time to complete the training of the electromagnetic spider killer, I will give you a reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What reward, what reward?!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a secret, I won't tell you now." Siegel said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood of the spacecraft is much better, quietly squatting on the dock floor, allowing the makers to carry out the construction. Using the transmission array, Siegel sent hundreds of electromagnetic spiders down and handed the commanding scepter to the star rope in her core compartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in addition to the work of outer armor and ship-borne spiders, there are several magical arrays that Siegel needs to construct. For example, a space lock with a trigger mechanism prevents barrier enchantment of detection and prophecy. After all, now the opponent of the star is no longer a goblin, but a wizard with the same ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Siegel tried to adjust his mood, his mood was very lost. It became dumb for two consecutive days. Janet is one of the few people who know Siegel to go to the goblin world. When she looks at Siegel, she knows that her husband’s actions must have failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, Isaac will write his own name, he also painted a portrait of three of us, want to see?" Janet sent Walked the servant's golem. I personally took Ningshen tea to find Siegel. "His back and legs are very strong. I have been entangled with me for giving him a little pony. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ah, I don't think there is any problem, let Mavwilles pick a tame little mare." Siegel said. Sometimes he feels that he is too sentimental and looks too much for success and failure. I am only in my twenties, let a guy who has lived for tens of thousands of years counted once, what is the big deal? After being fooled by Lear, Siegel almost mistakenly thought he was at a disadvantage. It is clear that Xunzi is on his own side and Lear wants to pursue it. And he was afraid that he would hide his scorpion in a place where he could never find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this means must be there, Siegel thinks. As Leir said, chaos is the most uncontrollable force in the world, so there is no place in the multiverse that is more suitable for hiding things than the Chaos Sea. Just put the twentieth scorpion and the scorpion scorpion together and throw them into the chaotic sea. The completely disordered space and time turbulence will isolate them from all the search abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should write a letter to Lear, using this as a last resort. It’s okay to fight between the two mages, but Siegel doesn’t want this to involve the family. Janet and Isaac are not magical, and they have no power to fight on the battlefields of the two divisions. If Lear involved this matter to them. Then the blind man goes to the Chaos Sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Lear will also reply, if the blind man goes to the Chaos Sea, then there is no bottom line in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled apologetically and took Janet's hand: "Sorry, distracted. What are you talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just said, Did you officially find a swordsman teacher for Isaac, and lay the foundation from now on? He is waving everywhere with a wooden sword all day, and his energy is abundant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I think Mana is very good. Although her swordsmanship is not the best. But she knows how the mercenaries fight, and can make Isaac better guarded. And the guns are equipped, this weapon More need to master, it is more appropriate to find Mana."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you said it is not bad, just do it." Janet sat in Siegel. Beside him, put his two hands in his grasp: "Don't worry, Siegel, it's easy to be old. You are so young, Heim is so young, even if you encounter some setbacks, what can you do? Three of us can be peaceful and happy, what else can we not satisfy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dream Simple, able to have a stable home, love my husband and healthy children. My children don’t have to be abandoned, sold, or trained as spies like me. If I’m not in terms of easy capacity, unlocking and removing traps Specially, now I am afraid to receive a guest in a 妓+院, I am afraid of metamorphosis and disease. Now I am very satisfied, and I am grateful to the gods. You should also do this, even if no god will listen Your prayers, but gratitude should always have. Ignore what I have, always look at what I have not got, which will inevitably bring distress. I think that even God has something that he can’t get, so he has to It’s not the norm, it’s more worthy of cherishing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very reasonable, even if God has something that you can’t get." Nodded and kissed Janet on the lips: "The other thing you said is not bad. I am so young, I should do something meaningful, not to be bored here."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet blinks The long eyelashes trembled and asked: "What plans do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel cuddles his wife and steps into any door, directly to Bedroom: "Start from exercising!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After exclamation is laughter and gasping, and then there will always be a good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side of the wall barrier, the goblin waited for it to reappear after the Zenith Starship was attacked again. Silent goblin and bald goblin mobilize the army, has approached the kingdom of a star goblin. The plans they set were destroyed by the madmen of this country. This is something that cannot be tolerated. The elimination of it is the only result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands to reason that about half an hour or so, the Zenith Starship’s spacecraft should appear and begin a retaliatory counterattack. However, the goblins have waited for a long time but have not waited. A star goblin announced to the world that his weapons completely destroyed the zenith star invaders and did what other goblins could not do. He officially announced that a star kingdom is the most powerful kingdom of the whole earth, with the most advanced weapons and the most ferocious nuclear power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The era of the giants is over, there is only one leader on the planet, that is me, a great star! A brilliant star!" Crazy is still going on, but there are a lot of goblins who agree with him and have tried to go to that glorious country so that they can become a part of the strongest country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of silent goblins and bald goblins meet on the border, with a distinct line between the two sides. Opposite them, the number of chariots and armies is only less than one-third of them. One of the stars, the goblin border guards have already smashed their guns, ready to destroy the giants under the glory of the leader, and build a great one. Star Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is on the verge of exploding, and all the troops are waiting for the command of the attack. "Under the time, the kingdom of the stars has not really participated, which will lead to insufficient control." Lear talked to the Elves, who also agreed with the big prophet. "Without human participation, you can't control the production of divine power. Whether it is a dwarf or an elf, if you live here on a large scale, you will let the power of the racial god truly penetrate into this crystal wall. The goblin also has a race god, but now he still I didn’t find the world. The goblin now believes nothing, but if the goblin has faith and begins to pray to the gods of the race, the situation can’t be controlled.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's right. Humans don't have racial gods. This is the most convenient way to invade. Only they can guarantee the implementation of the plan.” The Elf Saint nodded. “You should do more of Evan's work and let him send troops as soon as possible. He is The greatest king of mankind, his participation is a must. The longer the time drags on, the more variables will be. Heim’s Sigling grows gradually, and his influence on Evan cannot be underestimated. This is also the inside of your human mage. The business needs to be resolved as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
