			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming a god is definitely an improvement in the long run, but in the short term, it brings a lot of trouble to Siegel. . ¥f. ¥f<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to satisfy the owner of Heim’s long-lost owner, the chef of Mier City has spent all his time preparing a rich feast for him. One, the eyes are not connected. There are many foods that have never been seen before in the city of Mire. They are either from the East Continent or the Western treasures from the starting point. It stands to reason that this will be a feast of taste, especially for Siegel who has eaten long-lasting elf biscuits and compressed dry food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be counterproductive, every dish has not yet come up, Siegel already knows what it is, what it tastes. If you can afford to lose your sense of novelty, then it is frustrating to foresee that you are full and thus feel full. Siegel needs to eat, but the body of the saint is not needed, and the magic god is unnecessary. Therefore, Siegel used his prophecy of the priesthood to satisfy his own desires and completely broke his own interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole of all is the way to go to God is too tricky. He can now fully invoke the power of the magic god, issue rules and even create saints and provide power to the pastor if he wants to have a magical pastor. But the fire is not completely integrated with him, but scattered among tens of thousands of clones. These clones add up to the magic god, in which the Star God network plays a central coordination role. When Siegel took the initiative to order, everything would act according to his will, but when he did not actively use it, the fire would come out from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as time goes by, the combination of Siegel and Shenhuo will become closer and closer, and eventually there is no need for a clone and a star network to rely on it. , you can fully grasp. So what he has to do now is to overcome this transition period, at least not at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you again for helping me accomplish my goal. By eliminating Lear, the dragon person you saw, my safety is guaranteed, my The family is also.” Siegel raised the cup and paid tribute to the four people who insisted on the last: “Do you have any wishes?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hope to continue research Spells, find the way the dwarf runes and magic combine." The dwarf's wish Siegel has been completed, so this is skipped. The half dragon people hope to become strong and become the most powerful mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, there is no way, you have to work hard." Siegel waited for the half-dragon to say something, and looked at the gnome Ke Ke. "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back to the School of Magic and continue to study, then go home." The gnome cut the lamb chops in front of him and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you lived in me for a while, the magic school will take a long time to open. Or I can send you home first, then let the magic The college picks you up. Time is a magical rule with different interpretations from different angles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney frowned at Siegel, although two Personal time is not long, but Chanem still feels that Siegel has made some changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know what I want." Chanem regained his serious expression and said to Siegel. "I want to pay as soon as possible. After all, I have other urgent things to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pointed at his head and said, "I am finishing here. A little bit about the prophecy of the priesthood, there are some things to tell you. The power of prophecy is absolutely accurate for God's domestic affairs. The farther away from the kingdom of God, the more blurred it is. The power of the previous magical god enveloped the East China, so After the emergence of the New World, his power will be loopholes. You have to go to other worlds and pursue the power of the murderous god, where you can’t fully predict the power of prophecy, and there may be conflicts with the gods of the same god in that world. Predicting the crystal ball for you, so that you can directly steal the power of prophecy, or see the long river, how about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney shook his head:" This is not what we said before, how can I use it is my own business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what I said is the best choice for you." Siegel narrowed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. I still insist." Chanem did not go to the semi-dragon to kick him under the table, but continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want Siegel to keep his promise, he is..." Chanem hasn't finished yet, and Siegel waved his hand and threw him out with a teleport. A snow-capped mountain is a good place to calm down, especially its space is also isolated by Siegel, there is no road down the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf dining cloth wiped the mouth and made a great effort to squeeze out a full meal: "I have eaten, can you give me a room, or I am going here?" The hotel is also available."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half dragon and the gnome also put down the tableware and nodded quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows that he has done something too much, closes his eyes and rubs his eyebrows, then gently swings his hand to indicate that they can leave. The banquet for the guests suddenly turned into a solitary dinner, and the people who ate had no interest at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ducks, pigs and roast chickens in front of them seem to want to say something, but certainly not to congratulate the birth of the new magic god. Those breads, salads and jams are nothing but the wreckage of plants and animals, hand-made in utensils. The vessels come from the earth, the people come from the flesh and blood, and the flesh and blood come from...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll!" Siegel pushes his hands forward, except for the table and chairs and the lampstand. All of them disappeared from the front. The servant, who was carrying the next big dish, panicked and threw the seafood chowder soup to the ground, and ran away with the roll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no master for a long time, there is no change in the mind and thoughts, so it greedily magnifies any fluctuations from emotions. Perhaps Siegel is now violent, not close to human feelings, losing self-control. However, he also understands that if he let go of the fire, he will continue to try to suppress, and the final result will not be neurotic, but because the object will be reversed, it will become a wave of ancient wells, similar to the state of the lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that his emotions will appear, and self-injury is hard to avoid. The only hope now is not to hurt others. "Think about it three times before you say it and do it, and look at the future." He kept telling himself in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the gods, time will pass easily inadvertently, and Siegel sat alone in the restaurant for more than two hours. When he came back to God, the sky outside was dark. He smiled, packed his clothes and sent himself to the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet has slept on the lounge chair, lying on the ground next to a novel, it seems very boring, no number of pages to remind people of dreams. There was a cradle beside her, and she and Siegel's little daughter closed their eyes in peace. She still has no name, only her mother calls her a baby. Siegel was careful, he took a light footstep and did not wake up the two dreamers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be his last child unless he uses the power to make one, but it is hard to say that it is a child or a saint. Siegel completely said goodbye to the flesh and blood, and the current appearance is just a shell. Fortunately, he still has a very obvious preference bias, and there are still some gods who have no gender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at my wife and children, he suddenly realizes that he knows what is lost and will cherish it. It is not too difficult for me to lead his wife and children in Heim to live this life and even give them eternal life. But the body that is filled with the Holy Spirit will eventually lose its universality. One day, the fire of their souls will be completely replaced by the fire of God. That is, they are no longer the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is the same. It is not impossible to give up the power to return to the mortal, but it will take at least a thousand years. Initially, he thought that as long as he eliminated Lear and no longer threatened, he could give up the fire and return to the mortal world like Lear. But he is different from the state of the former magical god. It is necessary to merge all the clones and bring all the fires together before you can talk about the abandonment. His situation is different, and the work he gets rid of is many times more trouble than Lehr, so how can it be hundreds or even a thousand years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t think about such a distant thing, you may have annihilated most of the humanity by then, and the rest of the divine is not willing to give up the fire, everything is just a fantasy. It's like a dead body that can't be canceled. Any harvest will come at a price, let alone become a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel moved his finger and Janet was transferred to the bed, and the quilt covered her body wearing only tulle. At this time, my daughter is estimated to be hungry, wake up and cry. When Janet heard that she was crying, she was directly hypnotized by Siegel's spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squeezed out the divine power from his fingertips, mixed with the pure water of creation, and slowly fed to his daughter. Just need a little, the little guy is full, and his face is flushed. The energy contained in it is too big, and Siegel is doing it for the first time, directly breaking her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
