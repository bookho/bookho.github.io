			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read_content_up();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking <路siluke〞info update is the fastest, no Pop-up window!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is located in the underground of the Light Tower, surrounded by thick soil and thousands of tons of rock. The thatched grass on the floor exudes a The smell of scent, the faint mist formed by the extreme humidity makes it very strange.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cell that slowly decays, without ventilation windows, There are no beds, no guards. The thick iron railings have rusted, but they are still solid, and the iron locks on the doors have become integrated with the railings, but the ones that shrink in the corners will not raise any objections.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is standing in a cell, the dark door is a wall here. With a weak torch, he sees a faint red color on the wall, revealing a piece A piece of saltpeter. The door to this cell is collapsed, as long as you can walk sideways.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the shadow says, a clear magical wave is in front, and Siegel can already feel it with the detection of magic. It is said that magical fluctuations can reflect a person's mood, just like a heartbeat, it will not lie. From the front In the volatility, Siegel clearly felt the resentment, anger and revenge, and there was a lot of grief mixed in.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was careful Going over, there are empty cell rooms on both sides. There are scratches everywhere on the walls, and there is a long-lasting curse that has been dried up and written with blood. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of all cells, it is an "interrogation room", at least the metal nameplate on the door is written as such. There is very little rusting here. One of the objects, this brand exudes a chill of horror. There is no lock on the door, just open it with a single push, then hòu Siegel will see the legendary "Mage Master".<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is an old woman. The gray hair is thin and thin. It hangs from the top of the head. The miàn is covered with a thick blood clot. The wrinkled face has a bruising beat. Traces, a few whip marks from the forehead to the corner of the mouth. Her body was wearing a tattered prison uniform, a burnt coke hole, and a hole that was whipped by her whip. Her waist and feet and ankles They are all dressed in shackles and fixed with several chains on the railings around them, leaving only a small range of activities. Her hands and wrists are locked in the iron ball, and the chain on the ball connects the cell ceiling. When the door came in, she didn’t respond. Although her eyes opened, she didn’t focus, just . Silly looking to stay far wall only <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "McGonagall Master? Siegel screamed softly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman responded, looked at Siegel, her eyes and mouth could not twitch, in her throat. An angry grunt. When she was shut in, there was a middle-aged knight with a sly face on her face. The man beat her the most embarrassing and painful, and she fell on a cold ground like a bag of potatoes. Her forehead touched the ground full of shackles, and her last thought was not revenge. Instead, she avoided the nose and mouth and hit the ground. Then she was hung on the chain and fixed in this "wide" cell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cursed everyone, Sir Pran, the lady, his fool son, the knight of his men, the inhabitants of his territory, and all the people associated with Pran. One day she wants revenge. If she can't, she will die. She feels that the magical energy in her body has already boiled, just like a volcano, but she can't, she doesn't have that ability.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you a Master Meg? Siegel asked: "I need to determine your identity." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! The prisoner spit a spit and said nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical fluctuations on the other side couldn’t be faked, and Siegel thought about it and took out his wand and started. Casting a spell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoner’s eyes widened and looked at the wand with excitement. Her mouth was slightly open, her lips trembled, but for a moment I can't say it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel used the wand to draw a few mysterious runes in the air, using the silent phantom spell to create three floating half-empty patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at it, which one is your emblem? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the register, Siegel knows that Meg's emblem is the hail that descended from the mountain. He used illusion to simulate this scene, but the three emblems are slightly different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These three are not mine." McGonagall tried to control his breathing and reluctantly said: "Your raindrops are not accurate. One should be a diamond."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and put away the illusion. "Hello, Master Mage. I am a member of the Mage Federation. For the sake of safety, I am sorry that I cannot tell you my name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are not going to let me go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel closed his eyes and thought about it, but hòu said: "You are now a prisoner of Viscount Pran. Even if you take a step back, you are his wanted man, and I will bear the consequences when you release it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pulsing the hell, this cursed annoyance Place!" Master Mage's angry body shook, and the chain creaked. He shouted loudly until the blind man shouted. "Bastards! Betrayal, swindlers, traitors, ungrateful villains! Don't die, you can't die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is so violent, she re-opens The wound, the blood slowly flowed down. She has vented countless angers, and now she can't hide the pain from her emotions. The appearance of Viscount Pran emerged in his mind, but more of his whip appeared. The burning pain goes deep into the bone marrow, and she will never forget it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did she stay here, she couldn’t count at all, only knowing that it had been a long time. As time passed, she calculated the speed of wound recovery and estimated it one or two days. But then I thought that I was malnourished, and the wound could not be healed at the usual speed, and it was doubled. For a long time, she often sighs for this, but she thinks that she may stay here forever, she will be afraid, and feel that the pain in front of it may just begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?" McGonagall said: "Look at the Masters, don't play any more games, just say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel clears the scorpion and says: "I was commissioned, I am looking for "Moonlight Moya". You have been holding this book for a long time, It is time to return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Water!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no problem. Siegel pulled out the skin from his body. It contains a condensate that relieves pain and fatigue. Said to be a potion. In fact, it is a tea made from the ingredients of the formula. Adding good red wine is much less effective than real medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the time is longer and the taste is fresh and refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water bladder floats on the edge of Meg, and the old woman swallows. The water ran down from the corner of the mouth and dripped in the thatched grass. She kept drinking until she stopped, but hòu took a long breath and said, "You gave me this, I will give you this book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Siegel wants this book. But she can't be led by her nose. If she is released now, I am afraid she will ask for more. The mage thought for a moment and decided to test the bottom line of Mage Master, so he said: "The book is the property of the federation. Returning this is what you should do. You can only provide extra help if you complete your obligations. If you want to leave here, it is impossible to exchange things that belong to the federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, still so careless." McGonagall seems Some strength has been restored. I looked up and said to Siegel: "What do you want? My spell book, or all kinds of magic potions I made?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am only now I want "The Moonlight Moya's Roll"." Siegel said: "Test your life. I can promise you, after I get the book, I will come back to see you and talk to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you won't be back." McGonagall said: "When you hold a book, you will definitely leave this damn place and never look back. It is a cursed land, only defeated and destroyed. Let the things you want be as rotten as the land here, sink into the garbage, never reappear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Meg's mood is very unstable, Siegel finally found this, and it is difficult for such people to talk properly. The mage lord frowned, and in addition to Janet's face in her mind, the beautiful head turned, and the back of the face was the terrible face of the bones. He can't let this happen, and he can't let the book slip away from his hand. Siegel wants to find a way for Meg to move from extreme to rational, so that she can continue to talk with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
