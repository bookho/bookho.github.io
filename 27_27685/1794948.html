			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months later, Ximu Town. WwW.XsHuoTXt.com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel that you are really uninteresting character, teacher William, where did you capture this giant squid?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, the giant squid in the deep sea can't fly. I just saw it fighting a sperm whale and took it back. In order to maintain the taste, It is killed by a cone of ice, but no dead spirit spells are used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a hundred meters long and weighs 80 tons. Was in the hands of William, the soft tentacles scattered on the surface of the sea, blocking part of the channel. The port of Ximu Town was not big, and it was basically shackled by it. Even if William sent the squid back, Ximu Town did not have enough lifting power to drag it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't eat squid, nor will I cook for you." Siegel shook his head helplessly, then turned and left. "The trouble of dragging yourself back, you can handle it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be like this, the squid is just your last name, not your totem. This doesn't catch up. "Well?" William took a loose shot and threw the giant squid into the harbor and flew to chase Siegel. "You are all a teacher, but also believe in the name curse this one? Don't tell me that you are so superstitious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel raised his hands and shouted "Oh my God! Why is this!" He stepped up until he returned to the hotel. William smiled behind him, a cynical look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel is called Stormy Night, and the stew here is still the same as in the past, full of the sea and the taste of freedom. The whole New World is changing, but it has not changed at all, and Siegel has to be very emotional. As a teacher. He can cast a spell to become a mansion. Stayed comfortably inside. But when I came to Ximu Town, I didn't eat a stew of Timothy, the owner of the distiller's nose, in the stormy night. That will definitely bring bad luck. This is by no means superstitious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss is still as passionate as ever, and does not overcharge his money because of Siegel’s exquisite clothes, at most it is only added to the hodgepodge stew. Only prawns. The only thing that made him complain was that Siegel had wrapped up the entire hotel. Although he paid enough room, it was obviously not friendly enough. It wasn't until Siegel took out five hundred silver coins for him, so that if he had someone to inquire about the accommodation, he would give it to the guest as a full compensation. He only reappeared his smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reputation is more important than money, my dark-haired child, remember my words." Timothy's bright red nose decided to go The kitchen is busy. Siegel paid the money, but he couldn't eat anything prepared according to the number of rooms. It is also a good act to make the seafood easy to break. It is better to make it to the hard work on the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, summoning the Master Chamber of Secrets or casting a hidden mansion spell is more convenient than now. Why do you have to live here?" After Siegel entered the hotel, William received I played a playful expression and became serious again. "Can you tell me who you are guarding against?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone. I don't know who it is." Siegel snapped a finger and hid the magic enchantment at the corner of the hotel to start working. Pass the wrong information out and cover up their conversation. "Is still not able to find a dwarf stone boat?". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I don't want to understand this. According to the dwarf's record, the 100,000 dwarfs were transported over the sea by a stone boat, even if it was used. The rune of the space class should also have a large volume. I flew several rounds back and forth on the sea, and also explored the film world, but there was no clue."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you say that the dwarf may have mastered some sort of stealing technique that we don't know, can hide a big ship?" Siegel is most worried about this. If there is such a dwarf rune, then they may hide the weakness of the crystal wall and prevent other races from being known as William's plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William secretly went to the goblin wall system for a turn, using the spell to reverse search for weak areas of the crystal wall, a total of three. After returning to the New World, he found a place near the northern part of the Walled Mountains, near the Holy Land of the Jackdaw Tribe, and not far from the location where Siegel discovered the statue of Reid. He used the spell enchantment to hide the location and then look for the other two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the federation, William informed the chief of the various factions of the council about the situation. A crystal wall system represents countless opportunities and massive resources that can make anyone earn a pot. The Security Council voted on the matter and Siegel voted for one of two abstentions. In the case of other approvals, the federation decided to keep this secret and began planning to enter the goblin world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"William, I still think it’s not a good idea to hide a crystal wall entrance and exit. Is it possible to defend this entrance and exit and benefit from it by virtue of the strength of the federation? I think the risk is too big, much higher than the possible benefits.” Siegel said: “The dwarves have already planted their heads on this matter, their bodies have floated down the shield river, and a lot of life has been taken away by the war. I I don't want to see the mages face the same situation: the corpse is everywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know your kindness, but we are not dwarves after all. Their means are single, There is no flexibility, and their strategy is wrong from the beginning.” William has a well-thought-out smile with a confident smile: “The dwarf wants to destroy the goblin, occupy the world, and then emigrate. The most mentally retarded immigration method in the world is war. It’s not an immigrant but a colony. The wrong way leads to wrong results. The dwarf’s combat power is high, but the tactics are too singular, just being smothered by the goblin’s musket. The purpose is clear, entering, lurking, learning, searching. Killing a goblin or killing 100 million goblins is not good for the federation. Only knowledge and resources to support research are valuable things. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William understands very well that Siegel is a conservative to a certain extent. He can take risks, but he only takes his life safety as a bargaining chip. Never want to count the lives of others. This is especially true in the face of war. Look at the preparations he made at Heim's collar and you will know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can use the arms race to let opponents dispel the idea of ​​war. Siegel will be happy to make all the weapons, scare off the enemy, and then all of them are wasted, turning into rusted scrap iron in the warehouse. A person of this character, unless the war is inevitable, will not endorse any risky move unless he has sufficient judgment and preparation for the entire situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, the Masters Association has begun to operate one of the walls of the crystal wall. If it wasn't for me, I used the location to hide the one in the northern mountains. I am afraid it has already been They are found. You can choose a safe approach, but you should not underestimate the power of the Masters Association. If we do not catch up, we will soon be eliminated. Only a more relaxed environment and ideas can not be truly lasting, for the Master In fact, the opportunity to learn magic and the knowledge of knowledge is truly decisive appeal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened when the last federation took such an adventurous action? Is the lesson of the Knox Association not enough?". Siegel shook his head and still was not convinced: "Are you sure you won't say at the dwarf's meeting that there is a weak spot in the north?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "As long as the Masters Association does not mention this matter, then don't say it." William looked at Siegel and his eyes were firm: "Since the Masters Association has found one of the weak points, they must be like me. There are ways. Know the total number of weak points. Although the northern mountains are now obscured by my spells, I believe that within five years, the Masters Association will certainly be able to find out the detailed position. Don't be lucky about their reconnaissance ability, Lear is not The general prophet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello! Is he still a omnipotent god?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect William to be laughed at all, and the expression became more serious. He took out his wand and cast several spells to strengthen his ability to prevent peeping and prophecy. Even so, he stood up and paced back and forth in the room with a hesitant expression on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, you have raised my curiosity," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you always have to meet with Lear, and you are mentally prepared in advance." William sat down and looked at his toes. "Lee is different from all the divisions. He is the only prophecy teacher in the history of history, the only special ability and prophecy. Its true power is not certain, but we speculate that his specific ability is to escape death. He has lived in the world for at least four thousand to five thousand years. This is the limit of the record we can find."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Undead?" The first thought of this: "Is it disguised by the lich?". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, the Masters Association and the City of Learning will not look at a lich sitting in that position anyway." William said: "You know me." I like to travel, but if I only walk on the old and new continents, I will not be famous for this. I have been to many places, other countries, other planes. I have already seen it when I have not yet become a teacher. There are more than twenty different worlds. One thing that always surprises me is that there is no magic god in our world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
