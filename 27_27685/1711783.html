			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village was busy all the time, and dozens of hands quickly cleared all traces, faster than the vultures and crows on the prairie. Clothes armor and weapons can't be left, but they can be sold to nomads on the grasslands. There is a sign of the black day on the shield, so it can only be melted into a wok, and it can also change a lot of money. The body was to be smashed, and then the face was smashed, and a deep valley was thrown in to ensure that no one could find it. Although the horse is worth the money, it can't stay, it can only kill the meat. So after a while, the chef was not surprised when he came up with horse meat and stewed peas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The peas are cooked, your craft is still not good enough, every time you can make a good meal." Jeff said this, But still dig a large spoon on his plate and cover it on the black bread. "Forget it, it's hot, it's better than in the mountains." He drank a few more sloppy ciders, which showed a sour taste, and Janet gave up after taking a bite. However, Jeff did not care. He said to Siegel: "Continue to say the jazz. We found His Royal Highness and warned him of a possible attack. The prince attached great importance, so he stayed with the jazz so that he could show his ability. The loyalty of the royal family. The jazz is very serious, and every day he is dedicated to defending the safety of the prince. Fortunately, the eater is not allowed to succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The jazz is not injured. ?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, he is very good. But he later said that fortunately, the main target of the trolls was the prince and the morning guards around him, and he was lucky enough to escape. The prince's swordsmanship is superb, and it is unexpected to everyone. Although he was injured, he still insisted on the rescue. Unfortunately, he did not catch the eater's head. He actually became a one under the dawn of the morning sun. The smog disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the power of the spell. How can the prince not help the caster?" Siegel felt very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, it was originally a mage, but I left before that day. It seems to be the execution of the prince's order. In short, it is unfortunate." Jeff I stuffed some food into my mouth and said, "After that we went all the way north, and joined Count Todd in the vicinity of Deepwater City, the prince’s injury was almost as good. Sir Bill had thought that things could be settled, and The opportunity to rush to the top of Mora, but Count Todd wants Sir Bill to become his vassal. Although it is only a Knight of the Freedom Knight, but promised that the Jazz will get a territory, just in the area of ​​the East Lake of the Stars. The Jazz readily accepts, swears allegiance Then I took me to the north together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have received a letter from the jazz, should it be this time? He said he can't go The head of Mora meets us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I still find the messenger to send out, I am glad that you can receive it." Jeff said: "The jazz has been very worried about you, especially you, he often Oh, but His Royal Highness and Count Todd asked us to keep the secrets of our mission confidential and not to be able to communicate with each other, so we couldn't write to you after that. Now everyone is still in the mountains, I was sent out to buy food, but I can Take you up. The details can only be told by the Jazz and you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here is so poor, you rely on them to trade with the grassland people, collect food? Black blood What is the viscount of the fort, isn't he a sealed knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a knight, but unfortunately neither knows how to operate, nor gathers people’s hearts, Moreover, he is not a knight of a star-studded country. The Brad-Slitter family has been loyal to the Saus dynasty, and there has been border friction between the Saus dynasty and the starry country. Although the Black Blood Fortress will not blatantly fall into the stone - He didn't dare to bring such a big trouble to his master—but it always made some scorpions. For example, all the men were pulled away, the food was collected and stored in the castle, and the cavalry was cut off. What."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's awkward. I don't know what the prince is going to do in this place." Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't ask me, I don't know." Jeff said while eating: "Even if I know that I can't say it, the oath is a vow." I will take you up the mountain to find the jazz, and I can guarantee that this is a young master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Master? I am not a young master." Shaking his head, his brows are confused: "I don't know who my parents are, why do you say that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Bill has himself The land is sealed, but he still has no wife, no children, and you are his apprentice, so you are a young master.” Jeff Gold coins grinned and said: “I just made a joke to you, don’t think too much. You The two have to eat more, and for these civilians, there are no good conditions on the mountain. And in my experience, we have to go quickly to prevent the weather from turning bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
