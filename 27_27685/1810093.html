			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty, before the storm of dust has not completely shrouded here, I suggest you leave as soon as possible." Siegel gave Evan a look, clear Qing Zizi said: "You came here with your own body. If the dust has a bad influence on you, it will directly affect you. I actually use the projection method, and the association's mage can also In the way of projection, there is a way to avoid danger. Do not believe you ask Master Lear, I believe he is the same idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, His Majesty, now It should go back through the crystal wall channel. We have to go back." Lear made a gesture of asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan looked at the two men and fully understood the status of the Stars in the confrontation between the association and the federation. Siegel is a little better, at least not giving him the feeling of "throwing away when he runs out." However, Siegel’s phrase “Don’t pull in someone else” also made him feel a little uncomfortable. Is the human kingdom just a burden in the whole thing? Looking at Siegel, Evan wants to swear by him: As a good friend of mine, can you not help you, but will drag your hind legs, and even end up hurting you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom of stars can stand up to today, and it is certainly not enough to rely on a castle that is difficult to break on a mountain. If you only rely on the Cavaliers, how do you deal with the Temple and the Masters Association, and how do you continue to expand under the encirclement of elves and dwarves? Evan has a faint feeling that his royal family will not look as simple as it seems, and in the dusty history, he will be able to find out how the ancestors should deal with the secrets of the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The association left several mages to deal with the finishing of the magic array, while also strengthening the foundation to check the impact of the earthquake on the tower. After that, they also need to start the magical array of the periphery, turning the array of dense fog into a wind wall, at least to reduce the influence of the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Masters escorted His Majesty the King to leave the Wall Channel. Siegel looked at the eyes of the association's mage, knowing that he must not stay in the tower to continue to visit, so he waved his hand, sent it back to the star, and then ascended to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To endure a hard journey, come on. Stars." After Siegel got on the boat, he said: "Add one to yourself with higher creation. The layer of lead armor, the thicker the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!" Xingsuo knows what Siegel did in the Master Tari. The spacecraft and the sergeant can go home directly by ending the projection, but Lear’s finger can’t. For this action, watching the legendary squad is just a cover. Being able to understand the seeds of the locks and legendary spells is an unexpected surprise, but the real purpose is only the fingers of Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put your fingers in the space bag and put them in the pocket of Siegel. When the Stars began to fly, they also entered the alert state, and all the electromagnetic guns and the killer magic spiders were armed. Two people rushed toward the thick black clouds, but felt like they were plunging into the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mushroom cloud produced by the nuclear bomb explosion has a high heat. The same is true for dust formed by disasters such as volcanoes. They keep rising until they reach the height of the rain cloud. There will be no rain washes here, and their temperature will not decrease for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They soon tasted this uncomfortable taste. The pervasive heat and radiation dust came in through the cracks, and the dark red sparks and the shadows of the yellow light flashed in the wind, and a stinging sensation appeared on the bare skin. This kind of pain was shielded after Siegel was transformed into a scorpion form, but the interference of the dust energy still exists, just like the sacred bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo only said that he is very hot, but the protective fire element damage spell does not respond well to this situation. Fortunately, the star is not a living body, her steel body will not mutate in the dust, the temperature in the clouds makes her uncomfortable. But it does not cause damage to the external armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people rushed to the sky and went to the thin air, where there was a lot less dust, but more violent electric energy. The star is constantly hit by the lightning from the bottom up, playing her constant voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at these "lightnings", the elements of the elements are not very powerful, is it so painful? He recited the spell and kept the protective lightning damage magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo feels that he is protected by the power of his master, and he is comfortable and screams, and then uses his memory to find the way back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
