			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun moves like a snail in the hope of everyone, and everyone can only wait patiently. When the mountain finally blocked the sun, the shadows spread, and the valley appeared half of the dark and half of the landscape. Elf Lia stepped on the light pace, silently moving forward on the slope, and there was no dust on the ground. Dio followed closely, biting the axe in his mouth, and squatting down and striding. He sometimes supports the ground with a strong arm, and every time he exerts his force, he will quickly move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel glared at the dwarf and made brute force to help Elinte improve his speed. After the dwarf put on his full body armor, the weight was amazing, and the cloth on the foot was silent, but it was easier to stir up the dust. Siegel helps the dwarves share the weight and minimize this effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the heavy gasping of the dwarf in the ear, Siegel added a force to his arm. The body of the dwarf has begun to fail to keep up with his fighting spirit, but Elint himself does not admit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lia runs while picking up the longbow from behind. Just listening to a bang, a white feather arrow shot from the window. At the same time as the surprised "enemy attack" shouted in the watchtower, the barbarian had already smashed the wooden door and rushed into the tower inside the splashing debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can finally spit out the flying axe in the mouth, Dio is about to be smashed. "Blessings of the gods, death, bulls, power! Kill!" There was a deafening trench in the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, Siegel!" The dwarf slammed a hand and said, panting, "The man is crazy, he forgets everything, you Go and grab two live!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!" Siegel let go of the dwarf and broke out at an amazing speed. He held a machete in his right hand and took out the net in his left hand, striding toward the watchtower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who fell from a broken wooden door, wearing a characteristic inlaid leather armor, had no weapons in his hands. Siegel looked at it with a little distraction and found that the skull of this person had been smashed by the giant stick, and there would be no hope for life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lia stood outside the window and bent to the arrow, covering the barbarians fighting inside. When she saw Siegel rushing up, she shouted loudly: "There is a warrior inside, don't smash it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel didn't want to understand for a moment This is why, it has already rushed into the watchtower. There are two bodies inside, one is the arrow that penetrates the throat, and the other is cut into two halves by a curved blade. Three others are besieging Dio, two flexible humans and a maddening dwarf. Siegel noticed that there was an active sergeant in the corner of the room, waving with a spear. It has been trying to join the battle group, but the action is sluggish and is always blocked by the three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few people did not respond, and Siegel quickly threw the net out of the mankind behind Deo. The man rolled and rolled on the ground, trying to pull the net with both hands and trying to drill it out. Siegel would never let him do so, stepping over in two steps, slamming the man's temple with a machete handle and stun him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flying knife flew to the side of Siegel, and the arrow shot by Lia flew. The man pulled out three more flying knives and circled the wooden door - there was no way to aim from the window. Siegel held a pair of knives and made a nervous look, watching carefully the three flying knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kid, weird, you dare to do it right with me! Let you know the strength of my dart king..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the words have not been finished, a siege hammer hits his side. The "Dart King" hangs a large piece of dust on the wall, and plays two times on the ground. The mouth spits blood, leaving only the ability to twitch. The "Siege Hammer" blocked the entire door and shouted: "Who killed my brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last dwarf attacker was surrounded by the enemy It seems that I don't care, and I am more aggressively attacking Dio. There was a weird scream in his mouth, completely ignoring the wound on his body, only knowing to attack with the greatest strength. Dio seems to have also been provoked by the savage, the giant stick and the enemy's mace violently collided, making a dull bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You traitor!" Elinette rushed to the crown and threw the hammer in his hand. The hammer rotates inside and emits a red glow. The dwarf felt the threat of death and seemed to have recovered a little bit of wisdom and raised the mace to try to block the blow. But the gem clan's powerful magic weapon directly shreds the mace, just as easy as breaking a toothpick. In the rising flame, the flying hammer smashed the dwarf's face bone and then flew back to Elinte's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel remembered the words of the wizard master and quickly hugged Dio's waist. Despite being dragged down by two steps, Siegel succeeded in pulling the barbaric. "Don't smash it, things are awkward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manor stop After the next step, the power of violentness gradually faded from the body, and the brain became better. He also found it wrong at this time: Although he always wanted to use weapons to attack the "invaders" in the house, he always did not leave the wall more than one meter away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lia came in and said to everyone: "Don't destroy this sergeant, otherwise its owner will be inductive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, is there an evil spellcaster who dominates this behind the scenes?" Elinette looked at the dwarf's arm on the ground and had a broken hammer. Elinette had a disgusted expression, and then spit on the ground: "Hey! It really is a dwarf, the goods from the old continent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Let's ask this guy in the net." Lia shook her head and said: "You guys are still unrelenting, and their brains are hot. Only Siegel can remember what to do, or even a The tongue can't be caught."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's right, we are all too excited." The dwarf touched the beard and stepped on the net with his foot. That guy, just step a few times. The man slowly woke up and found that the hammer burning in flames was a finger away from his nose, and it was clear that the hair was curled under the influence of heat. He said in a hurry: "Surrender, surrender!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrogation was done by the dwarf alone, and Dio returned to the item placed under the hillside, Siegel Responsible for cleaning the battlefield. This is his first real execution of the battle plan - all of which have been subjected to various sneak attacks or unexpected situations. He likes the feeling that he can successfully complete the action when the plan is executed correctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the dwarf came out and looked very dignified. He called everyone together and said: "The things are a bit complicated. These pieces are hired and come here to do some cornering. I think our treasures may be eyeing."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?" asked Lia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some of the casters also have mercenary guards who came here ten days ago and used the spell to cover the attack tower. They also have camps in front, here only But it's a blind man. Other things don't know the tongue, I tried it, he can't recall the specific details of the hirer. I guess his brain has been done by the caster." The dwarf's angry lame, double fists Said: "These damn magicians, not tampering with memory or operating the dead, are not good things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do next?" Lia asked Road: "The caster can't deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarians naturally don't fear any battle, just to speak, they are stopped by the dwarves. Elinette looked at Siegel and grabbed the young man's wrists with both hands and said to him: "Children, the front is very dangerous, it is no longer a simple treasure hunt. You are just beginning to embark on this path. I shouldn't suddenly face such danger. My suggestion is that you stay here and look at this prisoner. I have promised that he will let him live as long as he cooperates, but I am also worried that he will escape and expose our whereabouts, so it needs to be here. One person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought for a moment and nodded. He lowered his head and walked into the room without saying a word. Elinette spread his hand and said helplessly: "This is also for him. He is too young."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shouts of the captives suddenly sounded in the tower: "What are you doing? Take the ropes? Ah... it hurts!" The barbarian pointed to the watchtower, and asked doubtfully: "Siegel will not kill the captives? He doesn't look like that kind of person?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice quickly went silent, and then Siegel came out, he looked relaxed. "I have completed the task of guarding, and the person will never run away. I have a special knot, which I learned from the boat. He will tighten as long as he struggles with the rope, and it will be estimated if he struggles twice. I strangled myself. I showed him the role of the rope. He has made it clear that he will never move. And my mind and soul tell me that I should face difficulties with my companions. Even if you stun me. I will go to find you after I wake up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf is a sigh of relief, this is his favorite Siegel, Irene is on the west Geer raised his thumb. Dio is more interested in another thing, and has been asking: "Can you teach me the rope tie method? I can use it back to the tribe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
