			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Master of the Lawyers Association has a wizard named Madeleine Taylor who is my daughter," Idis said. "I will unite through her." Some of the secrets of the meeting could be smuggled out of the nuclear drawings, a total of twenty-seven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty-seven of the forty-two, the number It’s already a lot.” Siegel sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The high-level mantra of the federation, I have collected some of it myself, and I can hand it over. After entering the sergeant, various spells I was very strict in control, and only the management of the federation was loose. I was drilling this loophole. I was thinking that if Madeleine might enter the sergeant, she would still leave something for her. A few books. I want to use these to exchange, I hope you can save her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When is the drawing handed over?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the construction of the magic spacecraft, the copied drawings have been sent away. The former Master who participated in the construction of the first Mier nuclear nuclear also provided some drawings, early Also sent away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow Shell Master is furious, and the body is steaming up and down with a negative energy flame. The grievances and the spirits are surrounded by her. If it is not the spell here that suppresses the enchantment, these dead spirits have already rushed to clean the Itis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t worry, Master Shelley is not a time to punish." Siegel said to Edith: "I will still hand you over to safety." Council, this time you don't want to hide things. If you can say that the Federation can recover the high-level spells, whether or not the board passes, I will contact Madeleine Taylor to keep her away from the Peruvian nuclear. I can't guarantee anything other than that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long does it take for Peru to check out the explosion?" Idis asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know this, or that sentence, I only have theoretical inferences, I have never done this kind of experiment." Siegel patted the robe, Finally, I looked at the decadent Idis: "Oh. I am leaving. I will not come to see you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel!" Diss suddenly raised his head and said loudly: "In the southeast corner of my room, from the bottom to the second brick, there is a bottle of medicine inside. It is a life potion made by the Masters Association. Please promise me to figure out what is inside. Why? Extend life. If it is not for it, I am not... I really should have died long ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I have time, I am only a federation. One member, can't promise you for everyone." Siegel turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Shelley came out with Siegel, leaving Edis to be re-enclosed in the dark and silent silence. “The council can start working, find high-level magic materials as soon as possible, and keep it safe.” Siegel said to Shelley: “I can’t do everything with the council. On the one hand, it’s really a problem, on the other hand. I don't want the federation to return to the state of the Big Three. After completing the magic ship, many things can't be handled as easily as in the past. To regard the Masters Association and the City of Learning as enemies, you must be nervous about both inside and outside." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the Masters Association is so miserable, now there are still Masters eating inside!" Necromancer Shelley pinched his fist: "Never lightly spare these people! One has to grab one, put them on the flame and burn it into fly ash!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My opinion is that killing is never a solution to the problem, it will be in vain Wasted the ability of the caster.” Siegel said as he walked: “I don’t want to say anything, I’m going to have a decision on the board. I’ll tell you that I’ll be there. Idis’s physical condition doesn’t look good, first. Find the curse as soon as possible Information, this is the most important thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you find the spell information, is it really necessary to inform the female mage called Madeleine?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s footsteps are slightly. Then continue to move forward. "Pledge is a promise, I will definitely do this. But I also worry that this is a kind of contact code, or even some kind of early warning mechanism of the Masters Association. So the best way is to secretly check the situation of Madeleine. See if it is true, as Edith said. This thing can be done after the spell data is reclaimed. Itis has not been anxious to tell the truth, we can not worry in certain circumstances."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snowley nodded and understood Siegel’s plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the process of construction, we can continue to practice spells and spells. This is a win-win situation." Master Wiewood respectfully said to His Majesty the King: "The Federation is willing to cooperate with the kingdom of stars to cope with the goblin. The threat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the people of the federation are more sober, threatening the word is very good. Others are just saying opportunities." Evan nodded Approved, he saw Siegel come over. Then he said to the mage around him: "Thank you for your explanation, accompanied by the Master. Siegel is coming. Let him do the next thing to send the King!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizards laughed and turned and left after the ceremony. Others are also some distance away from the two, leaving room for conversation between the king and the sorcerer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I listened to them, the original idea of ​​this spacecraft is completely out of your mind, and the most critical secret nuclear can also be your design. Evan said: "Give me the truth, is this magic spaceship not the strongest thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not." Siegel I thought of a virtual gun. Although there are still many principles that are not understood, but as a weapon, the power of the virtual cannon is unstoppable by the magic spacecraft. "The new era is coming. Will this be the best or the worst? It will depend on how it will change in the next decade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am thinking about Aaron. If he didn't transfer the throne, the kingdom of the stars really fell into the civil war. Isn't that the whole era missed? I just thought about why my luck is so good, inheriting the kingdom of stars. Can things go so well?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a question that cannot be answered. In the end, the extent to which the blood magicians changed their bloodlines affected the fate of the royal family. This is probably something that cannot be calculated. In the past, Evan was buried in the history of the royal family with the death of the old king. Among all the "good luck", the reason for giving Evan Star's surname to get rid of his illegitimate child's identity is what it is, and I am afraid no one can answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, after watching the magic ship, I began to understand why the royal family parted ways with the Masters Association, why are they so afraid of the emergence of the Master of the Master. Really, If you control this magical spaceship. Who can stop you from attacking the castle of the kingdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sense will stop me." Siegel spread his hand: Let's just say. How many meanings does it have to lay down so many castles and occupy the vast territory? The last Master of the Master launched a war, not a land, but a test of his own spell power, while trying to challenge the temple system. I am against myself. The spell ability has a clear understanding. My opponent is not a starry royal family, so there is no need to launch a rebellion. But here, I have to give you a piece of land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ah? What position?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The trans-continental transmission array was basically completed, and I occupied five uninhabited islands at sea. When it was the site of Heim’s collar. According to these The trend of the island, the transmission array has been connected to the vicinity of Qiya City, from where it is the most cost-effective and most efficient way to go. But until now, the Federation has not been able to negotiate with the Earl of Passy in Qiye City. The thing, the old man is not letting any magical things come ashore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, the old man! Don't worry, I will convince him." Wen smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not that simple." Siegel said: "The Federation reports to me. The reason for the inability to negotiate is mainly because the consultants of the school city are obstructing it. , smashing the role of the Federation's transmission array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can the consultants of the school have more weight than the king's words?" Evan said no. "These are the aristocrats and lords who have vowed to pledge allegiance, their honor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The glory of the king cannot break the lord's jurisdiction over his territory. Siegel sighed. Said: "We have carefully studied the map and found that all the places that can go ashore have a school counselor. If we try one, it will only intensify the contradiction on the table. If the confrontation is positive, the current federation is not the opponent of the association. I can only do it by myself, so I can only come to you. The best solution is this: the royal family replaces a territory for him, and exchanges a royal collar with a royal collar."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me a reason, just to transfer the shore to shore, can't convince me." Evan said: "Only enough temptations can be used to allow Count Passy to agree. Everything in the royal family name is very valuable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
