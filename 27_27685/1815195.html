			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire magic school’s square is full of Siegel’s clo, their eyes are shining like a torch, their The mouth is not broken, saying that no one can understand it. The power of the fire of the gods shuttles back and forth between these Clos, forming more than a dozen quick trajectories. Every time you hit Crow, you will leave some of your divine power to transform your body, and the amount of remaining fire will be reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Lear waved his claws, chasing the fire, trying to catch them in vain. But once this process begins, it either succeeds or fails, but it will never go halfway. Shenhuo wants to find someone to carry it. When it is found, it does not allow any outside forces to interfere - unless this power is stronger than Shenhuo. Lear couldn’t catch up, couldn’t catch it, and couldn’t stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the power of Lear’s magical sacred person, and with the source of the fire, the fire had already burned him. As time passed, Siegel waking up several times in a coma, woke up and coma, and gradually grasped the power of fire. Lear was gradually suppressed, and finally he lay on his back and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem went over and looked at him with a condescending look, and shook it gently: "God returns, the Holy One is not conscious. If you are completely Abandoning the saints and becoming a mortal who can live forever, or is it possible to leave from here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No {will not succeed." Lear bite Tightly close, strong self-sustaining. He has no backhand. Once he gives up the saints, he can only compete with other mortals in the normal way. He knows the traps he has set, and the so-called normal way is simply not possible. So he does not believe that Siegel will succeed, neither willing nor can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will soon be ignited, explode and then die, the fire will regroup, and the way back to the frozen crystal will smash me, no one Can become a magical god, only I have such qualifications and strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what I hate most?" Chanem will his own right hand It turns into a shadow and condenses into a knife: "I hate those gods who say that power is theirs, they are always theirs, they are all helpless! I want to be free, I want Sadai, so I occupy it like you. The guy who doesn't understand the failure is the most annoying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha can't attack me, but what about the knife?" Lear laughed at him: You can't overcome the rules of the Kingdom of God here, even if I am lying here, you can't do anything. <>"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who said I want to attack you? "Chanem constantly gathers the power of the shadows and moves the whole body's holy power to his hand, which is not preserved at all." Soon, a pure black, like the shortness of the night sky, is now only in front of him, in which the cruelty, ambition and efficient and precise killing power of the murder god are gathered. He himself became a mortal body, sweating and exhausted, and the short sword sat on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be a new true god appearing in a while, I am still in his kingdom of God. If you don't do this, I am afraid it will be directly suppressed." When I looked at Lear, I finally persuaded: "The time is running out, you have to think about it for yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, you want to lie to me crazy Now, even the Holy One has given up, even the reason is not, I believe that the Master will succeed? You are a trick, you want to lie to me to give up the Holy Power, you will kill the first time you can attack me!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney is no longer persuaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the numerous voices of Siegel’s shreds of speech, there has been no roar of battle. The trio 66 continued to come out of the room and was stunned by the sight. The gnome's wheelchair has long since rotted, and now supports himself with flying. He came to a "Siegel" and reached out to touch it, but was picked up by the holy curtain and his fingers raised smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I still feel that my ability to make a magic image is very strong. I didn’t expect Siegel to be able to make it in large quantities. The figure is still quite good. , but what do they use and can they cast spells?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cro in front of him suddenly turned his head and said "can" and then continued self-mumbling. The gnome was shocked and stumbled back and flew backwards until he hit the dragon. "It's too weird!" Ke Ke patted his head: "I think it's safer to go back to the room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the white of the nine rooms The dome begins to disappear and dissipates in the air like a bubble. Also disappearing is the wreckage of the Magic Tower. The widely circulated library, the prophecy crystal ball and the magical beast on the wilderness also turned back into the shadow of the sly, and disappeared in the blink of an eye. There is only a flat white marble floor on the square of Nuo Da, and there are tens of thousands of Sigels and the rest of the Magic Academy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel opened his eyes and woke up completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Lear made a scream and his body began to burn. The magic god has already been produced. His saint has no fate line anymore. Life and death are only between the gods. Siegel thought that he did not have the necessary existence, so he directly destroyed Lear. It may be that the screams are a little annoying, and Siegel’s frowning, the flames screaming ten times, and the whole process is completed in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Chanem expected this, he still felt that the tooth was a little painful when he saw the process of destroying a saint by the main body of the god. He looked at Siegel and asked: "What is your current state?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still a little dizzy." Siegel squeezed his fist hard and pulled hard Stretching out his muscles, the great effort stretched out. "I am still a speculative method. The aftereffects are still there. I need to adapt slowly." He looked at Chanem and nodded to him: "I promised that you will do something, but you should wait a little. I need time to get complete control. Right, you put the shadow dagger in the space item. I am always reminded in my mind, just like the warning that can't be turned off, all point to your holy power. Weapons, troubles are bothering to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is okay." Chanem nodded, put away his arms, no longer speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Clo is sitting meditation, only the body of Siegel stands. He released the star god in his hand and painted a circle to protect it. At the same time, the secret nuclear furnace was also placed on the sacred crystal, and the power of repair was continuously provided. If the scale is too large, the star god may be born with self-consciousness, and this danger must be confronted. But fortunately, the Star God can only connect to Segal's Clo, which essentially connects one individual, and the number may never go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is as drunk as it is, and it takes two steps. With the help of the fire, the spell is instinct, so he can adapt quickly, but manipulating the body is another matter. It’s not a comfortable thing to have more than 10,000 of the brains at once. He just wants to concentrate hard. <> After swinging like a baby toddler, he finally looked like a normal person when he acted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trio came over and did not speak, Siegel said: "Yes, I am a god now, but with the general god The difference. I will slowly recover, thank you for your concern. The Magic Academy will open, but it will not work for a while. Leave your magic emblem, I can always find you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ke Ke slightly mouth, Siegel nodded and replied: "Yes, you haven't asked yet. I know what you are going to say, so I answered it directly. This state is very Blame, don't talk, let me adjust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this perspective, Siegel may be the most embarrassing magic god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first thing, let the magic of the Thunder Wall world return to normal." He concentrated on consciousness, let the chaotic spell effect become rule again, the element Combined with spells more closely. Since Siegel himself will be the dwarf's runes and elves' magic, he also touched the dragon's magical ability by binding the dragon spell, so from his beginning, these spells are all called magic, and they can be common to each other, no longer obvious. The gap is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, the more you change, the more trouble." Siegel’s face is much better, he clap his hands, Chanem and the trio are all He was taken to the city of Mire and appeared directly in the hall of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards clenched their weapons at once, and the servant was shocked. When you see that Heim is the master, everyone has come back. "Prepare for the banquet, first eat some things, I am tired. These are my friends, entertain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you crazy? How can you? Come to the crystal wall with the real body!” Chanem suddenly shouted: “Your strength is enough, is it okay?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There was no crystal Is the wall destroying or destroying the storm?” Siegel gestured to everyone to let the servant send the shield to the river and break the throat. The Janet wind that received the news ran over and stood in the corner of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet, don't doubt, it's me." Siegel said: "I have been out for so long, I am really bothering you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I know." Jenny nodded and her eyes were wet. She took a deep breath and thought of one thing, then said to Siegel: "You are busy first, and some things go back and talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
