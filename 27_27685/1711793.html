			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear makes Siegel difficult to breathe, he can hardly resist the urge to stand up and run away. In order to ensure that the magic array's effect can operate correctly without interference, the lamp god is also sent to a distant place. Now the Dwarf Palace has only one enemy of the Blood Sorcerer, and the exit of the escape is behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Siegel calmly said to himself, it is not the time. The fluctuation of magical energy is still strengthening, but it has not yet reached the peak. The blood magician's control is still there. He still has enough strength to draw any other magic or give orders at any time. What is done at this moment is meaningless and will be countered. Only when the spell progresses to the most critical moment, at that time, the blood magician needs to use almost all of his concentration to maintain the spell, just like a strong man holding a heavy weight, his hands are occupied, it is difficult to do. Defend and resist. ‘Only at that time’, Siegel forced himself to move, but quietly put his nails deep into the flesh, using pain to stimulate the stiff muscles, and overcoming the impact of fear on the speed of response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood magician's face full of wrinkles, decaying evil is getting closer and closer, and the bloody smell on his body is clearly audible and disgusting. The distance is so close, Siegel has been able to feel the wind brought by the magic surge through the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is ready." The blood magician said softly, "Go into the eternal sleep..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic array started to work, and the people tied to the chair woke up, and the pain began to yell. They didn't know what was going on, they only saw the blood line on their heads, the horrible magician and the death of the surrounding. Several people are struggling, but the chains on them are hard to break free, and as the blood is drawn more and more, their strength is diminishing. Prince Aaron was the most bloody, so he was the weakest. The poor guy's skin became pale and transparent, his body temperature dropped, and the air he exhaled was cold and lived like a snowman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More horrible sights appear in front of everyone: all the flesh of the blood magician melts like the wax oil under the flame, falling off the bones, the only body The only organs left are the heart. In front of the crowd stood a beggar surrounded by blood vessels, the heart was still beating, the blood was still flowing, and the dragon was still casting spells. The energy of the magic array pulsates with the rhythm of the heart, and slaps on Siegel like a tide. In order to ensure the integrity of the new body container, the blood magician injects himself and the energy from the blood into the body of Siegel, quickly replenishing his lost strength, and then storing it, ready to repair the possible damage caused by blood transfer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood magician believes in his magical ability and does not trap Siegel with a chain. He fears that after getting a new body, all summons and artifacts will take the opportunity to get rid of control, and there is a great possibility of rebelling against the master. At that time, he would be extremely weak, and all the power would be used to suppress blood stasis, and there was no spare power to fight the rebellion. Without the summoner, he could not solve the chain of his body. If the spell succeeds, he will be trapped and starved to death in his magical array, which is the biggest irony. The paralyzed effect of the blood tentacles is strong enough, and it will naturally fade as long as it waits for half an hour. The blood magician believes that there will be no interruptions within half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhythm of the chanting spell is getting higher and higher, and the spell is at a critical time. As the last syllable was finished, the surrounding sounds disappeared abruptly. The cockroaches turned into dust, and the heart and blood vessels turned grayish white. Only a group of human blood still stood in the center of the circle. Four blood lines run through his top, and a blood line quickly shot between Siegel's eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then missed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel leaned back and drove the chair to the ground. He reached out to his wand and read the secret "Schlac!" The wand flew into his palm, and the next spell immediately ignited the energy missile and shot into the human form of blood. In the impact of the explosion, the blood man was blown up and violently twisted like a shrub in the wind. The blood magician has no mouth at the moment and can't read the spell, but he can freely aggregate his body and wrap and spread like a stream of water. He only needs to drill into the body of Siegel to complete the spell, so the blood magician swoops up like a wave hitting the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel struggled while chanting a spell and releasing cold power from the top of the wand. Compared to the use of flame to dry these blood, Siegel is more able to withstand the cold environment, and the spell is more proficient. A layer of frost covered the blood, greatly slowing the flow of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blood group swells up like a blood magician's dry head. There are two holes in his orbital position, so that the whole blood group is like a mole. Necromancer spells and blood magic are perfectly combined at this moment, creating such a unique monster. It took out a bloody hand and pressed it on Siegel's face. Numerous blood was poured into the mouth of the apprentice mage, and all the spells were taken back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to NMD!" Siegel screamed, coughing up a lot of blood on the side while suppressing convulsions. He tried to lick the thick blood on his body, but he was like a worm that was wrapped around the spider web, trying to wave his limbs. Blood water poured into his nose, mouth, poured into his head, and then he was thrown out and spit on the ground. Siegel struggled like a drowning man, twitching. He felt that his strength of struggle was diminishing, his mind began to stun, but he continued to fight for survival. The people in the chair fainted one by one, and only Janet was still awake. Her tears rushed out, and she looked painfully at Siegel's blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Janet heard a bang, blood blasted, and Siegel screamed coughing on the ground. A large amount of blood is rushed back into several people through the blood line. Janet feels that her blood is red in the field of vision. Many capillaries are damaged and the whole body is extremely painful. In this bloody world, she saw a short, small blood group slowly standing up, with empty eyes in the direction of Siegel. A wave of similar waves echoed in Janet's mind, and there seemed to be a thunderous sound in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel once again resisted the magic of the blood magician, and consumed the power that was originally poured into him. This is a serious injury that is beyond the magical energy that he had endured. The number of twenty scorpions has gradually faded. Siegel is still innocent to discover, because the blood magician is still there, talking directly through his blood line in his ear, attracting most of his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magical resistance of the perfect blood is so high?" The blood magician was full of doubts, and he looked at Siegel in a pool of blood in surprise. There is still joy in doubt. Although he lost a lot of power in the possession that he had just failed, the magical array is still working. The four sacrifices are still alive. He only needs to draw more blood to make up. And he can also feel that the apprentice mage has been exhausted, his body is open to defense, and there is no way to stop the process of integration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no perfect bloodline waiting for you." Siegel turned and sat on the floor watching the blood magician. He had just kneeled on the ground and had heard heavy footsteps approaching in the distance. The god of lights will only fly in flight. It is impossible to have such a voice. It will only be a smart golem. Siegel, with his last hope, prays to the god of squid and asks him to send soldiers to defeat evil. But before that, he needs to delay enough time. Siegel's heart beats faster, and the voice trembles as he regains hope. He whispered: "I just used the spell of the blood key, you can change the blood state, and apply the magic power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible! "The blood magician's voice was anxious and angry, but he did not find any answers from the eyes of Siegel's smile." "There is no such spell in the world, blood can only be merged, mortals can't create and change the power. How can a little apprentice wizard understand how powerful the blood is? How can you have such a spell? Proficient in undead magic and blood magic, never heard of such great power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really don't know the truth." Siegel said, in his eyes The mockery stung the blood magician. "I don't really have this power, but it doesn't affect my application. Have you heard of a wizard called Jia Kun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alchemist Jia Kun?” The blood magician’s voice began to tremble, and even the red in the blood group began to fade. "He only appeared in legends and wild history, and was sung in the songs of the troubadour. No Master has organized this person's information. Only our blood magician knows that this person does exist. Where did you hear this? Name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I read his spell book." Siegel continued to delay the time, focusing the blood magician's attention on himself: There are only two spells in the book, the blood key and the big broken lock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Tell me to hear!" The blood magician shouted: "You will The spell tells me, I will spare your life. Since your body is not perfect blood, I will let you take a life and use the body of the old man. This is a transaction that the Master understands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I tell you two spells, then you will definitely kill me." Siegel bargained: "And all of my friends can't die, I just came to save. Theirs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The few on the chair? He Can't die." The blood magician screamed: "As long as I don't let them die, they will be fine, as long as they can rest for a long time. They are inspired by the blood in the magical array, and it is very likely to be blessed in disguise." Let's say that the transaction between young people and mages is sacred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
