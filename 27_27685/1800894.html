When the Xingsuo uses an electromagnetic weapon to fire, it will affect the distribution of surrounding elements and destroy the effect of higher invisibility. Eventually, the invisibility will be lost. If this is not the case, the stealth state attack is the first choice for the star number. Therefore, before Siegel upgraded the warship version to the high-level invisibility, Xingsuo had to attack with a conspicuous posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First solve the enemy on the ground at the fastest speed." Siegel issued an order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electromagnetic guns have exposed the muzzle of the muzzle from under the hidden armor, and the effect of transmitting the array is not used when hitting close objects, so the rate of fire is extremely fast. . The dazzling light continually flashes from the star horn, as the sun shines on the hustle and bustle of the lake, producing countless bright spots. At the maximum rate of fire, the Advanced Creations Array does not produce enough fine gold warheads, but how many steel warheads there are. According to the knowledge of the “contribution” of the goblin researchers, Siegel already knows that the warhead formed by the combination of tungsten and steel can be as powerful as the fine gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what is "tungsten"? This needs to be studied slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum stable rate of fire of the electromagnetic gun is ten rounds per second, although there is still potential to continue to increase, but it will cause rapid loss of weapons. Moreover, such speed is enough. The steel warhead constantly penetrates the air wall, creating a continuous shock wave, like a huge palm pressed from the air. The bullets fired by the goblin collided with the shells that the stars repelled in the air, instantly melted and exploded, and became a splendid hot metal fireworks. The dense impact sounds are connected in one piece, and finally the goblin can only hear the extremely sharp tearing rag. They licked their ears and painfully, and then they saw the end of the ground forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel chariot was not penetrated at all, but was hardened and smashed. After all, each electromagnetic bomb is about the same size as an adult's arm, so the power of the Siegel electromagnetic gun has exceeded the deformation speed of the goblin chariot steel material, and has not been exposed to the hole, it has been hammered down. The upper part of all metal chariots melted and the whole was burning. The high temperature causes the ammunition to explode. Cruel the wreckage of the chariot and then smash it out in all directions. One after another explosion point is one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a minute of shooting, there are only a few goblin chariots in the field of vision. The spacecraft took out some of the energy and began to repair the damage to the outer shell. Only a few electromagnetic guns were used to attack a few ground enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time. The shells of the medium and long-range artillery pieces flew in succession. When the star cable accelerates, it avoids most of the firepower. The rest is either intercepted with a magic missile or an electromagnetic gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of both is not very good. Although the magic missile has a must-have feature, it also has a limit flight speed. In the face of high-speed objects, it may be wrong. And attacking steel warheads with magical missiles is not an easy task to destroy in a short time. So there are still many shells hitting the spacecraft shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you wear an armor, it will be fine." Siegel touched the chin after seeing this situation: "The outer armor is more sturdy, and the combination repair Uninterrupted replenishment, can absorb damage very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, the goblin who fired the shells hide behind the mountain, I have no weapons to strike the arc." Xingsuo said to Siegel with a cry of silence: "Their shells hit me so badly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A mountain is just a matter of piercing." Siegel said: "You just practice the use of low-fire high-injury electromagnetic guns. Right, climb them for a while and their shells are not easy to reach you, be careful of those missiles."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Missile? Is it something that can be flying on the back?" Xingsuo noticed something slower than the shell, only to find that they could turn in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muzzle immediately aimed at them. This is much better than a cannonball! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First fire, ready to turn quickly, let me try to track how these missiles are tracked." Siegel let the star use the secondary invisibility, At the same time, leave an illusion in the air that is exactly the same as the star. The spacecraft immediately turned sharply and quickly left the original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Invisibility is also an improvement, but don't worry. Just hit them all down. Behind you, you hate it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I There is also the same feeling.” The star immediately fired, and the intensive electromagnetic projectile shot down all the missiles. Now she has flown as high as the clouds, and the chariots hiding behind the mountains are also in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last star has no chance to try to feel through a mountain. But this also reminded Siegel. Because of the Master's origins, Siegel has become accustomed to attacking enemies in the field of vision, and how to deal with inexperienced enemies outside the field of vision. The electromagnetic gun can basically only be used as a direct weapon. Although it is almost invincible, it is too low if it is used to demolish obstacles. Next there should be two directions, one is a parabolic attack like a trebuchet. The other is a tracking attack like a missile. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after, the star slings had to deal with the cluster of planes that the goblins followed, and their volley missiles did make the stars rush. "Stupid girl, stop at the local defense to do what, move up! If the missile is to follow the back of your ass, you will have a longer reaction and processing time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo suddenly realized that immediately opened the elemental jet torrent, hit the clouds and rushed to the sky. There were hundreds of various types of air-to-air missiles behind her, but their own electromagnetic shells stormed them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missiles were destroyed one by one in the air, but Siegel was still not satisfied with the efficiency of the stars. "To believe in your own brain, you will eliminate the threat into a physical instinct. If you concentrate on every missile, you can't cope with a more difficult situation. Believe in yourself, let go and try. And I am There will be no big problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stars snorted and tried to calculate from the secondary brain. Although it is called the secondary brain, Siegel has completely created the core of these elements according to the level of super-large gas elements, and has the ability to independently handle the situation. The perfect flight attitude of the gas element, superb offensive and defensive movements, the keen perception of the airflow forming the vortex, and the most important basic intelligence for selecting countermeasures according to the situation. Although the main role of the frontal and secondary brains is to expand the star's perception of the spacecraft's body, if they give them a certain degree of autonomy. Every one can be alone – of course, just in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, high-level creation means unlimited ammunition, and the secret nuclear energy means unlimited energy, plus a powerful master to make the last line of defense, star The cable became very relaxed. The state is so good. There are thirty-six electromagnetic guns in the whole ship, but there are one hundred and eight secondary brains. That is to say, even if all are firing, one can also take three deputy brains. This kind of computing power is enough, even when the stars are flying up and down. I have not seen how much the hit rate is low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star-studded star has targeted the Air Force of the Goblin. Although those planes are very flexible, there is not enough speed to avoid the "glamorous" barrage. The crazy race of Goblin doesn't know how to stop, so it must be a good fight. The final result is that the four heavens are bright and the little things that are in the way are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, it seems that there are no enemies, where are we going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course It’s going to their biggest production base.” Siegel smiled and replied: “Remember the map in space, the most polluted area is.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Oh, understand! I will speed up!" Stars seem to be very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has plans, tactical actions still have to complement strategic goals. So he said: "Keep the current flight speed, we have to give the goblin a reaction time, see what other means they can take it out. Don't take it lightly, the real power is still behind."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblin’s nuclear weapons have not yet been used, and they may still want to be able to shoot down the spacecraft, so as to retain as much debris as possible and analyze the secrets of interplanetary navigation. But if this is done, the goblin will use nuclear weapons sooner or later. Siegel is confident that he will completely suppress the goblin at the level of conventional weapons, but still has no ability to confront nuclear weapons. It is a purely huge energy, or it overwhelm it. Or you have to surpass it in quality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this "quality" is actually the rule. According to the Master's terminology, at least the legendary spell is only possible, and must also be a targeted legendary protection spell. So wander around. The ultimate goal is the level of magical knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
