			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no forests after the hills, and there are more and more weird rocks and clumps of weeds. The magical array of dwarves, elves, and human wizards became thin here, as if they had given up monitoring here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to say that such an inaccessible place should have many traces of animal and insect life, and creatures like ants and baboons are not difficult to see. Can Siegel walked all the way, except that a few non-toxic snakes fled in the grass, they did not see anything else. I didn’t see any nests, and I rarely found the bones. The inside of the Yari Forest is like an animal going in, which is in stark contrast to the forest outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s doubts were quickly answered. After turning over another hill, he saw the Valley of the Ayurveda and the magical array over the valley. . It’s strange that the magical array is swung up and straight from the ground, but it can’t be seen in the distance. Siegel stepped back from the hillock, no matter how he mobilized magic and elemental induction, he could no longer find a huge circle of law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you are close enough to know the existence of the squad, thousands of continually running runes and mysterious lines form the cylindrical battle of fifty miles. , isolated the world on both sides. In addition to being able to see the absurd scenery across the circle, there is no trace of elemental information leaking out. This shows that the array operates perfectly, and it is completely self-contained with no holes. Siegel stared at it for a while, and soon he slammed his forehead down. This tactic is too big and the speed of change is too fast. It takes at least a few months to get a look at the appearance - Siegel doesn't have that long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of safety, Siegel picked up a stone and threw it at the phalanx, then watched it break down into powder, just like the effect of dissociating rays. . Then he experimented with different elemental effects and found that the array was as strong as the rainbow light wall, and even more so. As the strongest spell of protection, the Rainbow Light Wall and the Rainbow Light Ball need to be solved in layers by a variety of spells, just like peeling onions. It has high requirements for speed and timing, and the spells are placed in the wrong position or the lack of power can not produce results. Although each layer of rainbow light is fixed by any magical solution, it is basically a delusion to remove this protective array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason for him. The scale of this battle is too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general rainbow light wall is also a few tens of meters in length, and some of the special divisions have the ability to extend it to two or three hundred meters. Basically it is the limit of mortal. There are dozens of miles in the line of sight, like the size of the iridescent wall in front of Siegel. It requires a corresponding spell of the same size to pick it up. With the help of the Peruvian nuclear, Siegel can release one or two spells of this intensity, but then it will inevitably pull off. When he recovered, the wall of law was restored. If you want to peel off the seven-layer rainbow wall, how can you have more than five magical spaceships with the secret nuclear power? And five or six elemental magic masters like Siegel work at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not an elemental master of magic, it can’t control the huge energy of the secret nuclear, and it can’t be turned into a source of spell power available to itself. The Hongguang Law Wall standing in front of the ** is like a declaration: I have told you how to beat me, try it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What power is supported by such a large magical array?" Siegel was a bit curious. It wouldn’t be surprising if he could nuclear him, but this array seems to have a long history. Is there any other solution besides the Peruvian nuclear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked slowly around the circle, trying to find its weak point. It may be a method from the underground, but after the earth element was dug down more than ten meters, it still hit the rainbow light wall, and then it was eliminated. Siegel would not report any hope. The Rainbow Light Wall is also one of the few barriers that can block all prophecies and detect spells. So there is no way to know the opposite situation. Siegel can only measure this battle with his feet until he finds cluttered footprints and dry blood on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Footprints come from a variety of creatures, elephants, lions, hounds and foxes. Several pieces of feathers caught between the cracks seem to come from some kind of giant birds. Or a feather beast like a hummer and a taro. The color of the blood on the ground is deep and shallow, and it has the same source as the foot print. Although Siegel is not a biological expert, he also knows that such a messy situation must be unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the Rainbow Light Wall, people know that it is dangerous, not to mention the keen animals. These footprints come from all directions, but they appear to be out of thin air. For example, elephant footprints on the ground, if you want to find where it comes from. You can only trace the broken clues. There was nothing on a flat open space, and then suddenly there was a huge footprint. Unless the elephant will fly or will cast a spell, there is only one explanation: these are all changes from the Druid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reddish-brown liquid flowing down hit the iridescent wall along the inclination of the ground and became a rising smoke. Somehow, the stable rainbow light wall has a flaw here. Where the smoke is shrouded, the iridescent colors that should have been constantly changing have solidified, including those of the mysterious runes and lines. In other words, the magic array is not running here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very easy to crack from here, and Siegel only needs to use the spell of normal energy level, and you can get rid of one or two spells. He looked around and the terrain here is similar to that described by the Green Dragon. It is very likely that this place is the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and was about to cast magic, but he heard a slight embarrassment. "Help me..." The faintly identifiable elf language came from under the heap of corpses. Siegel hesitated for a while, sighed, changed his appearance first, disguised as an elf, and then came to the corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of layers of corpses, there is a slight trembling place. Siegel saw colorful feathers and curved beaks, and the sound came from here. He pushed open the corpses around him and dug a giant billet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parrot’s wings and legs are broken, and the body presents a strange twisting direction, which should be the result of prolonged oppression. The parrot looked at Siegel with blue-black eyes. Then twist your neck and support your upper body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, brother, I almost died." The parrot said, "Let me put it on the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It touches the ground. It began to tremble and eventually became a halfling. Less than a metre tall, sitting on the ground looks even shorter. The druid brown robes he wore were like large quilts, or the ones full of holes and smudges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halfling raised his head and looked at the "elf" standing in front of him: "Lucky brother. How have I never seen you?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never seen you." Siegel replied in pure elf: "How did you survive?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know..." The halfling shook his head: "I only remember that I was inspecting the sunset forest, and then I heard the call of the Druid's Ring, and immediately rushed back. After that, I was pressed under the shape of a parrot. I couldn’t move at all. I didn’t remember what happened before. I can feel my life is going on, and my brothers and sisters around me died because of the injury, but I am very lucky because The size is small, so it lasts longer. It is controlled by magic, and it can't move. It's good that I am a parrot and can ask for help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Gere smiled and looked at him. "You are lucky." He turned his eyes to the pile of corpses and deliberately said: "Is there still a living person inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halfling immediately becomes grief The expression shook his head and said: "No, the last one except me died three days ago. I thought I was dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What are you going to do next?" Siegel continued to test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I was hurt, and I didn't have the power to release a spell to treat myself. I can't go far. I need to take a break here, pray and meditate. The halfling said to Siegel: "Only you can protect me, so don't go far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at the rise of blood Smoke, but look at the halfling with the corner of the eye. Road: "I want to go inside and see, you are waiting for me outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going inside? There are demons inside, you don't want to live. "The halfling said: "You don't go in, it is to die. I need you to take me back to the ring of Druids. Report the situation to the elders there. Come and help me!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a saint, you don't have to help me." Siegel said to the halfling, "And I just saved you, you deceive me, let me think about it." Whose saint you are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halfling laughed twice and the wound in his body healed in a faint glow. Although this is a common force in the saints, Siegel found that his wounds healed less slowly than other saints. Even the dwarf sages, after being ravaged by the dust, returned to normal from the poor appearance of the dry, faster than this halfling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
