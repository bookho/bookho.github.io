			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late at night, Kaibu Town, which has fallen asleep, was suddenly awakened, and two long dragons made up of torches came out from the direction of the castle and extended all the way to the southern guardian castle. . The guards wearing the breastplate, the cloak and the shield bearing the lord's badge slammed the door with their fists. The gnome Jagger shouted in the door: "Come, come, I will open the door." The leader's soldiers waved their hands and let the torches surround the entire hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pygmy is wearing pajamas, wearing a large and ridiculous spiky nightcap on his head, with an oil lamp in his hand: "Adult, what can I do for you?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The five people from the North are still there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, They still rested in the room and never left.” The gnome opened the door and let the guards sneak in: “They are in the third and fourth rooms on the right side of the second floor.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very good at serving, the Duke of the Duke is very satisfied, and the comrades in the Solidarity are thankful for your contribution." When the soldier spoke, his hand was always on the hilt and his eyes glanced at the first floor. The lobby. "Reporting them is a very sensible choice. Their leader, the white-haired Jie has just been arrested for attacking the lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know they are all It’s not a good thing.” The gnome nodded. “I can smell the smell on them. It’s a forgiveness, no ideal robber taste. Is the Lord’s adult safe and sound?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord of the Lord led the Solidarity to defeat the enemy. The deportator has been detained and will be tried in the next day." The soldier said: "Because you reported the merits, you have already drawn a line with the villains, so you You can continue to manage the South China Sea Watch Castle as one of the strong barriers of the Solidarity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my pleasure." Gnomish Jagger said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor was uploaded to the sound of ping-pong, and two soldiers ran down the stairs in a moment. "The Viscount is an adult, the room is empty. One person No, they have nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The captain turned his attention to the gnome, who quickly waved his hand. It looked more surprised than anyone else: "I can't, they fell asleep in the room. I checked them when I sent them hot water. Did they have no place to escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the window, there are no footprints!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the soldiers returned, and no footprints were found around the hotel. The five people disappeared like a slam, and no one knew where they went. Even if the guards brought the hounds over, they could only smell the smell of the kitchen sausages, and could not find pastors, gnomes and girls. Only Jage accidentally found a note while counting the storage room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I take your three rabbits. Come back and give you money - Sol."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Search! Mobilize all Solidarity people, be sure to find them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yao En and others will not sit still, Siegel's communication warning They also let the plan start running. Siegel believes in his companions and friends, but he does not put all his hopes on others. He spoke to Rees and led him to say more insider while continuing to observe the magic scroll in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you give me some water, Master Reese." Siegel swayed the chain and almost made the writing of Rees a key line. It’s a pity that Siegel thought. How good the error is. "I have been talking for a long time. I am not one of your arrangements for thirst death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rees carefully inserted the quill into the ink bottle. Then stood up. I first observed the condition of the drug, and then brought a skin. After opening. The scent of ale is emitted inside. Siegel's mouthful swallowing, like this is the last time I can taste the liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, you still have a lot of time." Rees said: "I will give you food and drink to keep your body in top." The state, to complete the mission of the template, but you do not need to be very clear-minded, I should prepare some sleeping grass for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I take a nap Grass, how can you point out the shortcomings of the spell?” Siegel laughed. “I have found three places to improve so far. It’s not far from five.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need to look at it. I just point out the difference. There is a difference between the two." Siegel's eyes are full of smiles: "Improving spells is your own thing, so that you can get the highest honor, more than those. Smart wizards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is sooner or later!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So trouble you Let me look at the next reel, I am so good to be a compact five." Siegel has a well-thought-out look, but it makes Rees stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be suspicious, but will open the scroll to show him, then return to his seat to continue to depict the magic array. Rees looked up from time to time to see the prisoner's expression and guess what was in his mind. As a result, an error occurs in drawing the rune, and this magic scroll must be recreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives Siegel time again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound caused by the obsidian dagger on the back is constantly feeling sore and itchy. The wound is working hard to heal because it has been used to stop bleeding. Siegel's physical resilience is much higher than that of ordinary humans. In the middle of the day, only those who were stabbed by Rees with a knife left a shallow scar, leaving only the knife wound behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the scroll in front of him while paying attention to the situation on the side of Rees with the corner of his eye. Once Ris was found to focus on the work in front of him and ignored him, he began to twist the muscles of his shoulders and back, rubbing the dagger and letting it move slowly. Because the dagger is very sharp, each friction will cause a new wound. The blood soaked the black handle again and again, and the new wound continued to extend downward. The handle that originally pointed to the sky began to sag under the efforts of Siegel. Perhaps after hard work, it would slide down the wound and free Siegel from the seal of the ban. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rees sometimes comes to check Siegel's physical condition, this time is the most dangerous. Siegel needs to draw his attention so that he does not let him discover the changes behind the dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s best to talk about some of the magical insights, especially about glued soldier spells. Siegel himself is a master of the elemental warrior, so he can always ask the most appropriate question, which can show that he has a certain level, and he can just reach the itch of Rees, so that he can proudly show the deep Magic knowledge. Siegel is a powerful mage. But when he is willing, it will be the kind of student that the teacher likes most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed by, and Rees had no rest at all. Siegel is taking the time. His back has been blurred by blood, and he is worried about the blood dripping onto the ground. So he had to suspend the action and wait until everything solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very painful to be poked with a knife. It’s more uncomfortable to leave the knife in the body, but the most unbearable thing is to cut your own flesh. Siegel made a new wound at least five hundred times by twisting his muscles. Every time it's small, but it doesn't weaken the pain at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very tired now, but with strong support. Constant blood loss, no food. Just drinking a few ale also aggravated the degree of fatigue. At this point, Rees stood up, his magic scroll was finally copied, and the pharmacy was almost ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also needs to fight for time, it is best to let Rees go to rest, so that he can stand alone for hours. “Why do I need to find a warrior template?” Siegel asked. “Can't the assassin of the murder god be a template? Their dodge fighting skills are better than the castle warriors and they can be played without armor.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are better as a template than those assassins," Rees replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there isn't me? Do you look at the idiot with a rigid castle head to make a template, and use that inferior martial arts to limit the ability of the clay warrior? I think there is something wrong with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your observation really makes me admire." Rees said: "I have always had this idea. Even if you don't need to perform The assassin of the mission left me the wounds. As a result, they were all transported, brought to the place of training and healing, and slipped away from my fingers. It’s a pity. What a good experimental material. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place for training and recuperation, what is it? After Siegel heard this sentence, his mind suddenly seemed to be lit. Countless new ideas are coming soon. Maybe Janet was taken away among these people. This thought came out like a big tree, and stood firmly in the soil of thought. This must be the case. The first thing Janet wakes up is to pretend to be a wounded person, to observe and adapt to the new environment. This is what she is best at: camouflage. This explanation is the most reasonable and most in line with Siegel's wishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
