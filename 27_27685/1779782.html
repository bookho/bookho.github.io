			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a place called Helin, the army led by Heim stopped the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a gentle hill surrounded by fields of low grass and beautiful flowers. Several solitary stones piled up in the green grass, and the long-lasting wind and sun made them smooth, and a group of rabbits dug a hole under the stone to hide here. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans occupy the hills, the cavalry swings, and the archers follow, and the soldiers armed with spears and shields cover the flanks. More than a dozen small trebuchets were installed on the carts, and their ammunition included a net of iron shovel and a jar filled with kerosene or lime powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly two thousand elves occupied a piece of land under the hills, expelling a similar formation. They only have five war trees, but in addition to this, the war preparations are still neat. The Elf Warrior is equipped with a narrow shield like a blade, holding a moon arc machete; the Ranger is holding a bow and arrow, ready to fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana Zema came out and went to the center of the battlefield alone. Elijah also came over to meet her with a horse. The wound caused by Leah's electric shock by Siegel has healed and returned to its best condition - at least no visible signs of injury from the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See you again, Ms. Lia." Mana first greeted her with a relaxed smile on her face. "Your intentions have been seen. We have taken advantage of it, and we have gained the upper hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel really can't lie." Elijah also smiled. It seems very easy. She said: "Our spellcasters have made temptations and misleading several times, and the results have not played any role, or they have been intercepted by you. But the strengths and weaknesses are not so good-looking, the battlefield's victory and defeat will never be determined by the mouth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Siegel’s voice screamed abruptly, and then he slowly appeared on the shadow of the phantom. "Sometimes the outcome is between the lips and teeth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's army rioted, and Leah's guards tried to rush to protect her. But Elijah Liya waved her hand and made her army a little more secure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you approaching in an invisible way?" Leah looked at Siegel and said with mixed feelings: "Do you think that if you started out?" I won't talk to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid that you will beat me because of the previous things, then I will lose face. It is better. Observe how your mood is determined." Siegel scratched his head. Said to the elf: "Master Leah, I can be invisible close to you and you will not be discovered. You know what it means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still do assassins?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and said to her: "This shows that the casters behind you are flawed in detecting invisibility. I can continue to use it." This flaw will blow you down. Unless you want to break the way of the Magic City Magic Array now, or hide in the Elven Forest, I will be able to destroy the opposite army sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't think so." Lia replied: "I understand your character. Siegel. You will attack, but you will never become an assassin. You are your own mind and Wushu is very proud, so it will never sell character, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to say." Siegel shook his head: "The war has been going on for so long, I am already full of boredom and may be unscrupulous. But Mana persuaded me to make me sensible. Waiting for this. So Master Lia, my reason has not disappeared, can you talk about your surrender?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elf never Surrender." Lia replied, "There is nothing to talk about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will each go back to our respective camps. Then we will drive the horses and fight one battle?" With a wave of hand, Siegel showed a illusionary picture among the three people, with a vivid image showing the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect your spell talent to be so good." Lia applauded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the illusion, the cavalry of Heim led the two flank at the beginning of the battle, giving the front of the battlefield to the archer and the shield. The trebuchet is constantly launching to cover the infantry. In the face of the plasma, the war tree has a range advantage, but it does not determine the direction of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have reinforcements and the reserve team has not been dispatched. It is good for us both in terms of total strength and time." Siegel said: "And you have to go back to the Elven Forest, how long can you delay here?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s words have not been finished yet, Leah interrupted his words and said: “Siegel, you can accurately predict our actions, know We have to rush back to the Elven Forest. And successfully block it here, is someone leaking information to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "No, everything I inferred, why do you ask?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have nothing to do with the black people?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides hatred, nothing!" Siegel gnashed his teeth and clenched his fists: "I can't wait to get out one by one, twisting their necks and killing them all!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then why did you send the mage of the territory into the Elven Forest, which happened to be in Hit the scene?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked Idis to take Janet to the Elven Forest to find the Druid Shiki reincarnation. The black man interrupted this spell. In the ceremony, I finally only received the cold body of Janet.” Siegel said: “I have to go to the Elf Forest anyway to see what is going on, and nothing can stop me.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jenit also..." Lia frowned and looked at Siegel with a puzzled look: "It turned out that my father had to cast a spell to save her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your father?" Siegel also noticed that it was wrong. "One of the three druids who performed the ceremony is your father? How is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soul has been returned to the elf tree." Li Yaqiang Resist the sorrow, did not let the tears flow down, but the voice still trembled. "We are ordered to return to the Elven Forest to defend ourselves, to avenge the dead relatives, and have no time to fight with you. Let's get away! Just as you said, nothing can stop us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is about to talk, and suddenly he feels in his heart. He saw that from the battlefield of Heim, a trebuchet fired a huge stone and would accurately hit himself in five seconds. He jerked back, the boulder had already flown into the sky, and the "beep" sound of the launch was just coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel immediately launched the Rainbow Light Ball Ring, which shrouded all three people. The stone slammed into it, smashed it on the shield, and was completely disintegrated by powerful magical energy. Siegel then lifted the shield and the three were unharmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mana, go to reorganize the army, find traitors. Can't fight today, even if the elf attacks, give me a back!" Siegel said: "Someone wants Provoke the dispute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's troops also had a commotion. An old war tree suddenly raised his hand and slammed down. The smoke and dust scattered, in a shallow pit full of blood and minced meat, a black dress is very eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Lia ordered loudly and asked the elf to stand by and not to go further. Let the mages search for magical fluctuations immediately, and the pastors pray to the moon god and use the power to identify the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals of both sides stood in the middle of the battlefield, waiting for the two armies to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea and Siegel’s forces are well-trained, and the time taken to reorganize the order is almost the same. Elf Lia calmly looked at Siegel and tried to solve the current dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was ready early, so he said: "Even if we don’t fight today, as your elves withdraw, they actually lose. In the occupation of Heim’s collar, this territory has returned to our human hands anyway. Do you agree?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea nodded, this is not Refuting the facts. Although there are other elf troops in the southern part of the New World, the total strength of these forces is only about 4,000, which is similar to the heyday of the army surrounding the city of Mire. Even the most difficult time was supported, and Siegel had no reason to keep up with Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My idea is that your elves have left more than 500 hostages in Heim, I have set aside a place to settle and guarantee their lives. I It will be guaranteed not to let Heim’s army leave the border and go to the troubles of your elves. On this basis, Elf Forest and Iheim will conclude a truce treaty and then see how to deal with the black people’s organization.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
