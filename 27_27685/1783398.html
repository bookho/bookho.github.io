			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing in front of the two is a narrow passage, the plaster on the wall has been decayed and scattered, and the pieces fell to the ground, revealing the stone shell behind. . Www/xshuotxt/com doesn't know what kind of technology the writers are using. The whole stone shell is integrated, and there is no trace of splicing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some transparent crystal shells scattered around the ground, but not as hard as real crystals, they will become shattered and smashed when you step on them. sound. Since Siegel cast a spell and could not detect the signs of living creatures and dead spirits, the two only need to be careful of the traps, and there is no need to sneak away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a small room on both sides of the passage with lots of weird things. Since there are no descriptions of the text symbols, the explorers can only guess their purpose from the appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can be rotated, and then blow out the wind." Evan fingered the three iron leaves connected to the roots and smiled and said to Siegel. "What did you find there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be someone's bedroom, and the pile of debris that fell on the ground might be a bed." The stick pointed to the finger. "As we expected, the body shape here is almost the same as ours, two hands and two feet, one head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the bed you Can you see so much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel let a ball of light fly to the corner of the room. "Look, there is a set of clothes there, and the ones connected up and down, do not explain their appearance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan went over and wanted to take it up and see, The clothes were so badly damaged that they turned into pieces and dust on his hands. "Let's go, there is nothing to see here. I need to find a written record, but I am afraid that the hope of finding it is getting more and more embarrassing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is everywhere The lines are buried under the surface of the wall and arranged neatly. Siegel pulled out one and found that the surface of the material used a rubber-like substance, because the passage of time became very brittle, and all the drops would fall. Inside is the wire, and most of it has been rusted. It is such a thing that spreads throughout the city, like the human body is covered with nerves and blood vessels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly had a feeling of deja vu, isn’t that the plasma on the Void Ship? Is it also plasma flowing in these thin lines? Siegel thought for a moment. Then shake your head. After all, plasma is a liquid-flowing thing that contains a lot of energy and will continue to escape. There is not enough space in these thin lines for it to flow, and the outer wrapped skin can not withstand the energy of the plasma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it is passing electricity? Siegel’s flash of light flashed. He is a little stunned. Passing the current to the finger, it runs away along the line. A glass ball on the wall shone slightly and gave a pale yellow glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come back, come again." Evan said with a glass ball by hand, said to Siegel: "You seem to have found something unacceptable." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of security. Siegel's scepter is aligned with the "wire" and casts a stronger spell of lightning. A glimmer of light flashed, the glass ball on the wall suddenly became very bright, and then all the "snap" sounds were broken. The wires also gave off an unpleasant smell and burned in several places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master made a snap and the flames were all extinguished. He looked at Evan and said: "It's hard to master, and most of the things here are going bad. Let's explore and experiment again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean by this?" Evan looked around. "According to your translation. Isn't this a refuge? I don't think so much. You look at the bed here, one room is one, so relaxed and comfortable, Where is the refuge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded: "I also feel this way. A lot of space is wasted, especially the shaft. So we If you can't believe the words on the metal plate, you should be more careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many years have you been here, will there be any institutional traps that will work? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the case of metal corrosion, it is about two hundred years. But here is a sealed environment. It is meaningless to use rust to infer time. Siegel replied: "The things here are driven by electricity, but now .. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp trap if there is no electricity, most of it should fail "<br <br /> & nbsp />;"Do not push your own hand to the sword. I am sure that I have not created a smart magic weapon for you." Although Siegel said this, he also clenched the defensive staff. A few spells are at hand and ready to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They continue to walk inward and pass through this area with small bedrooms on both sides. In front of them, a stumbling door blocked the way for two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was broken by the collapsed roof." Siegel said after reading it, "Let me open the passage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the things that block the road are very mixed, there are metal, rock, and translucent strange materials. Therefore, we cannot dig into the past by earth elements. Siegel squinted Evan back, then raised his index finger and gathered magical energy on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is aware of the danger from this spell, which is a purely devastating force. He carefully observed Siegel's movements, and carefully recorded the various signs of the spell's performance, making it his own experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissociation ray is a powerful destructive spell that destroys the structure of matter and breaks it down into harmless elements, thereby disintegrating it. Erase. This spell has a strong destructive effect on both physical and magical effects, and is a powerful combat spell and deterrent power of the wizard. The elf's elemental surge array also uses some of the design ideas and functions of the separation process, but it is more gentle and slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Siegel's fingertips, a green ray was shot, and the obstacles pressed against the door were accurately hit, and then they disappeared silently. There was some dust on the ground, and a fresh and moist wind blew from the faces of the two, and the surrounding temperature rose a little – this is what remains after the debris is dissociated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people opened the door in front of a small garden. There used to be a big tree standing in the middle surrounded by flower beds and resting chairs. But now all the plants are dead, leaving only a pile of debris on the mulch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cracked ceiling was worn by the middle of the tree, and now there is only a layer of soil that is constantly seeping. It is likely to be below the tear lake of God, so Siegel casts a spell to make the soil on the top of the head turn into rock, which can play a supporting role for at least some time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, I found a few sets of tattered clothes here, empty pockets, I am afraid to throw it here?" Evan checked A circle, then pointed to the next door: "Let's continue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, let me find it." Siegel stretched his hand In the mulch. The force connecting the earth elements is detected around. Soon he discovered that in the soil beneath a seat, he dug three things like chestnuts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not the seed of the big tree? Can you plant it?" Evan reached out and wanted to take one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Druid is an expert in this area. I need to try before I can tell you, I hope to bring this plant back to life." Siegel in Evan Before I reached out, I collected the seeds and smiled and said to him: "If you want to divide the treasure, you have to wait and go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still have to The starting point is strong." Evan took back his hand and strode to the next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seeds of plants can be preserved for a long time, and even continue to germinate after thousands of years of freezing. So Siegel is still quite confident. But there is always something that keeps him in doubt: here he saw the wreckage of the dead plant, the "people" who live here? Where are their bones? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan just found some clothes on the ground, all of them are one-piece coats. Who will throw clothes in the garden? A terrible speculation is that people in the past died here, and those clothes are actually the last things left in the dead body. In general, the skeleton does not know why it disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the saying goes, "Dust is dusty, soil is returned to earth", it is still difficult to make the body completely dusty, unless using dissociated rays or the like. Spells. Siegel checked the fabric, soft, waterproof, and warm, but it didn't feel like it could resist the dissociation rays. Why did the clothes stay? The body is gone? This does not explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked Evan to be careful, then pressed down on his mind and continued to follow him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
