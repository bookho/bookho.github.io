			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your purpose is to defeat them, not to dance with them, to be murderous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Siegel just wanted to ask what is murderous, but heard the dwarf ordered, and the twelve opponents rushed up again. Segal bravely rushed up and quickly knocked over the two. But he immediately fell into the trap, but did not escape the mess, and then failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what are you? From a dance to a fool? But you become a fool and you can kill one more than you dance. You What is the use of martial arts in the past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have twelve people, I only have one, which is unfair." Siegel argued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will tell you the kid, remember. There is nothing fair and unfair on the battlefield. Goblin, orc, and the Kobold will not tell you anything fair. Unfair, the wolves in the wild will not tell you the fair! The only thing that will be discussed with you is whether they are the ones that are defeated by you. Only they will ask this question! You must know that the enemy will always be swarming. We naturally hope that we will always be on the side of the number of people, or one-on-one, but these premise is that we can survive the disadvantages. The elves use their superb shooting skills, humans have charged cavalry, these are the advantages. But the only thing that dares to face the disadvantages is that I am a dwarf, relying on solid martial arts! Do you know why we have the strongest heavy armor? Because we are not fast, we are always surrounded, and never back. The first line of the battlefield It is the position of the dwarf, and the companion behind you, you can only desperately. I don’t ask you to give me a knife, but I don’t ask you to be unharmed. I only ask for unbearable injuries. Before, destroy the enemy as much as possible, and then drag the enemy. This is the honor of the warrior, you must work hard in this direction. Well, think about it, then come again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel had five minutes of thinking time. He took the shield around the training ground for two laps and then carefully thought about what he had just made. He can't block the attack of 12 people at the same time, no one can do it. Even with the footwork, there will be at least three or four people at the same time, attacking him from different angles. Moreover, the venue here is very limited, the footwork can not be long-lasting, and the perfect dynamic balance must be achieved in attack, block and movement. What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that he did not think of a good way during this time, so there is no accident, he will fail after going up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this child let me point out your problem, you and the elf learn, the pursuit is to fight the deadly place, this goal is not wrong, However, there is a problem in the process before this. If you think about the iron casting weapon, you can't expect a hammer to be directly formed. You must take a patience to hit it. Don't always think about reaching the last one, but every attack, you need Have a positive effect, use martial arts to accumulate these effects. Victory, it is not that you pierce the enemy's heart to be successful, you cut it over and let the enemy can't cut you, it is also a success. At the same time, your shield must move. Get up, don't just wait for you, our dwarf's goal is not to kill, or to oppress the enemy like iron, let them fall into the trap, only fall into our rhythm. Imagine, then come again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the tired body, the plan to conceive the battle in your mind. After a few minutes, he successfully knocked down four and then died when he defeated the fifth. He thought of a combination of sudden collisions, sudden retreats, and the use of an enemy's body to block another attack angle. He used the shield to actively hit each other's weapons and learned to use kicks to create an advantage. That afternoon, his highest record was to defeat six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole day of the first day, Elinte did not specifically guide anything, just let Siegel try and try again and again. Let him know what is going on in a melee, a situation that a warrior will face. In the evening, Elijah treated the body for him and used the magic to relieve fatigue. This kind of training is very difficult, and the fake weapons that are trained in use immediately, Siegel still left a scar of blue and purple. Fortunately, young people are very focused on training, and he feels that suffering is not a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarves have been trained since childhood, they are crawling and playing this as a game. They have long been thick and thick, so you can It’s time to get used to it for a while, and you have to be there,” Lia said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, I can adapt" Siegel said: "If you are faced with such a situation, what should you do?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I have two choices, one is to open the distance, solve them with a long bow, penetrate the arrow or even the arrow. The other is close-fitting melee, treating the enemy as a shield Use short weapons - such as short swords and daggers - to resolve enemies as quickly as possible. These two methods are not for you. We need about 30 years to master such martial arts, and humans do not have that long time to spend. To be honest, you It’s already very surprising that I can grasp the level of the elf in such a short period of time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Siegel was ready to squat again, but when he arrived at the training ground, he was surprised to find that there were no dwarf children to be a sparring partner. Elinette waited for him alone, and there were all sorts of weapons on the side of the field: heavy warhammers with humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and even giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The things we have to do today are very clear, that is, let you know the weaknesses of various weapons. It should be noted that each weapon has different ways of using it. Body shape, strength, and martial arts skills. Know why we dwarves are the best weapons forging masters? Because we fight these weapons all day, our familiarity is infiltrated into our bloodstream – and vice versa. When we get to a sword, we know the scope of its attack. When we see a hammer, we can visually measure its weight and power. From this, we have developed unique martial arts skills."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These weapons are all? What should be done?" Siegel scratched his head and asked questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason is simple - hurting you is always a weapon, martial arts skills can only be played through the extension of the weapon. The elf says you have a good brain, and you I have mastered the elf body, and the coordination ability of the body has also been good in yesterday's battle. So today I will teach you two kinds of combat skills, one is called unloading weapons, the other is called pushing weapons."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf picked up a long sword and threw it at Siegel, then found a heavy hammer: "Take a sword for example. I will teach you the easiest way." Blocking his threat zone. It is impossible to use weapons such as daggers and swords. The best choice is heavy weapons, such as our dwarf warhammers and battle axes. Your opponents use their hands to force and pass It takes time to get to the body of the weapon before it can cause a threat. When it is countered, this power is also passed back. This is the process we have to cut off. But this requires training to make the heavy weapon a part of your arm. Don't say more, let me learn. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarf's martial arts skills complement their feelings of blowing weapons, focusing on the transmission of power and the feedback of perceived power. To achieve a weapon is an extension of the arm, Then you don't just need to apply force to the weapon, but you also need to feel the subtle changes that the weapon sends back to the arm. After the initial study, Siegel is blindfolded, hits different materials with different weapons, and then perceives the hit. What is it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They then learn the power of using the weapon to give back to the next blow, and use the rotation of the body and the change of the center of gravity to form a continuous The attack is absorbed by Siegel as a sponge, and through repeated training to form an experience, let him grow fast. Siegel's body will use the limit every day, once and for all success and failure let him The martial arts grew rapidly. Fortunately, the food in the dwarf's home is rich enough, and Siegel can add a lot of meat every day. So despite the hardship, it is very fast for him. A period of time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time has passed for a month. Through hard training, Siegel has been able to calmly face the attacks of these dwarfs, and The record of several successful wins. It is not meaningful to increase the number of opponents, because this is the maximum number of enemies facing each other in a single battle. Then he enters one-on-one reinforcement teaching, and the opponent is replaced by a real dwarf. Warriors. They are proficient in the combat skills of dwarves, and their strength, patience and experience are much higher. Each one is much stronger than the twelve dwarfs. Siegel lives a repetitive and fulfilling life every day, constantly tempering. His own martial arts. Irene, who is rich in aristocratic life, can provide Siegel with a lot of nutrient supplements, which makes him expand and become stronger, but without losing flexibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important celebration time for the dwarves is getting closer and closer. Everyone is busy setting up the celebration venue of the Mora and preparing for the event. Many forces and organizations have arrived in succession, or at least sent enough envoys. Elinette also needs to meet these people and have not participated in the training for several days. "Busy boring red tape" - he said so. These did not affect Siegel, but he is still persisting in training. The elf has been waiting for the arrival of Sir Bill, and only received a letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say, Sir Bill, he is not coming? Is he okay? Nothing is going on!" Siegel was very worried after hearing the news. Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf handed the letter to him, let him see it, and then said: "I heard the news a few days ago, the prince’s team of the starry country was attacked. The prince was seriously injured, but the cricket pointed out that the attack was actually a blind eye. The prince was not in the team. The rumor of serious injury was false. The strangest thing is that no one knows where the team went."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
