			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mother of the earth, please guide me to find evil!" Anomen screamed, letting the holy emblem in his hand shine a strong light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows of the place shrouded in light are hidden, and everyone can see a black figure. Arnold suddenly yelled and grabbed his eyes and collapsed. The holy emblem fell to the ground and the light disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Child, what's wrong with you?!" Yao En shot an arrow where the shadow appeared, but as expected, did not hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A strong evil spirit, my eyes are like looking directly at the sun." He looked up and everyone saw red and swollen around his eyes. The blood is densely covered around the pupil, and the tears are direct. The holy emblem that fell on the ground seemed to be grilled by fire, and it was bursting with blue smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black shadow flashed, the earth's mother's holy emblem was swept away and rolled to a place that no one could touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anomen blinked and took another holy emblem from his arms and lifted it again. "Evan, I will force him out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't! Heim's army is coming soon, and it will be safe. Now I can protect you, don't be reluctant!" Evan said: "Just look at it and hurt it like that, do you want to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know myself What is being done." Anomen will be very determined, raising the name of the mother of the earth. His eyes are like being ignited by flames, and the flesh and blood are screaming. This time the light is more stable and brighter than the previous one, and the contour of Chanem becomes very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan swooped up, but the long sword directly penetrated the shadow, and there was no touch. Although he can see the position of the sacred murderer, he is still hidden in the film world and cannot directly attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ano's mouth has a word in his mouth, and others are all obscure sentences. The sacred emblem of the Mother Earth changed the color, and the golden light hit the Chanem. Finally forced him out of the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chenna’s black cloak is constantly swaying with black smoke, like the twisted sand dunes on the desert under the sun, all the scenery becomes awkward . The radiance of Mother Earth is no small burden for him. He raised his hand to cover his eyes, which allowed him to slowly rise straight up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan rushed up. Strangled him with a long sword. Because Evan's long sword has been able to hurt Chanem's body, he does not dare to use empty hands to connect with the sword. He continually slams the plane of the blade with his fingers and dials the route of the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your swordsmanship can suddenly improve, it is a strange thing to hurt me with the power of mortals. But what you can do is here. Channim said as he dialed the gear: "I won't be tired, but how long can you persist, how long can your pastor companion last? Leave the believer of the Mother Earth to me. You guys can go." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan listened to these words and was totally unmoved. Arnold may decide to agree and use his life for other security. But how can the enemy believe? Losing the light of the Mother Earth, the Holy One of the murderous god can return to the hidden state and then try to attack again and again until all of them are killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Evan waved his sword again and again, trying to surpass Chanem from speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to improve your speed, you must first speed up the frequency, you can’t use all your strength to slash, and you need to recycle the long sword to start the next attack. Yu Li. Moreover, the long sword trajectory that goes straight or folds is obstructive to the lifting speed, so Evan begins to use the arc. Combine some of the skills of the machete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chanem frowned. He found it increasingly difficult to find the right hit point, even if he hit the blade. It’s just that changing one arc to another doesn’t change Evan’s offensive rhythm. With the creation of the arc, Evan also began to consciously rotate the wrist, twisting the direction of the blade before and after the Chennam finger, posing a threat to his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Evan took advantage of it, forcing Chanem to keep retreating, stepping away from the stone and obstacles, barely blocking several offensives. His grey eyes never left his opponent. It seems to be observing and evaluating, but it seems to be exerting divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome Yao En was not idle, took all kinds of potions from his pocket and slammed into the mouth of Arnold. However, the pastor kept chanting prayers and could drink without the healing potion. So the gnome tried to pour the potion on Arnold's head, trying to pour out the flames that burned his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meng is a bit embarrassed because of a lot of blood loss, but she still insists on taking out the stone throwing pellets, one of which is soaked with alchemy potion. The potion is of extraordinary value and is said to allow the weapon to penetrate any damage resistance. But can this thing work for the Holy Spirit of the divine structure? Ai Meng does not dare to think about this problem, just let himself be busy and do his best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer’s sacred man stepped on a metal plate and looked down and found it was Evan’s throwing shield. Although most of it has been rusted, it is still good news for Chanem. Instead of retreating this time, he seized the opportunity to roll to the side and pick up the shield. The rusted part was shaken off like dust, and he used the rest to change a long dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the swordsmanship is crisp and sweet, just like the raindrops on the roof, making a bang and an urgent and fast sound. The two returned to the balance of power, but they have formed a strange style. Chanem continued to stab and collect, occasionally adding a few strokes. Evan is increasingly using arcs, and even the movement of the footsteps begins to move in the direction of the arc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hundred-faced scorpion on his chest exudes light and heat, and the numbers light up one by one. Evan was unaware that his whole body was devoted to the weapon in his hand. He has a feeling that the arc is not the end, he can be faster and more coordinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the arc became a circle, and his long sword painted one circle of another size in the air. Whenever Chanet's dagger hits, the circle changes, or changes size, or it is slanted, but the dagger of the line can always be put in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Chanem’s arm was full of scars, and the blood soaked the sleeves and ran down the gown. If it is an ordinary person, this arm has already been cut off. Where can I continue to attack? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney seized the opportunity to split the long dagger into two, becoming two short daggers and continuing to entangle with Evan. But he has already fallen into the sword circle of Evan, and the damage is not reduced. Evan only feels that he is very fast, and every attack can bring psychological and physical pleasure. In a few moments, he even forgot the battle, only the sentiment of swordsmanship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword is approaching, the circle is getting smaller and smaller, and the space left for Channam to hide is getting smaller and smaller. He didn't know what to do, leaving an arm to let Evan smash and take the opportunity to leave the battlefield. Evan chased two steps now and left two sword wounds on his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you continue to catch up, you hear Yao’s cry: "Come back to Evan, you have to leave the light range!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan stopped immediately, watching Chanem standing in a place three steps away from him, with a weird smile on his face. "Don't forget, I am an assassin, not a warrior. Enjoy the last time, your swordsman can't solve all the problems." After that, his body squirmed and re-grown a full arm. Then Chanet looked at Evan in a hazy manner and disappeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, this is not over yet!" Evan quickly ran back to everyone, and Arnold had become weak because of the cast. Emmon and Evan worked together to extract the holy emblem of the Mother Earth from the priest's palm. High heat has burned out Arnold's palm, leaving criss-cross wounds on it. But the more serious injury is Arnold's eyes, which have not responded to the outside light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if it's awkward or temporarily blind." Yao En's voice is shaking, but he tries to calm himself: "No matter what, He must not see anything now, I love you to help him, let us leave this place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid we can't go." Arnold suddenly opened his mouth. "The evil of black is just behind us, I can feel it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan holds a long sword, but his naked eyes can't see the enemy. "He needs to come out of hiding when he is attacking. At that time I can hurt him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chonem’s voice came from all directions, fundamentally I can't tell the position: "What can I do if I hurt me? I can recover quickly. Even if you cut my head, there will be new heads growing up. How long can you protect them? It is definitely not as good as my patience. I will Give you a chance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
