From now on - point 515 fans festival to enjoy double monthly tickets, other activities have to send red envelopes can also see a look! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the most important thing in a spell battle, is the power of the spell, the precision of aiming, or the choice of spell restraint? Siegel has many answers, but for the long-awaited Lion King Alexander, there is only one answer: the speed of the cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an opponent can only release one spell, but he can release two or three, even if the power of each spell is not necessarily strong, but with this The means are enough to reverse any unfavorable situation. He didn't want to be a monkey in Siegel's ray, so he observed the weakness of this spell by sneaking on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can shoot out the ray by simply clicking on the wand, and you donâ€™t need to swear, the action is also reduced to the extreme. It stands to reason that such a spell will not be so strong, but its power is great. For example, dissociation, iridescent ray, or death-like ray spell power is stronger than this strange spell, but it does not penetrate specific protective spells, so the threat is not as great as this spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no strongest spell, only the strongest mage. Alexander did wander for a while, but he quickly discovered the weakness of this ray spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He casts a spell while rolling, and finally casts high-level mirrors on and off. For a time, there were twelve rolling lichs in Siegel's sight, each one stained with black mud on the ground, and each one looked embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha!" Seeing this funny scene, Siegel laughed and stopped the spell in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich went on the ground and the twelve bones stood neatly across from Siegel. Higher mirroring can create the illusion of the caster in a false manner, making similar but different actions, with the same magical aura, and can interact with the surrounding environment. It is also more resistant to regional spells, such as fireballs, and when the illusion is broken. New additions will be made every few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can only choose one for targeting at a time. The result of guessing is that Alexander releases the spell. After he laughed a few times, he gestured a spell and knew it was a real visual spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all illusions are restrained by real visual spells, which essentially eliminate the elemental fluctuations of illusion magic. Thus directly blasting the illusion. Alexander naturally wouldn't let Siegel cast this spell. He leaned back slightly and then slammed forward and screamed "Destroy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death Mantra As the Thunder exploded on Siegel, it was blown directly into pieces. "Not good, fooled!" Alexander found himself hitting a phantom. The real Siegel hid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be that when he rolls the cast, Siegel recognizes the magical aura of high-level mirroring, and then instantly develops his own tactics. The afterimage stealth technique is a good blind eye method, which can leave a false shadow in the original place, and the caster's body is invisible. However, what kind of shadow is left is the most crucial. After all, the opponent is not a fool, and always pay attention to the changes in the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows that Alexander uses high-level mirrors to arrange illusions and to create the illusion of a true visual spell. While invisible, Siegel used the elves to reduce the footprints on the snow. Move away from one side quickly. He used a high level of invisibility for himself to replace the common invisibility that would be defeated by attack or spelling, and quickly hid behind the rocks on the hillside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander found himself being deceived, guessing that Siegel used the afterimage invisibility. He did not immediately display the invisible spell or the real vision to find the opponent's position, but the self-centered, outwardly cast a stinking cloud. As a dead soul, the stinking cloud that can cause disgusting, range and convulsions does not hurt him, and the spell of enhanced perception that he exerts in response to heavy fog is still there, even if the field of vision is filled with green clouds. Not affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisibility does not mean that there is no form. If Siegel moves in the clouds, it will still form a disturbance. Discovered by Alexander. The lich looked up and looked at him, and he first guarded against the sky. He didn't know that Siegel had mastered the pace of the elves, so it was not expected that Siegel's footsteps would be very light. The weak signal passed by the tremor was ignored by him, so he naturally thought of flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel held his breath and used the psionic vision to look into the clouds. The invisibility will be seen by the clouds, and the same is true for higher mirrors. Although this spell can interact with the environment, it is only known to avoid stones, trees, and not volley to the top of the cliff. Mirror shadow is not a physical object, and it is impossible to open the cloud. It will not let the stinking clouds go around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-and-a-half-and-a-half-length electromagnetic weapons were drawn from the space bag, and Siegel put it on his shoulders. He will never waste if he has only one chance. Aiming at the lich who is casting the next spell, Siegel uses the power of time and space. This is a small, empty vanity, and the attack distance and power are quite limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this finite comparison is compared to the vacant gun of the Xingsuo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the powers involved in time and space are by no means simple. Lion King Alexander also felt when Siegel used this power. He bit his teeth and said the trigger word "Time is standing!" Among all the protective spells on him, the most powerful one is the time pause triggered by the language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned, feeling a stronger force of time and space, and rushing into his own empty cannon. He himself is also oscillating time and space, and the two forces form a momentary balance, which gives Siegel time to launch the Nether Cannon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the eyes of Alexander, time is another look. Everything around it becomes slow until it is still, the light is dimmed but the environment can be seen faintly. In this almost pure black world, there is only one bright spot like a firefly, just beside the rock in front of your side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there should be no such intensity! The Lich's mind reacts immediately, and only normal speed objects can emit normal light! Then he saw a weird scene, a ring of light spinning towards himself, almost the same speed as a butterfly flying between flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is in the time-suspended environment, how can there be such a "quick" thing besides myself? This weird phenomenon worries him, so Alexander immediately stepped forward to avoid the side. I didn't think that I was stuck in the same place, and the action of leaving was as slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More surprised him is still behind. Just in the position where he stood, a halo emerged from nothing and gradually appeared. It has the same size and motion pattern as the flying aura, and it is completely carved out of a mold except for the difference in brightness. Alexander's half body is in the range of the aura, and it is this area that is extremely sticky, seriously affecting his mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a sergeant, especially a sergeant who has learned to pause the spell, Alexander thinks about the cause of all this, and then fills it up. Deeply admire. I don't know how Siegel did it. His attack crossed the barrier of time and space, and it was hit at the same time as the launch - even before the launch. It is only because of this subtle time difference that people can't distinguish, so they mistakenly believe that the attack has a "flying" process. If Alexander did not use time to pause, he could not see the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logically, he has been "hit", but the timeout has given him a chance to breathe. If the aura of flight coincides with the aura that limits his actions, then the "cause" of the attack and the "result" of the injury are complete, and he will inevitably be severely traumatized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally thought that defensive and counterattack could be combined, and the result was still desperately alive. Alexander made a lion-like roar and tried his best to get out of the halo area. His entire skeleton is deformed during the pull. Fortunately, the strength of the Lich body is much greater than that of the ordinary cockroach. Although it is awkward, it is completely out of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the timeout also ended at this time, and the void gun (gun?) finally completed the convergence of the two halos. A small annihilation black hole appeared in the volley, sucking all the wind, snow and mud around. Due to the reduced power, the annihilation of the black hole lasted for less than a second, and it blew open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest killing is concentrated at the moment when the black hole appears. The power of the explosion is only a little bigger than the fireball. There are still some gaps in the shield to break the division. The lich seized the opportunity to rush to the shooting point, but only saw the strange guns that were falling on the ground and constantly emerging with blue smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoulder weapons are used to launch a virtual cannon, and there is only one intensity, which has melted down after the shooting is completed. Siegel simply abandoned it and immediately flew into the sky. The explosion blew away the stinking clouds, and Alexander had already looked at the sky first. This time he had a great chance of using the air as the secondary direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
