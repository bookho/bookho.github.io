			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a deep breath, then pulled out the dust of the stars, letting the whirlpool of the portal engulf him. From the corner of his eye, you can see the door of the study opening, and Capricorn first came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the portal was closed, leaving only the momentary image of this moment in Siegelâ€™s field of vision. He seemed to hear the angry scream from the void. Everything around the madness began to sway, and the fierce shock came from all directions, constantly beating his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a rag that has been shaken, and blood is constantly ejected from his mouth and nose. The void devours the blood, leaving no trace of dregs. If it can't leave immediately from the exit, I am afraid he will be the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his wand and tried to mobilize the power of the elements around him to construct a spell, but nothing in nothing. He can only turn to his own body, squeezing the remaining magical energy from muscles, blood and bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only one chance to use a spell, Siegel did not hesitate to choose a spell that has been used hundreds of times: Elemental Summon. He adjusted the flames inside the group, formed a flying firebird in front of himself, and clamped himself with his claws, and slammed outward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell concentrates all of his magical energy, including spells that should have protected him from the void. For a moment, he was exposed to the void, and every pore of the body felt the pressure of being annihilated. The blood tried to squeeze the blood vessels and the skin to escape, the eyeballs also bulged out in the squeezing, and the coldness of death blew into the bone marrow, making his thinking slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a warm feeling in the place caught by the fire element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel only feels whirlwind, his eyes are fascinating, and his mind is rumbling. He didn't know if he spent a moment in the void or 10,000 years, because the feelings about time and space were all chaotic. There are sorrows everywhere, surrounded by his body, like a scene of countless wraiths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he recovered was the feeling of gravity. Like on a sea-going ship, it travels on the raging waves, constantly swaying, but Siegel does feel gravity. He knows that it is impossible to shake the world, only himself. So slowly recovered the touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to take a breath, the pain in the lungs was nothing compared to the joy of re-breathing, which made him know that he was out of the void of the transmission interval. With the heavy breathing, he slowly figured out whether the voice in his mind came from fantasy or the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the roar of grievances began to fade. That is actually the echo from the heart beat. The rotating color is gradually replaced by green fluorescence, here is the skull throne hall, the lines on the ground made of plasma are clearly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel found his hand on the line, a lot of electric energy like a rushing river, constantly scouring his skin. He jerked his hand back. As a result, it lost its balance and fell on the hard brass floor. His skull heard the ancient sounds of history, and the sound of the sizzling currents contend with each other, gradually blending with the sound of the heartbeat, and finally become a distant background sound, and finally everything goes to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necklace with the twenty-faced scorpion is in front of his eyes, and the number 4 on the plaque glitters. He struggled with his hand and understood its role: immune to the damage of the plasma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this ability? Siegel is puzzled, why not let himself survive the void? To test the life and death test, it was the earliest life and death when crossing the portal. It is the first time to squeeze out the power of the elements in the body. Why is it the plasma immunity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell to the ground, regained control of the body little by little, began to concentrate, and used meditation to restore focus on magic. He calls for the energy of the elements around him, but the magical energy is cracked in his hands like a broken ice, leaving only the purest energy, the only kind of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tingling sensation spreads through every bone and every muscle of his body, causing his body to twitch involuntarily. The magic that should have poured in did not enter, leaving only a hollow wound. If he did not drain the energy of his body in the void. Not so much, but now he is like an extremely dehydrated patient, still taking vainly from the desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the dust of the stars? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood up and looked at the ground that had become a mess because of the transmission. Most of the items that were sucked in, mainly books and papers, were all destroyed by the plasma network on the ground and turned into a black residue. His sword is not at hand. Instead, it was inserted in the back of the throne, and it kept shaking. Siegel walked over and pulled out the long sword. At that moment, he seemed to hear a cheer of cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not an illusion? Siegel frowned. In this strange place, everything can't be careless, and any clue can decide life and death. He held the sword and observed the place where the dust of the stars hit. At the top of the back of the king's seat, the blazing gems on the claws are shining. A clear wound is just a few inches away from it, just in the rumor that "the flesh and blood will eventually die, only thinking forever." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flattened the sword and pointed the sharp tip of the sword at the red scent of the soul, stabbing one inch and one inch. With a sigh, he heard a calm voice saying, "Stop, stop your crazy moves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green lines of the plasma on the ground began to beat, Then slowly retract and eventually converge under the base of the chair. Siegel waited quietly for a while until he saw a floating shadow on the chair, a silhouette with a middle-aged human man. He has wavy curls and neat moustaches, his eyes open with calm and deep eyes. He seems to be a broken leather armor, the iron guards worn on his hands are incomplete, and the cloak behind him is more like a fire burnt, full of holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Monroe. Towan, the steward and prisoner of the King of the Shadows." The phantom said: "Please take your star sword from the inflammation." Remove the soul crystal, don't destroy it, or everyone will be lost in the void."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send me back." The dust of the star is not shaking, still Against the blazing gems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't do it." Monroe replied: "I can only passively manage and protect, not open the transmission channel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you? Smart items, parasitic souls or projections?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a shadow of the dead." Monroe replied: "I am the remains of the destroyed world, the residue that should have disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You lie!" Siegel said: "I The shadows of the passing spirits are not like you! They..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menro smiled softly, and his appearance and contours became awkward. In the blink of an eye, he changed into a milky white smog with a slight radiance. Then he changed back and said in a calm tone: "What color is the shadow of the dead spirit you have seen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost pure white." Geer replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then he is a lucky person." Monroe said: "The desperate hit without destruction is still the last will to be clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand." Siegel said: "What is the lingering shadow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The dead, the soul needs a place, perhaps the kingdom of God, perhaps a channel of certain rules. The soul is the most precious resource of the entire universe, not to be wasted." Monroe explained: "But if it is a certain world All the kingdoms of God are destroyed at the same time, the souls of the whole world are gone, what will they be? Eternal life is a curse, and eternal death is even more. This is the ghost of the dead, the homeless lonely ghost. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So can you be attached to other people's grievances, but it is also a shadow of death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes." Monroe replied: "Only in the soul of the soul, you can gradually remove the grievances of the passing shadows, so that they have the brand from the last world. Lost. Only in this way can we integrate into the kingdoms of other worlds and find a home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is why the grievances will continue to be attached and strive to create one after another. One death. They want to adapt to the rules of the new world in this way? No wonder they will gradually become dim until they disappear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
