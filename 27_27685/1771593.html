			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jackdaw Tribe has undoubtedly become the largest tribe in the northern grasslands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bond of in-laws, the Jackdaw Tribe and the Black Wolf Tribe combine to form the closest core. Giant Kerry also used his strength and courage, as well as the character of boldness and trustworthiness, to gather the Red Sun Tribe, the Broken Spear Tribe and the Cave Bear Tribe. According to the intelligence of Siegel, they found the holy land belonging to the nomads on the grassland. The water and grass here are beautiful and the climate is pleasant, which is most suitable for the tribe to recuperate. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the end of the orc war, the generals of the jackdaw tribe have returned to the scale of 5,000, and the warriors who can fight on horseback are 1,500. They split into large groups on the grasslands and absorbed all the weak tribes. If they are willing to surrender, they will relocate the entire tribe. If they are not willing to surrender, they will take the materials and horses away, and the heads will remain in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jackdaw Tribe and the White Bird family are black and white, and the flag is the opposite, but they share a good silver mine. With enough money, the Jackdaw tribe buys all kinds of supplies directly through the Bird's Nest, especially the weapons and armor they used to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armed jackdaw tribe is unstoppable and moves forward to Deepwater City. The masked lords of Deepwater City have already felt the pressure, and their trade with the goods of Mora has been greatly affected. Just as the masked lord organized the army and tried to crusade the giant Kerry, the war that the elves suddenly launched disrupted their plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing is such a rare event that the "black wolf" of the Jackdaw tribe saw the opportunity and suggested that her husband officially call Khan and unify all nomadic tribes. Under his management. This proposal has received the support of almost all the cravings of the jackdaws. Kerry is also very heart-warming, but how can it be implemented? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough statistics, through constant annexation, at the beginning of the Elven War, the Jackdaw Tribe had a population of 20,000 and a warrior with five thousand battles. These people walked within the sanctuary and were divided into four large residential areas. Three of the finished glyphs protect the core jackdaw tribe in the middle. The population of other tribes on the prairie is four times that of the jackdaws, but they have not been able to form a joint force, and it is sooner or later to be annexed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kerry didn’t want to be a King of Khan by threatening only by force. So he asked Mesera to think of a way to gather all the tribal leaders. He wanted to see which tribes supported him as a sweat and who dared to oppose it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Wolf Princess" Mesilla thought of an idea. There is nothing wrong with the winter grassland. Held a contest in the Holy Land and selected his wife for the prince of the Jackdaw tribe. Although the little guy just learned to talk, he was lively and active all day, wild and crazy. But he is the eldest son of the giant Kerry, the most likely heir of the future Jackdaw tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More. When he gets married, it takes at least ten years. In this decade, the tribes who have caught this relationship will be able to live a good life. It is a good choice to form an alliance with the Jackdaw tribe, or rely on shelter under its wings. According to the current situation, the jackdaw became the first grassland without any suspense, which is a good backing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to tradition, whether it is a contest or a prince’s marriage, it is a very influential event on the prairie. Therefore, Kerry proposed that it should be carried out within the Holy Land, witnessed by the heavens and the earth, and no one can raise any objection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant Kerry ordered the messenger to leave and sent a message to each tribe. The tribes arrived as scheduled, including the mighty tens of thousands of prairie warriors from the tribe's first tie, the same number of horses and vehicles filled with gifts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing on the grassland is the venue, but it is quickly filled with the newly added population. Animals, horses and carts are stationed on the edge of the Holy Land, and various tents stretch for miles. The consumption of food is a headache. Fortunately, the jackdaw tribes have long been prepared to consume the cattle and sheep that they plundered but did not produce milk or produce piglets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more people gathering, and more and more. The idle warriors began to fight after eating and drinking, and consumed a lot of energy. The contradiction between tribes and tribes always requires a solution, so dozens of fights occur every day in the camps of outsiders. Bleeding is only a small meaning, and the situation of the dead is not uncommon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry heard these things, just smiled a little: "Do not die on some people, how can the Warriors Conference be grand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, but it's very important." Kerry took a kiss on his wife's face and said: "The contest is very sacred. You must not marry the three spirits. Be fair and just."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the contest was started earlier. Anyone who wants to participate can receive a number plate to indicate their identity. Since most people are illiterate, and some even recognize the numbers, the cards they carry are all pictures. Different combinations of animals such as cattle, sheep, horses, birds, snakes, and dogs are used to distinguish. For example, Kerry's brand is five lively white crows, and an unnamed contestant has won the "Bulldog, Snake, Horse and Sheep" brand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the wisdom of the prairie people, but the problem is that the picture is not accurate, some people's aesthetic eyes are also very unique, always pointing to the horse is a dog. Therefore, there will always be mistakes, and it is not uncommon for the big shots to be made. After Kerry heard about it, he laughed and said that everything is the will of the three spirits. What is so strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors sighed with sweat, muscles and muscles slamming. The tribal leaders are more concerned about another thing, in the end, the girl who can marry the prince of the jackdaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the middle of the mountain, in the long hall built of wood, stone and grass, the power of the entire grassland is concentrated, and the noise of the quarrel is deafening. The giant Kerry sat in the highest position and looked at everything with a smile. He was on the upper body, and the strong muscles radiated a red glow under the fire. The necklace with animal teeth and gems hangs on his chest, covering the faint scars that have healed. Every time you kill a person, you can string a tooth. If you don't complete a victory, you can string a gem. Kerry’s chest has been hung with three strings of such necklaces. As long as he moves his body, the necklace will make a loud noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people under the table will always make a similar result, and then you can know how many forces are on the grassland. Picking up the wine on the table next to him, screaming and sipping it - this room is hot, not at all like the feeling of going into the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missella reminded him in advance, so don’t be impatient, and don’t express your opinion easily. If a child wants to marry and have a child, how can he spend ten years, and don’t worry about being a father. He only needs to sit in his seat and watch it calmly and listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry thought he could do it, but he soon became bored. The temperature of the people here and the long hall made him feel a little uncomfortable, and the sound of fighting outside was more seduce his attention and challenged his patience. His muscles are beating with excitement, just like warming up before the war. However, there is no opponent here, and the feeling of anxiety grows. He drinks another glass of red wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine was hot, which made him very uncomfortable, squatting on the servant’s ass and letting him roll on the ground. "Go, go find some water outside, I want to make ice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant quickly climbed up and went out from behind the account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one cares about this move, the leaders are still quarreling. Because it is married, the woman's age is smaller than the Jackdaw Prince. It is no problem, so even women who are not born can be compared, and the scene becomes more and more chaotic. This is like a bragging conference. There is no standard for discussion. It depends only on who has a big voice and a thick arm. Only two people sat in the corner of the long hall, did not speak, and looked at Kerry on the table with a gloomy gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wore sheepskin coats and wrapped themselves tightly, seemingly very afraid of the cold. The two men are not as strong as the prairie warriors, and the slender fingers obviously have not caught the sword for a few days. They had two heads together, an eagle hook nose, a knife and a face, and they talked softly to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect the suppression of magic here so strong." The person with the hook nose said: "My spells are almost completely invalid. How are you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another knife nodded, very helplessly said: "I am the same situation. Spells, scrolls, and even magic rings can not work, only potions The situation is better. Without a spell, you only have to rely on medicine and hypnosis to control Kerry, but all need to be close to him and have a chance to be alone with him. Do you have a way?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle hook nose shook his head. "Don't look at him, but the guards around him are not simple characters. Without magic help, you can't get close. But the winner of the contest, you need to be the organizer of the conference. Toast, that may be an opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
