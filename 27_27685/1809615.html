Siegel sat at the boardroom table, right The colleagues of the Federation said: "You should feel the whims of the Masters Association. I am worried that this time they will recognize our orthodox identity, and then there will be other conspiracy behind the willingness to provide assistance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the expressions of other mages. Some people frowned. Obviously there were other thoughts in the heart, but no one dared to raise objections. After waking up, William talked about the process of the incident. Everyone analyzed it and thought it was obviously a premeditated plan. The goal was to target the Masters Union and Heim’s Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire federation was caught unprepared, and everyone found that their vigilance and combat effectiveness were really bad. If it wasn't for Waywood to regain control of some of the secret nuclear weapons, it would be hard to avoid the magical spaceship crashing; if not Wendy led Alexander to the city of Mith, the gunners of Heim's collar and the school of magic school dragged the enemy. If it wasn't for the Siegel sergeant who came back at an alarming rate and then defeated Lion King Alexander, the disaster caused by this incident would have to be deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, when Siegel raised objections, no Master expressed his opposition. Unconsciously, Siegel has established a high prestige in the Federation. In the past, everyone trusted him, but this time he did not fight with the lion's spells. His "wei" could not be established quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if "wei" is used too much, it will affect the more important "letter". Siegel paused and knew that no one objected, but he turned around and said to everyone: "The intention of the Masters Association is doubtful, but on the other hand, spell scrolls, magic books, and various materials are good. Things, we don't have to refuse. According to past agreements, some things should have been ours. The aid of the association is not out of thin air. The former seniors of the federation also contributed to the Masters Association, including copying scrolls and making magic. Items. So I think it is okay to receive assistance with purpose and restrictions this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many mages nodded unconsciously, with a smile on their faces. Siegel exchanged a number of higher spells with cloning. This matter has already spread in the federation. According to past practice, the sergeant will provide a copy to the federation after he has learned the spell. However, after all, it takes a while to wait. How can it be more convenient to directly receive the magic book of the Masters Association? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention not just high magic scrolls. Ordinary spells and spellcasting rituals, spell tactics, these things are very important for a large number of formal mages who are free from apprenticeship. So they are happy that the Siegel Master can agree to re-establish a relationship with the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have to tell you one thing. When Alexander started attacking the Federation and my castle, I was outside the Tower of the Masters of the Masters. I originally thought Using the transfer and transmission channels, I came back at the fastest speed. But the Tongtian Tower released the space lock spell.” Siegel’s face was very serious, and the eyes were swept over the faces of every member of the board to ensure that he The meaning can be accurately conveyed to everyone: "This incident will never be a coincidence. The association has not given up the action of completely digesting and absorbing the federation. As long as it is not careful, the federation will still be seriously hurt or even destroyed. It’s not alarmist. Think about it. If there is no my cloning, how many people will die because of the injury?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s look around, Wendy and Simonton is not on the scene. They are still under the protection of eternal stagnation. The morning priest, the priest of the Mother Earth and the magic statue Rhett have come to see, no one has a good grasp of treatment. So Siegel can only make clones for them. Coupled with the amount of work required to complete the Tongtian Tower, seventeen clones in Siegel's laboratory are slowly growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My opinion is like this, no matter what you do, you must never let go of the vigilance of the Masters Association. Think about the existence of the Masters Association for so many years. How many Masters' organizations were born, where did they go, and how many are there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federation should be alert after this time, At least Siegel hopes so. After attending the meeting of the federation. I also have to deal with things that Heim is leading. As the castle was attacked, he wrote to Evan to take a leave of absence and not to attend the pre-election meeting. I believe that the younger Todd, who is in his thirties, will not have a problem that he must solve before he can sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the Federation. The affairs of the territory are much simpler. The simplicity of the villagers made him feel relaxed in spirit. He would rather manage the little things of these horses and cows all day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rabbit industry has only emerged in these two years. Due to the increase of the knight, the demand for rabbit skin liner inside the armor is increased, and the rabbit meat itself can be eaten. The rabbit fur is also a good warm material. Apart from the knight, the market of ordinary residents is not small, so the rabbit is also More. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man put down the rabbit and said deeply: "Respected lord, I am Marjorie Rabit, son of Thai Rabit, Rabbit Farm The owner, I have recently encountered a problem, my rabbit has a strange stone in my head. The rabbit's brain is a very popular food, many pubs specialize in buying rabbit heads. But since the long stone, they are I don't buy it from me. This is also a loss of money. It is not worth the trouble of the Marquis. But recently there have been rumors that my rabbit is cursed, which affects all the business of my rabbit farm. It is going to go bankrupt, so I can ask the adults, can you see what is going on, if it is not a curse, you can make my family regain innocence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not? Going to the priest of the temple? Breaking the curse they are better at it, and they are always there, but I don't often be in the territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you are mine Lord, I believe in adults." Marjorie is very strong. Answer the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and walked down from the main chair and came to the man: "Well, since you said so, I will try. Actually, I It won't raise a rabbit, and it's far worse than you in this respect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking out a rabbit from the cage, Siegel noticed something different. It is obviously an ordinary gray-haired rabbit. Why is there a slight elemental reaction? He used the detection magic, turned over and carefully observed, and found that the rabbit's head really has magical aura. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I bought this rabbit," Siegel said, his hand twisting around the rabbit's neck, then pulling out the dagger and cutting the skull. Marjorie seems to know what the Lord of the Lord wants to do, and reaches out and points to him: "Adult, just in that place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Obsidian is the first to pick, the blade The tip has an irregular stone. Siegel let the invisible servant come to the water, carefully wash it and put it in the palm of his hand. The faint magical light is emitted from this stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All rabbits are like this?" Siegel frowned after receiving a positive answer. If it is an ordinary mage, I am afraid I still can't see it. With his rich experience in elemental magic, Siegel found a stable elemental polymer structure from the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter how many rabbits you have, I have to." Siegel said: "These stones are very interesting, maybe my magic test is worth using. So, after you raise the rabbit, the stones in your head are dug out to me. I will buy it at the price of a five-copper plate. Would you like it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Thank you, Lord, I am willing!" After the person thanked him, he left with joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has dealt with a few things and returned to the lab early. This time the information about the rabbit farm has been placed on his desk. Marjorie’s rabbit farm is not far from the secret nuclear mine. In addition, the feed he uses is no different from other rabbit farms. It seems that only the Peruvian nuclear is the biggest cause of this. The high concentration of elemental forces affects the rabbit, leaving this crystalline stone in its brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elemental aggregates are very stable, can store a large number of elemental energy structures, and it also has the ability to convert elements. Siegel's four-pulse arrows and the Miereng nuclear are based on elemental aggregates, and they themselves have the ability to produce and condense elements for polymerization. The small stones in front of them are mostly useless impurities, but there are pure elemental polymerization crystals in the innermost tiny areas. Siegel estimated that if this piece of crystallization releases the force, it can satisfy the elemental energy required for a fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you imagine a rabbit releasing a fireball, I am afraid everyone will laugh out loud. But if they know the category of magical beasts, it is not difficult to understand the relationship between rabbits and fireballs. For example, petrochemical lizards that can be petrified, green-footed dragon snakes that can spur lightning, and flash dogs that can cast any door spells are all kinds of magical beasts. Maybe these rabbits are too young, or they don't use the energy in their bodies, but to a certain extent, they start to move away from ordinary animals and change in the direction of the magical beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Marjorie said that their rabbits, regardless of their size, have such stones in their heads. If you rely on the environment of the secret nuclear core, so that each rabbit has a change, then the probability of change is too high, obviously impossible. A more reasonable explanation is that after a rabbit has undergone a change, its descendants inherit this characteristic, which gradually increases the number of "crystal rabbits". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
