			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood Magic is born out of Necromancer and Change spells. It is a series of spells that specialize in the structure of biological bodies to control and weaken. According to the general concept of the Masters Federation, blood magic has its own unique features, and has contributed to the discovery of the Master's own strength, but that is all. The technique of using blood as a method of casting is widely circulated, and in order to prevent a bleeding ritual, the Federation stipulates that only the blood of the caster can be used. For the spells of the Blood Magic series, most of them use too many curses and torture effects, which have been biased towards evil, which may cause the general public's fear of the Master, which is unfavorable for the development of the Masters Union. So the Federation "suggestion", don't abuse blood magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is now disguised as an orc witch, he must not use elemental spells, and all the spells he knows are blood magic. Serge has no psychological burden on the orcs using such spells. He whispered his curse as he licked the bloodstone. The mask just masked the movements of his lips and the voice of the curse. Except for Colin, who was sitting next to Siegel, others did not know that he was casting spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of the spell, Siegel clearly heard the beating of the spear male heart, and clearly saw the roar of blood flowing in his body. This is a strong orc, the skin, muscles, internal organs and bones are strong and strong, but can he exercise blood? Siegel concentrated his spirits and shook the blood of the orcs, making them like wild horses in the blood vessels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect was immediate, and the spearman was stunned and fell to the ground in the eyes of everyone. Half of his face turned red, and the other half was white as wax paper, and the irregularities on both sides of the next second were exchanged. The spear man opened his mouth and tried to breathe, but still felt tired and had a strong suffocation. Siegel quickly mastered the trick, using his own voice to control the vibrations of the orcs' blood, and to focus the spell on the tiny blood vessels of the spear's ear. For the orcs, he immediately heard a low roar, a majestic voice echoing in his mind: "obey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus a little fear The effect, Siegel, killed the orcs' self-confidence. I saw the spearman throwing his weapon, kneeling on the ground, and slamming his head. "I surrender!" The orc took a breath and said with the strength of the whole body: "I will become a servant of the Witch Festival, giving blood and life, and the Beastmaster will witness my vow!" After that, he smashed and made a kiss. The ring on the hand of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Siegel is not willing to let him really swear, otherwise the Beastmaster is likely to hear this passage and then anger. Siegel is a personal class, and the Beastmaster is very proud and will not let his people serve any other race. Siegel took back his sleeves and shrouded it quietly, then calmly said: "I don't need your loyalty. I need a wolf, not a dog. What method do you use to prove your ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will fight for you." Spearman Akus said: "Anyone who wants to threaten you must first step on my long knife and my body. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Start by holding this position." Siegel stood up and reversed the spell effect, allowing the orc's blood to carry. More nutrients are transported throughout the body, which makes the spearman feel energetic and full of vitality. He slammed his head on the ground, then grabbed the long-handled knife, stood up straight, looked at the orcs around him, and used the fierce and sinister face to stop the potential challenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Keep here, if I am back, the location is gone, then I hope that you are either dead or escaping. But if you are still alive to protect this Location, I will reward you." Siegel stood up and waved to Linko to let him lead the way. I can't be trapped here, and most of the towns haven't seen it. I haven't bought anything. I haven't heard anything. I have to take the initiative and can't let this embarrassing dwarf fool, Siegel thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do a full set of play, Linke can only keep up. He was short, but the pace was very fast, and the result was that the chain armor on his body was shaking and swaying - this armor was not as good as the one I made at the Gnomish grocery store, and Siegel laughed. Lin Ke rushed to the front in a few steps, guiding Siegel to the direction of the slave market. The "Witch Festival" behind him, with the attention of many orcs, with confidence and majesty, squinted through the crowd and left the accommodation area. Siegel deliberately made this gesture of unintentional threat, secretly observing everything around him with the eyes of the raven. He has the means, not a fool, and naturally does not place his safety on the "rules" or "commitments" of the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most noisy place in the whole bacon town is the slave market. Usually it will be pulled by a car, and the slaves in the cage are constantly being sold. The orcs will Ask for the price with cattle and sheep or iron. There will also be coins in the south, all obtained through looting. Orcs can't use it to buy things in human cities, so they can only be used as gold and silver, causing a big depreciation of coins. A lot of businessmen who are dark, courageous, and shameless will go to the orcs to exchange gold and gold for the coins, and then make a big profit from the value of the currency. However, most of the merchants will go to the coastal ports in the east and rarely go inland. At least Siegel did not see a human businessman in the town of bacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Commodities" are old and young, mostly malnourished, standing out of nowhere. They only had thick hemp ropes on their hands, only two or three whip whip, but no one dared to resist, obediently obeying orders, going forward, opening mouth, squatting, turning circles, jumping. Siegel took a deep breath and could hardly imagine what kind of power could distort humanity. Everyone is born free, this is the nature and beauty of life, and slavery kills this beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witch Festival adults." Lin Ke asked in a similar way: "What do you want to buy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Materials." Siegel whispered: "Start with herbs and bones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many unique animals living in the northern part of the Walled Mountains. They live in cold climates for a long time, and they often have ice resistance or flame affinity. Siegel walked slowly on the muddy ground and glanced over the stalls on the ground. The orcs will choose the slaves who will count and send them to sell things. Only if you sell well, will you be spared from the whip, maybe there will be a piece of meat to eat, so the slaves are very hard to scream. Most of them put a piece of cloth on the ground as a stand and put things out. Many things, even the seller, don't know what it is, so most of the sipping that Siegel hears is about the owner of the item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captains of the squadron defeated the elf's side patrol in a one-on-one battle. These are his trophies!" A slave shouted With. Siegel looked down and didn't believe that the elf ride would cross the deepwater city control area, come to the wall mountains and the orcs heads-up, and use dwarf-style equipment. However, there is a runestone in the cargo, which looks good and has the possibility of repair. Siguel stayed in two steps, and the slave thought he had attracted the buyer, making him even louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned and gave up the runestone. He felt that he had some inconspicuous thoughts, and that the use of witchcraft to market the market was somewhat swaying, and he did not want to use violence to solve all problems as a real orc. As in the case just now, the orcs will use their fists to educate the seller and when to close their mouths. Siegel understood the correct way, but he could not get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to speed up the action so that it didn't take too long to reveal flaws. Siegel took out a bag containing silver blocks of different sizes, cut from the blood magician's silver ingot. Although silver is soft, it cannot be used on weapons, but it is a good thing to make amulets. And the black market merchants from the South will collect money, so it is more convenient to use this transaction. "Linco, hurry, what do I mean, what do you buy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel quickly picked some herbs, animal bones and teeth, and some colorful stones. He also bought a few amulets, not the ability to "guard" the above - if they used to be used, then they would not be sold here. Siegel saw that several talismans might use a relatively rare additive that could be used to make some implements. In the absence of a wand, the implement is also an alternative. For example, with yellow corundum as the main material, the magical array is created by adding sulfur and gold powder to the melted aluminum liquid, and then the inlay is made on the iron ring to enable the mage to cast most of the flame element spells, like a wand. same. Few wizards do this now, after all, the wand can replace the entire system, and it is cheaper and easier to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has bloodstone, and there is dragon blood in his space. At the market, he has gathered the remaining materials, and goes back. Try to make a weapon of blood magic. Other instruments are best made if possible, but Siegel turned two laps and failed to get the material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a deep water city after all, not a well-developed business. Siegel decided to stop and told Lin Ke to return. I don't know how the situation in the accommodation area is, and the orc Akus is still alive. Just as he was about to leave the market, the four orcs stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These guys are obviously not ordinary orcs, they are wearing a similar iron armor - modeled after the human breastplate, it is good in the north. Protective gear. Each armor's chest is marked with red paint on a sign with only three fingers. They stopped in front of Siegel, first stunned, and then said: "This witch singer, our Karrug bloody adult invites you to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is he a general?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, he is also a witch festival adult." The orcs let a road open, one of them reaching out to make a request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
