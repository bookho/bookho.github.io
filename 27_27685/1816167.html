			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a fool can fight against the wall of the storm, even the gods can not overcome this power to end everything. Perhaps the rules mastered by the creation god can suppress or eliminate the wall of the storm, but this is only the speculation of the gods, and no one has ever seen the creation god do this kind of thing. Everyone only knows that when the wall of the storm is angry, the lightning that destroys everything can even burn the power of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time stops!" For a moment, Siegel absorbed the power of the surrounding time rules and made his movements fast. He quickly casts spells, extracts energy from divine power, changes the flow of time around him, and forms a time-space shock wave that can be slowed down. But when the devastating lightning appeared, the time-space shock wave was easily broken, and there was no obstruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned, increasing time shocks. He no longer wants to influence the wall of the storm, just to allow himself to get extra dodge time - this time can still be achieved. When the lightning fell, he had left the range that was supposed to be attacked and shifted out a few feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the effect of this time shock is much weaker than expected. I should have enough time to leave here directly. I shouldn’t just move this distance. Siegel took a deep breath and carefully felt the flow of elements around him. When he did not use divine power, the wall of the storm almost turned a blind eye to him, and finally there was no next destruction of lightning. However, in order to solve the doubts of the mind, Siegel still uses divine power to create a regular seed in a small scope, which is the effect of imitating legendary spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroy the lightning and smash it down, it looks a lot faster than normal lightning. But Siegel knows that this is not that lightning is getting faster, but that he is slowing down. Destruction of lightning can not control the time and space of the field, it will always be the same mode to attack. So in the area where Siegel is located, the time flow rate is not normal, and it is a minute inside, and it may take many hours to go outside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a god, there’s enough warning and reaction to the attack you want to launch yourself, and the non-legendary spells move with your heart, then you’ve just been destroyed by lightning. Killed. The gods bring themselves here and put them in a slow time field. What are they going to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, he immediately casts a teleport and is ready to leave. However, the transmission spell seems to trigger some kind of setting, and the magic array that trapped the shadows of the dead began to collapse. Siegel immediately understood that the space folding effect of the Factional lost structural stability when it transmitted the spell, which led to the beginning of the collapse. If left unchecked, these shadows will leave the storm wall area without any scruples. Siegel has seen the threat they can pose to civil society, and naturally it is impossible to let it go. He gave up the teleportation and used his magic to hold the collapsed squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the burden of a thousand squats on the shoulders, even the magic god needs time to adapt. One after another spells are read from the mouth of Siegel, constantly added to the broken magical array. The spirits of the dead saw the opportunity, began to arrogantly left and right, and attacked everything they saw. Although most of them hit illusion, they also consume the power of the squad, thus destroying its stability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you talk about the peaceful circle, how can they compare me!" After Siegel stabilized the folding space, he began to create a peaceful array. Learned in life. At the same time, he also ordered the star to take off, defending the city of Mystery with the highest alert state, and all the holy people who tried to approach were shot and never merciless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if this is a misunderstanding, Siegel has enough power to protect his territory and his family. However, the saints of the gods did not go to the city of Miele, and did not even take a step toward the direction of Heim. Their purpose is to go east and all the way to the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel received a message from his own clone of the Holy One, first stunned, and then his face became very cold. The clones guarding the front of the prison were still doing their due diligence experiments, and suddenly more than a dozen saints sneaked and besieged and quickly killed it. Although this loss is negligible for the Holy Spirit of the magic god, it is enough to declare the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can resurrect his own clone of the Holy One with one thought, but the Holy One of Death is by his side, using the death whip to bind the clone The neck of the body. Even if Siegel resurrected him, he would only experience another death and could not change the situation. So Siegel let it fall to the ground, as long as it can protect things in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the saints of the gods came out from the jail, and looked at each other with a look of disappointment and no sorrow. The Elf Saints nodded, and the saints who stayed outside were all relieved. In order to avoid night dreams, they quickly left and went to the outer plane to avoid the tracking of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The timing is really exquisite! This is the only chance that you are likely to succeed. It is in your hands! It is an experienced warrior!" Siegel thinks a little, and the power of the god of knowledge immediately helps him. Clear the clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Styx vows are powerful and can't be destroyed, but there is a way to get rid of the oath. When the conditions of the swearing have changed and all swearers agree, the new vows can be used instead of the old ones. Siegel cut away from his prophecy and handed it to Chanem, and Chanem took it to other worlds. At the same time, Siegel has not completed the absorption of the fire, not a real magic god. The important constraint in the Styx vows, "The God of Magic, Knowledge, and Prophecy," is gone, and all the remaining gods have a chance to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can even think of how they will change. It is impossible to completely abolish the power of the oath, but it is still possible to "can not own, hold and study the dice alone" and "can only jointly own, hold and study the dice". The slight differences in language have led to a dramatic change in the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods decided to abandon the world, and Siegel’s remorse thought that he should have thought of this from the words of the dead sacred! When the wall of the storm descends, when the destruction of the world cannot be stopped, this is the first time that the gods have the opportunity to withdraw from their own saints. They stayed because they wanted to know the secrets of the ten-faced scorpion that could block the wall of the storm. It does not mean how deeply they really feel about the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions? Siegel laughed at his negligence. The more the gods come from, the more time they have, the more emotions are destroyed. Even if they are racial gods, their priesthood is only to maintain the continuation and development of race, and never guarantee the continuation and development of each individual. The wall of the storm as the power to destroy the crystal wall, like death, is the process that all races and lives need to face. Racial gods can retreat in a generous manner, which does not affect their priesthood and fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only this guy who has just become a god, still thinking about being a savior! There is nothing wrong with this idea, but it is wrong to relax the vigilance against other gods. The gods took a step more than him, using the time delay field and the shadow of the dead to drag him, modify the Styx vows, enter the prison, and take away ten scorpions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall of the storm shook a little, and several lightning bolts shot and blasted the pit on the ground. This time, the light that did not repair the cracks appeared, and the destroyed place was actually destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is only a small thing, the wall of the storm is deadly to the destruction of the rules. When it is full of force, even the divine power can not leave the crystal wall, everything will be enveloped in a closed black box. Under normal circumstances, the wall of the storm suddenly appears without warning, and does not give the gods the opportunity to evacuate. However, the situation in the world of the thunder wall is special. After the destruction of the storm and the scorpion formed a stalemate, most of the rules were not closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the stalemate on this level of rules is still there, otherwise there is really no hope. Ridiculously, I still want to establish a temple, establish a magic school, and build a Heim collar that can be happy for everyone. Now it seems that it is just a soap bubble dream surrounded by fine needles, which will be punctured and disappeared at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel faces a simple choice. With his ability to cast spells, whether or not he is repairing the circle of the shadows of the besieged spirits, he can leave his wife, children and all those who have relationships with him, and even leave a huge difference around the world. The door of the world, any who is willing to leave can leave. Before the storm wall closes all the rules, how much can you go, as for the world? Just throw it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple, clear, safe and not selfish, it takes only half a day to get rid of the threat of the Wall of Storm. As for whether or not to launch a war of God, to find those guys to calculate the accounts, it is possible to use hundreds or even thousands of years to plan and act. If there are other concerns that other gods want to launch the war, the god of magic and knowledge is not so restricted. No matter the means of intelligence, strategy, tactics and war, the god of magic and knowledge is never lacking. Even if there is any new way for the other god, it will become knowledge after the first exhibition, and it will be collected by him. Even if Siegel is only a new god, he can grow very quickly as long as he does not die. Experience and means are not obstacles to his success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the choice is to find ways to save the world, or to save everyone as much as possible. This means fighting against the power of the storm wall, staying here, and even dying here. If the wall of the storm does not close the rules within a year, then Siegel can also complete the absorption of the fire, and can create a saint with sufficient ability to cast, at least the true body can avoid danger. But who can guarantee this year? There is no precedent for the current state of the devastating storm, and no one can say that he knows what happened next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
