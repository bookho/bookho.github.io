From now on - point 515 fans festival to enjoy double monthly tickets, other activities have to send red envelopes can also see a look! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Siegel and Alexander fought deep into the wild, Siegel relied on the sun in the sky to determine the direction, and then tried to look to the west, actually vaguely I saw the shadow of several dragons. The dragon and Siegel are at least two hundred miles apart, opening their wings and squirting the flame while flying. Even if the sergeant is not much bigger than the ants in the field of magic enhancement, Siegel is glad that the battle here has not been detected by the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the body of the dragon, there is a row of rolling hills that resemble the walled mountains, and then the faint blue sea. There was a purple highlight on the Haiping line, and Siegel’s pupils shrank. He knew what he saw: the wall of the storm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has heard of the Wall of Storm countless times and got his knowledge from books, but he has never seen it before. At the moment he saw the wall of the storm, he had an impulse to find out, but reason told him that there are still many things to be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel dug a pit on the side of the battlefield and set up a transmission squad to allow him to locate the place. It used to rely on the space channel of Alexander to come here. If there is no channel mark in the future, it will affect the accuracy of building the space door. He buried the road mark with soil, looked back at the "trap cave" that Alexander prepared on the mountain, and then sent it back to the city of Mire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only about half an hour to fight with the lion’s spells. The city of Myrtle has gradually recovered with the concerted efforts of the castle knights, the federation mages and the mercenaries. Order. The return of Siegel excites the spirit of the people. When he declares that the enemy has been in anger, the knights are cheering and the mercenary is very excited. Only the Masters of the Federation are quite unnatural. They still have complex feelings for Lion King Alexander. This kind of feeling makes them not know what face to use to face the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first it was shock and surprise. Lion King Alexander did not die. He returned to everyone with William. William, who is seriously injured in a coma, is naturally worrying. But most of the mages miss the Federation of the Three Peaks, and naturally welcome Alexander back to the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they then noticed that it was wrong. Most of the wizards have found that the effect of mind control spreads in the magic spaceship, and many people feel that their thinking is slow and their vigilance is reduced. Some after the Knox Association event. The specially developed high-level mind barrier spell was triggered, and everyone knows that someone has invaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a failure of the magical spacecraft, and the board members who were in the meeting rushed to repair and protect the spacecraft. By the time they ruled out the risk of falling, they found that the Lion King had already fought in the city of Mith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation did not hesitate and immediately decided to help Siegel. The lion king Alexander. As a result, before they fully joined the battlefield, Siegel had already driven the magical spaceship that Heim led. The two sergeants left behind in tandem with one another, and no one else could track them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I heard the news that the Lion King had died completely. An era has completely ended, and a new era has come unstoppable. The wizard's mages looked at Siegel, the sorcerer who defeated the mighty Lion King. In addition to the creativity of the spell, he was also quite powerful in the battle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana led a team of knights to Siegel, who protected Janet and Isaac. Janet has seen the battle and experienced various dangerous environments, so she is very calm. Her eyes are full of attachment and love. There is no panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the little guy, he still doesn't fully understand what happened, his face is full of excitement. If it is not the mother's tight grip on the wrist, it is estimated that he has long been running through the castle, waving a small sword to find the enemy "battle." Siegel did not care that this was a big crowd, and he hugged Janet tightly and kissed her deeply. At the same time his big hand rubbed his son's black hair, and then pinched his soft cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Safe, let's take a break. I have to look at the situation at the federation." Siegel looked at his wife and said: "Some things I have to deal with it, I can only go to you later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go to the Master's business. I went to the town area with Isaac to see. Appease the emotions there.” Janet said with a smile: “Mana and her knight will protect me, and the mercenaries who come to help also need to contact them. Whether it is for justice or gold coins, they can help. Not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he walked over to Mana and solemnly said: "Thank you." The female knight snorted, rubbed her eyes, and then quickly responded with a knightly courtesy. "This is all about my business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be able to face the threat of the sergeant without retreating. Our knights and fighters are all good. Siegel roughly glanced at the surrounding situation: the collapsed parts were almost cleaned up with the help of earth elements, but the blood on the ground and the bodies that were being cleaned not far away were still eye-catching. "Don't deplore the gold coins, arrange the life of these war dead people. If there is any wish in their family, you can sum up, you can be directly responsible. In addition, the effectiveness of various weapons in this battle, whether the training is effective You also have to know what kind of combat power Heim has, how to command it, I will ask you all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana nodded hard, her right hand was Knocked three times on the breastplate, and then went to do her duty as the lord. Siegel had time to look at the situation here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty and Simonton were seriously injured, their chests were blown up, their internal organs were eroded by negative energy, and almost all were exhausted. Fortunately, the Federation had several more divisions, Wendy was protected by Siegel with eternal stagnation, and Simonton was protected by Verwood. Curse Master Wiewood is not in a good condition. He was also attacked by Lion King Alexander and was blown up in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not fall. He became a special ability and summoned by the cursing department, and the power to obtain a certain summoning was added to himself. By reaching a deal with an outsider, Weywood adds the power of the Inferno Ice Demon to himself. Other than that, strong body, tough skin, multiple resistance to elements, immunity to flames, and a certain degree of regenerative ability make him recover faster than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, this is the little finger of Simon, I think you got it like Wendy." In order to restore the wound, he kept on Eat in the ground. Can still look hungry and weak. Siegel patted his shoulder. "Why don't you have a therapeutic agent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My ability has both advantages and disadvantages. The drawback is that I don't like the sacred positive energy. So drinking syrup is useless." Wiewood barely smiled. Said: "How to eat and eat fat, isn't this good news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not in the mood to laugh, but he understands that Weywood wants to soothe Good intention of the atmosphere. "Is the Federation here... Is it a big loss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are six official mages who died on the spaceship, and ten of the magicians who came over to help There are about 30 injured. Fortunately, the injury is not too serious. The battle at the division level is too dangerous, even on the periphery, it is easy to cause death." Weiwood sighed: "Nobody thought." Alexander will become an evil lich. We should be alert when we see William being injured and comatose! Great, great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"William Injury and coma? Take me to see!” Siegel hurriedly grabbed Verwood’s wrist and led him to lead the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Siegel, I really can't move, let other people take you there. I stayed with several wizards to carry down Wendy and Simon. Although they are eternal, they can't be placed in the open air."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let others take me there." "Siegel didn't think much, and found a familiar wizard to lead the way and fly to the spaceship of the federation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first spaceship in history was full of explosive scars. The time and space of the Urco nuclear can cause an explosion in the spacecraft through the energy transmission system, the flames are raging, and the energy of various elements immediately causes subsequent damage. It was hard for everyone to stabilize it in the open space far from the castle, and to put the output of the Miereng nuclear to the lowest level, and then took out the hand to start the fire and maintenance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William was fixed in the hospital bed and was not affected by the confusion. Siegel checked and felt that he was shocked because of the injury. He is currently in a slow recovery period and should be fine. However, in order to be safe, Siegel still took a part of his flesh and blood. Prepare to make clones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wound, William should have been attacked by a surprise attack, most likely the hand of Alexander. However, Alexander is very secretive about his ability, and I am afraid that few people know it except himself. But I saw William injured. The wizard's mage did not raise their vigilance, and Siegel was worried about them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
