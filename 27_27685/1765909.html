			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the forward digging has reached the limit, and Siegel will start to trim the passage. He has also laid out some areas where he can rest and try to make the road easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day after day, it is difficult to estimate the time in the underground. The number of days is calculated by the frequency of the cable feeding system. For a whole week, Siegel flattened the channel floor and placed anti-slip bumps on the ups and downs, and according to the dwarf's instructions, cut holes to rest at intervals. He also tried to strengthen the rope system and turn one rope into two to increase the speed of cargo transportation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what other achievements you will make in the future, the title of the miner’s lord is certain." In the rest area, Dwarf Locke smiled at Siegel. Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong with this title." In the past, Siegel was still picky, and now he really feels that the title does not have much impact on her. The lord of the day war is also his title, but what role can he play besides letting him be somewhat fluttering? So the elf will not conflict with him, or will Knox co-own to bow down? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he decided to change the subject, discussing the title did not help much in the current situation. "Rock, how long does it take for the passage to dig?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been dug more than 270 miles, almost." The dwarf smashed his hand, then Look at your tight cheeks. The long hours of work made him look tired, but after hearing what happened on the ground, the tension spread to the dwarf. This passage is now built not only for the dwarves, but also for the entire Heimean residents. So the dwarves pushed themselves to the limit, even if they shine on the perseverance rune, and there is a hot honey beside them, so that he can't really relax. "If the map is not wrong, it will take about ten days to get through."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The side of the city wall mountain?" asked Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Siegel adults, here is not good or bad." A one-eyed dwarf swallowed the honey and smeared the mouth after saying: " If you have to describe the scene on that side, it will only be big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The beginning of a thousand miles, and the mountain side is not much different, humans, half-orcs, The semi-giant and the goblins are the inhabitants here. They live in the form of tribes on the grasslands. The wall mountains block the sea breeze from the east, so the grassland has a dry climate with few precipitation. Several rivers of snow are lingering. On the grasslands, the two sides of the strait are the most beautiful land. It is also the area with the fiercest battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After two thousand miles, it is an area where gullies and hills are mixed. The deepest place there is said to lead to hell. The largest thunderbird and the longest purple worm live here, rule the sky and the ground. On the ground are all kinds of strange beasts, predators encircling groups. Cattle and sheep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After then. It is the giant's In the disk, they are integrated into the mountains, and they can't be seen at all. We have seen the giants of the hills, the giants of the stone, the giants of the fire, and the giants of the frost. Brother Locke has also seen the giants of the cloud. Our runes master Kono brothers are making The one who was quietly thinking about the volume, he said that he saw the Titan, the waist and the clouds, the sun and the moon, and the hand holding the electric light shining like the Milky Way. We don't believe him, because how can other people miss the big things? However, in this area, we lost a lot of brothers due to the attack of the giants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a thousand miles of the giants, you can see a swamp. It’s hard to walk here, and some dangerous areas will sink with a feather. In addition to the sinister environment and the lurking Naga, shadow, and soul sucking, the most terrible thing here is the chaotic elemental environment. Suddenly bigger, simple light will become a big fireball. Some places are dead, the elements will not respond to calls, even magic items will become waste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, we have runestones, which are less affected by the environment than your wizard's magic. It is conceivable that in such an environment, the help of no spell power will be difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that, it enters the site of the dragon. A majestic barrier than the wall-walled mountains blocks our view of the West, and the dragons flying in the sky have hoped that we will continue to the west. We are here on the way back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel listened carefully, and there was a question in his heart. He said: "This road is dangerous, why? You still have to go back? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are many treasures in the swamp area, especially in places with high elemental concentrations. Even an ordinary grass can contain the power of life-saving. The mountains of the dragon are even more so. Although we dare not approach the site of the dragon, we can let Greedy they live in peace and are satisfied with their wealth, so there is no conflict. You can think about how many treasures there are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems no matter what At the time, the dwarf's pursuit of treasures will never change. Siegel will not swear by comment, in the end, whether the dwarf of the west enters the hope of pursuing freedom or the development of the dwarf, or simply for the endless land and its veins. As long as these dwarves can help themselves to play the channel, they will lead foreign aid to Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they have rested and finished eating, they walk side by side towards the tunnel excavation. Everyone has adapted to the rumble of the rumble and the dust that is constantly flying around. Siegel wears goggles and a mask, while the dwarf uses thick eyebrows and thick beards to cover it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time there was a shout in front of him, because the tone of the passage was somewhat distorted, and Siegel couldn’t understand it, but obviously Locke understood it. I saw him suddenly excited and picked up, and suddenly clung to Siegel, and said in his ear: "Turn it! Dig it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is there still a ten-day amount of work?" Siegel's words allowed the dwarf to calm down. "Let's go and see what's found in the whole!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came to the tunnel mouth as quickly as possible, and the gas element quietly stopped aside, in the air. The slightest floating. It does not use air control, but there is still a dry breeze blowing from the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several dwarves are using the crossbow to enlarge the hole, and the broken earth and stone makes a faint sound. They are all excited now, until Locke stops their actions. "What is the hole? What is the use of rushing to expand the hole? Have you forgotten how Kono died?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves looked at each other, Some shyly put down the tools in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the hole is a large tunnel, about ten steps wide, and the surrounding rock walls are broken. It can be seen that there were originally stalagmites that were staggered, but they were all leveled, leaving only a slightly raised flat root. Some rubble was scattered on the ground, hiding fragments of ore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves are fully armed and the guards come to the tunnel. They stepped on the rubble and the crisp sound echoed in the tunnel. “This is an abandoned mine,” Locke said. “It’s not known what is being mined here, and why it was abandoned.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other The dwarf picked up the ore fragments on the ground, rubbed them with their fingers, and then placed them in the middle of the teeth. “It’s an emerald gem mine, and the quality should be good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I remember emeralds are often used as defensive runes in the dwarf runes, with a strong soul The effect, including the fight against the dead, isn't it?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Locke nodded and said with appreciation: "Yes, you remember very clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Since this is a mine, will there be an exit to the surface?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is usually no. Most of the mines in the Walled Mountains are closed to the outside world. This is also to prevent outsiders from entering these intricate mountain passages through these mines. But I think at least it can help us to reduce a lot of work, at least we can dig a lot of distance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people look in front, wide tunnels have been Extend until the dark vision is not visible. Since this is a part of the mine, it will not attract the attention of the Walled Mountain Rune, so you don't have to wait a few meters to get a new rune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone will cover up the half of the hole dug out and leave four dwarf guards. Siegel then set off with four dwarves, including Locke, trying to find the nearest location to the ground. Even in the deep underground, lovers can distinguish direction, depth and estimated distance with unique senses. They will never get lost in the rock underground, even if it is a specially designed maze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that this place should have been wider, and the passage of the raft has been extended to the top of the hole, connecting the layers of the working platform. There are complex lifting systems here, some to transport goods, and some to transport dwarf miners to certain locations in the mountains. From these leftover tools, the mine was abandoned for a long time, and no one has been down for at least a hundred years. The rock walls here were dug and pitted, and the treasures contained in them were long gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
