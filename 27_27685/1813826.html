			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the life at the School of Magic must be carefully watched, it is a great place to learn magic. Endless information and experienced teachers complement what Siegel has always lacked. He has unlimited spirituality, but lacks systematic training and sufficient knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not possible to get to the fourth floor for the time being, the first three layers are enough to make him greatly improve. This improvement is not directly reflected in the combat ability - the level of spelling he now uses for combat is already strong - but in the breadth and depth of the spell. If faced with the same thing, he can have more solutions than the past, more efficient and more appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Magic has not been a newcomer in recent times and has maintained a six-person scale. Why is there no one knows why? The situation of the mutual help group has also stabilized. Everyone knows that they can't provoke Chanem – in fact, it is no different from when he used to be a worm. – Chanem also has a hard time calming down and not testing more people. In addition to spending a lot of energy to read and learn, Siegel also began to secretly seize all opportunities to fight for points, even at the expense of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His latest achievement was to simulate the destruction of lightning on the fourth floor of the Magic Tower. Although it is only an arc that gathers on the fingertips, the nature of the forces contained therein is exactly the same. Seeing this scene, Chanem rarely smiled. “It seems that sometimes there is a need to force it, and people will make progress.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to display such power marks a step closer to how to prevent it from being resolved. So there are indeed reasons to celebrate. From time to time, Siegel shows a little progress, you can stabilize Chanem, and fight for yourself and everyone else. He continued to go to the second floor of the Magic Tower, slowly progressing on several spells he had advantaged, and repeatedly breaking the record. For example, he can summon fifty element guards at a time, but control each level one more than the original record. Through such means, he quickly accumulated a large number of points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay a certain amount of points, students can check each other's points. The progress of Siegel's points has always been the focus of everyone's attention. Siegel earned fast and spent fast. A large number of points were used by him to exchange experimental materials and even to expand the area of ​​the living room. He didn't tell anyone what he was doing, he didn't mention this topic at all, because he knew that he only wanted to speak. Anna will know if this is the truth or a lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many uses of points have also been discovered, and everyone has been drawn to attention by these new "means." Siegel has never forgotten a point, that is a usage of the earliest known points. Spend thousands of points to know the true situation of a student, race, name, source world, and so on. However, this feature is too expensive. In order to know the Siegel squid, the human mage, from the Thunder Wall World, Heim, the city of Mystery, is the Marquis of the Star Kingdom and the sect of the Federation. These pieces of information add up to six thousand points. Who will be idle and nothing to consume on this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did this, day after day, and spent a total of eight thousand points. The target he was looking for was the female Elf, a group of magic school students. One of the three old ones. The result of the investigation is very strange, Anna is actually her real name. She is indeed an elf, from the Elven Kingdom of the Thunder Wall World, and is one of the faculty members of the Academy of Arts. She is already 772 years old and has lived in the School of Magic for nine years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this information is used, she actually announced her true identity earlier than Siegel, but she always claimed that she is still using the pseudonym. For such a contradictory move, Siegel couldn't think of what her motives were. He took the opportunity to use his remaining two thousand points to apply to the lamp god to permanently conceal his true identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your points are not enough." The lamp god answered this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having this sentence is enough. On the one hand, it shows that the lamp god can indeed provide such a service, permanently hiding identity; in addition, the cost of this service is very high. In the absence of Siegel’s mutual aid society, everyone lacks access to points. And they are constantly threatening each other, causing everyone's points to float up to 2,000. On the one hand, it is very strange that Anna can accumulate more than two thousand points. On the other hand, she actually spent the hidden real identity, which caused Siegel's deep doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember when Chennam was killed by lightning for the first time. Anna, who is on the second floor the next day, has more remaining points than the Orc. It stands to reason that the orc holy person entered the magic school earlier than her. No one can really threaten the saint. He will not spend much on magic learning. It is reasonable to say that he should have a lot of points left, but he still has no more than an elf. Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully avoided the attention of everyone and began to go back. Leaving the valley guarded by the stone pillars, through the huge seven statues of the mage, re-enter the mountain passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept calling on the mountain road and finally waited until the feather snake appeared. Five feather snakes flew up and down, constantly squirting flames and lightning, and dispelling the clouds around them. "Someone is back, the one who tastes better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately this time he stinks, mixed with the taste that I hate, brutal and powerful The brutal breath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that he wants to challenge us, is it so interesting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I told you earlier, you can't put water, you can't put water. You don't listen. Now he is coming to the door again. He came with contempt and came to despise him!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feathers and snakes talked with each other, the speed of speech is fast and fast, and the voice is like thunder. If they let them continue to talk, it is estimated that Siegel will have to accept another big wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You feathers, I am not coming to challenge, nor intend to offend. I just have doubts in my heart, I hope I can get an answer." Siegel rushed to use the biggest Speak in volume so as not to lose chances: "I want to know who is the first person to pass this area?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I tell you, little things." A feather snake laughed: "You don't have what we need, we won't serve you. We come from the clouds, live in the clouds, we only need these clouds to live forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is only cloud. There are a few feather snakes with you. Isn't it lonely?" Siegel said: "You five can entertain themselves, but they can't expand the group, can't Create new happiness. I can promise to help you to go to a new world in exchange for the safe environment here. In exchange for your doubts, don't know if this is possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several feather snakes glanced at each other, laughing happily New hidden into the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a return to silence between the mountains, and this thing seems to be over. But Siegel knows. Feather snakes are a very patient creature. They will observe and wait, and will not easily conclude. So Siegel left them time, did not leave the mountain road, but sat down to start meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the multiverse, feather snakes are powerful creatures with their own ethnic gods, they have their own world of the gods, have their own social structure, and even Some of the world's creatures worship as gods. They are born to be masters, and they can also control the power of life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having the permanent qualification of the second tier. The teaching class on the first floor is not mandatory, at least not because of the absence of points. Siegel sat in the cloud valley for three days, while meditating, while continuing to try to contact the feather snake. He knows that in the entire magic school, in addition to the lamp god, the feather snake is the only living thing, and the only original guardian who still has normal intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third night, the feather snake appeared again, but only the sound came and appeared in the mind of Siegel’s meditation. "Remember your promise. Strange Master, you promise our freedom of protection, we will give you doubts within the scope of knowing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you. "Siegel is a long breath." "Can you tell me who is the first to come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't know his name, only know that he is your father - yours The taste is in the same vein." Feather snake replied: "He is squatting all the way. Hahahahahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the power of the orc saint still has residual Siegel thought. "Who is it next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a personal class, but he didn’t succeed and fell off the road.” The feather snake’s figure flickers in the thick fog Suddenly, I patiently describe all the people who have passed from the passage to Siegel one by one. The sorcerer’s brows grew deeper and deeper, and the suspicions in his heart continued to strengthen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no female elf? Half-elves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Only male elves In the past, we are very sure about this.” Feather said: “Our nose can't be wrong.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
