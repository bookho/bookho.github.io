			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idis teacher, when you leave for the Masters Association, Sergeant Siegel has come to the library several times to check the blood magic related information. Dunbar, who is always nervous, wears a brown-gray robes with a brass-colored headband on his pale red hair. Perhaps it is nervous, perhaps because of caution, his body is protected by a circle of flame shields and has not been lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis said: "Blood magic is a very important but very unpopular area in the Mage Federation. Almost all Masters have learned how to use it. The power in the blood, in order to save themselves in an emergency. But there is another blood magic, how to use the blood to influence the fate, to intervene in the field of divine power and the will of the world. The simple power is not divided between good and evil, but In addition to cultivating a large group of ambitious and conspirators, this one has no achievements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nod, according to the records of the Masters Association This is indeed the case. "I understand your concerns, but I am not trying to change my destiny, but I want to reverse the strength of the blood that has been strengthened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis reached out and touched his mouth. Short beard, think about it carefully. There is only one body left in front of Siegel, and blood magic is of no use to him, so it must be for others. There is only one person who is most likely to have problems in the entire territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is your wife Janet having a problem?" Idis guessed the answer. "She has returned to her ancestors? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and told the Half Elf Master in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A very difficult thing to return to the ancestors, almost no solution." Idis said: "You also know that the power of blood and the life of a person is When you are connected, it is difficult to separate the two. When you move one of them, the other will be affected. Late or early, the part from the devil will gradually gain the upper hand and swallow up the other half of the mortal. If it happens to an ordinary person, there is still the possibility of healing. But for the devil, the returning ancestor is a part of birth, and any treatment will increase the speed of transformation."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't the Masters Association do nothing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis shook his head. Said to Siegel: "The Masters Association is not a panacea. Even if it can find a way, it will not be able to catch up before the permanent changes happen. As far as I know, the Association has not updated the research materials on blood magic for a long time. I am afraid that the blood magician is not as proficient as you said. And many mages believe that returning to the ancestors is to strengthen an individual strength, is a kind of strengthening, why not stop? The direction of magic research is tens of thousands, the mage who can be put into it. It’s too little.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I took back the Moonlight Moya Roll. I read it many times, but I don’t know how to repeat that blood magician. I also went back to the ruins of the bloody transformation magic array, trying to find clues. But it was cleaned and nothing left.” Siegel said: “I think that person should still There are accomplices, things about the bloodline are not over, there may be further conspiracy. Can this not cause the attention of the Masters Association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can not represent Master Association says heavy Or not, but there is one thing you should understand." Edith said: "The power of blood is powerful, and the direction of this research is endless, but you know how much more important than blood research, or more than a blood magician. Are the dangerous guys there? Not all mages are under the jurisdiction of the association. The Masters Association is not in the forefront of the world in every field. As far as I know, the association has discovered that the madman who wants to make absolute voids intends to The whole world has been brought into irreparable destruction; there is a method that specializes in ice mage to study the three elements of shielding gas, fire and earth, and infinite pursuit of lower temperature, resulting in a city being completely frozen, only one hundred years later Melting. So far, the movements of these wizards are still a mystery. If they are ranked according to the degree of danger, the blood magician will not attract their attention. And it is not a member of the association who encounters the curse of blood magic. It is just an ordinary demon. There is no potential for being a caster, and the association will not control it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of dissuasion in the words of Idis is very clear , The style of the Master Association, also as he said. I have never been concerned about the situation of non-casters. The only way Siegel thinks at the moment is to create magical runes, suppress the speed of Janet's growth, slow down the speed of blood changes, and hope to continue to find ways to delay the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel tapped his staff and stood up to prepare for the fare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the light suddenly appeared in the darkness, Siegel quickly seized on this hope. "Idis Master, please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most basic of every life is the blood, the most difficult thing to change is the blood. But for a class of people The blood is not a meteorite, but like water, it is fluid and can change. Can you know who I am talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel only used a few The answer is in seconds, but his doubts are deeper: "Are you a druid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf mage nodded: "Druid You can transform yourself into an animal, transform into an element, and gain all the abilities of animals and elements. Some druids can even become a dragon, and they can also use the power of dragon, spit, and dragon. This is not simple. The morphological change can only be changed from the pedigree level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But my current relationship with the elf is not good, how are their druids? Will you help?” Siegel said a question: “And does Janet have the qualification to become a druid? I don’t think it’s too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think wrong, not let Janet become a druid. Druid needs to realize, need to embrace nature with sincerity, not relying on learning and Imitation can be successful." Idis said: "My idea is that it is almost impossible to stop the growth of the devil's bloodline. Why not let Janet completely change a lineage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't understand." Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know that there are some pastors in the Mother Earth Temple, who have shown the power to resurrect the dead. Several very religious believers were intervened by divine power. Going back to the world. But what we want is not this kind of resurrection, because the process will restore the bloodline of life and will not change." Idis explained patiently: "The Druid has a spell ritual called reincarnation. Similar to the resurrection, but it actually changes the body and the race together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you change from a demon to an ordinary human? Can you get rid of the curse from the hell devil?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is theoretical." The Half-Elf Master said: "In essence, the reincarnation is actually dead once, attached to the blood of the body. The related things naturally lose their effect. The resurrection of the pastor can recreate the original body, but the reincarnation of the druid is a new beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Need to die Once?” Siegel was a little worried: “Is this safe?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The risk is definitely there. The transition between life and death is never going smoothly." Idis said: "This thing needs to be measured by yourself, is it really going to happen? That step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel calmly looked at the half-elves mage. Trying to find some clues from his expression. However, Idis has always been calm, just looking at his deep eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands. The Masters Association is not the task of saving Janet. Even if the strength of the association itself cannot be done, it does not mean that the association's network cannot do it. The most powerful thing about the Masters Association is not the books and knowledge they contain. But they have penetrated into every corner of the world. If you think about it and hand it over to Siegel's "Accurate Transfer Book", you will know the style of the Masters Association - Unicom's Quartet, gathering strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the use of the Network of the Masters Association, or the help of other Masters, has never been free. After Siegel entered the federation and became a formal apprentice, the first thing was to receive a price list. The prices of various spell services are listed above. It is natural that Idis will not help in vain, and only the exchanges required can form a solid relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Edith, how can you help me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also see When I arrived, I had half of the elves. I lived in the Elven Forest for nearly a hundred years. Even after I became a formal mage, I also had a relationship with him. An elf Druid owes me a favor, and he happens to be able to reincarnate. One of the Druids. I can use this person to ask for help, and I naturally want to benefit from you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, I "Dys Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reincarnation can't increase the natural life, so it can only be half life. I don't want more than this - half Life," Idis said. "You tell me how you achieved and maintained this state of affairs, and then taught me. This is the condition I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
