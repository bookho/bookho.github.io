			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Light God II finally has its use. It uses communication techniques to tell the history of the Griffin family at Siegel. Www/xshuotxt/com This is a family with the highest title of Marquis. The main family is known for being able to train lions and beasts and provide air force for the King of the Stars. The blood of the bird druids has been flowing in the blood of their family members. Each generation will have three or five good seedlings that can communicate with nature to ensure that they always have the means to continue to train the lions and beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is not the only family that can provide air combat troops, the history of the Griffin family and the starry kingdom are entangled in one war after another. A famous reputation has been made. The information on the hands of Siegel shows that the registration of the contest is only a young battlefield baron of the Griffin family, a teenager who is less than twenty years old. What can be seen in front of him is a staggered old man with wrinkles and teeth falling out. He came to the center of the hall with the support of two young maids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man behind him holds the flag of the family and looks at it with trepidation. This is a child who doesn't even grow freckles. He doesn't have a few muscles on his body, and he can't be a contestant. What is the Griffin family still doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The distinguished Earl of Siegel, the star lord and the * division, I am Hart Griffin of Frost Leaf City, on behalf of the Marquis His most sincere greetings." The old man is twitching and can speak with full anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and replied - Hart Griffin had only the baron's title, and such courtesy was enough. "May the Griffin family soar forever, and wish you good health."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the band changed a song and began to play the stars often heard. "The song of victory." This piece has many lyric versions, one of which is related to the Griffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why didn't you see the guy who came to the competition this time? I heard that he was honing his skills on the battlefield of the bandits and bandits, and still A good result has been achieved in a contest." - Light God II immediately consulted the information at hand and then told Siegel the information. "Witt Griffin. If I didn't remember the wrong name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really a strong blogger, Lord Lord, *Master. Witt is a proud The child - he is not ignorant of politeness, but wants to leave the best state to the time of the contest. He told me. I hope that the lord will recognize him at a glance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very ambitious person, I am looking forward to his performance." Siegel said to the old man: "Please try to taste the shark fin soup. The essence of the shark body. I am hard to get from The chef borrowed from Sham Shui Po.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This credit belongs to Janet, but Siegel’s “brutal” was taken directly. I thought that the old man would be polite and thankful, and then went to taste the food and let go of Siegel. I didn't expect him to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Count Siegel, I have an important thing to do with you this time. It is too difficult to see you, so only Say on this occasion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please say." Siegel smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please enjoy the light and the eldest daughter of the family marquis heir Hausmann Griffin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s smile disappeared from his face. He said to the old man: “You are afraid to remember correctly, I am married. I have my own wife.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Your marriage is well known and will be held public shortly after you become the lord. I also know that you have a healthy and active boy." The voice of the old man is not bad, behind him. I have already followed a lot of knights waiting to be interviewed, so people have become dense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The unfortunate thing happened later, Countess Janet died of an accidental illness, and you recovered your single. Our Griffin family only wants to be relatives with you. The eldest daughter of the Marquis and the Earl are the right ones. And Heim’s collar already has the heir, Isaac Squid, if I remember correctly. So our sincerity is very full, I hope the adults can accept it.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never heard of such a truth." Siegel snorted and then shook his head: "Jenit is by my side. You have to introduce me to the marriage." It’s really anecdotal! You should inquire about the situation and then open it, Baron Griffin. I suggest that you still try the wine that Heim’s collar is. Clean up your thoughts and decide your actions.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough!" Siegel shouted. Interrupted the old man's swearing: "You talk too much, too much wrong. I don't want to listen anymore. I don't want to marry the eldest daughter of the Griffin family heir, even though I have never seen her. I can't talk about it. I like it, but my heart can no longer be given to her. This is the last courtesy I can do. If you continue to bully me under my roof with gibberish, you will never be able to speak again." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s murky eyes suddenly turned bright, quietly watching Siegel, silent for a few seconds. Just when everyone thought that he had left his head, he continued to say: "The Earl, according to the laws of the kingdom of stars, you are now single. I introduce you to the pearl of the house and not deceive you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, then slowly exhales out of his nose. "Put off his tongue and then deport."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, think twice, he is just an old man, his mind is confused, and he is the Griffin family. The envoys could not cut their tongues like this." The guards beside them quickly intervened. Janet stood not far away, staring coldly at the Griffin family, but with a colder look at the guards beside Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The young guards are not sensible, let you laugh." Siegel said to the people around him: "It seems that he still did not receive enough education, do not understand What is called an oath to protect the master's honor and life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand, pointed at the old man's mouth, and then gently recited the spell. I saw a slamming sound, and Hart Griffin turned into a burst of blue smoke from the two maids and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The east gate of the city goes out, all the way to the direction of the rabbit ear port, he is on the new cape avenue." Siegel to the maid who is still in a daze The young man with the Griffin family badge said: "My last kindness is to tell you where he is. Might City does not welcome Hart Griffin. If he reappears, it is not just the ability to lose his ability to speak. Let him cherish life and stay away from ignorance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart-wrenching fear flashed from Siegel's eyes, and the spell of fear was implanted in their hearts. Three people shouted and turned and ran. The knights gave them a way to let them go, and one person took a shot on the maid's buttocks. If you are in a pub, this move can cause a big laugh, at least you can also activate the atmosphere. But now everyone can see that things are not over yet, and the Earl of Heim is still in anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and looked at the knight who was next to him. Some of the baby's face rushed to the ground and hurried to the ground. "The Lord, I know it is wrong, I shouldn't talk too much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Being reprimanded, your behavior is much more serious than that.” Siegel said: “You are deprived of the title of the knight because you cannot defend the vows of the vows and refuse to execute a clear command. You are now a civilian, take off Lower the armor, lay down the weapon, and go home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I can't go home. I can only be a knight..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel completely lost patience and threw him out of the castle directly by teleportation, but left his weapons and armor in the hall. I don't know what he will wear under the lining. It is very likely that nothing will be worn considering this weather. Although streaking is not within the scope of punishment, it is a good way to deepen memory for this young leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interview must be completed as soon as possible, or there will be no more guys left in the hall. The people behind it apparently saw the set of attendant armor on the ground, and they stepped up their paces and took a gift in front of Siegel. They left as a greeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Mike and his half-orc partner, no one stayed in the hall to taste the food. Mana heard about this and hurriedly came from the racecourse, but did not have time to see Siegel. She could probably guess the position of the lord, so she did not hesitate to climb the steps and went to the terrace garden courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel, who had taken off the burden of the armor, was sitting in the rocking chair and watching Isaac running around. He has a bruise on his body, which is an indispensable experience and lesson on the road to growth. Not looking at Crow Barron, looking at him, will not let him have any real danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, I am late, I am sorry that Barent has caused you trouble." Barnet is the name of the deaf, every day Siegel The people around the "guards (ceremonial)" were all developed by Mana, and she felt that she should pay a lot of responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
