			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel picked up a bunch of Dilan, as the torch took the lead and the little finger followed. This path was paved with goose soft stones and marched on the ground. The two don't know how deep they are from the ground now, and there are no trees around them that can be worn out of the soil, so they are estimated to be very deep. After about ten minutes, the path finally came to an end. They saw that the passage was blocked by a gate, and the back of the door gave off a pale yellow light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil lamp was extinguished at this time, leaving only a few of the underground orchids in the hands of Siegel, so the two took a small one. They looked closely at the door and found out that it was actually the back panel of the closet, and the light came in from under the closet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people held their breath and put their ears close to the closet, only to hear something on the opposite side. The sound was mixed with a lot of nasal and plosive sounds, and there was a serious molar sound, and Siegel couldn't understand it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the little white face is white, holding the blue grass in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, after a while, the voice left, and the light that disappeared under the closet disappeared. The little finger dared to act at this time. He touched it from the wooden board. He didn't know what kind of mechanism was screwed up. The wooden board slammed open and formed a small door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no clothes in the closet, the cabinet door is half covered, and a lot of thick spider webs are stuffed with wardrobes. Siegel swept the spider web and the first jumped in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was originally a bedroom, I don’t know why it was built underground, surrounded by cold stone walls, except for a decaying wooden door, what exports? No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the debris left on the ground, there was once a big bed, which is the main reason why two people judged this is the bedroom. Next to the closet is a dressing table with only one leg left. The bronze mirror is already rusty and completely non-reflective. The chandelier on the ceiling has fallen into pieces on the ground, and the remaining wax oil has fallen to the ground. There was a thick layer of dust throughout the room and two rows of huge footprints on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a pair of pearl earrings in the corner of the drawer of the dressing table, which naturally goes into the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the gate is a long corridor. The long blankets laid on the ground are lumped together and abandoned like garbage. There is a candlestick hanging on the wall, but there is no light now. Two of Siegel, holding the glowing bluegrass, stepped on the footprints on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the door is in the innermost part of the corridor, and the corridor more than 20 meters long has only one room. On the walls on both sides, there are a lot of warnings, such as "Anger will only bring harm" and "Compassion and compassion are the greatest virtues". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the corridor is a spiral staircase, and I don’t know where to go. One side of the wall collapsed, revealing a big hole. Malt pointed out to Siegel that the stairs were clean and the footprints were extending in the direction of the big hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where should we go next?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The treasure is upstairs." So the two immediately determined the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the spiral staircase is a sliding door that can be opened by gently pulling the chain. Then Siegel and Malt climbed up and found that they had returned to the ground, and here is a huge study. The room is decorated in a luxurious style with a sun sign on the ceiling, a tall statue on the side of the room, and a sliding door that opens from behind the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no room in the room, but everything is neat and tidy, it seems that someone is responsible for cleaning. The floor was covered with a thick wool blanket and some soft, thick cushions were placed. There are three large floor-to-ceiling windows on each side of the wall, decorated with transparent stained glass. On the wall without windows, there are large bookcases and some storage cabinets with fine objects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large desk is in front of the statue, black and black, and one table is red. The little thumb climbed straight down to the desk, fiddled for a long time, and finally opened a dark grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a large roll of paper inside, the little finger opened and looked, and then said happily: "Found it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the squid grabbed the little finger and asked: "In fact, isn't this your treasure room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little finger is not in a hurry, shaking his hand The scroll, after shaking off, gave the squid a look: "What did you write about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel squinted and read that it was this lineage A certificate to prove the pedigree and inheritance rights of a man named "Reméin-Start". After this certificate, there are portraits, genealogy pictures and a will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With these things, here is my treasure room." The little finger pulled back and said, "Okay, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people sneak back on the original road, from the sliding door behind the statue to the spiral staircase. They didn't take two steps, and suddenly they heard footsteps coming from underneath, accompanied by the language of "nose, grind and plosive." A mean, huge shadow slowly emerges from the bottom of the stairs and extends across the opposite wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people rushed to the light blue grass in their hands and stuffed them under the clothes. Siegel felt nervous, and he didn't come up with something good, so he put his hand on the handle of the machete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows are getting bigger and bigger, and the footsteps are getting clearer. Soon, the owner of the shadow came out of the hole. This is a strong giant with a height of more than two meters. There are many raised sarcomas on the top of the bare head. The yellow-brown skin has weed-like body hair, and the strong arms are almost falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster has a prominent tooth and his mouth almost reaches the root of his ear. It is this mouth that constantly makes strange noises that are boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster holds the lantern in one hand, and carries a mace in one hand, and enters the long corridor. Siegel waited for a while, and the monster returned, and sneaked into the hole to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, this guy hasn’t looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what monster it is?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a troll." The little finger looks a bit stiff and unnaturally said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel only when he was frightened, did not ask, escorted him to leave the secret road, and climbed back to the well. Malt Siegel should be kept secret and give one of the pair of earrings to him. Siegel doesn't want to, because he has promised that he will not go to the treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this is not a treasure, but a gift I gave you." The little finger put an earring over and said, "You are "My friend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... I think it’s OK." Siegel scratched his head and said, "If you forgive me, I almost hit you. "We are friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think sometimes you are very stingy!" Malt waved, carrying a sack of teapot and Siegel bid farewell: "Remember, don't say anything about the pedigree to prove those things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were separated, and Siegel took the horse back. Arrived at the hotel. As a result, not only Sir Bill and Master Lia, but Jeff did not return. Siegel was thinking about the trolls all night and let him sleep well. He didn't understand why the trolls appeared there, and didn't know why the guy was always patrolling. Does the Viscount of the Hub Fort know that the evil creatures are hidden under his castle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to report the findings to the Viscount, but couldn’t figure out how to explain the process of discovering the trolls. Coincidentally, no one can discuss it now, so Siegel can only toss and turn, almost no sleep all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day dawn, the young man made up his mind. He left a letter on the table stating the location and condition of the troll, and then armed, ready to go to the cave. If he does not find out what the trolls are trying to do, he will never feel at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-entered the secret room in the underground room of the castle, where the dead environment is suffocating, and the idea of ​​a troll appear at any time makes Siegel very tension. He rubbed his hands and slid against the corner of the wall, illuminating by the fire moss that was not on his wrist. Among several luminescent plants that can be found, firefly moss is the darkest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
