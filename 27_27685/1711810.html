			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel temporarily stayed in the stone village, Lin Ke patted the big stone that his house relied on, telling Siegel that it was from the beginning of the birth of heaven and earth Existence, could have spawned the spirit of the stone, but it gave up and became an immortal stone. The village is named after this, meaning the existence of long-term peace. Later, the village has been very safe, but it has not developed for hundreds of years: the village is still at the level of more than 50 people. Everyone can barely guarantee food and drink, and there will always be a village where witch worship is stationed. Until last month, Zucker ate the drunken moss in the village, squandered and mad, and cursed the witchcraft that came to treat him. The result was not three days. The witch festival adults slipped down while catching fish on the glaciers, and they were drowned inexplicably. So Zucker chose self-exile, and sent himself a curse of "the sin of the death of the witch sacrifice, will be tortured to death", left the village and sold himself to the slave trader. No one in the village thought that he could come back alive, because the curse of Zucker would bring the people around him with endless misfortunes, and I don’t know when it will be a scream. However, when they listened to Lin Ke, "The person brought back by the singer is a witch festival, so the curse has been fulfilled and completed, and the new sorcerity has been redeemed for the sin of the old witch festival." Then, the talents in the village dared to get close to the gram, give him food and drink, and help him clean up the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was taken to the tent of the original witch festival. "Come on, don't worry about anything, we will prepare for you." Everyone is very enthusiastic, and their eyes are full of hope: "There will be a brazier, food and clothes in a while. If the witch festival adults need someone to warm their blankets, the girls in the village will be very happy."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s look around, the half-orc girl and his aesthetic habits are too different, and the last one is declined. Everyone prepared things with all their hands and feet and watched Siegel enter the tent of the witch festival. According to the practice in the village, except for the witch sacrifice and the invited person, others cannot enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the colorful curtains decorated with colored strips, a stench almost smothered Siegel. Think about it too, it has been close to it for two months, and the things inside have already decayed and deteriorated. If there are not some poisonous herbs in the tent, it is estimated that there will be insecticides inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pinches his nose, and casting in such a situation is also a test. He opened all the curtains of the tent to let the air circulate, while constantly singing the cleaning spell. The spoiled, stinky things were cleaned up and thrown into the burning brazier outside. Fleas, worms, and a few mice that were about to be poisoned were also thrown out and burned to ashes. Soon, the smell inside the house was much better, and dust and other dirt were also cleaned up. Siegel changed a brazier again, and this was carried in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tent is now full of other scent: moss, mushrooms, pine oil and saffron, and some unusual materials that look like specimens made from animal offal . The brazier was placed in the middle of the tent, and the warm red flame illuminated the space of more than three meters in diameter. The smoke floated away from the opening of the pointed tent, so there was no charcoal gas in the room. Siegel bent over and looked around in the tent, admiring the collection of the old witch festival. There are many animal bone specimens on the wall, some animal teeth, a few bottles of eyeballs in yellow-green potions, a wooden box denture, and a suspicious black liquid in the skin. Among all things, the most abundant is a large pile of tobacco leaves wrapped in fine deer skin, which smells fragrant and pleasant, and definitely adds other pharmaceutical ingredients. In a tin box, Siegel also found a few pipes, new and old, they are equally exquisite, and they know the excellent handwork at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a thick fur on the ground that completely isolated the cold on the ground. Siegel sat up and suddenly felt guilty. He is not a witch festival, but now he is occupying the best place. Although all of this was due to misunderstanding, it began with the misunderstanding of Zangke, and was used by the village chief of Lin Ke to satisfy the requirements of the hard-working villagers, but the ultimate benefit was Siegel. He sat on a warm bed and stared at the brazier for a long time. Judging from the current situation, denying that he is a witch offering will be unfavorable to him, and he is a friend who has been together and escaped, so he can only pretend to be a scalp. But other things can't be enjoyed, which goes against his conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest advantage of this tent is that it separates the line of sight, and Siegel can finally open the key space with confidence. He found out the cold clothes, equipped with dragon tooth daggers, and took out some drinks, sugar and gems. Since he does not know if gold coins are useful on the north side of the Walled Mountain Range, he can only trade with sugar and precious stones. It is a pity that his breastplate, dwarf belt and obsidian dagger were lost. It must have been picked up by the scavengers who were found and sold to the slave traders. Now it may be in the hands of anyone. Can you find it later? Siegel is not sure. I don't know if there is no dwarf gold belt, and the library of Mora can still let him in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the rock house, a cheerful voice of a man and a woman came out, and Siegel heard the red ear from a long distance. But the half-orcs around seem to be accustomed to it, regardless of whether they are still doing their own thing. A few children were curious to see, but they were driven away by Linke’s wives like ducks. Siegel waited at the door, and after a while he heard the voice of Lin Ke: "Hey? The witch festival is coming? Please come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone house It is still the original smell, but there is more helium in the slippery liquid. Siegel tried not to look at the half-orc woman hiding under the quilt. He was really afraid of being scared. Lin Ke ** body, only a circle of animal skin around the waist, sitting on the stool. He cut a piece of barbecue with a knife, stuffed it into his mouth, and gasped and said: "When you finish the exercise, it always makes me hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your appetite is good," Siegel said. He pointed to the bed and said: "Some things I want to tell you privately are better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, no. My woman won't mess Say a word." Lin Ke patted the quilt hard, the female half-orc below screamed. Siegel thought about it, grabbed a fine sand, and applied sleep. With his current level of magic control, he can continue to cast spells on the same target until they are conquered by spell effects or the caster loses attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman was very tired, so she quickly snorted and fell asleep. "Okay, I can talk now." Siegel sat down cross-legged and placed a sitting position that stood up at any time. "I want to go back south of the Walled Mountain Range. It is impossible to stay here for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have already told you that the road to the south will not work. Lin Ke ate another piece of meat and sent it to the throat with spruce tea. "You are a southerner, don't understand the north, the wasteland here is much cruel. Usually there will be a variety of beasts wandering around, specifically picking the pedestrians appetizing. But all these murderers are not comparable to the orc warlords, especially It is the skinner's corrugated! He has more than 10,000 orcs under his hand, and every time he plunders, he can send at least 4,000 teams. They will eat everything and go only to the skin. Now this group The crazy guy has already gone to the Walled Mountains. Although it can't be said that there is a valley everywhere, you can't judge which way is safe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four The Qiancheng City Wall Mountain is so vast that you can still try it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke laughed and said: “The number of skinners is large, but their weapons are very Poor, only part of the use of metal weapons, and there is no discipline, you can indeed try. But the corrugated is not the only warlord, there are iron foot Fuerte, two-headed wolf king Wolff. They have one Elite strong orc army, can Fighting any city; another wolf cavalry with the most north, even the walled mountains can not reduce their mobility, even on the northern plains. The four orc warlords have three now in the wall mountains, full of Wan’s army, this is not a wolf, a troll, and a hill giant. Don’t say it’s a human being, it’s just a mouse that can’t be drilled. Sooner or later, it’s sniffed, trampled and peeled! Listen to a persuasion, don’t die. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned. I didn't expect the situation to develop so fast. It seems that a big battle is inevitable. The deep-water attack of Deepwater City really caught the attention of the orcs. The orcs may be planning to destroy the Deepwater City troops outside the city walls, and it seems that a Thunder strike will be used to establish the advantages on the battlefield. I hope that the army as a bait should not be feverish. Don’t take it on the grassland. If there is a problem, you should immediately withdraw. Just cover the east side of the mountain range to the Makkaru assault detachment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the warlord hammer? Is he not out of the city wall?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hammer has been hung up, 'three eyes' Lund kills him and becomes the fourth warlord. He just needs to clean up those short-term excuses Obedient generals, so only a few hundred troops were sent. The remaining thousands of people mostly contracted around Macabu, welcome any unyielding leader to challenge. If the situation stabilizes, maybe they will take The ship went straight to the south to land. I see that this deep-water city is very rare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New orc warlords? I don't know if the wizards of this news federation know. The port city that is guarded by heavy troops, the assault detachment has the opportunity to go in and set fire? I hope that the Master of the Federation can show the mana, summon the skyfire to burn the shipyard, and not be trapped in the frozen wasteland like himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the orcs are not moving from the walls of the city, I have no hope of passing." Siegel sighed and said: "In the short term, I only I can live, but I am not a witch festival, I can’t act at all!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
