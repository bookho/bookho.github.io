			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog wall rushes up and forms a circle around the duel. The lords of the Southern Allied Forces have been arguing, and it is speculated that this must be the trick of the squid baron, but no one dares to easily disturb the process of the duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let’s watch it change,” said Sir Brown, holding his arm and a beaming expression, slowly saying: “I believe in Viscount Felton, he Since you dare to accept the challenge, you must have your own way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His words have caused the approval of most people, but the necessary preparations are still to be done. Soldiers and archers armed with shields have begun the entire team to prevent opponents from attacking with fog. The siege weapons manufacturing camp also strengthened its alert. Many knights wore armor and led the servants to patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton stretches out the palm of his hand and ejects the red flame. Siegel had been prepared to roll over to the side. He was brewing lightning in his hand and retracing back at an extremely fast speed. Felton showed a strange smile and watched the lightning hit him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electric sparks splashed, a layer of skin with a scale of scorching smell, burning and falling to the ground. Felton's body swells rapidly, and the hands are stretched to the front legs, supporting the enlarged body with the thick hind legs. His shoulders swayed, splitting from the neck into seven heads resembling snakeheads, and instantly elongating. Sharp teeth and dripping venom clearly indicate danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Hydra Lizard?" Siegel said with a smile: "Do you use this method to deal with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton did not speak, and immediately launched an offensive. He stretched his neck and bit it at Siegel, launching a serial attack. As a proficient mage, he also casts spells while attacking, or attaches the power of various elements to his attacks, or uses protective spells to enhance the strength of the body. Segal quickly used the pace of the elves. Left and right, it was difficult to avoid the first round of offense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake lizard took a step forward, swaying with a thick neck, and several other heads spurting. The space left by Siegel on the ground was too small, and he jumped up. And use flying to increase your mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking beautiful!" Felton used three heads to cast spells together and placed a force field wall in the air. Siegel recognized this spell, but did not stop his cast, but instead gathered another spell in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unusual, Felton is alert. He sees that the opponent is gathering the power of the flame element, most likely an attacking spell like a fireball. It has long been known that Siguel Lord is very good at magic of various elements. Felton made the appropriate preparations in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also began to mobilize the elements of fire, with the intention of countering the other's magic. Can be beyond his expectations, Siegel did not choose to attack, but cast a flame shield on himself. Does he still want to be close to me, how confident is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire Shield protects the caster from damage from most fire elements. So Felton found that the energy of the elements he gathered together was useless as an attack. He also wants to cast a flame shield, but at this time Siegel has swooped down the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really dare!" Felton's cumbersome step back, leaving more room for attack on his head. As long as the fangs are bitten by the fangs, the deadly venom will be infused, and even the dragon will not be able to withstand the mixture of toxins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one bite, you can win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel slammed and slammed with a long sword. The dust of the stars glowed brightly, squatting on a long neck of the snake lizard. The scales cannot withstand the power of the long sword. The role of Rui Feng is even more prominent. A snake head in Felton was directly smashed, with a lot of blood falling onto the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the head of the spell that changes and will soon dissipate completely. Will not leave any wreckage. One less head is not fatal to the snake lizard, it can still attack as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The neck is much easier," Siegel snarled. When Felton wanted to return, he waved his wand with his left hand and made a long rope of magic. The techniques of lending and bundling are not unfamiliar with the passage of time, but are more difficult to resist with the help of magic. Felton is eager to attack. The two snake heads were tied together and lost flexibility at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton wouldn't sit still, a layer of mud and stone covering the whole body, forming heavy armor. He believes that adding such a defense is enough to withstand the other's sword, and now only needs continuous attack to seize the victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stardust is not so easy to resist. At the moment when Siegel saw the method, his wrist twisted, and the sniper became a puncture, and the tip of the dust of the star poked into the skin of the stone. After waiting to upload the feeling of cutting into the flesh and blood, he violently pulled it hard, and a huge gap was made, almost smashing the entire neck by two-thirds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You crazy! Go to hell!" Felton screamed, opened his mouth and slammed into the Siegel from three directions, long The fangs want to bite him out of countless blood holes. Siegel stood up straight and raised his wand in preparation for coping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first huge mouth bites the mage shield, and the protection of the force field continually shakes, creating a dazzling illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second big mouth ran from the other direction, this time the force shield can't stop it, the flame shield emits amazing light and heat, melts The teeth are sharp, and the mouth is baked. The two were entangled, and the snake head that was shaking because of the pain picked up the chaotic airflow, and the flame was continually beaten on the ground until the flame burned his head and emerged from its eyelids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third big mouth is on the ground and heads towards Siegel’s lower body, hidden and insidious. With a wave of Siegel's wand, the ground swelled, and a huge rock made up of magic came out, blocking the path of the snake head. Irritating the snake head, he rushed up and smashed the stone into pieces. At this time, Siegel has completed the evasion and took the opportunity to cast a spell to enhance his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles of his arms are high and up, instantly approaching the level of the giant Kerry, and the sniper power of the sword is one level higher. The snake lizard head stuck from the ground has not recovered from the impact, and it has been fallen again by the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hydra has become less than five, and its power has dropped dramatically. Felton continues to deform. The remaining head was taken back, and the body was slightly shrunk, turning into a giant golden pheasant with two heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this monster? Siegel has no concept at all. The claws looked very sharp, and the slender claws seemed to hide under the feathers of the wings. This is all about being careful. The swelled skin of the cocks may contain venom. The long sword is best to avoid that position, can be used as a bird, what does the oval mouth mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s flash of light, immediately draws the dwarf rune “quiet” with the wand volley. Sure enough, Felton opened his mouth, and the elliptical upper and lower jaws played a role in orientation and focusing. A powerful sound wave shrouded Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf runes strive to eliminate the vibrations caused by the sound, and eventually turn this confrontation into a pure magical power. Siegel needs to convert his own spell to the dwarf runes, and Felton also needs a strong enough lung to continue to use the sonic attack, the two are equal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, two people are unsustainable. Both people are also unscathed. The dwarf's silent runes disappeared in the air, and Siegel raised his hand, and the five energy missiles flew toward the twin chickens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A layer of transparent shield blocked the energy missile, and Felton blew up five flashes in front of him. The shield did not move, Felton ridiculed: "Is the missile used like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed, his wings rolled up, five flying Ejected to Siegel and rolled to the middle. "Do you confirm that the missile can hit me?" Siegel's lips did not move. The sound came out. The missile hits accurately, but it is only a phantom, and Siegel’s real body has long been stunned by the flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where? Felton feels that the shape of the chicken head is difficult to observe around. Then I deformed instantly and turned myself into a green clay monster. He is as crystal-clear as the jelly body, and there are many large and small eyeballs floating inside. Some mysterious magic runes flash between the eyeballs, constantly absorbing the energy of the surrounding elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his body surface, some red blood-like textures resemble blood vessels violently leaping, pulsating the fearful light. This is Felton's reliance on the Master: the Austrian law mud. This strange creature is very rare. Felton was also able to get its knowledge with the help of Casper. The Austrian mud monster has a special affinity for magic, which can quickly absorb the energy of the surrounding elements. Destroy the stability of magic spells. It has been speculated that this creature was purposely created in response to the Master's battle. You can quickly gain the advantage of a magic matchup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
