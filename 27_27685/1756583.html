			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the order of Siegel, the army formed by the four elements began to charge, like the army of locusts covering the sky. The structure of many elements is not stable and will disintegrate as it progresses. But it doesn't matter, Siegel only needs quantity, drowning the amount of everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Void Ship" has complex internal passages and numerous rooms, like a maze, but this is not a problem in the absolute number. Siegel can't face the Lord himself, but his army can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element of gas is the first to take the lead and the other elements are the first to get into the channel, and this time they can no longer stand by. The army regained its position and waved the mace to kill the elemental army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element focusing lens perceives that the energy source is working, and begins to absorb immediately. Although this absorption is inefficient, the mace quickly drains its power and becomes an ordinary iron block. The warrior is physically strong, but how can a pair of bone fists be the opponents of the elements? They are like ants that gather together and are only blocked before the elemental torrent. The flood slowed down and then broke the dam unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of "Dare" dominated like a thunder bombing in the ear: "Close the door and close the door to block them from blocking them"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defense mechanism in the channel is finally exposed, the green death ray and the dazzling white lightning are like snakes, traversing through the body of the element, which is tantamount to drinking and quenching thirst. These energies have a powerful killing effect. Various elements fall down in pieces, and many passages become graves of death gathering, but all of these energy sources are exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is both distracting, constantly urging the summoning of elements while increasing the spell power of the energy focusing lens. The elements began to destroy the walls and exposed the hidden plasma lines. The energy ball continues to expand, and the energy that has accumulated for thousands of years has fallen into the grasp of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not fair" dominated the yelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements spread, lightning and rays step back. The Siegel command elements collide with each other to trigger an explosion and open the closed door. The entire void ship trembled in the void, like a patient who had committed epilepsy. The explosion brought in countless scattered fragments, reflecting the faint green light in the dark space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the mid-abdomen of giant creatures, elemental torrents illuminate each of its "blood vessels" and every "body cavity." The master found that he had nowhere to hide. His soldiers retreat, and the proud single-energy plasma system became the reminder. This is a war of attrition, but all the consumables come from one of the wars. If there is enough depth or time, the master may be able to think of ways to get out of trouble. But on this small island of empty ship, it has no way to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he was forced to be in the generals and wrapped himself in a heavy battleboard. He can't use weapons, just relying on spiritual pressure to destroy the elements that are close. Hold the last line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything will end" is the idea of ​​dominance, but also the power of his cohesion. In the face of the kingdom of God, he used this power to continually erode and let the gods run out. But that is a battle at the spiritual level, and if it is used in the material field, the effect is greatly reduced. The power of the elements will eventually overwhelm the master, which is unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Siegel stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not stop making elements, but temporarily stopped the impact on the dominance and adopted a strategy of not attacking. The ruler thought that he had gained a chance, but then he was completely desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel continues to increase the number of elements, and eventually fills every space in the Void. Then he gave orders and began to look for anything that could store energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no place to hide, and a large number of Inflammatory Crystals have been found. As long as it is exposed, energy is extracted and becomes a weapon of Siegel. He took all the cards to his own hands and forced the master to the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a surprise attack. It took only half an hour from the time the law enforcement took effect. The lord has enough knowledge and means, but when there is no time to respond and change, there is no power to turn it over. He took his mental strength back to his side. Layers wrap yourself. Powerful psionic powers are distorted in the real world, and material elemental magic stagnates as it approaches the lord. Time seems to have lost its normal state, and the momentary thinking seems to be eternal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel first consolidated his front. He ordered the elements to dismantle those confusing passages. Only rooms with various functions are reserved. Then began to dismantle the warriors and beetles to ensure that there are no residual soul crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room where the master is located is completely isolated and slowly removed from the void ship. This is the safest way. Although the protective cover formed by the energy focusing lens is very powerful, it cannot move, and Siegel is actually trapped in it. As long as he leaves the energy shield. There are countless ways to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the ruler is also trapped. There are elements everywhere, and outside is the void, where can he go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the lord wrapped in the psionic shield, in addition to being submerged by the ocean of elements, Siegel thought of another way: throw it out. Spiritual power is stronger, and it cannot produce matter out of thin air. Without material support, the experience of dominance is enriched, and there is not enough means to fight the erosion of the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the master can fight against the void at the beginning, he does not need to use the body to build the base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor wall was torn open and gradually separated from the main body of the Void. The earth element waved its arm and forced the connection between the two. Behind the heavy iron plate, the muscle tissue belonging to the original creature still exists and is full of toughness. The fire element swooped up and began to burn with the utmost power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master immediately understood the intruder’s intentions, so he stood up and took a step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental army immediately alerted, and looked at the mental power to distort the field. As long as it continues to move forward, it will also push the master out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The psychic field did not move forward, and the voice of the master came out and was captured by Siegel. "You have achieved an absolute advantage, but no victory. Without me, you can't leave this void. If you can't leave, your victory won't be known. There won't be any battle in any space at any time. It is recorded that everything is useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is silent and continues to direct the elements to complete the original work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord continued to say: "I know someone is helping you, let you come to my site, pretending to be my warrior. Your spell spell is very successful, you The mind is also very calm. Until now, I have not revealed any flaws. I think I am going to escape this time, but there are a few things to tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Who instructs, I don't know if he told you, I am only a master. In this void, there are many masters of resistance, you can't beat us all. Your spells and abilities are respected by me. On the basis, I can negotiate with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can open a portal for you and send you to the city of Wanmen. There. You I want to go to any world, we can't track it. You can also specify a few worlds until they are dead, and the army of Nexus will not be close. Our request is that you leave this place as soon as possible and keep your spell spells secret. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel still remain silent, but he was quietly thinking. He imagined the scene of the marching army, imagining the green plasma covering the earth, imagining the doomsday scene where the void swallowed everything. The world he loves, whether it is mountains, ocean forests or the earth, has been eaten. It turns into a beetle and becomes a nutrient of green blood and corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood and bones are all useful, but after death these are no longer the dead, but the soul is still. In the world of Nexus, the soul will never rest in peace. They are deprived of the power of regeneration, cannot enjoy the peaceful kingdom of God, cannot live with the ancestors, and cannot reincarnate. They become pure energy, like things like coal firewood. It became an alchemy material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, do you still have the ability to resist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel closes his eyes and focuses his attention on the spells, secretly giving orders to the elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just a mortal." Siegel responded to the ruler: "I can't see forever. I can only see it. You are alive." Too long, there are too many variables, I can't deal with them one by one. I can only use the shortest and most reckless way to deal with it. I would rather go with you here and will not negotiate with you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
