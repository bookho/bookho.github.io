			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the massive death of colloidal warriors, there are already many elves who have fallen ill because of the stench in the base. ◎, the soldiers led by Heim did not enter the underground, fortunately escaped the disaster. They did not prepare for the camp, but gathered outside the Shak Manor to take care of the direction of the castle in Kaibu. It has already surpassed the attack range of the Kabuki trebuchet and is in the high ground for easy observation of the surrounding situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captives of dozens of murder gods are accepting the punishment of the chopping hand. Before each execution, Siegel’s verdict was announced, and the forgiven eyes, tongue, and accompanying physician were next to him, preparing red iron pieces and bandages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you accompany me, Master Verwood, I have been in the cave for a long time, and I haven’t breathed fresh air for a while." On the lawn of Shaq Manor, he saw the Master of the Curse, when he was examining the colloidal warriors who turned into stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Siegel, you are finally here." Wiewood looked solemnly, and it seemed that some of his eyes could not be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wywood slammed his cane in front of him, as if Use this time to discretion. In the end, he still said: "I heard the news, the Masters Association officially invited you to go and make a secret for them. Is this true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Geer shook his head: "I didn't receive the news, I don't even know what to invite. But I did send a message to the Masters Association in some way. If they don't intervene in the affairs of the Masters Union, then I can give They built a Mire nuclear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your approach is correct, so it is so good." Verwood said: "There are some rumors in the federation. But Mainly still worried that you will tell the Master Association of the technology of the secret nuclear. This will make the Masters Union lose its advantage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel meaningfully looks at the dimension Wood. Thinking about it, then saying: "The advantage of the federation has never been that the secret can be nuclear, but it should be the wide-ranging division trained by it. Wywood, is there a voice in the federation, I want to open my secret "Nuclear manufacturing methods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is such a voice, but most of the Masters are firmly opposed. The Federation never allows any form to ask for other The mage unveiled the secrets of his spells and the squad, which is an iron law.” Verwood said frankly: “You don’t have to pay attention to this statement. Occasionally a few mages are frightened by the failure of the former federation. There will be problems. In addition to your own choice of sharing, the Federation will never make such a request. But you still have to pay attention to the Masters Association, their temptation and penetration is difficult to resist. Now is the most vulnerable time of the Federation. After all, no one is sitting in the town, and everyone has no sense of security."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does there be any standard for becoming a teacher?" Siegel stopped. Two people are standing next to the cliff Tens of meters outside the foot is its long waves surge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weewood looked at Siegel, and his eyes gradually showed excitement. He smiled and said: "There is only one absolute standard, that is, the ability to cast space locks and eternal silence. Only space locks can ensure that an area will not be infiltrated by the transfer. It is also the basis for mastering space. Eternal quiescence is the basis for mastering time, and eventually leads to the time to pause the spell. In addition to this, there are other arguments that can prove that you have become a sergeant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every ** division will create their own abilities based on their understanding of the elements and their understanding of magic. The well-known William sergeant can mix and transform, and Faranas can be far away. There is no one to know the abilities of Lion King Alexander, but everyone is sure that it must be a very powerful skill. Although it is impossible to prove that there is a special ability to be a ** division, most people think that this can also be counted as A standard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declaring a ** is good for both yourself and the federation, but it is not something that can be done verbally. Siegel needs to cast a spell under the testimony of at least five mages, or to show his special abilities before he can become a recognized sorcerer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to learn deeper spells, many new mentors choose to demonstrate their special abilities. Only a few people have the resources to learn, and they can read the volume of the deep magic to be able to hide their abilities. As one of the top executives of the federation with veto power, Siegel was able to access the library to access information that was not accessible to ordinary lawyers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a hint is enough for Weywood, and the appearance of a sorcerer is a good news for him. Many experiments require the participation of a spell-level user at the division level, otherwise security and effectiveness are not guaranteed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Congratulations to you, Siegel, I have one thing to say to you." Wywood took a disc from the space bag and handed it To Siegel. The main material of the disc is lead, so it is very heavy, but fortunately both of them are masters, which can be assisted by spells. The silver plate on the lead plate depicts a circle, and some parts use amethyst (generally considered to have the power of communication space) as a spell node. Siegel saw some familiar structures at a glance, and it was his own "energy channel" spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be something you built the portal, it’s amazing. If you can, I want to learn from you." Very sincere. He knew the value of this technology in his heart, especially for his lord. Not to mention the increase in combat effectiveness brought by the military, if it can be used in the daily life, it will save a long transport, and can bring the things of the rabbit ear port directly to the city of Mier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spell is the most respected of all faction mages, because of the existence of transmission, so we have always been the most important research and improvement of the transmission of spells. As a mage of the curse system, we set the application direction of the secret energy core as the transmission technology in the first time. You are holding the first generation of products in your hand.” Verwood is very proud. Although six thousand gold coins can only be used once, they can maintain a stable portal for about fifteen minutes. There are no restrictions on how many people and things are transported during this period. We are still improving the process. But you need your help."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which aspect? I have a precise delivery manual there. It should be able to help you," Siegel said immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wywood shook his head: "It has nothing to do with sending the spell itself, but we want to understand how you can make the magical creation of the secret nuclear core without loss. I mean that every day I generate and provide such a large amount of energy, can the nuclear core not be bad? Our portal disk work is very stable, but it will last for more than fifteen minutes, and the structure will melt down. This aspect is far worse than the secret nuclear. At present we only have to turn off for ten minutes, so we can keep it within the scope of repairability. Otherwise, no one can afford it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and left the disc, and promised: "No problem, I am willing to share this knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the answer that satisfied me, Wywood didn't seem to be in a hurry. "Become a sergeant first, then we can call you Siegel. Whether it is for yourself or for the federation, that is the top priority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Thank you, I will work hard. Right, I have to trouble you to help me transport the army back." Siegel and Weywood shook hands and then separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weewood left with a smile. Leave Siegel alone standing on the cliff by the sea. He saw a lot of bubbles appearing on the sea, and the muddy sand rolled with the bubbles. Stir with sea water. It seems that some of the caves have collapsed, and the elves have begun to completely destroy the stronghold of the murder god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer room is safe and sound. The transfer chamber will become a closed and isolated space by planning the landslide in advance. Only by completely destroying other parts of the site will it prevent someone from reoccupying the place, and those adventurers or scavengers will not waste their energy to find treasures hidden under the seabed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaq Manor will also be demolished, the house will be ignited, and even the entire cliff will fall apart under the influence of the spell. Now the soldiers led by Heim are moving out of the manor, and the plans are all piled up away from the cliffs and left to the residents of Kaibu. For the soldiers to take away some valuable items, Siegel will not take care of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood alone on the edge of the cliff, letting the sea breeze blow his robes. He stared at a three-masted sailboat in the distant sea, imagined it as the Soss, and then watched it until the sea level line covered it. Just as exhausted, can you see the wall of the storm at the end of the sky? Behind the wall of the storm is not the kingdom of the true God, what kind of plan are they doing there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel feels that he is caught in a conspiracy of God, and countless coincidences seem to surround him, concealed words, countless hints, and unmentioned Secret, what are the gods planning? God has different personalities and appeals. What is it that allows them to reach a consensus and implement a plan together? This problem will never be answered in the current world. Maybe it is only a matter of jumping out of the barriers and passing through to other worlds to have a chance to figure out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
