This feeling of being a flesh-and-blood body is very rare for him to be a golem, and it is only in his memory that he has this feeling before the first time he applied his magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with you, why did the face begin to melt?" Two to find Rhett's abnormality, and dropped the mop to clean the little temple and ran over. "Are you drinking water again? You are a clay golem. When it is too much, it will become soft!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a fallacies, are you again? What strange story novels have you seen?" Rhett didn't move, letting the konjac check his body. "My structure is not damaged, but some of my heart can't be quiet. Can you go out and see what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, are you not hurting, why? Can't walk together to see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tow, Rhett walked out of the temple. His eyes just saw the hills flying up, and the trees and flowers flew in the air. His heart was shocked and suddenly he realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow me, don't be here." Rhett immediately made up his mind: "I know my belongings."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, his face fell and his eyebrows made of steel fell to the ground. He asked in a trembling voice: "Do you want to leave home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't hear the first sentence I said to follow me? Rhett only wanted to squat on the second head, but he was worried about playing him even more stupid. "It is enough to bring something to pray in peacetime. I finally feel the call of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel covers his temple outside the castle, Rui De is busy removing his little temple. The stone house that he had set up, and finally only a long strip of stone that he was holding in his arms. This was originally installed on the threshold, and it will hang its holy emblem after finding the gods. For Rhett, all of the building materials are the most significant, so be sure to bring them around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is holding a long strip of stone, squatting at the two toot, and firmly walking toward the new temple. As the distance shortened, the familiar feeling became stronger and stronger, just like the feeling of going out to the home. He feels that his ability to practice is constantly improving, and his understanding of the gods and beliefs in his mind is also endless. His steps grew bigger and he became more and more determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second duo was dragged away at first, and later found that the power of the beggar began to become smaller, so it became the hand that firmly grasped Rhett. He is afraid of being left behind and has a natural hostility to something that can attract the devil like Rhett. He looked at the temple that appeared in front of the sky, although he knew that there was no force to complete such a building, but he could not like it. Even the flag of the six-clawed squid looks familiar, but the building does not give him any home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder is the only reason to let him follow. He looked around curiously and was shocked when he saw the words on the walls of the Enlightenment. All the texts on the basis of magic can perfectly express the meaning, which is not common for the konjac from the mechanical environment. Culture and language always lead to differences in understanding, and this does not exist in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was so sly, with a shallow smile on his face, watching Reid walk in. He doesn't need to wear his own clothes decorated with golden decorations, and he doesn't need to let the gods form a light to cover his body. When the priest of the magic god sees himself, he will understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder stunned and put down the long strip of stone in his hand, scratching his head with his empty hand: "It turned out to be you, Marquis of Siegel." Is this temple covered by you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, here is the temple of the god of magic and knowledge, are you not feeling it?" Release a little bit of power and close it before the reaction of the wall barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder’s body trembled and almost smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, your reaction is very strange, the two beeps are stunned, you are fine. Are you not my pastor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder looked at him and saw that the second beep was not only smashed, but also the five bodies cast their hands on the ground. This position is too ugly, the Golem kicked the konjac, but was whispered by the second whisper: "You didn't find the opposite is strong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Understand your feelings. I can only tell you my guess about your magic." Siegel said: "The magical clerk lost the manager for a period of time, completely passively reflecting the operation of magic. You are the priest's power sensor that was inspired at that time. You are made by magic, so it is normal to be able to communicate with the magic god. You don't know which one of your gods is, and the special state of that special period. Related. Now I am getting the magical priesthood, providing you with the source of the magic, but still the lord of Heim. You can separate this thing, or wait until you later understand the relationship, this pair I don't care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... what instructions do you have? Big... adults?" Reid thought about it, or used this name to compare Suitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is to manage the temple and work for me." Siegel said to him with a smile. "The things you have to do are actually the same as in the past. Help others according to your preferences. By the way, clean up the temple. The only difference is that the temple has become bigger than before, and its purpose is more clear. As a god of magic and knowledge, I The only requirement is to spread magic and knowledge, and use these two tools to create a better life. However, as the lord of Heim, since this temple is built in the city of Mire, it must also serve the territory. Unless it is out of place, I don't care about the specific things. If you come first, then be my chief pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked down the throne and reached out Rhett had a little on his forehead. He passed on his teachings, the field of magic and the power of knowledge, the magic and the method of cloning. Let him be a truly qualified pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything was done, Pastor Ryder flashed the light of wisdom in his eyes, which seemed more attractive than before. Two moan looked at him enviously, and looked at Siegel again. His relationship with Rhett is very close, but he can't share his faith. As a konjac, I believe that the order of the world has become a habit, even if the existence of God is just a manifestation of order. It is difficult for him to become a believer in a certain god unless the god is given priority as order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also... there is still a problem." Rhett said with some embarrassment: "Do I need to pray to you every day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what do you do now, how do you do it now, there is no need to change your habits." The sudden change in identity has made Siegel less comfortable, especially in the face of familiarity. When people are. Janet said that whether he is a god or not, he is still his wife. Rhett changed from a friend to a believer, and this change is too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for the matter to be handled, the synagogues of the federation came in and followed some residents of the city. In fact, most people are attracted by the text on the walls of the Enlightenment Hall, immersed in the state of learning is difficult to extricate themselves. Even some of the federation's mages are staying outside. Masters who are able to come inside or who have been immersed in spells for many years, or potential priests, are also admirers of the Marquis of Siegel - now transformed into ordinary believers under the influence of divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to simultaneously circulate magical fluctuations and divine power fluctuations, and the perfect combination of the two, in addition to the magic god who can have? Most of the Masters of the Federation do not believe in magical gods, but it does not mean that they do not respect power. They can face the gods from an objective point of view, but they will not think about it all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A highest-level wizard is enough. In fact, the only difference between the etiquette and the past is that Siegel only needs to simply nod. The return is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I don’t have any eyes, is that person Siegel? When did he have the priest's power?" Eyes, "Your teacher, what have you studied in the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Researched how to become a magical god." Siegel ended up Ryder's blessing, put away the divine power, and walked among the people of the federation. "For this reason, I have to withdraw from the Mage Federation. My main energy now is on the Temple of Heim and the Temple of Magic. You I also saw the Enlightenment Hall outside, and then I will expand the School of Magic. These things really need the help of the Federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is incumbent and unshirkable." Wood said quickly. He seems to be at a loss, and it is obvious that this shock is too great for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty is also in the crowd, hiding behind the burly plastic master Sementon. She secretly looked at Siegel, but carefully avoided his gaze. For a long time, he didn't meet. Wendy thought that he could let go of this experience, but found that the more he suppressed his influence on himself, the more he did not become a lich and the undead character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
