			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps of the dragon girl "噔噔" gradually went away from the stairs, and the konjac swayed to the side of Siegel with concern. The look asked: "Is it okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing," Siegel’s mouth trembled. "Let's still work. Janet... It should be fine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the workshop built for the imitation of the Hins technology, two people have been working hard, and have succeeded and failed for several months. Not like the manufacturing plant of the Void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the earliest, the assembly line always had problems, and the furnace and the forging mechanism could not match. Don't say that magic weapons are made. It can't even build a normal iron bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many places that I don’t understand. After all, when he is maintaining the workshop, he only sees the appearance and replaces the parts, and does not participate in the manufacturing process. It is difficult to get into the sky if you want to copy it completely. Siegel continued to comfort him: "We can't immediately reach the manufacturing level of Nexus. What we want to learn is the idea of ​​making things. All the parts that can be simplified are simplified, from what we will do!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Duo is responsible for finding ways to make ordinary materials reach the intensity of enchantment and allow them to reach the designated position of the enchanting machine. They gave up the enchantment, directly depicting the magic array with the formed steel plate, and then twisting it into the ammunition tweezers, in order to greatly simplify the manufacturing process. Siegel focused all his attention on the magical lines of the enchantment and then tried to improve the quality and precision of the finished product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pattern of the magic array has been determined, and Siegel first tried to make an enchanted ammunition by hand and spent the whole two days of sleeplessness. Although the first one was affected by the unfamiliarity and slowed down, this time consumption was unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you choose from all the fighters, there will be about 100 qualified shooters in the whole Heim collar. If you launch a civilian, you can arm it to about 300. I have been able to manufacture it for a whole year.” Siegel counted the account. “The elves have at least 3,000 old war trees, so only the production line of mass production can turn things around.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such an algorithm, the second beep does not understand. "Why isn't Knox common to win? We can also try to make a devil's box, which may be easier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elf must win. Siegel sighed. I took a picture of the second beep. "I can only tell you this thing. Don't tell others. Although Knox's members are human, they are more dangerous than elves. They can be used to weaken the power of the elves, but they must not Let them get the key to victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we shouldn't make the devil's scorpion first?" . Can't keep up with Siegel's thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knox is gradually developed by conspiracy and lurking, parasitic on other organizations." Siegel said: "The organization that relies on conspiracy will end up Killing each other. So Knox will fail and the elf will win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no such statement in the outer plane." Obviously not being convinced. But it is no longer entangled: "I will be your prophecy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel understands that his understanding of war is just an imaginary And the inference of wishful thinking. In fact, he is not willing to make the only reason to break the scorpion, but because he is also a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the powerful magic enchantment of the Rainbow Lightball has a fatal weakness: it still relies on elemental energy. In the mind of Siegel, there was a thought of breaking the magical magic circle: all the energy of the surrounding elements was converted into plasma, and the plasma itself was used to accelerate the weapon itself to form a powerful penetrating power. In this way, as long as a sufficient number of weapons can destroy the elemental basis of magic protection, the effect of breaking the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is such a weapon, the magician will be greatly restricted. Although the Master has a thorough means, the flesh and blood will eventually need rest, and it is impossible to always be mentally alert. If the envisioned devil is effective. Then the assassin can really pose a deadly threat to the wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel did not try to make even a broken magical vector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machining of fine gold items is basically the highest challenge of a weapon armor. It takes a lot of patience to make some modifications on the surface of such a hard object, even with spell assist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure over and over did not make Siegel discouraged, he concentrated on his fingertips, the smallest changes were not missed, and eventually Dwarf Ai Linde’s training gave him the greatest help. He also clearly remembered how the dwarf taught him to distinguish the material of weapons and armor at the top of Mora. Feel their center of gravity and feel, find vulnerable parts to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he re-uses the knowledge he had learned, he finally had a different feeling. The fine gold material is finally able to communicate with him like steel, just as the dwarf can see through the rocks. So he is very confident in the fine gold rams made this time. I took a piece of steel and placed it underneath it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two toes also came together to see, the rounded eyes focused on the ram, silently praying to the snake of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pulls the joystick, the hammer slams on the steel plate, accompanied by the deafening noise is the splash of fire. The two couldn't wait to raise the ram and cast the reconnaissance spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So far so good." Siegel said: "There is no break in the engraving. There is no very uneven thickness. I try it with a repair." Effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repair is just a very simple spell in the Master spell, which can only be used to repair simple items such as doors and windows, tables and chairs, clothes, etc. The healing spell is very sensitive to the presence of material, elemental affinity, and magical arrays, so magic items cannot be repaired with this spell. Even sometimes the item is only enchanted and cannot be applied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy of the healing spell enveloped the steel plate, but it didn't work. Siegel and Erdu clap and laughed with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on the next step!" Two slaps the steel plate to the next machine, and the conveyor belt can't wait. The slender robotic arm accurately places the gemstone powder at the node location and then burns it with a plasma to spread in the engraving to form a network of interconnected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to adjusting the machine settings in the future, reducing the consumption of gem powder and saving costs, this step is also completed successfully. The steel plate then continues to run and is caught by the boom and immersed in cold water. This water is used for both cooling and special materials to form a layer of insulation protection on the plasma lines. Siegel can't make a jelly-proof anti-leakage coating. Only the alchemy materials of the Masters Union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This material is not durable and will lose its ability to insulate in a few years. By then, the entire ammunition will be useless. However, this is not a hand-crafted magic item, and it is not intended to be used forever - it can solve the problem at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After cooling. The boom trembled, draining the residual moisture from the steel plate and placing it on the final forming lathe. Here the steel plate is bent to become the outer shell of the ammunition. The magic array originally distributed on several sides will also be closed here and finally formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This step is very important: the lines of the magic lines need to be closed. No matter whether it is angle, strength or timing, you can't make mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people caught their breath and prayed silently in their hearts. The lathe made a harsh sound, and the thin steel plate had no resistance. A faint glow emanates from the ammunition, which is clearly the aura of magical items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and the two hands are shaking, and it takes a long time to control the mood. When Duo picked up the ammunition, Siegel showed the detection magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Light! Very obvious aura, stable, clear and strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people found the ammunition stand, buckled in the scorpion, slightly tight. But this has little effect. They will have prepared the plasma 从 从 from the Stable Magic Array - exactly the same as the ammunition ,, but Siegel hand-painted on the workbench - taken out, then stuffed into the ammunition, and then began wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours have passed, and the plasma is still very stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good sign. Before Siegel made the scorpion, as long as the magic array took a few minutes, it will dissolve, not like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
