All those who are in the outpost must report their names and origins, and it is best to have someone who is familiar with them. "Beware of the assassin of the murder god," Siegel decided to open the news, lest it cause unnecessary speculation: "If you find a suspicious stranger, please contact the castle's guard, don't touch yourself."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Aboriginal people living in the wilderness of the West do not know what the murder god is, but when he heard that he had no heroic spirit and often used ghosts to murder his life, most of them expressed their spurn . Later, I don’t know who was spread, "the big boss of the lord" - they gave Siegel's "new title" - the leader of the lord was assassinated by the devote of the devote, and his wife also died of assassination in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this from?" Siegel asked Fazak and Moore. "Janet did not die, this is a rumor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two grandchildren looked at each other and said in unison: "We will investigate this matter please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is it useful?" Siegel can see the situation in the market in the bastion. After completing the question, the soldiers began to rummaging through the cabinets, trying to find assassins from the piles of fur and bacon. Soon they will go to the businessman's pocket and wallet and spread the seeds of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call the soldiers back, they can't find anything, don't add chaos to the starting point." Siegel tapped the stone frame on the window sill with his finger. , sound like a drum. "You can't use violence against the murder god. It's his home, not ours. Moore, haven't you asked about setting up a place of worship at the outpost? I agree. Heim is free to believe, but all the temples." The temples and the altars must be reported to the local lords, and they can be built at the designated locations with their consent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak licked his beard, against Siegel Said: "The Earl, the starry kingdom, with the morning temple as the core to manage other beliefs, will Heim’s leadership cause dissatisfaction with the morning temple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, they are priests who believe in the gods, and will not contradict the lord because of this kind of thing.” Siegel turned to Moore and said to him: “If necessary, you can also take the position of the starting lord. Good and peaceful gods organize gifts, whether it is money or food. The purpose is to let them help us to prevent the murder of the gods and avoid the turmoil in the territory. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mol nodded . Then retire and begin to issue orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horns sounded horns, two short and one long. The soldiers at the market reluctantly left their hands and grabbed their weapons and began to go to the castle. Soldiers are used to fight, or let them stand guard and patrol, but maintaining the order of the city is not their job. The hand that used to be a weapon faced an unarmed civilian. It is easy to cause problems. On the battlefield, he can use the rewards and trophies to satisfy the soldiers, but in his own town? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some ways, elemental guards are more obedient than soldiers, but the only problem is intelligence. There are no clever elements in the world, and pure and extreme energy can cause damage inadvertently. It is okay to use the elemental patrol to show the strength of the territory, but the element guards cannot form the normal state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From all angles, the lamp gods used by the mages are a good choice. They have the ability to deal with problems, loyalty, no desire, and no fatigue at all. It also has quite good magical ability, and it is also a competent bodyguard. However, the materials needed to make the lamp god are both expensive and scarce. So you can only put this plan after the magic array is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another option is to use the Golem. The combination of the elemental rune matrix of Heim's collar and the energy focusing lens array provides a good elemental power, which basically reaches the level required by the elemental golem on the Dragon and Lion Cliff. Siegel does not need to create such a powerful guardian golem, only a simpler, more compact body-building soldier. Maybe it's not even a soldier for combat, but a choice of a tireless construction horse, and even a winch is a good idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a vague idea that came into being after becoming a lord. He found that the income of the territory was very uneven, and the taxes from the land and population were far lower than the income of the gold mine. If there is no zebra mountain gold mine, only the special products of the territory can not meet the needs of learning magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the past Master Lia said, most of the spell learners can't pay the Master's tuition. On the one hand, the cost of casting and the cost of magic items are high. On the other hand, because ordinary people earn too little. As a seaman and adventurer, Siegel has not much idea about this, just let him eat enough. But after becoming the lord, he saw the tax paid by Fazak to his territory. He gradually understood the truth of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If non-negative energy is harmful to **. Even undead creatures are an option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is possible to accomplish such an idea, isn’t it more meaningful than doing some intrigues, lie deception and killing all day? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there a god of murder in the world, why is he able to grow rapidly? "It's really troublesome." Siegel said to himself. Because he can't understand God's way of thinking, it is difficult to infer the steps they might take next, so they can only passively prevent and prevent. It is said that the murder god hates the influence of kindness and justice, and the upright battle. It is known that his weakness does not mean that there is an opportunity to implement it. Siegel clenched his fist and realized that this would be a long-lasting contest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the meaning of a black piece of cloth sent by a half-man's hand, a challenge or a warning? No one can be sure of what it means. Through Lille's description, the Earl of Heims thought of a man who had already been left behind by him: the singer, Jarrell. Since the day when the Red Dragon attacked the Jackdaw Tribe, he has never seen him again. Blue eyes, tears like the corners of the eyes and beautiful faces, just in line with the appearance of Siegel's memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sieg has always thought that Jarrell was burned to death in the fire, and there was no bone. If it is him, then what does he choose to appear at this time, is the enemy or friend? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black fabric contains black information, but Siegel can't guess the meaning behind it. For the sake of the present, only increase vigilance and step up defense to prevent the black assassin from reappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is based on this consideration that Moore will double the number of people who go to the Niu Rhino tribe. They formed a team of 100 people, with gifts to the depths of the green grass and ocean. Moore didn't want his grandfather to travel long distances, lest the physical exertion affect his health. As a result, Fazak knocked a few slaps. The one-eyed old man had to follow, and finally Siegel persuaded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I get to my destination, I can use the transfer to go directly to you." The Master said: "You are here to rest first. Adapt to the environment, and look after the starting point outpost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was moved by the latter half of the sentence and changed his mind to stay. Therefore, the young people on the road are naturally speeding up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way the prairie people have their own prairie people, they tamed the Falcon as a scout, and investigated the movements around them. Since the team carries enough supplies, there is no need to hunt along the way. Therefore, the experienced ranger swayed the whip and made a loud noise, which spread throughout the four fields. This can scare the beasts and keep them away from the line of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people marching along the river, so it is not easy to get lost, but also make the journey more comfortable. At some time, Siegel casts a light spell on the truck and repairs the damage caused by the bumps, so everyone does not have to take care of the speed. Although there are often small stones along the river bank, there is no impact on the big car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s focus on continuing to engrave the crystal mantra, Moore nervously observes the surrounding situation, and the heart is still worried about the date of the blind date, only Evan is true "Visitors". He watched the falcon hovering in the dark blue sky, riding a horse galloping in the turbulent grass sea, surrounded by green blades of grass and bright flowers. Xu Feng burst into the air, blowing cool coolness on his face. He only felt that he was calm and peaceful, and at the same time majestic and magnificent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the vast ocean between the two continents did not give him such feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the sword. Before his own "bonfire" was not completed, he temporarily used Siegel's star dust. He used the sword to keep tapping the horse, and each time the target is a small flower. The sharp tip of the sword ran towards the delicate flower at a very fast speed, but it was just a touch on the top, such as a kiss between lovers, only gentle and considerate. He was flying all the way, kisses all the way, except for the grass on which the horseshoe was trampled, the other was unharmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranger in the team once again swayed the long whip, and a "clam" sound came from behind Evan. However, there was a roar in front of him. It seemed that a fierce beast was consciously provocative and responded with a scream. If the Ranger shakes the whip a few more times, the beast will run away, every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan gently slammed his horse's belly with his foot, and the mount changed direction and went straight toward the beast. Good horse, know my heart. Evan stared at the front and found a big brown lion from the grass. He was crouching in the soft grass nest, surrounded by clean animal bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
