			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf nodded and said: "I can recognize the responsibility on the shoulders, indicating that you have really grown up. Humans can always learn other races, such as Our dwarf's sense of responsibility, this is your advantage. But when you talk about the original plan, how did you plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel look at Elinte Look at the kitten again, then say: "You know that I used to be a sailor. On the boat..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told the old captain about his dying The secret treasure about the end of the world tells the dwarf, "I want to see it there. It's not just for treasures, it's more because of curiosity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is a lofty ideal, but I hope that you are not burnt, really ready to practice." Elinette said with a beard, very serious: "In fact, I came here, there is one thing you want to do, and at the same time Also as an exchange condition for the gem family to provide you with assistance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"Ah, as a good friend and a good student, I immediately promise you, but as a local lord, I have to ask clearly." Siegel said with a smile: "Now Hemqiu has nothing to produce. "What can you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What we are looking for is that you have nothing here," said Dwarf Elinte. Then he added: "One hundred years ago, a group of dwarves went west from the walled mountains to the wilderness. Their mission was to find the end of the world and the dragon's foothold in the New World. We have been very strange, why? The greedy dragon will abandon the treasures of the Walled Mountains and fly westward. The gods we receive indicate that this matter has nothing to do with the dwarves, so for a long time Mora has taken an unconcerned attitude - but not all The dwarves think so. The westward dwarves are more radical. At that time, all the families had elites, including our gem family. They returned more than half a year ago, leaving only thirty people still alive." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did they find out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wild land is bigger than the imagination, there The huge monsters exceeded the previous expectations. The survivors described the storm giants holding the Thunder, the dragons that illuminate the rainbow and the eyes that can block the sun. They failed to find the dragon's lair, but they did bring back A lot of rare treasures. This time, the god of guardian once again lowered the gods, and the dwarfs of Mora were not allowed to go to the west of the walled mountains. So as to avoid causing disasters, our three families decided to throw these west dwarves Come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? I can't see the strong who can come back from such a dangerous place, they want to leave, I can't take care of it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you as a dwarf. A sneaky thief?" Elin was so angry that he blew his beard and snorted. "After the gods descended, all the west dwarves made vows before the patron saint, never leaked, completely obeyed God's will, and said it. It's done. But their identity is too sensitive, the three big families don't want to There is turmoil inside the Mora, and the gods are only known to the 9 people in the core conference and the Westward Dwarf. So we need to find a place to settle them, at least some distance from the Mora. Are you not right?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegels licked his chin and carefully calculated the matter, weighing the pros and cons. "As long as they can accept the management of my lord, then I will welcome them with both hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, this sentence is enough for you." Elinte said: "Although it does not conform to the policy, I personally admire those who are westward, and their current leader is still my uncle. Locke. Diamond, you have something to discuss with him, I can He praised you in front of him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When do they arrive? I need to prepare food and drinks in advance."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After we help you build the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stunned, Elinte was very satisfied Looked at his expression, then laughed: "What do you think we are doing? Do I need to have a guard for 100 people, do I have to be so old? Irene doesn't need to go anywhere, just a warhammer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then said: "The brothers behind me are the best." Dwarf craftsmen, warriors and miners, we heard that you want to build a castle in the Walled Mountains, so it will come. This thing can not be carried out by our dwarves. Right. Don't say that you are not prepared to pay us the reward! ‚Äù<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Elinette." Siegel escaped his gold from his pocket. When practicing magic, he pressed the gold into the shape of a flying axe. "Fortunately, I produce gold here, enough to pay for a castle - as long as you allow me to owe a part."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf took the gold. Close one eye and use the other to look at it carefully and admire: "It's really good, the purity is very high. Where did you find such a good craftsman, it is comparable to our dwarf craftsmanship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I personally refined, using magic." Siegel said with a smile: "But I really want to know your methods, how do we exchange each other?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know that our dwarves can't learn magic." Elinte said: "It's a sly little devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dwarf's presence, the entire striped mountain became more lively, and the castles of Siegel and Janet's dreams could finally be built. The dwarf Elinette is not a general construction worker. They can all be called masters of architecture. Rocks, metal and runes are the most obedient tools in their hands, and they can work freely according to their minds. The huge sum of thousands of gold coins allowed the entire Heimqiu to have enough start-up capital, and the gold mines in the Striped Mountains allowed the development momentum to continue. However, this information is still confidential to the lords of the South. They never knew that the food, seeds and building materials that the car was transported from Mora was all exchanged from Siegel's gold mine. Siegel knows very well that he has the greatest advantage as a lord: in the vicinity of 1,500 miles, he does not have a superior lord who needs allegiance, and can be said to be completely free. If he can develop successfully, Heimqiu can almost be regarded as an independent kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site creaked like a mess. The merchants from the top of Mora stood in the carriage and moved a bucket of ale, a bag of flour, and a bundle of new shovel and crossbow. The blacksmith shop next to the camp is open day and night, and the fire is burning forever. They are building alchemy tools according to the dwarf's drawings. As soon as possible, build a workshop that can refine gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to vehicles that transport food and tools, there are also trucks that carry charcoal from the north. The dwarf taught the local mankind the ability to make charcoal quickly, and the forest was paralyzed. Under the power of the axe and the saw, the wood has no resistance. After Janet heard about it. Stop this matter immediately. According to the power of the lord, the forest, the river, and the production above are all lords, and they must not be used without authorization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are stealing the property of the lord, and immediately stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deva brothers want It is a bounty to arrest those who are arbitrarily logging, and to be able to work for the lord and the wife in their eyes. However, Janet did not issue an order to arrest. Let these people leave, just repeatedly telling them not to come to the woods again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Siegel very happy and knows that his lover will not be a ruthless woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out his own gold coins and bought charcoal from the top of the Mora, not allowed to cut down any trees. He then ordered the villagers to freely pick up firewood for fire, and each village could have three hunters and three fishermen. If the harvest of hunting and fishing is used in your own village, you will not have to pay taxes, otherwise you will be fined all income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Fazak was puzzled by this, Siegel made him prepare the market as soon as possible. The exchange of goods in the territory will be concentrated in the market, and the lord will send people to supervise the business and ensure the transaction price of daily necessities. And collect a portion of the tax from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchase of bulk goods has caused the price level of the entire territory to begin to fall. The villagers are encouraged and excited about being able to buy cheap things. After the two black-hearted businessmen who tried to deceive the villagers with fake and inferior products smashed two fingers and threw them out of the market, the transaction became active. If it is not a commodity such as eggs, fish or pork, the market can make Siegel have a tax on multiple gold coins every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is too little compared to gold mines. Therefore, gold mines are the foundation of territorial wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf artisan took over the gold mine in the Zebra Mountain and began to build a convenient and efficient mine system. Although there were not enough steel to build the track, they used ropes and pulleys to construct another set of equipment to transport the ore. Cooperation with the Orcs is actually the most difficult part. It is hard for them to get along with each other. Siegel and Irene spent a lot of effort and finally let the Orcs learn the use of the mine system before the dwarf was exhausted. After that, a large amount of red gold ore was continuously transported out of the mountains and piled up next to the refining workshop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
