			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has a smile, as long as this person is greedy, it is easy to do, he now has blood magic, witch festival and Kaka all the money. Without hesitation and hesitation, he extended two fingers and said: "If the goods are intact, two hundred white gold coins. Whether it is deep water city or a starry kingdom, you can live a good life."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you get the money by handing it over to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want this money, you have to follow it. Go to the old mainland and find the master of the lord.” Siegel took the glass and poured a deep sip. Then he said, “Do you think I will carry so much money on my body?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slippery." The one-eyed old man said: "Tell me what the name of the person is, what it looks like, I will pick it up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There is a purple birthmark behind his left ear, about one meter tall, a young man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On this? You let me With this everywhere to find someone?" One-eyed patted the table and shook the plates and cups above. "Kid, aren't you playing me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, playing you, Siegel thought. If you don't use deception, how can you hear the news from here? Although it is only a slave message, everything in the entire orc society is related to the slave business. From the slave trade, we can see that the movement of the army and the change of power can know the profit and loss of the store and the amount of goods. The denser the orcs, the denser the slaves and the more news there are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I naturally will distinguish when I bring people." Siegel said: "If you look too specific, don't you worry about the seller taking the opportunity to raise prices. Does it affect our profits?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man smiled and his eyes became a seam: "You are a slippery head, and now I am against me." He raised the cup and touched Siegel. "I wish our business a success. This is a really bad job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as the money is good, there is nothing to complain about." Siegel and him Cheers. Before being sold, I am temporarily safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the early morning light passed through the small window of the grocery store with railings and shone into the small, crowded bedroom, Siegel got up early. Even if the raven hidden in the beam of the house is a sentinel, he does not dare to sleep more. Opening the door of the bedroom and then stepping on the creaking stairs, Siegel came to the front desk of the grocery store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now aliased as Sos, the name of the ship he was born in. According to the method of nobility, the full name of Siegel should be called Siegel from Sos, the first person of the squid family, the brave of Mora, and the royal baron of the starry kingdom. If he can get out of the internship class and get a more formal identity in the Mage Federation, it will also be added to his name. But in the case of being surrounded by enemies, a pseudonym called Sos is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed half-orc is called Fitzak, and everyone is more accustomed to calling him "one-eyed daddy", who is said to have lived in Macabu for more than 30 years - - This is naturally a forged identity. He has been on the battlefield, has sold slaves, and has been a pirate. Now this grocery store does not belong to him, but the industry of General Kab. Fitzak is just a high-level manager. In the eyes of the orcs, it is already a great gift for a monk to sit in a chair and make money comfortably. It is a half-orc who is thrown into the arena or who is eating in the narrow boat cabin all day. Too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Fitzak is a spy in Deepwater City. He is hoping to have a stable stronghold to cover his work so that he can pick up the groceries. The work of the store. He usually racks his brains and fights for more money and power for the "master". He is a qualified shopkeeper. But in private, he used the convenience of receiving smugglers to pass information to Deepwater City. For more than a decade, he has been doing life on both sides. However, since one eye has been lost ten years ago, the other eyesight has been declining. He has recently noticed that his body is accelerating aging, his energy is getting worse and worse, and he has been unable to do so. He asked for several times to leave his current position, but the war initiated by the orcs made him have to stay, which was half a year. Fortunately, the final task has been released, waiting for the faceless to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This self-proclaimed Soth is never a faceless person, and one-eyed dad is already convinced of this. He is certainly not an intermediary who buys prisoners of war, and certainly has another purpose. The only question is, which organization does he serve? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel examined the bag carefully and found no trace of being taken apart. This is the rule of the identity forgery industry. Only the manufacturer and the user know the identity information, and the middle channel cannot open the bag. Generally, such an opaque black cloth bag is sewn with needle threads, and then the opening is pressed with two copper plates, and then sealed with a sealing wax. Inside the bag will be parchment with identification information, and perhaps one or two gadgets for proof. Such a small package is about 2 to 5 gold coins, and the more chaotic it is, the cheaper it is. Siegel knows the market, so he just throws three gold coins into Fitzak and says, "When did you actually pay the money, are you giving me the money? I will spend 30 gold coins in three days." The result is only useless news. I said that I need three identities, how can I only have one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, this takes time." The old man bite Biting gold coins, I only feel that the teeth are loose and my mouth hurts badly. However, he still made a satisfied expression, put the gold coins into his pocket, and then shook his head and said: "Since you are already up, let's go to the slave market."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Go so early?" Siegel squinted, and asked curiously: "Going to the market is tantamount to finding a needle in a haystack. This is a stupid way."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bait has been sprinkled, just look at the time to bite the hook. You are not useful here when you stay here, and anyway, there is no customer in the grocery store today, it is better to go to the slave market to see."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood." Siegel nodded and said, "Wait for me, come right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel returned to the room and opened the bag to view. Inside is two pieces of parchment, one with burning eyes and the other with an orc text. The orcs use tattoos to determine their identity. They use war patterns for themselves, and the generals will also find witchcraft to impose enchantments on the battle lines. Half-orcs generally do not have war lines, but some of the most important half-orc elites can use professional tattoos so that the orcs will not easily kill these valuable half-orcs. Slaves of other races use branding to burn the owner's identity mark on the skin. Some of the orcs' "allies" are mostly pirates, mercenaries, and slave traders. They will have the opportunity to devote all their loyalty to tattoos, and they can be honest with some orc generals and gain his shelter. Siegel bought such a tattoo, located on the right side of the neck, the object of allegiance is an orc female general named Aubin. There is also a basic introduction to identity on the sheepskin, the name and relationship status of the orc female general. Siegel wrote down these things and reloaded them into bags. He took a small bottle from his body, which was poison taken from the witch festival. After pouring the poison powder into the pocket and tying it into the pocket, Siegel hid it under the bedboard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always had a feeling that Fazak was watching him. Because of the inability to use magic, Siegel did not have a good way to check the entire room for hidden voyeur holes. He has been guarding Fitzak to give himself a black hand, so the raven is hiding on the beam of the house all day, and he does not eat or drink. It is like a sculpture, only the black eyes are always staring at the surroundings with vigilance. Siegel looked at the magic pet before leaving the door, and did not need language and nerve connection. The two were connected. Raven Barron nodded and said he knew his mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak is not credible, and Siegel knew from the beginning that he must find time to get rid of this old man. As the orc's largest ship-building port, Macabu has been at a high level of alert. There are often patrolling sergeants who walk through the streets and arbitrarily hold a human or half-orc to ask. More dangerous than the patrols are the witch sacrifices, who, under the protection of the sergeant, will bless the orcs who have passed, and on the other hand, in the dark, cast a spell that strengthens the ability to detect enchantment. They will listen to the words of the orc residents and distinguish the information contained in them. Siegel has seen that under their instructions, several escaped slaves were taken out of the hidden dark lane and beheaded on the street. The blood flowing out of the falling head was reddened on the ground, and the witch festival rewarded those informants who provided information. In a few days, Fitzk will also be a member of the informant, Siegel thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still has to go all the way to the slave market with the one-eyed dad, pretending to be intimate. Both of them spoke with a mask, but Siegel saw that Fazak’s love when he tasted the deep water city spirits was sincere, so he voted for him, passing by a wine merchant’s street vendor. Before, I deliberately stopped my foot and asked: "What good wine do you have here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc stall owner is two human beings and would not want to receive them. Ignore Siegel’s words. Siegel was not angry, bent down and smelled it, then shook his head and walked away. He said to Fazak: "The spirits here smell like abusing the nose, drinking it and afflicting the tongue, swallowing and hurting the stomach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one you brought The spirits are very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
