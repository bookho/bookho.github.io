			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come and stop this mage!" The priest of the murderer shouted, "Hey, he hasn't finished the spell! Fast!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he took the lead and rushed up to his fist. WwW.XsHuotXT.com This room is not big, but the distance to the Master is only five steps, but the five steps are like an insurmountable obstacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no obstacles, and the air is as thick as a swamp. The priest was slowed down only by taking one step, and the second step could not be stepped on. Later, the soldiers and assassins rushed into the same dilemma. They were like worms stuck on the spider web. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stands in the middle of the room, constantly mobilizing the surrounding elements to bring them from the soil, rock formations and oceans to their side. The energy he absorbs from all these sources flows through his body, forming a spell that is ready to go. Like the whirlpool in the middle of the sea, everything around him seems to have been sucked by him. Those who are set in the air have this feeling. As they get deeper and deeper, the sense of oppression is getting stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal elemental level is suitable for the growth of all things, but when the element level is too high, it will produce a suffocating effect, which is harmful to all living things. The servants of the murder god are caught in this state. They can't move and can't breathe. They are really dying in the high concentration of water and earth elements. They also feel the two most terrible sudden deaths. feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s voice begins again, this time clear and slow, and every word of the spell is pronounced. The priests of the murder god finally understood, it was a carol of the power of the elements, just like their praise of the murder god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand put it down, pointed to the front, and the spell began to start. A burst of green acid sprayed out and dissolved everything in front of it. The flesh and blood body can't stop the monster formed by the mixture of soil and water. A monster composed of twelve acids was created, cheering and jumping towards the channel of the stronghold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They combine the characteristics of both elements, the flexible and intrinsic and hard outer shell. These monsters have long, thin heads. The pointed mouth is full of jewel-like sharp teeth. They use slender limbs to drive a streamlined body and maintain a balance with a long tail. Assassins are also hard to compare with their body flexibility. The special senses of elemental creatures can easily identify hidden enemies. But the most troublesome thing is another feature. Once the monster is injured, the acid in the body will splatter, and it is difficult for the attacker to have time to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These silver-gray elemental monsters are the first scouts to go out and explore the path. Their shape will not last long and will eventually become a acid bomb. With the exception of single-element creatures, only four-element polymers can remain stable for long periods of time. But for a powerful mana, stability and instability can be used as weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stepped through the acid in the ground without being affected. But everything around him is melting the ground, walls, all kinds of debris or dead bodies killed by monsters. I believe that the movement here can attract the attention of the sacred murderer, but I don't know if he will go to the elf or come to find himself, but as long as you don't go to Yao En, they will be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a scroll of limited pledges, Siegel blessed a dagger as a "seal god body." If you can hurt him with a dagger, you can solve the most troublesome physical resistance and resilience of the Holy One - these are all supported by God. Siegel has always sought ways to deal with the saints, and he did not expect that the solution is by his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out a fire element, a gas element rune guard, and activated them here. Due to the size of the channel, the elements can only maintain a large size, so the power is not very strong. Siegel arranged for them to protect themselves in tandem to prevent the sudden assassination of the assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who have tried this way. And more than one. Often when Siegel turned his head or his attention was slightly attracted to something, an assassin slid to him. The timing was very good, but the action was still stupid. The mage who is heavily defended by defensive spells is not a stake. Even if the dagger is only a few inches away from the skin of the body, it is still insurmountable. There are six or seven different spell barriers in this inch of space. How can ordinary daggers penetrate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning shot from Siegel's fingertips, accurately hit the assassin's head. A burst of blue smoke will rise and death will come. The servants of all the murderers saw this scene, and they threw their weapons and turned and fled. Siegel left them to leave because fear would help him spread the message and guide him in the right direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He met a team of colloidal warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really good to be back to the Master. You don't have to find a way to use all kinds of swords to get close to me, just call the power of the elements. The red, purple, and black flames are constantly ejected, creating a brilliant flash in the passage. The scorching heat melts the rock and naturally melts the thin iron and the gelatin monster beneath it. "These things are really useless." Siegel said more than once. "If it is a real knight, how can you try to use the tower shield as a cover, and then use a long-range weapon to fight back. These iron people will only use the sword, purely Arrangement!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the raid, the base was in chaos, but it didn't last long. Fear and chaos can trigger a bombing, but the servant of the murderer is neither afraid of death nor abandoning chaos. Regardless of whether their training can stop the invaders, they finally reorganized and restored their grasp of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dorn, the mantle outside the manor, they sent three war trees, which have blocked the army of the Duke of Kaibu and suppressed it. Inside the castle. The manor will not last long, and the elves will rush down.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorn is not good at battlefield command, but he also knows that if he can’t stop the elf The entire stronghold will soon be occupied, and all glory will no longer be. "Send all the soldiers, resist the festival. The elves can't show their strength in the passage. We still have a number of advantages. After the spiral passage, it is a big cave. Immediately set up the position and take out the long-range weapons from the warehouse!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the warehouse has been destroyed, we only have a small inventory of the barracks. A mage who did not know where to come from first blown up the lab And then summoned the earth monster in the warehouse. We didn't find Mr. Rees's whereabouts, I am afraid he is fierce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage? Let Ke Ke Pastor go Dealing with it, he doesn't claim to have the best experience with the caster, and his record is also the best in the Elven Forest.” Dorn grabbed the servant around him, his eyes flashing with a crazy look “Knocking the alarm, let the Solidarity The comrades came to support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those are untrained farmers and craftsmen, what is the use?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their sacrifices can slow the progress of the elves Naturally, it is useful.” Dorn said, “Ready to transfer the array and ask for help from other places.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can...” The servant hesitated, but still Nodded and accepted the order. On the way he left, he replied to Regis. This young man was well done because of several recent missions, so he came to the base to prepare for training. The servant pointed him to the direction of the transmission line, and then went to the secret road and sounded the alarm of the Solidarity in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reggers nodded, but did not go to the array. He will serve Siegel and will no longer accept the control of the Temple of the God of Murder. He touched the dagger hidden in the sleeve, staring at the Dane who was giving orders, waiting patiently for the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel continues to advance in the passage, wherever he goes, only death. Flush the fist in front of the fire element, smash a door, and then rush in to destroy the enemies hidden in it. Siegel sometimes throws a few fireballs inside—anything that doesn’t hurt the fire—and basically empties a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He passed several bedrooms, a canteen and two storage rooms, not far from the front is a prayer room with a sacred emblem of murder. In front of the altar that lit the candle, a burly man wearing a full body armor was kneeling down to the ground and praying. His one-handed bow and the big shield of the door were resting on the feet, and a heavy-duty hammer was still hanging on his waist. He heard the burning sound of the fire, and he stood up and showed a weird smile with his mouthless teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come to die, little mage." He hung the shield on his arm and picked up the bow, so he looked at Siegel "the god of murder." There is no place for you to scatter in front of the power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no elemental power from him, and the fire element does not want to rush. Siegel probably understood what was going on, but still ordered the fire element to charge. The flames that swept through the past screamed, waving bright and warm arms, and then extinguished five meters in front of the man, leaving only the elemental rune core dropped to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a good thing that Heim has taken, a rune warrior with tens of thousands of gold coins." The man aimed at Siegel with a sling, then said " I am Coron, they call me a mage killer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
