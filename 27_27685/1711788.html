			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel originally did not want Janet to take risks, but she was worried that she would secretly follow, so she could only enter the cave. The mage's wand has been lit up and walked in front; Janet took the dragon's tooth dagger and walked gently behind her footsteps. The cave outside has been reconnoitered many times. It is just a simple, dwarf-style stone hall, rough, strong and majestic. The air is full of moist air, mixed with the smell of dirt, rot leaves and garbage, only slightly better than the camp outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the help of magic, the two people saw another scene: there was a layer of black slate on the ground, all of which were esoteric dwarfs. The text, after years of wear and tear, is also unharmed, and is shining slightly in the magical field of vision. Between the two conical columns, there is a metal gate decorated with a faucet. The ring on the door is rusted, but the door itself avoids the erosion of time. Siegel stepped forward and stretched the door knocker. With a gentle trembling, the faucet made a low squeak, and a gap that was enough to pass through between the two doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark passage is hidden behind the gate, and a hot, dry wind blows out from it, smashing through Siegel’s face and making him instantly The illusion, I thought I went back to the summer. He put the wand in first and raised the voice of the curse. The light becomes brighter and shines farther, but still can't reach the end of the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bodies were quietly lying on the stone wall of the passage, their faces were blue, and the blood marks from the eyes, nose, and ears had dried up, but Still clearly visible, coupled with their twisted fingers and open mouths, Siegel can judge these people to die from the bones, a plague spread through wound contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out the rope from his backpack and tied it on the feet of two bodies, carefully not touching it directly. Then he threw the other end of the rope and wrote a note to illustrate the situation. After entering the gate, Siegel discovered that the two of them were affected by the rune of the place, also known as the existence of invisibility and anechoic, as if they were in another world. The outside people couldn't see the metal gate, and now they can't see or hear Siegel and Janet, but they can find the rope and find the note. As soon as the rope is pulled, the two bodies will be taken out and properly handled outside according to the instructions on the paper strip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not let them come in along the rope?" Janet grabbed Siegel's arm and asked, "Many people are strong."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not only the door that has the magic to deceive the senses, but also in the passage. After they come in, there is no difference between them and the donkeys. We can't take care of them and add useless troubles."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people go forward together and look closely at the surrounding environment. This channel is semi-circular, three meters high, even if it jumps up, it is not enough. The ground is spotless, so Siegel can't track the footprints. The walls on both sides of the passage were decorated with many long, thick bones. The two men approached and guessed that they were all keels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like the red dragon skeleton of the Jackdaw tribe." Janet said: "There is nothing smaller here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's best not to tamper." Siegel took Janet's hand. "I still remember the record in "Jia Kun Travel Notes". Whenever there is a skull on the wall, you must knock between your eyes, otherwise there will be poisonous needles and sickles attack."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people carefully walked forward, one person paying attention to the wall on one side. They walked two hundred meters and finally found a lot of bodies in the passage. They are all lumpy and dismembered, with seven hired knights and a morning guard. Their bodies have been hard and dry, and even if the internal organs are sprinkled on the ground, there is no stench. Siegel guessed that this may be related to the strange dry heat here, or it may be a special effect of rune spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the wall next to the pile of corpses, there is a complete orc head set in the middle of a pile of keels, and its forehead is exceptionally smooth and flat. Siegel walked over and tapped with a wand. Just listening to the sound of a slap in the wall, then the rhythm of the rhythm, snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go ahead, after the snoring, the organs here will recover, only the skull can be passed." Siegel took Janet's hand. After two steps, leaving the danger zone, I said: "There were 7 hired knights, plus two at the door, and the number of missing mercenaries was only one person. The morning guards died one person, but the highness should pass here. "Go ahead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, what do you want to do when you go back? Will there be this institution?" Janet asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men stepped forward and walked into the cave with the light of magic. The channel is getting narrower and narrower, and it can be turned into eight people side by side. It's like a canyon outside, a huge entrance and a tight interior, a trap. Siegel is a bit worried. He stood still and once again recalled the record in the book "Jia Kun Travel Notes": the front should be the dragon's throat, only the blood of the real dragon and the blood of the real king can pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They keep moving forward, watching the endless sacral bones on both sides, finding the skulls of various monsters inside, knocking, and then crossing the trap. The journey seemed monotonous and boring, and the passage seemed to never come to an end. Siegel held his wand, and the light could only shine more than ten meters in front of him and behind him. It was dark outside. In this repressive environment, the two young adventurers don't want to talk, they just hold their hands tightly and stay strong with each other's existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s difficult to calculate distance and time here, so they don’t know how long they have gone. When they are hungry, the two stop and take a few mouthfuls of dry food. In the deep and deep passage, the sound of chewing the wheat cake became a resounding sound. The two people looked at each other and felt a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did the dwarf kill so many dragons?" Janet stroked the cheekbones on the wall and asked Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unclear." Siegel shook his head and frowned and replied: "The history of the record never mentions the scale of war and the killing of dragons. Quantity, this is really very strange. Although there is no genus relationship between the dragons, most of the dragons are living alone, but if they are killed in such a large number, the dragons have long united to launch the battle of revenge. The dwarf kingdom is Very strong, but far worse than the dragon - why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel suddenly stopped, Janet was also He grabbed it and his hands hurt. She looked at Siegel's face with horror and nervous expression. She suddenly picked up at night and asked: "What happened? What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How far have we gone?” Siegel whispered and ran a drop of sweat along his forehead. He asked again: “How far have we been?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't know, but it should be quite far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should have been out of the sphere of influence for a long time." Siegel pointed to himself. The eyes are pointing around again: "Are you sure that these are still true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and pulled out their arms, back to back Stand up. "What should I do now? Can you cast spells to break the illusion?" Janet asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't have enough material to cast that spell again. If you don't want to quit, you can only go forward with your head. Come and tie the rope We are on the waist," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are moving slower. Siegel opened the long whip - this is the longest weapon on his body - constantly slamming the ground and walls in the direction of the road, using fierce heavy blows to explore the road. In the passage, the sound of "啪啪" reverberated, and it continued to oscillate. In the end, it turned into a roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the channel is not infinitely extended, they soon saw the end. A round metal door gradually appeared in the light, decorated with a faucet pattern that was broken by an axe. A ruby-sized ruby ​​is decorated in the sky at the corner of the pattern, symbolizing the position of the sun. The axe was thrown from the sun and killed the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lower half of the pattern, the blood made of silver flows from the broken skull of the dragon and converges on the keyhole below the round door. It was a small palm-shaped tray, written in the Mora dwarf language: "The dragon blood of the contributor, the true blood of the ruler." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarves are a society that pays great attention to bloodlines. Their power is hidden in the blood and passed down from generation to generation. The slang that is born as a blacksmith is The dwarf prepared. So the dwarf believes that the true king must be a family of blood, "Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come this door?" Janet asked: "Where is the blood of the dwarf royal family? Did you mention it in Jakun’s travels?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mentioned that he invented a bloody key to pass this gate, but I have a better way." Siegel pulled out of his backpack A small bottle, about one finger long, containing a dark red semi-solidified body. "This is the blood of the red dragon. I have collected several bottles and I want to keep the casting materials. Since you can use the dragon blood of the contributors, just try it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
