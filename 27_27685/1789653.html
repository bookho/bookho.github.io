			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel first took out an obsidian dagger with no smudges on it. WwW.XsHuoTXt.com "How should this dagger be used?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." When Reese spoke, his eyes were slightly wrinkled and he was noticed by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Understood, I will change one." Siegel raised his hand and it seemed that he was going to cast a spell. Rees quickly waved his hand, he did not have much soul fragments to split, and each reduction would cause him heavy damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't, I said." Rees said, "There are four obsidian daggers, the function is exactly the same, that is, the ability to seal the dagger. For example, choosing a seal element casting method is equivalent to an anti-magic force field. Each time you need to consume a limited wish scroll, or someone can cast this spell yourself. And you have to choose the right ability, but also the language of limited wish. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What if I say seal power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of God will fall, But not all of them will be sealed, only those half gods and saints will be turned into ordinary people in the body structure." Rees said, "I have never known how to use it after I got this dagger, until I use it to kill it. Killing a lamp god, using the core of the lamp god to activate it. Although this dagger is strong, I am not very likely to use it, so I gave it to the saint of the murder god. Only in the hands of a special assassin can he play the most. The role of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wishing limit common technique is a magical spells, can create many magical effect, Alchemy package as was used for producing image and magic genie or the like. Simpler bodies, such as clay figurines, can only be made with earth cores, but larger figs such as the Goblin and Iron Golem require limited wishing to give life and intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has always had the idea of ​​making a lamp god, so he is also very concerned about limited wishing. There are not many transcripts of limited wishing spells left by the Federation, but who is called Lion King Alexander is a powerful general teacher? There are three limited wishing scrolls in Siegel's space bag. It can be used for one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second question, where is the training and healing facility of the Temple of Murder?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I have not been to, so I don't know." Rees is also simply. Answer immediately. "I only know that there is a transmission array at this base. The former wounded from the Elven Forest left from there. Siegel. Are you going to avenge the elves? They just set off in the New World." Can you trust them in the war against humanity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, since they started the war, I no longer trust them. But what I am best at is to bring the disaster to someone else's head." Siegel took the dagger and put it together with a limited wish scroll. "There is always a solution to the hatred between the elf god and the murder god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish you success." Rees said, "What else is wrong? Ask together, I don't want to let my soul fragments leave for too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last is not a problem. It's a request, I want all the spells that record you. "Handbooks for alchemy, magic books are also available."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a bit too much." Rees said, "There is my lifelong knowledge and experience, how is it possible?" To you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first two souls of yours are also said this way, but the latter two want to understand and confess, but unfortunately they say no The same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese hesitated for a while, and finally collapsed his shoulders and sighed "You will get it anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and pointed to the lab wall Shelves, piled up there with some plant roots, animal bones and minerals. "There is a dark space behind the third row of shelves. The secret language is 'transported by blood', which is my two magic books and three test notes. You want to take it, but don't damage it. This is the mage. "The minimum respect with the Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I agree with this." Siegel walked over and opened the secret, and took it out. The few books were quickly stuffed into the space bag. When Rees saw this scene, his eyes were almost blind. As soon as he was struck, a blood rushed to his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel descended and held the defensive staff and smiled back. "The answer is simple. Because it is not the spiritual world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here... here is true The world, I am not a soul fragment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not. I have not yet been able to completely control your voice quietly. I have not yet mastered the cutting soul. Skills, so everything is a scam." Siegel clap. Say, "I used some of Knox's commonality as an aid. But it's the contradictions in your own heart. You think you are strong, but the Siegel you imagine is stronger than you. On the other hand, you feel inferior because of the immaturity of the Glue Warrior spell, and you have doubts about your true strength. The result is an illusion in your heart that Siegel is much smarter and stronger than you, and what a spell is a glance. You can understand, what means you can come in. You lose to your own imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, I am really alive!" Reese rushed to the crown, and two blood and tears flowed out of her eyes, apparently on the verge of madness. "Being played by a junior in the applause, I still have a question and answer, and I handed out the magic book, I really lost my old face!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anger Will make your spell have a bigger loophole," Siegel deliberately continued to irritate him and said, "Although you have no chance of winning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No wins!? Ah? What is no victory!" Reese waved his arm, summoning the power of the element, forming a whirlpool of spells in front of him. There is a crazy killing in the whirlpool, and the most violent magical energy is attached to this killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has almost no movement, just erecting an ice wall barrier in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you still laughing at me? Use an ice wall to block my spells? This little ice wall will break immediately under impact, what is the role? "I can't get it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I use it because it breaks and spreads the impact of the explosion." Siegel raised his hand to point to Said to Rees, "How long have you been paying attention to yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Body...?" Rees turned and looked at the four that had begun to expand. The elemental polymer is not far behind him. The vortex of the elements that they gather together is attracted by the polymer, just like adding energy to it. The explosion was inevitable and he tried to wrap himself with the strongest protective spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is already late. The power of the explosion instantly destroyed the ice wall and slammed Serge back into the wall. He uses the gas element as a cushion to slow down the impact and blow away the wreckage of the ice wall. Lightning and acidity filled the room, and everything turned into pieces, splashing like raindrops. The walls of the lab were black and cracked, and the ground was full of colorful flames. The radiant light made Siegel cast a strange and inexplicable shadow on the broken wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental defense matrix surrounding the lab reached its limit, because the explosion exceeded the level of the ordinary magic spell experiment, so there was already power to escape. How long will it take someone to check it out? Since the god of murder does not have many magic users and lacks transmission, Siegel estimates that there should be two or three minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was unscathed because the battle was in his plan and there was nothing unexpected about it. In the conversation with Rees, he got his intelligence information, and by reading his scrolls to know his spell characteristics, plus the pre-arranged magic array, he was unintentional. Siegel’s original strength is higher than that of Rees, and the natural victory is at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rees still stands in the position of the caster just now, the whole body is black, and the blue smoke is constantly being burned, just like being baked, but the real fatal injury is in his On the back. The elemental polymer blasts off all the skin behind him and burns the internal organs. If you can survive in such a situation, then he can be considered a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the room that was completely destroyed, and everything in Rees was destroyed. But it is not a pity, because the most important harvest for the Master is already in his space bag. Magic items, except artifacts, can be made. The only difference is the cost. Only thought and wisdom are invaluable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the explosion somewhat exceeds Siegel’s expectations, but the reason is also clear that the spell that Rees finally used strengthens the power of the elemental aggregate. Siegel thinks about it. It is not appropriate to call this unstable structure of the explosion a polymer. It should be given a new name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
