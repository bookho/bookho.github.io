			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan struggled to block, but because the ankles were stuck together, he couldn’t open the attack of Jarrell. Without the cooperation of the pace of the body, the one-handed sword of the light armor is more threatening than the strong warrior wrapped in the heavy armor. He quickly fell into the wind, but he could still remain undefeated by relying on a quick sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel fears that other spells will accidentally injure Evan, so use the most accurate attack spell: Magic Missile. The black flaming energy ball hits Jarrell accurately, and he has five holes in him. But in less than two seconds, as the mucus that makes up the body squirms quickly, he has recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it hurts." Jarrell said deliberately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His intentions became very obvious, that is, constantly close to Evan, it is best to stick with him. The viscose-like body seems to have no vitality, and its resilience is superb, so Jarrell can change his injuries and stick to the battle with a short sword. Evan tried to pull his feet out a few times, but just got his calves in, and the situation became more complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gasifying agents!" Siegel said: "You are out of the fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan frowned, blocking the short sword, and then turned around and slashed a wrist of Jarrell with a bonfire. The black hand holding the short sword fell to the ground and immediately became a "dough" that was constantly creeping and crawled toward its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw it all, but Evan didn't pay attention. His long sword draws another circle, killing Jarrell's short sword and stabbing into his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no familiar feeling on the hand. The "bonfire" did not touch the bones and internal organs, but it felt like it was inserted into a pool of mud. The attack that should have been deadly has failed, and Jarrell seems to have nothing different, still with a strange smile. He licked Evan's martial arts and bit his mouth open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan blocked his teeth with a long sword, and then his shoulders violently pumped out. "Is it difficult for your teeth to be made of mud?" With Evan's roar, more than a dozen crystal-clear but broken teeth flew out and slammed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short sword stabbed into Evan’s right shoulder, bloody. At this time, his long sword was stuck by the black mucus body and could not be pulled out for a time. The creeping hand on the ground climbed into the body of Jarrell. Reconnect to your wrist. Evan has only one empty hand available, and there is no way to block it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pharmacy! Fast!" Siegel once again urged Evan to withdraw, and he threw his hand in the sky and threw it in the sky. Air spell ball. Two thick blue transparent arms stick out of the spell ball. Hold the cuffs firmly and be ready to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel uses the index finger to index the index finger, the middle finger to the middle finger, and the opposite thumb to form a diamond shape, in which Jarrell is framed. He read the spell and a white light shot from the palm of his hand. Photographed on the assassin's black body. Followed by the beam, there is a flame ray to follow, leaving three wounds on the body of Jarrell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black mud is flowing, and the flame is extinguished by wrapping. He squinted at the white light on his body, and this light did not cause any harm to him except for a trace of heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the arm of the air plucked the trigger and began to continuously emit the plasma, which relied on the white light emitted by Siegel as a guide.弩矢 is fast and accurate, and the frequency of launch is much higher than ordinary people. In just a few seconds, thirty 弩 all shot. Half of Jarrell's body is like a porcupine, and there are only half of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan also took out the gasification agent with his free hand at this time, and as soon as he drank his head, his body gradually began to become transparent. Jarrell made a cruel laugh, and the two short swords stabbed at the same time: "Ready to die, Swordsman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is faster, from him The fingertips shot a lightning bolt that covered the arrow in the body of Jarrell. The plasma sputum will become very unstable after leaving the protection of the ammunition, and will collapse after a period of time, thus releasing a powerful plasma. Of course, it is also possible to use the method of active destruction to prompt the destruction of the company. Produce subsequent effects faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plasma bursts with a green flash, and the impact and heat will blow Yarrell down. Even Evan, who floated in midair, was affected, and was suddenly blown out, hitting the stone wall and restoring the original shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isn't it still dead?" Evan swayed and stood up against the wall. The impact of the previous one caused a great shock to the gasified body, and it was difficult to completely eliminate it. He saw his long sword fall to the side and called him back to his hand with a hook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a stone on the sword, and Evan’s wrist was shaken and it fell. I didn’t hit the rock just now. Isn’t the long sword always stuck in the chest of Jarrell? suddenly. Evan understands the truth of the matter: no matter how strange Arrell's ability is, he still can't escape the spell of using elemental power, and naturally he will be restrained by the devil's sword. Just want to play the effect, you need to wait for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gravel that fell on the ground fell into dregs, but it did not become a creeping clay, and naturally it would not wriggle. "As long as there is a way to restrain yours, nothing in the world is invincible!" said Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel noticed something else. The ability of the Devil Sword to counteract magic and all spells, almost all of the elements related to the ability can not play a role in it, then how does Evan summon the sword to his own hands? The thought was as white as it passed, and it flashed through the mind of Siegel, and then was overwhelmed by the thought of how to continue fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan retired from the distance, so Siegel’s wrists turned over and the flames burst out in the flat! After the light, the stones on the ground burned red, and the body of Ariel had a black smoke. He screamed in pain, his arms like a whip smacking around, trying to put out the flames on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not stop casting, his other hand was claw-shaped, and he grabbed it forward. Another fireball flew over, and after the dazzling light, the strong airflow blew the mage's hem, and also danced with his black hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yarell's clay has only a small beach left, and the rest are missing. Siegel’s heart was full of warnings, and the hair behind his neck stood upright, clearly showing a cold feeling of metal. He had no time to cast any doors, so he rolled forward. A white light passed through the place where the mage had just stood, but only a few bundles of hair were cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yariel came out of the shadows and still held two short swords in his hands. He couldn't see the traces of the attack that had just been attacked. There were no holes in the plasma, no wounds burning in the fireball, and it seemed to be restored. However, his size is a little smaller than before, although he is still the same height but has become even thinner. This change naturally did not escape the observations of Siegel and Evan. They all thought together: Maybe this is the way to destroy the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Siegel recited the spell, Ariel’s eyes closed and disappeared from the front of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sound, no wind, this assassin must have made another impact! Where will he appear? Siegel's intensive dance technique cannot cover both the Master and the King at a distance, and each has a visual blind spot for itself. So Siegel stared at Evan, and Evan was concerned about Siegel. The two had a tacit agreement with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At your feet, dodge backwards!" Evan yelled and rushed over with a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel ordered the defensive staff to "not move", then slammed it to use the force, and at the same time used the pace of the elf, and instantly broke out the speed, After three flashes in three positions. Jarrell’s double-swords were only a few milliseconds, and the results were all in the air, without any effect. Now that Siegel has become an empty hand, so his hands cast spells together, and the spells are eager and strong, greatly speeding up the speed of magic construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of transparent palms made up of force fields are pushed out and slammed into Jarrell, and their strength is no less than the full strength of the siege hammer. hit. Even if it is strong and tall, like a giant in the hill, these "flying palms" can knock him over and then press it on the stone wall. Jarrell knew that he could no longer pull away from the Master, so he gritted his teeth and stared at the trajectory of the flying slap attack, then softened his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transparent palm flashed past and took two pieces of clay from the body of Jarrell, and slammed it on the stone wall. The two holes hung in the chest of Jarrell, the arms turned a full circle, and then the swords in the eyebrows were staggered. Then there was a blood-red emblem on his forehead, the sacred god of the murder god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the injury to his chest was restored to the original, and then a wave of light emanating from the center of the emblem, forming a cover, covering a radius of five meters, naturally Also included Siegel into it. Before Evan rushed to the light wave, he slammed into it. It is clearly a layer of light, but it is as strong as a wall, and the broken sword can not be broken for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
