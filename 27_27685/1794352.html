			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the ground paved with yellow sand, it was watched by 10,000 pairs of eyes. It turned out to be this feeling. Siegel untied his cloak and left it with his hands. Naturally someone would help him pick it up. The dust of the star slaps gently on the side of the thigh, and seems to be anxious to show off himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol's gas element received an order to stop the surrounding winds. There is only one flag around the racecourse that can dance, and that is the black nine-claw squid flag. Under the command of Heim's Guard, the knights who were preparing for the next game took the horse back to the side and could not get close to the center of the duel field. Although they did not know what happened in the stands, the news spread throughout the contest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a burst of noise and noise, there is only one sound in the venue. Ten thousand throats shouted: "Heim collar! Heim collar!" cheer for Siegel. The swaying fists and the cheering cheers swept the earth like a storm, and surrounded Siegel like a wave. He is like returning to the warm ocean of summer, and the feeling of the waves like the palm of his hand makes him comfortable, comfortable and familiar. He opened his arms and turned around in the same place. It seemed that he was going to hold this cheer in his arms. Siegel felt that he did not need to participate in the sword game, which is enough for him to recollect his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witt Griffin has no ability to cast any door, he only crowded the crowd and came down from the podium. In this case, it is inevitable that the person next to him will intentionally or unintentionally hinder his progress. Even if he was jealous, he did not reach out to help. The Griffin family twice provoked the squid family in public, which has caused everyone's dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally jumped to the sand and took a step forward. A snoring came and then spread the entire venue. Witt rushed to wear a helmet and put a cover to cover his blushing expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel lowered his arm. Draw out the dust of the star, take a sword flower on the side of the body, and then put the sword in front of you. In accordance with the etiquette of ordinary knights. He waited for Griffin to take out the weapon and then lowered the tip of the sword and said, "Come on. Let us solve this matter as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witt Riffin completed the action of the ceremony first, then crossed the sword in front of him and approached Siegel in a defensive posture. He mobilized his body muscles to maintain balance and watched carefully that Siegel was afraid of the tiniest movements. This is a very safe tactic. If it was in the past, Siegel would watch with great interest and then applaud his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what he thinks in his mind is something else: this kind of fighting rhythm is enough to take out the explosive gun. He opened more than twenty holes in him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The era of swords is over, and now it is time to enjoy the last beauty at dusk. Siegel took a deep breath and slowly exhaled, then sprinted to Griffin with a sword. The long sword collided with the long sword and announced the beginning of the battle with a bang. It took only two seconds for the two swords to collide with each other six times. It seems that no one is prepared to retain strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witt Griffin is a good guy in swordsmanship, attack and defense are balanced, and people have enough patience to never rush. Try to minimize the possibility of making mistakes. Siegel also adopted a steady and steady strategy, using the footwork to adjust the center of gravity, shoulders like a boat driving on the waves. Have a rhythmic ups and downs to save your physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First the Cavaliers’ ceremonial swordsmanship was only speeded up at least twice as fast, with a bit more exquisiteness and less elegance. Then there is the castle sword method that is common in the kingdom of the stars. The movement of the blade is driven by the movement of the whole body, and it is not limited to standing in a fixed place to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of sword skills Siegel is very skilled, this is his first systematic study of martial arts, has long been deeply engraved in the bone marrow. Segal blocked every attack of the opponent. Always maintain your own advantages and master the battlefield rhythm. Just now, Witt’s momentum has gone. How do you become a procrastination after dozens of rounds? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel will definitely win," Janet said. "Everyone knows. Griffin is not his opponent at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless the Lord of the Lord has other plans." Mana frowned. "It seems that the Lord is somewhat absent-minded. Is there anything that bothers him?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Janet shook her head: "His life has been very regular in recent times, and his mood is very good. No one has troubled him except the Griffin family. Her brow suddenly wrinkled and her hand touched her belly. She thought of what the pastor Ryder had said, but that should be a secret, did Reid tell Siegel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is it that the second bet leaked the news? Compared to Rhett, the konjac is bigger than the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heim collar! Heim collar!" As the tsunami-like shouts brought her thoughts back to the field, Witt's left shoulder was already bloody. He stepped back to avoid Siegel's sword. The leader of Heim was standing on the sand with a sly squat, and the blood of the star dust dropped three blood beads, and then re-cleaned as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you going to use the castle sword technique until the final defeat?" Siegel’s next words made Witt Griffin unable to understand. "If this is my last performance as a swordsman, at least I have to get the power of my strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witt bite his teeth and insert the long sword On the ground, tear off his sleeves and tie the wounds of his shoulders. There is a chance to rest in the duel, you can change weapons or deal with wounds. Siegel waited for him like this, quiet as a sculpture. But under his robes, the weak current is massaging the muscles, keeping the body in top condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin did not pick up the sword again, but took out a long shot. The gun body is extended by docking, and finally has a length of more than two meters. This should be the weapon used on the back of the gryphon, and its use is only known to the Griffin family. Only the lions and beasts are available to the kingdom of the stars, but there is never a gryphon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to increase the scope of the threat and destroy him when the enemy is still unable to pose a threat. The goblin musket is also such a design idea, they are no doubt farther than the knights on the wall of the thunder wall. Maybe after a few decades, everyone will mention the gun. It refers to the kind of thing that uses explosives to launch a projectile, not the metal tip on a long pole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenger screamed and rushed up. The tip of the gun aimed at Siegel's chest. As he stepped on the ground, the gun swayed. The tip of the gun is circled in the air, threatening the throat and the armpit. This is a very threatening method, especially when it is displayed on the back of the gryphon. The Griffin itself has sharp claws and sharp knives. It dives faster than the gas element, and with the shaking of the gun tip, it is really difficult to defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But relying on people's legs, where is the speed of the gryphon? Not to mention the claws and shackles here. Siegel swayed to the right and turned back to the left. But use the wizard's pace and then return to the right direction with a faster speed. At the same time, his shoulders and navel are still pointing to the left. This weird posture makes Witt completely unaware of how to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhythm of the swaying of the rifle is in the grasp of Siegel, and there is a good response to this weapon dwarf combat technique. He easily avoided the tip of the gun, and an acceleration came to Witt. The young Griffin family knight only saw a flower in front of him, and he punched a punch on the helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunken face protects his nose, but it also covers his sight. As he moved sideways, he reached out and raised his visor. With the strength of the long sword and the knee, Siegel cut off the place where the rifle was connected. He grabbed the end with the gun, and he had to throw it at Griffin. When I raised my hand, I changed my mind and threw it to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s time for you to surrender." Siegel said seriously: "Young people, there are not many opportunities."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is clear and bright. It has spread throughout the contest - which of course depends on the power of magic. For a time, the venue was full of shouts of "surrender! Surrender!" Siegel smiled and used this method to push Witt Griffin to a dead end. Now the choices facing the challenger are very clear, either immediately confessing to surrender, or only one dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he waits for a while to scream for surrender, it’s too late, and Siegel can kill him directly without being accused. There is no weapon in his hand, and the long sword that has just been inserted on the ground is closer to the opponent. If he takes a dagger from his body - this is one thing the Cavaliers will always do on the battlefield, but in the duel there is no act of honor and grace. It is no different from assassination. Siegel does not have to be constrained by pure martial arts and swordsmanship. His spell power is enough to kill opponents thousands of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witt looked at the broken rifle in his hand. Throw it on the ground. Then he stood up straight. I took off my helmet. The helmet of the lion beast head is rolled on the ground and covered with sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a ruthless request." Witt said: "I still have the power to fight, I want to use the sword again. You are a noble lord. Please allow me to enter the knight for the last time to show martial arts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
