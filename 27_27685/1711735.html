			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next door to the storage room is an empty row of small rooms with a lot of bunk beds. In the past, it might be a underground barracks for guards. . At the end of these rest rooms, a thick door was blocked, and on the other side of the wall was a striking sign with a "canteen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The canteen has been converted into a kitchen by the trolls. When Siegel gently pushed the door open, he saw the trolls smashing their meat with their hands. The man who had been sent from the slide had been dismembered, his arms and legs were placed in a wooden barrel, and his body and head were on the meat board of the trolls. There is also a special bucket under the chopping board to pick up the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s stomach was so painful that he couldn’t help it, and wowed it out. He held the door frame and barely was knocked down by this bloody scene. The trolls saw Siegel and laughed happily: "Adding meals? And you don't have to clean the internal organs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster directly uses the hands of humans Throwing the sword is like smashing an ordinary flying knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel felt threatened and quickly jumped back and closed the door. The two-handed sword slammed into the thick door panel, about half of the blade penetrated and the other half stuck outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the hole in the door, Siegel saw that the trolls were charging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He threw the door and began to run away, rushing to the campfire room. The door of the canteen became a fragment in the bang, and even the entire underground barracks trembled. The trolls shouted at the back: "I want to hear the story, I want to eat you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel jumped into the campfire room and took a small break from the waist The bag is in your hand. He did not return, and ran to the passage behind the corner. The trolls didn't think too much, and they rushed in. He felt that his foot was awkward and he was caught by a rope. The huge trolls lost their balance and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel then turned back from the corner, and the bag on his hand was slammed on the ground, causing a pile of iron beads to roll on the ground. The trolls want to stand up, but his feet are always slippery, and he can only climb slowly in slow motion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These iron beads were brought by Leah Master Jean Jeff to train Siegel's balance ability, and the results were all used in the trolls. The balance of the infinite monster is not good. He doesn't dare to turn around or move too fast, otherwise he will fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has adapted to this environment during training and will not cause much impact. He initially knew the weakness of this monster by fighting with the last troll. In the dance-like knives, Siegel always starts with the fragile blood vessels and tendons. Even if the trolls have extraordinary resilience, he can't suck the blood out. The broken tendon further slows down the action of the monster and forms the fighting advantage of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the trolls’ ankles is also tied to the barrel by a rope, which makes it move like a heavy anchor. Siegel cut off the scimitar first, then took the rusty sword on the wall and continued to attack. After a few hundred rounds, he finally turned the trolls on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinister squint eyes, motionless, basically no blood from his latest wounds - all are exhausted in battle It is. Siegel dragged his two-handed sword and stood next to the shoulders of the trolls. He tried to lift the giant sword and cut off the monster's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment the knife fell, the trolls suddenly moved. He grabbed the fragments of the bottle at hand and slammed it into Siegel's ribs. The pain made Sigel's body shock, but he still gnashed his sword. The head of the trolls rolled down aside, and Siegel’s right armpits were all blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, wearing a chain armor, the broken bottle just pierced the skin and did not hurt the internal organs. Siegel tore off his trousers, pressed the wound and made a simple dressing. Then he kicked the trolline head into the fire and then walked back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took a lot of effort to get back to the hotel. At the door, he saw Sir Bill being prepared for the horse, and Master Lia was fully armed to set off. The elf first saw Siegel, exclaimed, and rushed to help him. The jazz hugged him directly. Siegel only felt a moment of relaxation and then passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Bill was sitting in the chair next to the room, and the letter that Siegel grabbed was placed on the side of the table and opened. The jazz looks very heavy and the clouds are dense. He looked out the window without saying a word until Leah came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about Siegel? Will he be alright?" The eager asked eagerly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, he's fine, now take a good sleep, there won't be anything." Lia comforted him and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a good boy. You look at the half-knife he got back, it’s hard to imagine what kind of battle he has experienced.” Sir Bill shook his head, then Said: "I was shocked to see the papers he left behind, and actually went to find the trouble of the trolls. This is a curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is driven by the sense of justice, you really find a good apprentice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, he is not my apprentice, but the knight is obedient. He wants I took the Cavaliers title from me." Sir Bill said to the elf: "You are his master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is you also calculating dwarves and Big fool?" Leah thought of two other good friends and laughed involuntarily. She said: "The big fool doesn't really need to count, just ask him to eat. The dwarf is very steady and won't listen to you casually. But I can provoke him, every time he is fooled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jazz still has no expression, his thoughts are not on the things that the elves said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leah discovered this and went forward and picked up the letter. The letter was short, but there was a conspiracy inside. The plan was initiated by the Visa of the Fort, and was shot by the eater, and was related to the life of His Royal Highness Prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This doesn't make sense!" Lia frowned and said: "The Statt family is from the kingdom of stars, and the Visa is always trying to restore the title of the count." "The prince of Bajie is too late, how can he murder him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This reason is too far-fetched, but this is itself a serial scheme." Sir Bill said slowly. : "Because things are too strange, they will lead people's delusions. No matter whether this is unsuccessful, the prince of Chila will be pushed to the forefront. Who is the enemy of the Visa of this land?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn’t it always our elf?" Leah said with amazement: "We will not use the evil means of planting and blaming! Only humans do this." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I know, I know you. But people in the hub city don't understand. Even if there is no war, the relationship between the elf and the place will be greatly strained. Sir Bill analyzed: "If the prince is dead, the hub will definitely be overturned." The new forest of your elves is also difficult to escape from the flames; if the prince does not die, the Visa will also avoid the suspicion of marching into the new forest. In these two cases, there is only one place to benefit from the end - deep water city."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the relationship between Sham Shui Po and this?" Lia did not understand. "You guys' conspiracy is too complicated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I think this is too complicated, not a bit like real." Sir Bill揉揉 揉揉 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ Why did the trolls play under the Viscount's castle, and what role did Kira-Start play?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me catch my breath, just take me It’s dead.” Leah moved her chair and poured it in. "I now understand why the Eileen dwarf always feels that you are in trouble. I feel this way now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short silence, Sir Bill said: "There is only one viable option at the moment - I am going to find a guard in the morning to protect the safety of the prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going with you." Lia Respond immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you took Siegel to find Elinte, and stayed at Longshi Cliff before the Lunar New Year. I have a knight and act. It will be more convenient. And I know that there is a contradiction between the Visa and the Elves, and you should not appear. Don’t tell Siegel about this matter, just say that I am holding a letter to find important people, and you will leave Hubburg as soon as possible. It is best to go tonight. If all goes well, I will meet you as soon as possible. Remember not let the dwarf swallow my share!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
