			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candlestick on the table is long gone, the fire in the fireplace is flashing, but most of the bedroom is shrouded in the dark. Siegel stayed at the bed and quietly looked at the sleeping son and re-covered the quilt as he kicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides becoming a lich, this is a rare way for Siegel to stay calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immersed in magical learning can also achieve ideological calm, but that would make the spirit too concentrated, not conducive to thinking about problems. Siegel needs to plan the next move and arrange everything. Peace is hard-won and needs to be cherished, and the foundation of this peaceful establishment is very stubborn. The threat of the elf has not been completely eliminated, but after having four hundred hostages, a fragile balance has been established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, he does not believe in the Elf Saint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the spokesperson of the race god, he has absolute authority among the elves. He is both a warrior and a mage and a pastor. All elves are his followers and people. If you are looking for a black man, it is not better to let the sorcerers, high-ranking priests, and legendary warriors in the elves come out. Why not find a human? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the angle, this thing seems to have a conspiracy, but this does not meet the character of the elf god. It is a kind, peaceful, and art-loving god. There are no bad things except that the thinking jumps too hard. And conspiracy, deception, and misinformation are more like the means of murdering God. How can it appear on the Elf Saint? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From all his current actions, there is no clue to any deception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement between the elves and humans has been basically confirmed. Mana, as the leader of Heim, represents Drey Uther and Brown Lester. The Southern Lords Alliance and the Elves have a truce. Although the agreement has not yet been finalized, things on the battlefield are over. Both humans and elves have begun to return to their homes. On the main road, you can often see the humans who are pushing the car home and the elves who are marching forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim’s collar is still not released, and armed soldiers monitor every armed person passing through the territory. The cavalry patrol day and night on the border line, both to prevent the robbers from entering the territory after the war, and to search for those who may be sacred believers. For the Knights of Heim, the war is not over, except that the enemies of the Ming have been taken care of. Now you have to deal with opponents hidden in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to show greater sincerity and build a good trust between humans and elves, the Elf Saints personally ran to inspect the four hundred elves who were detained. He asked the elves to meditate, think, and introspect, and honestly spent two years in Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years is only a short period of time for the elf's long life. However, it is enough for Heim to lead the situation, to build the territory, and to establish a close relationship through the road from east to west. Two years was much better than Siegel had expected. He accepted the goodwill of the Elves and brought him back to the city of Mire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental rune matrix and energy focusing lens of Heim's collar have no response to the entry of the Holy One. That is to say, Heim has no secret in front of the saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to meet the lich. The negative energy of his body makes me sick." The sage saint said: "If it wasn't for it, give it to you." You, and honestly hide from the crowd, I will definitely dispel him from the mortal world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander seems to feel threatened, built in the Elves When the magic array was gone, it was far away. Later, it left the Heim collar and went to the walled mountains. He is still studying how he can get into the top of the Mora, but he has encountered problems. Since he is the identity of the undead, in order to avoid being discovered, you cannot use any means of fanfare. But the general magic is useless in front of the forbidden grammar and the fine gold gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, there is a time when the Elf Saint is at Heim. Siegel always has a feeling of uneasiness. Because all his sense of security is maintained in the records of the Masters Association and on the basis of the other party's trustworthiness, in fact, they lack the corresponding counter-measures. If the Elves of the Elves have a bad thought, the whole Heim collar has no power to stop him, and the land he has created so hard will be destroyed and become a part of the Elven Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Siegel also understands that such speculation and doubt are unfair to the Elves. As a projection of the gods, his character and behavior are certain: that is, it is impossible to violate the characteristics of the god itself. But this also caused another worry for Siegel: The Holy One of the Elven God is here, the god of murder? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is still necessary to continue to enhance their magical power, at least to protect themselves. Whether it's looking for Janet, surrounded by Heim's collar or fulfilling his dream of exploring the world, Siegel can't relax for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic tower is being built on the east side of the castle. The transmission squad promised to be built on the square platform in front of the magic tower. Twelve Elf Masters from the Elven Forest “Art Institute” are setting the circle under the guidance of the Holy One. Learn from Siegel with knowledge that you have never touched before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official mage knows that there are countless other worlds in the universe, many of them have magic, and many have elves. All the world's elves will respect their racial gods and pray to him. So the elves in front of us actually have knowledge across multiple worlds. Only for some reason, he can only share a very small part, "to avoid too much influence on the world process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the real reason is This is not the case - Siegel's mouth is slightly upturned - "The spark of wisdom is the most precious treasure in the multiverse." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the eyes of the raven, he knew that the magic array had started construction again. The elves have a long life and only need four hours a day to rest enough, so they can work non-stop. Fortunately, these sharp-eared guys like art more than work, otherwise the world will not be what it is now, and humans will have a foothold? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel once again covered the quilt for the child, calling the raven to look after him and go to the magical field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has a lot of questions to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the time when the Elf Saint was at Heim, Siegel was determined to understand all the secrets of the elemental surge. Decomposing matter into elemental energy, he keenly discovered the enormous potential contained therein. The elves love nature, so they thought about how to transport the water to the mountains and make a spectacular waterfall. But when Siegel saw the waterfall, he thought about how to use the impact. Drive your own waterwheel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Saint is a very strict person who never directly reveals any answers to Siegel, but he will say which books can be found in the clues. After getting along for a few days, Siegel has already used him as a living book catalog. Used to retrieve the knowledge you need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it takes more time to find and mine the answers afterwards, in a short period of time, such an approach can ask a lot of questions. This kind of learning method has never been seen before, and the elf mage who has experienced all the vicissitudes of life is amazing. Not only the questions related to the elemental surge matrix, but also the problems accumulated in the magical learning are all mentioned by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Strych's "Plastic Energy Spell Special", you should read it." The Elf Saint is busy with the things at hand. Answer Siegel's question. He can actually finish a sentence in the gap between the chanting spells, without affecting the effect of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, are these things drawn from Deepwater City? How do I see a lot of materials for building elemental surges?" The person pointed to the mercury bottle on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all mercury, don’t fall into me.” Siegel shrugged his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s still silvery white from the outside, but it’s not pure mercury, it dissolves some silver powder and aluminum powder. This formula is used for element surges. The squad, and I know that there are quite a few stocks of this thing outside of Sham Shui Po. Wouldn't you say that this is a coincidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coincidence is not God's Realm? I can only call it a plan at most.” Siegel found that other elf wizards were paying attention to the conversation here, so he quickly shifted the topic: “How about the murder god’s whereabouts?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint refers to the top of the head. Helplessly said: "There is no result for the time being. You also know that this world is only a small one in the world where there are thousands of elves. To find the murder god, the importance of this matter must be back. Please wait patiently." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I bear with my heart?" Siegel said: "Janet may be still there, because she is overwhelmed by the reincarnation. She will panic." Are you scared? Will it be discovered by those people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, do you really know your wife?" The Elf Saint snorted. Said: "She has been trained and experienced more dangers than you. Don't think that you will be magical and you will be less than others!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
