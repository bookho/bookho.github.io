			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS. Presenting today's update, by the way, pull the ticket to the "Starting Point" 515 Fan Festival, each person has 8 tickets, and the voting also sends the starting currency. I beg you to support and appreciate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tacit understanding between the scorpions. If it is not by the help of the twenty-faced scorpion, I am afraid that Siegel will never be able to crack the ring. The newly acquired Eye of Competency Analysis can observe and help record all the details, and can also summarize these details as a whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writer's technique is very advanced, but it is completely different from the eight-faced scorpion, and the difference between them is very obvious. Siegel uses this to determine where to change from what area. If the legendary spell is the maximum height that the caster can achieve in his life, then the writer's technology applied to the Lord of the Rings is no simpler than the legendary spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the end, Siegel can only adopt the method of deceiving items, and push the genre of Dwarf Dingbao’s magic to advance on the ring of the Lord of the Rings. Superimpose a layer of the array. Thus, the combination of the god of the creation god, the technology of the writer and the magical array of Siegel finally enabled this magical item to function. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writer looks for other scorpions through the characteristics of the scorpion. Siegel wants to find the godhead and divine power hidden by the magic god, and also needs the same source to do Reference, this is why he must get the flesh and blood of Lear. He used the opportunity to open the magical array to deal with the goblin and approached him. He used the study as a cover and used cloning as an excuse. This misled Lill and made him not doubtful about the power of God. Of course, in other cases, even if there is no cloning, when you need Lear's flesh and blood, Siegel will try to get the Master's showdown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since pure flesh and blood, Siegel identified twelve general directions, where the power of Lear appeared. However, Lear's clones brought him an unexpected joy. The fragments of the Mother of the Earth made the clones have a divine character, similar to a saint. When Siegel used this clone as a standard, he found eight orientations. Only one of them coincides with the first twelve positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is Sigel’s goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Siegel has been in this place called Gima for two days, looking around for possible clues. Siegel used the Lord of the Rings in a deceptive manner and could not position it very accurately. Therefore, you can only measure the environment with your footsteps. He strolled through the mountains, the rivers and the valleys, and found no specific signs. Not to mention the hidden godhead, he could not find a cave more than ten meters deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a historic castle town in the territory of the Starry Kingdom, which is 600 miles away from the Star King. Stay away from all kinds of wars and troubles. The Maribor family has always ruled here. They are known for their diligence, honesty and lack of passion. They have never had a strong or intelligent person. They are mediocre, incompetent, but live peacefully here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country fields here are all opened up and planted with a variety of crops. The local specialty is a cyan grape that is used to make a bitter local red wine. Siegel looks at the farmland and plantations in the mountains and valleys. It is strange that such places that are often infested can be hidden if they can hide things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the power of God is placed here, the rule power contained in it will be very concentrated." The godhead is the foundation of the establishment of the kingdom of God, even if it is deliberately hidden. It should also be incompatible with the surrounding environment. Siegel looked for a long time and almost sniffed all the air around Jima, still not harvesting. He decided to calm down and think about it, so he decided to stop at the town of Jima. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At nightfall, he found a hotel called "All Come and Go" according to the index finger of the townspeople. The woodcarving brand was hung on the copper chain, and the weird name made him look more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hurry to enter, nor did he hand over the horse to Ma Tong. Although this is not a good horse, it is only after the transfer to Gima, they bought their spare horse from the passing caravan. But because I am now dressed as an adventurer. If you have a well-equipped outfit, you should take care of everything like a lone senior employer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse is almost full, and there are several strong mounts that are enough to be a military horse. Siegel looked at their troughs. It is a concentrate that adds soy beans and wheat bran. There are still a few fresh eggshell fragments on the ground, but no traces of egg liquid are found in the forage. Either the owner of the horse has personally fed it, or the little boy of the horse has stolen the egg himself, just throwing the shell on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
