			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Saint tears open the crack in the space and walks out of it. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM?壹?? Read a book·?k want a? Look at h?u?·? He and he looked at Ai Meng, said softly: "I heard your call. Children, don't be afraid, the elves will last forever. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone rushed to salute him, only Siegel looked serious and said to the elf saint: "Since you have come, then I want to murder the gods." Should the saints not be threatened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not fight with him, because that means the war is fully open. A race god and a concept god The battle between them is not that simple, so we will simply compare the level of divine power, and then the lower party will give in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, Chanem has left this stronghold?" Evan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chaney? Did he give himself a name?" The Elf Saint blinked and smiled: "This is an interesting thing, actually There is a saint who gives himself a name. It seems that the god of murder is not stable, which is one of his weaknesses. I will not destroy this Chanem, he has other uses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved his hand and inserted it into the dialogue between the two people, saying: "The murder god also has a training ground and healing facility, connected to the transmission array here. Can you tell me? Where is the transmission array?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Slightly wait.” The Elf Saint closed his eyes and opened a few seconds later, then said to Siegel. "I sent you in the past, but you have to be prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What preparation?" Siegel just asked, and then felt the transmission. The pulling force of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power comes from the Elf Saint, and builds a safe and stable transmission channel. Siegel's gaze sweeps through the alienation of the transmitted spell, and at a glance he fully understands its structure and function. Has it improved so much? Siegel immediately denied the idea. It is also the knowledge and spell theory of the past. These are not all that can be improved overnight. What really changes is his ability to sense magic and elemental energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a sharpshooter. Although it does not improve the stability of the archery, it suddenly has the vision of the eagle, and everything is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only needs to raise his hand now, and it is easy to counter the transmission of the Elf Saint, but that is completely unnecessary.壹 Read the book·?k?a??h?u???? He took a deep breath. Let the transfer be done on your own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the murder god is about to evacuate, and their delivery has been carried out in several batches, using a lot of precious materials. The Holy One of the murderous god has come to the will, and the new great temple enters the latent state. The Solidarity Committee will also change its face and go to the old university for exhibition. They waited for Dorn while transporting high-value treasures that they had searched for many years. He is the theoretical core of the Solidarity and knows best how to establish and display Solidarity faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has not appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A space crack appeared in the transfer hall, and then a black-and-black mage flew out with a wand. Siegel glanced at the room. The 20-meter-square cave depicts complex runes that are completely different from the style of the Master's Teleport. He is also very knowledgeable, but for a time he can't see what the law is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he dared not destroy this array, and he could not attack with violent elemental magic. When Segal had a move, he suddenly changed his appearance. Under the eyes of the public, he became the Master of Reese, and then fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to withdraw, what are you waiting for?" His voice is also vivid: "If it were not for the requirements of the Holy One, I would not care for your life and death!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general pastor's ability to distinguish is not enough to see Siegel's deformation, not to mention the scattered spell fluctuations in his body also make the priests feel terrified. "Ress. What is the sage of the saints?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ensure that this does not fall into the hands of the elves, giving you the opportunity to make up for this waste." Hearing: "If you use transmission, I can save some strength, so why are you still not rolling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words have not been finished, and Siegel will start. What the wizard needs is just enough close to the array, so that the wall can be covered with the force field wall to protect the underlying pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the entire ground is covered by a layer of transparent force field, the transmission has lost its effect. How can these pastors not understand what happened? They waved weapons made up of flames and lightning. ? Read a book???k?a an important book?h?u· or directly summon the Thunder to attack. Siegel lifted the defensive staff and applied secondary spells to enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple of the murder god has always been small, and the new big lacks the precipitation of time, so it is impossible to have a strong pastor to sit down. The powers summoned by these divine power users in front of them are not a threat to Siegel. So he pulled out a powerful mad laughter rune hanging in the sky and then stopped paying attention to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knox mad laughter, or the strength of the Peaceful Faction, is strong, and the priests who were in a state of tension and fear continued to move and lost. Fighting, looking around in vain. I don't know what I want to do. Siegel said with a finger: "Go there and squat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man controlled by the spell walked over, kneeling on the ground, and then smiling very happy With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel began to look down on the circle of law at the foot of the study, trying to find the structural part of his own understanding. For a time, the surrounding war seemed to have nothing to do with him, and all his attention was focused on the magic runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't see it." A voice suddenly sounded and awakened Siegel. He looked up and the saint of the murderer was standing in front of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't leave? Are you ready to fight the Elf Saint?" The sorcerer's sorcerer's radiance continues to shine, and the attacking spell is his Pinch at your fingertips and feel excited at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to find my stronghold? Unfortunately, you made a mistake." Chanem went to the corner, swung his palm and cut off all the pastors. Head. The energy of the golden light drifted from their bodies and was pinched in his hands. "Now, no one here knows the location of the stronghold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is almost annoyed with a knife! I just put all my attention on the transmission array, and I forgot to ask those pastors who were controlled by the mind! This is a major mistake and may have ruined the entire mission! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Siegel understands that he can’t show an expression that is too excited at this time. The murderous god may not yet know the true purpose of the trip, and this is also a response between humans and elves, in response to the assassination of the previous period. As long as you don't show your feet, Janet's existence is still a secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The use of assassins has always been unpopular. For our safety, your strongholds will be paid one by one." Siegel said: "No. Looking down on my understanding, your law is not unbreakable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you have to have a life study." Chanem will put the gold in his hand. As soon as the ball of light is thrown, let them fly into the channel. "I am not here for a long time. I wish you a happy and happy life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, his figure gradually disappeared and left completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a painful scream in the passage. The crying cry of the heart made Siegel feel sympathy. However, it will obviously be an enemy in a while, but if it is a battle, it may destroy the scene of the transmission array. Siegel picked up the staff, left two large elements of water to guard, and then walked into the passage against the strange sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coming over a distorted human figure, his half body swelled like a balloon. It is then invaded by mold and becomes a twisted and tangled muscle structure. His half face is like a shoulder, and only one slit is left in one eye, and the other is protruding out. The prominent eyes continued to rotate like the eyes of a lizard, looking at the shape of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the only remaining clothes and features on his body, this should be Dorn, the leader of the Solidarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the one who the Holy One wants me to kill?" Dorn’s voice was accompanied by a snoring noise, and he raised his hand to the neck. After a few squats, it sealed the hole. "Like the great murder god. I am your faithful servant and tool, practicing your great will!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
