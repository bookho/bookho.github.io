			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's refocus our attention on Siegel, after all, he has been in the library for fifteen days. Under the record of his quill, there is already a thick stack of information. He found interesting clues about the dragon on the cliff and a later wizard. These are the legends that Elint mentioned, but there are indeed many supporting evidence to prove that this matter is not groundless. In addition to this, I also found some local songs, which contain some descriptions of monsters near Longshi Cliff. There must be a variety of exaggerations in the songs, so that they can scare the disobedient children, but they repeatedly mention some black and white monsters that can’t get in and out of the wall. They can pass through the wall and suck the living soul. Siegel was very interested in this, so he decided to continue to dig deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the library, the working dwarves have long known that there is such a human being reading a book here every day. This scene is very rare, so this matter was passed between the librarians and finally passed to the curator's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even at the dwarf's standard, curator Monka Petty is very old. In his long journey of life, he rarely heard of such things - young human lads focus on reading? So he decided to go down and see for himself. The entire library is his field, and with the help of some rune items, he can quietly approach each reader without alarming them. The curator picked up a recorded note and flipped it quickly and carefully. The more he saw it, the more surprised he was. Through the text here, he can very seriously feel that there is a hidden clue inside, which is the result of bold imagination and reasonable reasoning. Good researchers can make reasonable reasoning from history, and the best researchers dare to make bold imaginations. When the curator saw the hunter, he showed his figure and came to the opposite side of Siegel. He yelled at the rest of the young man’s rest and stopped him: “Can the child listen to me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy looked up and used the eternal flame The light only noticed the dwarf opposite. It was a kind old man, and it was easy to see how many years he had experienced. His skin is wrinkled, covered with age spots, his nose and cheeks are pulled down, and there is no hair on the dry scalp. Even if he is watered with beer all the year round, there is only a sparse cocoon on his chin. Although this describes some people who do not respect the old man, full of ridicule, but for Siegel, this is the oldest potato he has ever seen. The years have left countless scars on this old man, but they also give it a trait that others can't have, a pair of insightful eyes that are full of insight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say about the elderly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old dwarf puts his index finger on his mouth He made a sly gesture, and he gestured to Siegel to take his notes and come to the curator's office. After closing the door here, you can not affect others to study. The old man gestured to Siegel to sit down and then put himself down in a soft, large chair, a comfortable bang. The servant poured two glasses of wine so that the two could continue the previous topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw that you are sorting out the information on the Dragon and Lion Cliff. The child, it must be the diamond family's often troubled little devil to let you come! Don't use I looked at me with a strange look. I want to know that my duty is to record everything around me. This has become an instinct. Even though I am old, sometimes I can’t write a lot of words, but fortunately my eyes are still bright and my ears. It’s not awkward. Since you became a darling, your business has been recorded in history, so I can know that you have a good relationship with the diamond family.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at him with a puzzled look and said: "I didn't expect that I was so concerned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the devil, The benefits of the brave brave are not only this, you will slowly know later.” The old man said slowly, his eyes fell into his memory: “I still remember that five years ago, the diamond kid came to me and asked some questions. I also asked him to check the information for himself. In the end, he spent 3,000 gold coins to buy 3 words. These three words are called eclipse days.” The old man blinked, and some naughty said: “I believe that you should go again soon!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel didn't say anything, just took the cup and took a bite to avoid answering the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, little devil, it seems that you are a person who can manage your mouth. Can I expect you to continue to maintain this quality? I have a job, "You need a young person like you"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old gentleman, I have promised to help with some information, and the task is not finished yet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This thing is good for you, and I promise that it will not delay Elinette's adventure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;The curator shook his head, but there was no disappointment. He stood up and opened the door by himself, then stood at the door and said, "Well, boy, don't let me the old man miss your time, go ahead." When Siegel left the house, The curator grabbed his arm and shouted: "When you are free, don't forget to come see me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening, Sieg I told Elinte about this. The dwarf was very surprised, and asked carefully about the passing of the matter. He thought about the conversation that took place every time, and then said to Siegel, "You didn't promise that he was right. The longevity Monka is the Petit dwarf. It is an important member of the dwarf dwarf clan, and it has a certain influence on the whole of the Mora. Since the dwarf dwarf did not climb the summit ladder, it was not the leader clan, but they have been pursuing this leadership position. According to some sources, Monca is studying why the dwarves have masters, thereby increasing the influence of their clan. This radical idea has worried many dwarves. It is right if you are not blended with them."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He looks like a good person, I have this feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that's right. Irene nodded. "The curator is indeed a good person. He also saved my life on the battlefield. I remember that during the Battle of the Dabei River, the Petit dwarves fought side by side with our gem clan, their mission. Is a cover Wings, as a result, they directly faced the impact of the giants of the hills, suffered very large battle losses, and suffered heavy casualties. However, limited to military orders, we were unable to provide them with support, and they must sacrifice them to attack forward. The longevity Monca has been on the battlefield. On the stable front of the military array, we ensured that our flank was not lost. However, one of his sons and two grandchildren were killed in the battle. Later, the battle was won, but also caused a gap between the two clan. They have always felt that our gem family intends to weaken their power and is a conspiracy to rule the clan. I can only assure you that we don't mean it. But if there is no history, the scars are hard to make up."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it wrong to solve the problem? It's all dwarves, living in the same place." Siegel asked some questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, in fact, everyone understands this truth, but many times to revisit history, it is for things outside history - such as interests. Recently we have The Petty family is very stiff, they support the West Walker to challenge the ruling class. I am afraid that this radical approach will cause dissatisfaction of the Dwarf's patron saint and bring a crisis of division." Elinette paused for a while and put the ale in his hand. Drinking it, then it seems to have the strength to say: "Well, I am already a little bit more, you are going to rest! These annoying things are still for the elderly to consider. Remember, you will go to the library in the future, only half a day. It's okay. Come back every day at noon, I will train you in the afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyes are bright, his frostbite has already been good, I really want to have a good activity. "Is it a martial arts learning dwarf? Master Lia once told me that I borrowed the dwarf martial arts to exercise my strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not just The strength of exercise, boy, you will know in the afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, when entering the training ground, Siegel almost stopped, he Originally thought that this would be a one-on-one training between him and Elinette, but did not expect to have many dwarf children around, he counted a number of 12. These children are wearing iron armor, wearing helmets and holding wooden shields. The other hand is lifted up, a wooden stick, and a cloth bag tied to it. As their arms sway, the cloth shakes off the white. Dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene is standing next to the training ground with a sly, holding Siegel's gear in his hand. He was a little excited to say: "Come on the child, this is your training: put all these twelve little scorpions down! But if your face, kneel, be marked with a white mark, even if you fail; if your There are more than five white marks on the body and limbs, and you are defeated!” The dwarf threw a wooden shield and a wood machete on the ground, and then said: “Pick up your gear, let me see you follow Bill. The basis, and the extent to which the knives and steps of the elfology can be achieved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel picked up the weapon and just tied the shield On the hand, twelve dwarfs rushed up. They shouted in their mouths and waved wooden sticks like twelve wild wild boars. The dwarves regard this as the most fun game. Usually they all call each other. This time, they can join hands to deal with an outsider, so the little guys are enemies and everyone is rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel hurried back, using the light pace, flashed the most dangerous attacks. He tried to lengthen the formation and promote a one-on-one situation, but the training ground did not have enough space. He only stepped back five steps and found that the wall had been stuck behind him. Segel took the opportunity to jump over the wall and use the wizard's knives and heights to overturn the first dwarf and then kick the second opponent. But the dwarf is naturally strong and tough, and the dwarf is only slightly squatted. Instead, Siegel loses some of his weight. Then a wooden stick was pumped up against his nose, and a white ash was full of head and face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
