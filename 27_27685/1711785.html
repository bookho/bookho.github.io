			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel followed the rain, then came to the big house and found a corner to stand. This time many people in the house, mercenaries and jazz are gathered here. On the central table, the original food and drinks were withdrawn. Now there is a mercenary lying on it, and everyone points to him. Although the mercenary's hands and feet are still shaking, but a moist and cold breath is emitted from the body, just like a dead person. Siegel saw that his lips had turned purple, his eyes were gray, his nails were black, and he seemed to read it in the book, and he could not get rid of the power of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone is looking for the cause of death of this person, but there is no obvious scar on him. Someone in the house has already taken off his armor and rummaged in an inch. After waiting for a while, I found a pinhole from the heel of this person, the only wound in his body. This wound is neither bleeding nor red and swollen, so it is difficult to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who brought him back?" asked Sir Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He himself came out and fell down near the hole." The big head of an eagle hook nose said: "We have been waiting here for twenty days. The four people who were sent in, except for the third group who got lost and returned to live, the other did not have a message. You said this prince..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The prince is Must wait, or who will give the rest of the gold coins?" A thin man sitting next to the corner stove suddenly popped up and continued to warm his hands by the fire. It can be seen that he is already ill, cold sweats on his forehead, his nose hangs long and his body is constantly swinging back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, this mouse can't hurry to eat something? Everyone is a quantitative food, how much can you hide? How hungry? What is the use of skinny bones?” The eagle hook nose said: “If the prince does not come out, is it still waiting for a lifetime? Leave the money to go to the grassland to buy high-priced food. It’s better to divide it directly. Let’s go to the South to be happy. This damn rain is still endless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his words did not resonate, and those knights with family emblems looked up with caution and alienation. he. Abandoning the master's money and fleeing is enough to be a beheading offence. Only unprofitable mercenaries will do this, and even in the mercenary world, such behavior will be reviled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also said to himself: "The prince wants to find the treasures of the ancient times. Well, let us serve him, but I have not sold them to him." In the place where the bird does not lay eggs, there is no food other than the increasingly unpalatable food. There is a girl! It’s really bad!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Enough, Mans, close your stinky mouth." Swordwood, the sword of anger, with the sword of the eagle as a banner, is a martial arts superb knight. He stood up and beat his fist on the table: "You are a mercenary who goes into the money, a guy who doesn't talk about faith. If you dare to go, stay here, I will personally pick you up from the mud." Come out, put on the noose, hang on the wall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fart! You have the ropes now, the neck of Laozi is here." Mansla Open the collar and open the beard to reveal a wet throat. He then slammed the table with force, and even the body above it violently vibrated. "I tell you the truth, it is impossible to wait until winter comes here! There is no food sold to you at the time of the grassland, not leaving this place, not freezing or starving! You aristocrats have a magical basket, we don't have it. Wait until you are hungry. At that time, you have to see who's sword is sharper, not the size of the title!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now we still have enough supplies." Sir Bill stood up Squeezed between Mans and Sorwood and said: "I am both a mercenary and a baron, but these two identities are not used by any bird. I only know people who can't even do what they promise. No one will believe in him. No one will follow him behind him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed the two back, first to Sorwood: "We are working for our Highness, worried about his Safety. But the situation in the cave is unknown. It is a life of nine deaths. In addition to volunteering, people can no longer go in and explore the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These commissions The soldiers are taking the money..." Sorwood’s eyebrows stood up, glaring, Mansfield said, pointing to his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You also have an oath to His Royal Highness, they only have money. Is the responsibility of money higher than the oath?" Sir Bill pressed his arm: "Only Volunteer can go into the cave again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you spend a lot of money, there will always be voluntary." Sorwood refused to accept the loss, but it was no longer entangled. Then Sir Bill said to Mans: "Along the way, you also see the cavalry on the prairie that squats on the king's flag and we retreat. We can reach this. Can you bring a few people to go with yourself? If there is no prince and Earl, you can't even get a clear water fortress, and you want to go to the Black Blood Castle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
