			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linkey’s own meal is very simple, with elf bread, various fruits, boiled eggs and a large piece of fried fish. However, the food he prepared for the guests was very rich, and the dishes came together one by one. In particular, he was rumored that Capricorn had been hunger striked for hundreds of years in order to have a better magical physique, and he took care of it and took out the treasures of various worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things are hard to see, even violations of the rules appear on the table. Especially the meat of the astral creatures, it is reasonable to say that this thing will dissipate immediately after leaving the astral environment, but the half-plane of this flying castle can be stable. The gemstone nucleus of the elemental creature is more attractive to the dragon, and it is only possible to condense out on the naturally occurring elemental elders. At Lynch's table, one end is a whole plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're welcome, these things are just eaten, anyway, they are made." Lynch bluntly said: "I have a gnome friend called Nemo, he finally I finished the machine of all things. Unfortunately, he didn’t have enough power to run the machine before he was alive, and I used it as a food making machine. The land area of ​​the flight fortress is too small, I can only grow some vegetables and fruits, and the quantity is not enough. So what you eat is the result of the machine of all things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Similar to higher creation?" Siegel cuts a piece of beef stew and looks at it. I can't see the magic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is indeed based on higher creation, but much more complicated than it. You know that matter can become energy, then energy should also become matter There should be no difference between the material and the material, as long as the conservation is met." Lynch said: "Some gods can not create matter, but it is similar. But the machine can only follow the template, not by The idea is generated. So these beef, gems and anything are collected from various worlds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The succubus Erenis swims and takes the place Wine, tidy up the dishes. While passing through Siegel, she gently swept the mage's thigh with her slender tail and then gently picked it with her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mental effect immunity, succubus lady." Siegel smiled: "This is one of my most comprehensive spells."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Elf Zelly took a succumb to the tail of the succubus and dragged her behind her: "You are affecting the atmosphere between the seats, the succubus. Stay honest. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The creatures of the outer plane are always difficult to deal with. The war between the devil and the devil will never end. I have seen too much, so I don't want to Intervened in any war.” Lynch smiled slightly and explained: “You can send the Capricorn to the reunion. The Black Dragon and I are very grateful to you. I can help you in the spell. But I will not "Involve your world's problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a spell book adapted to the rules of the wall?" Siegel quickly put down the knife and fork and asked eagerly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to call you, just call my name." Lynch said: "I spent more than a thousand years roaming many worlds, collecting A lot of spells. Although they come from different rules, my specialty is to limit the rules. I have lost the ability to cast spells myself. I even learned another set of rules from the beginning. Then I collected five secret scrolls. After that, I gradually understood the thoughts behind the system, and thus the law and the law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"瞎, you will not be a Paladin's spell until now. "Ze Lifa grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can use the priest magic to be great, know that I can't use the power of the godhead." Lynch patted the drow's back She smiled and then said to Siegel: "There is nothing wrong with the rules of converting spells, but can you wait for enough time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Needs How long?” Siegel asked quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A spell takes a day, but the world and other worlds have different time streams. You wait a day here, and the wall of the wall goes over two months. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months to change a spell, Siegel can't afford it. His construction of the lucky Soss and the affairs of Heim’s leadership required him to be distracted. Think of distraction. He had an idea: "Mr. Lynch, can you cast astral projections from here, so I can let my avatar return to Heim, can my body still stay here waiting for the spell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be kind to people, Lynch brother!" Angel Soka bites the cake. The mouth is confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, be kind. But next time I touch the tentacles, don't plead for it." Lynch touched the golden head of the angel. Then said to Siegel: "Like this, as a thank you for the reunion of the Black Dragon father and daughter. You can pick a spell, I will give you the version of the converted rule, and then give you some information about the high spell spell. Transcripts should be enough for you to continue learning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Mr. Lynch." Siegel then asked: "Can you ask "Magic Decoration?" Is there any follow-up information in the study? I want to make a life-space ship that can be projected through the astral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, why not use the door of the outside world directly? Oh, you don't have this spell right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the spacecraft made by Astral Projection is safer, not afraid of being destroyed, nor being captured. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linkey put down the tableware, sat up straight, his eyes sparklingAt this time, he appeared as a mage and discussed with Siegel enthusiastically. The "neural system" of the core of the lamp god, the elements of the para-brain and the elemental polymer line, plus the partial production of intelligent magic items. The two mage said, while using the illusion directly in the air to draw a three-dimensional drawing. The dark elf looked dizzy for a while and quickly quit; the succubus insisted for a while, then sent out the "squeaky", and fell on the chair, revealing a beautiful figure; the black dragon snorted and let his daughter lick The succubus's tail dragged her away from the restaurant, and the black dragon began to feel dizzy and could not bear the power of magic drawings. Only Angel Soka left with big eyes to watch, if nothing happened to eat candy snacks - her body and mind can afford to live, but unfortunately she could not understand, just to watch the excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a very energy-intensive, inefficient system," Lynch concluded. "There is a need for a large number of elements to support it, which is already difficult to solve." Second, about a quarter of the energy is supplied to the nervous system formed by the lamp god and the elementary brain, and these systems add up to two percent of the entire spacecraft."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a secret nuclear, elemental energy is not a problem." Siegel looked at the design that has been perfected after many improvements: "Mr. Lynch, you did not find this percent Is the second and the fourth a magical coincidence? Just like the human brain.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your world’s research on necromantic knowledge is quite good. Lin Qi appreciates: "This is indeed an artistic coincidence that reflects the beauty of the underworld. When you come into contact with the legendary spell and then touch the boundaries of the rules, you will It will be clearly felt that the so-called beauty is a manifestation of the rules of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "Magic to the end is art?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All explorations of the nature of the world are ultimately art, and the truth contains truth." Said: "The multiverse is built on the basis of 'three', everything is the same. The magic of the thunder wall world is dominated by four elements. I have also seen the division of another element, the golden wood and the fire, called the five elements. In the process of traveling through countless worlds, I have seen a more complex world, six or seven. The most dangerous thing is the double world. Because it is too extreme and extremely unstable, it will eventually lead to a heavy destruction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earth of the Goblin is twofold, and their thoughts are extremely extreme," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linkey shook his head: "It’s still the same sentence, I won’t intervene in the conflict between your world and the goblin wall. When you get through the crystal wall channel, connect When you go to the world of the Goblin, you have actually killed both worlds. The storm that destroys the world will follow the passage to the world of goblin. Their doomsday is no different from you. So I suggest you take the door of the other world. Spells, leave with your own people as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This..." Siegel never thought about this layer. Do the gods of dwarves know that the storm of destruction will erode the world opposite the passage? Even if the dwarf destroyed the goblins and immigrated their compatriots to the opposite side, how did they break the passage? The dwarf saint did not mention this matter. Is it deliberately concealing or not knowing at all? How did Lynch know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your heart is full of doubts, I can see it from your eyes. I don't know the answer to many questions. I have been searching for hundreds of years. Maybe the ultimate problem of the world has no answer at all. Maybe it’s not long enough for me to find the time. The method is not right.” Lynch said: “So, when your world is destroyed, if you choose to leave, I welcome you to come back again. Come here. I find that your thinking and understanding are very high. Maybe we can explore the wider world together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
