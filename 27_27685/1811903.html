			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Broadcast] Pay attention to the "starting point reading", get the first hand news of 515 red packets, and the students who have not robbed the red envelope after the Chinese New Year, this time can I have a show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barrier formed by the shadows made Siegel quite a bit of a hand, but finally failed to block the spell ability of the sorcerer. Relying on the forcible breaking of the four-pulse arrow, Siegel dispelled the shadow of the hole, and a fish jumped in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he found himself on a towering cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, the hole is still shrouded in shadow, but vaguely can see the scene of the battlefield outside. Siegel walked over and reached out and touched it, but there was an invisible barrier blocking him. He then spread the elemental energy upwards and tried to resolve the barrier, but a smothered electric light passed through and almost hurt his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the rule in the thunderbolt forms a whirlpool of greed, engulfing the elements, leaving no residue. It seems that it is not so easy to return from the original road, but this is also expected by Siegel. Shenhuo means the most essential spiritual power, no matter how hidden, it will change the rules around it and gradually form its own kingdom of God. Lear may be able to hide the fire and even compress the scope of the kingdom of God, but in places very close to the fire, there will be a regular barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, it is indeed the place that Siegel is looking for, and it is very close to the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cliff where Siegel is located is on a bare, grassy mountain with a steep mountain wall hundreds of meters above its head to the top, surrounded by the bottom. In the fog. Looking into the distance, you can see the hills interspersed between the clouds, all of which are knife-hardened, black and bare, hard stone walls, and even the soil is a luxury. The earth in front is shrouded in a dark twilight. I don't know if there is day or night, but now it is just like a haze, or it is always so dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a meandering path on the side of the cliff, only half a metre wide, close to the almost erected wall. This small road goes up and down, stretches forward, and walks through the hills like a snake. There are many places on the road deep into the fog. There are also places where you need to turn up the ridge. Looking forward in the direction of the road, you can see a white seven-story tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel instinctively the tower is the destination, and the power is stored in that place. Although there is no evidence and reasoning process, intuition is intuition. Very strong. He recites the spell, mobilizes the power of the element, and wants to pass it directly. But a thunder roared and the delivery failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at the sky, the black cloud of black clouds obscured the sky. Thunder is passed down from above. Siegel thinks of the rule lightning that has just passed, knowing that thunder may be caused by the limiting power of the kingdom of God. He grinned and tried to fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, it still failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to have to go with your own feet." Siegel stepped on the mountain path and experimented with magic spells while walking. Limit rules. Soon he discovered that it is not allowed to cast any spells that affect the way of action. Shadows, flights, transmissions, arachnids and wall penetrations are not allowed. Even feathers are blocked. In other words, if you fall from a small road. There are no spells that can be used to save lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just spells, the related magic items are equally useless. The flying carpet is an ordinary cloth in this place, and the feather ring is a copper ring. The mountain wall here is very smooth, it is difficult to grasp without moss, and the road under the foot is always tilted to the outside, giving people a feeling of crumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Siegel’s ability to balance is very good. The life on the mast and the pace of the elves have prevented him from a lot of dangers, so he walked very steady along the way. I don't know what is underneath the clouds in the mountains, but from the rot of the carrion sent from there, Siegel never wants to fall and find out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon. He approached the cloud area, and the road under his feet only extended five or six meters in front of him, and he could no longer see it. Siegel used psionic vision, but found that the clouds rolled. There is a constant sparkle of light, which seems to be sensitive to psionic vision. These are the counterattack forces formed by the rules, and Siegel does not want to waste energy on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't work, it doesn't work, why should you hate it?" Siegel turned this thought in his heart, but he could only helplessly move on. Fortunately, the road has always been at the foot. As always, the width and tilt can be dealt with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five shadows appeared. They were originally five super-large feather snakes, each of which was 20 meters long and had a wingspan of about ten meters. They danced around the circle in the air, and five pairs of green eyes stared at the west. Geer. Feather snakes are a kind of natural magical creatures. Their bloody veins are filled with spells. Many warlocks who rely on the ability of blood to cast spells hope to obtain feathers and snakes to assist them when they activate their abilities. Adult feather snakes can at least cast more than twenty different spells, but the super-large feather snake in front of Siegel is not just as simple as adulthood. Each of them can be comparable to the sorcerer, and united will become a very difficult enemy to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, most feather snakes are kind, helpful and obey, not much different from the Paladin. But even so, Siegel can't take it lightly. After all, it is the realm of the gods formed by the fire, and God knows that there is no difference between this and the outside except for the prohibition of maneuvering spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feathers looked at each other and spit out the spit, and the green feathers on the top of the head swayed. They use telepathy to communicate with each other and exchange opinions with the people in front of them. "There is another explorer, but this person's smell is better than the previous one, let him go directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agree, at least he is full It's a fresh elemental atmosphere, not a black and slimy shadow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you jealous of his nervousness, is it cute? Don't scare him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other four feather snakes glanced at the companion, who spit out his tongue and his eyes licked. Through telepathy, several feather snakes were negotiated, and a telegram was sent to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was blocked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to guard against Knox’s thought-controlling spells, Siegel set a layer of protection in his brain. In addition to the telepathic signals from the stars, Baron, several lights gods, and the Federation's mana pool, these other abilities are directly blocked. He could only hear the sound of a ringing bell in his ear, knowing that someone is using his psychic ability, but he does not know what kind of spell effect it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feathered snake that gave the signal stunned. He hasn’t encountered any situation where his mind communication can be turned off. The feather snake narrowed his eyes and concentrated his mind, focusing all his concentration on Siegel. The signal of the mind is as real as it is, even forming a burst of wind pressure, but the head of the ** division does not enter the salt, the door is tightly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s other creatures, I’m afraid I’m angry at this time. Feather snakes are more patient. Without a communication channel, it does not mean that you can not communicate, so it speaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a strong voice, the celestial language that came out of the feathers of the mouth was very difficult to understand. After all, many syllables became ambiguous. Siegel barely understood the words of it, knowing that these five feather snakes are the guards here, and by the way, examine the qualifications of the passers-by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The School of Magic does not accept fools, idiots, and eucalyptus heads." Feather said: "But look at your heart and good taste, we decided to use only a single spell. The quiz will cause you trouble, and you can rest after you pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel grin. The adjective is fresh and refreshing. What does the word "but" mean? He took out his wand and prepared himself. The feather snakes have good spell power, but they can never master the legendary spells. How much trouble can they cause? At least I just knew that this road leads to a magic school, maybe that is the name of the seven-story tower? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Wall!" "Wind!" "Ice Storm!" "Wind Claw!" "Cyclone!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stunned, this is the "single spell test"? Creating multiple wind gusts on such a narrow mountain road can be unimaginable once blown down. He stepped forward and leaned forward, but he quickly adjusted his center of gravity with the spirit of the elf and stuck the back firmly on the mountain wall. This did not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is getting bigger and bigger, and it’s getting messy, with biting ice and entanglement and pulling. The cold damage can not penetrate the magic protection of Siegel, and the threat brought by the wind claws can also be ignored. The only trouble is the suction and thrust formed by these winds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five feather snakes on the opposite side continue to use these five spells to make the situation more and more chaotic. Although some winds will cancel each other out, more cases are exacerbating the chaos of the wind. If you turn into a gas element, you can avoid the effects of all wind blows, but under the rules of shielded flight, it becomes very likely that the gas element will attract the threat of regular lightning, or because of the loss of speed, the result is the same as the physical creature. Roll over the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
