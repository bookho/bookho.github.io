			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second time they met, the previous time Siegel sent the dragon girl Capricorn to find her father, at that time he only Knowing that Lynch is a powerful legendary mage, he has lived for many years by controlling the speed of time. He learned from the Lynch about the skills of time control, but has never really seen his essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used to have a friend from your world, a monk called Regula. I haven’t known how many years have passed, and no one knows. He is a problem." Lynch and Siegel left the temple and came to the reception room of the castle. There are only two of them in this room, and everyone else has left. The dragon girl, Capricorn, seems to have learned a lot, and went to Janet and Isaac to play early. However, Isaac is now the lord, although he is still very close to the dragon girl, but it is not fun to "pretend" the adult. Megan Baby replaced the position of the Dragon Girl toy, but she also slowly experienced the process of adapting to Longwei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know the legendary monk Regula, who once ventured into another world and brought back his wife." Siegel took a shot. From the big library, I found a biography of Regura and handed it to Lynch. "This may be the closest record to the truth, but unfortunately his descendants have not been able to continue to this day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linchi nodded, after taking the book with calm The voice said: "If you live for a long time, you will see more things like this. I have no friends in my own world. The blood that I have left has passed through the branches and leaves, and I have barely felt it. I used to I often go back and see, but with the longevity of ethnic friends and the death of their children and grandchildren, it is meaningless to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think It’s a terrible thing to look at it.” Siegel said: “Time will wipe out everything, even a legendary mage can’t reverse it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some things are timeless." Lynch does not agree with Siegel's point of view: "Shenzhen's invasion of the human heart will not change with time, and time itself is a special case. In fact, it is a matter of me to come to you. I want to work with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Also a God? I was only a handful of experience, how to help you get on? "Siegel doubts Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linkey took two steps in the room, then reached for a trick and took five reels from the void. "My strength comes from these five mysterious scrolls, which are the magic foundation, the creation of spells, the creation of higher objects, the knowledge of space, and the manufacture of artifacts. I have been studying for many years and have been wondering what their original roots are. At present, I can only guess that it is a creation. The magic god of the god level. These five mysterious scrolls have been repeated tens of thousands of times, and there is no room for improvement. I need new ideas to help me further improve. Capricorn..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want a twenty-faced scorpion?" Siegel interrupted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I used the omniscient tower to peer into the history of your crystal wall and infer the existence of such things. It is also the creation of the creation god level, the same The magic is amazing." Lynch smiled and said: "But I also know that good horses, good saddles and good riders have to cooperate with each other. Unless I have absolute confidence, it is better to use twenty-faced dice than you. Otherwise I wouldn't want to take this thing away from you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this all based on your thoughts?" Be alert, this is no longer another Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't believe in the head, I only believe in the facts. Although I can stop the time, but lack the ability to travel through time, I can't see the future. My There are no rules of time in the five secret scrolls. This is a weak, but not a bad thing. Because all my judgment bases are based only on what has happened. I need a shrewd, inspiring, and always energetic. Research partners, which are thousands of times more important than taking advantage of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to study?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Time." Lynch said: "I want to know the secret of time, I want to have the ability to go back to the past. It is not to change history, but to look at those old friends. I need to repeat the experience. For the time being, let yourself not become a shackle of sacred fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been saved by myself in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, then I am looking for you right." Lynch finally showed a trace Yung. "In exchange, I can use the space power I have studied for thousands of years to help you solve the problem of the end of the world. The storm of destruction has always been my research direction. Although I have not been able to achieve any results, it is still possible to help you evacuate. Do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are..." The voice of the servant came from outside and then stopped. Siegel's perception of God can penetrate all the barriers within thirteen miles, so the process is clear. The servant was only fixed, and he was able to untie it in a few moments without any damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who casts the spell is a person with a blue oil on his face, highlighting his eyes, lips and ears, but covering his nose. His black cloak couldn't cover the slightly hunched body, and the full-shadow gloves made of blue dragon skin came out from under the cloak and held a staff. The wand with the hoe was two meters long and looked very heavy. He knocked on the ground and made a dull squeak, making him seem to be walking with the pillar. Behind him is followed by a mage, whose association robes accurately express his identity. When the wizard of the blue oil paint came in, both Siegel and Lynch clearly noticed that the original battlefield was eroded by a strange force, like sudden aging, without protection and warning. The role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am here at the right time, otherwise I will return empty-handed, it will make me very unhappy, some people will be unlucky!" Master Oil Paint said: "I want nuclear technology for unlimited energy. I have a half-face, enough to stuff three or four hundred people. The premise is not the Titan. Who is the Siegel squid, is you, or you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed his finger at the two mages in the room, and seemed to be unaffected by the fluctuations in their power. Lynch took a step back and gave up the position of Siegel. He also threw the mysterious scroll back into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a Siegel squid, do you have a half-face?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, the virginity is not deceiving. I have the coordinates of the position. I also have the lock of getting in and out. The half-plane is almost going to become a crystal wall, so now you can make a big profit when you buy it." The wizard said "But, do you really have a permanent device with unlimited energy? Don't be a fake that steals energy from Nether!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is completely permanent and infinitely energy-consuming, and it needs to be repaired every few decades.” Siegel felt instinctively delayed by this oily mage, just as an angel met the devil. Even if the devil changed his head, it seems to be pure and gentle, but the evil atmosphere of his body will still cause the angel to be alert. "I don't know what your name is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Businessman A." The wizard said: "Except for the real name, everything is fake, you use this name. I can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfunctory feeling is so strong, but frankly thorough. Siegel has some helplessness. He knows that the person is purely cautious, but there is no hostility. However, Lynch’s eyes lit up, but he said, “I know who you are, the businessman who provoked the faction war in the gate city and then burned the orphanage.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The orphanage is not my original purpose. I want to burn the 妓+院 next to it. It is not right to have the two together. Unfortunately, the defense is too strong, and the orphanage is better to burn." This thing is ashamed, looking at Lynch with a curious look: "Which are you, have I seen you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven't seen it, but You may have heard of me. I am the last person I have ever seen a decryptor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warning, don't do things with real names, it will cause unimaginable The evil consequences." The merchant's little finger trembled slightly, but this was his only reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't lie, are you not taking back your real name, and are you afraid of others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, I believe you, you have seen the decryptor." Merchant A Master smiled: "What do you want, I can bring it to you, just use a few real names to change. Absolutely fair and reasonable "Children are not deceiving!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linge ignored him, but said to Siegel: "This person is evil, acting without hesitation, but in seriousness When you talk about business, you have a good reputation. Although he is not a god, he can feel your strength, so he dare not make the means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil person? I can't give you unlimited energy, so as to avoid chaos in the world." Siegel pinched his fist and modified the magic rules of the thunder wall world. All the secret nuclear cores were forbidden to be taken to other spaces. In case this person directly grabs a nuclear weapon, he can't take it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you? Why do I manage what I do with unlimited energy? You see, I don't ask you what to do with the half-plane? The deal is Trading, don't look at it with colored glasses? This multiverse has nothing to do with it. It is a concept that is strongly imposed to make it messy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
