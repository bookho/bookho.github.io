			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When breakfast, Count Todd found Sir Bill. As always, Sir Bill is here at the training ground. But today he did not practice the swordsmanship, but he sat on the wooden barrel next to the weapon rack with his arms and quietly made a spectator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet is on the other side of the venue, another baron Siegel is next to his girlfriend, holding a pipe in his hand and spreading a book on his knee . He and Sir Bill were across the field, looking up from time to time, but most of the time they were reading. The middle training ground was occupied by two young people, one is Evan and the other is Kerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are playing against each other and playing hard. Both strengths, skills, and speed have their own advantages. For a time, no one can take anyone under the premise of not being seriously injured. If it was in the past, Siegel would also rush into the venue with excitement, but now that his physical fitness is still there, he has been more inclined to solve problems with spells instead of fists. However, Janet looked at it with gusto, and there was a gesture in the hand. She will secretly steal school tomorrow, but be careful not to affect Siegel next to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the count, Sir Bill took a glass of ale from the barrel next to him and handed it over. He took another cup of himself, and after the toast, waited for the count to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The prince's temperament is still not good." When drinking, the count looks like he is ten years old, his hair not only turns white quickly, but also falls off. It’s as powerful as the snow that is melting outside, gradually revealing the bare ground. "Although I don't want to admit it, but his body wants to return to his previous health, the hope is very embarrassing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Temple of Dawn has no way "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd shook his head, and everyone in the expression could see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still a school city to help. Although those wizards are not as good as the pastors in treating injuries, they are said to be very useful, and may find that the priests can’t find them. The question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope so too." Earl Todd looked dignified and thought for a while, then looked up and sipped the ale in the corner cup. . Then he sat on the wooden barrel and whispered, "Do you think the words of the Siegel Baron are a bit credible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe him Sir Bill replied: "Not only believe in his character, but also his ability. If it is not fully grasped, he will not tell me about the spying through me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect to be stared before I set off. It seems to be to rectify the order of the capital." In fact, the main meaning of Earl Todd is not here, he really changed the topic: "What do you think? In the prophecy of Master Lear, will there be a solution to the current situation of the prince?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Sir Bill honestly said: "Unless you ask the master himself, no one present can answer this question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no problem with the information. Knox is really a group of conspirators. "The count gnashed his teeth and pinched his fist: "The conspirators have never had any good endings." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful with them. Everyone knows that the Master is awesome. I think it’s better to talk to the Masters Association of the City. Only they can be better. Dealing with your own people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the count moved. "Tiger. What do you think of your apprentice?" He sat up straight and said, "Will he stand on the side of the royal family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He has always stood on the side of the royal family, which is unquestionable.” Sir Bill nodded. “But there is no good reason, and he will not be in concert with Knox. You can’t completely pin your hopes on him alone.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." The count said: "I remember when you reported to me, Siegel said that there is a means to restore the scene, saying Maybe you can see the prophecy of Master Lear again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He did say this, but that is our private communication, he did not let me report you Sir Bill said: "But I feel that I should report this to you without reservation, so as not to delay anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Earl, what the hell is..." Sir Bill’s words were not finished, and Count Todd bypassed the training ground and headed for Siegel. The young mage had long seen the opposite situation, and he applied a spell that enhanced the senses, and the conversation between the count and the baron was clearly heard. However, he still pretends to know nothing and the count is cold. Until the other party mentioned the predictions of Master Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a corollary about this matter." Siegel closed the book in his hand. "If I am a mage of the Knox Association, I will not I will try to steal the things that Lear master gave you, because no one knows what kind of magic mark there will be - if it is positioned by the master, it will be miserable. The Master who is proficient in prophecy is best at tracking and locking the target. The fools will certainly not be amazed. Similarly, they are not sure how to do things with the prophecy. One is that time is too late. It only takes ten minutes to judge what kind of magic enchantment is attached to the item, let alone modify it. The above is the second; the second is not necessarily able to break the protective magic on the item. As long as it is a smart person, it will not bet on the success rate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count While listening, I nod. He has only a common sense understanding of the caster and the spell, and through Siegel's commentary he is increasingly aware of the power of the wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knox Synagogue Master I know is very good at spells that affect memory, so I guess if they want to know the prophecy of Lear, then it will Take it from the reader's head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only thing to read the prophecy letter was the prince," said the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, so if you want to know the content of the letter, you must let me cast a spell on my memory."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure you can find the true prophetic text in the memory of His Royal Highness Prince?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, "This involves By reading and modifying the principle of memory spells, real and original memories will not be erased, they will only be covered up, so I have 80% of the grasp to dig out the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Does the harm to the prince's body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and answered very seriously: "Two days of headache is inevitable Then, either sleepiness or insomnia, it varies from person to person. But I can guarantee that within three days, it will definitely be fully restored, and there will be no subsequent influence." He thought about it. Adds: "Maybe you can ask the Lear master again, or wait for the higher enchantment master to come, so that the grasp may be bigger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Master Lear is too far away, and I can't count on it for a while.” The count said: “And the other mages are not members of the royal family. I don’t know. So, the current candidate is only you.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you decide, I can help." Siegel said: "But I have a request for Janet, her previous things are written off. Don't "Looking for her trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your little woman went to find the troubles of the dukes. It has nothing to do with me... Forget it, I am not jealous of you. Say the nonsense between the nobles. I promised your conditions, what else do you need to prepare?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is best to tell the cousin of the Temple of the Morning, let They take care of the body of His Royal Highness." Siegel said: "I will make a device first, and then I will finish it. At any time magic "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Todd Earl nodded, then he departed. I don't know how he persuaded Cooper's pastor, and eventually the Temple of Dawn actually agreed to this spell. However, they are prepared to think about the shield and other spells, ready to cut off the wizard's spells at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel doesn't care, anyway, no matter what. The spell is not harmful to him. The prince, who was lying in bed, slept very well after drinking a sleeping remedy, just to help cast a spell. Siegel placed the sacred stone stone on the prince's forehead, and the two hands overlapped and hung over the stone. As the voice of the chanting spell continued to reverberate in the room, a golden light beam emerged from Siegel's palm, covering the entire head of the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the Earl, Sir Bill, Evan, and Cooper Pastor are also on the side, they look different, but they are curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of the spells was different, and Siegel quickly found a spell structure that was characterized by the Knox Association. If it weren't for their spellbooks, it would not be easy for Siegel to notice these hidden spell features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
