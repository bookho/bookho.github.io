			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant elemental aggregate is constantly mingling with the lightning of the four-pulse power of the arrow, dispelling the storm of magic. WwW.XsHuotXT.com rain stopped, the wind slowed down, and the smoky sun threw down through the gap between the clouds, then slowly dispelled the dark clouds, revealing the blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no more wet storm in the air, and the curtain that blocks the prophetic spells disappears. Siegel found several ships through locating and then picked the nearest and approaching ship and flew over. The moving islands resurfaced, and the dwarves couldn't help but start cleaning. The Royal Fleet also regrouped and continued to escort alongside the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan licks the already numb arm, then sits on the bow of the boat and lifts the skin to fill the water inside. He is already close to the edge of the force, and again and again using the newly mastered sword to break the waves consumes a lot of his physical strength. If it weren't for the storm to disappear quickly, he and his ship must have been buried in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crew who escaped from the dead looked at their employers with awe--these people didn’t know that it was Evan Star, the king of the starry kingdom ( one). Evan hides his identity and even conceals his whereabouts from the generals who support him. He only leaves an order of "I go out and everyone does not move." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Sir Bill, he received a letter from Aaron. He did not discuss the hidden meaning behind the letter with anyone, but his instincts must come to a stone boat. Since he had not been crowned as a king, the dwarf did not invite him to go, but it did not affect his actions. Just look at how Aaron travels, and then follow the direction of the Royal Fleet to find the floating island of the dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent five hundred gold coins hiring this low-profile cargo ship called "Sailfish", far behind the Royal Fleet. They can only keep the fleet at the end of the Haiping line, mainly because they are worried that they will attract the attention of the other party. It may be caused by a U-turn of the fleet. Because of this, they were behind for a few days and they crashed into the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sails are rising again and they are going in the same direction. There is no longer a shadow of the Royal Fleet in the field of vision. When the storm is raging, they do not know how far they have been blown off the route. Fortunately, everyone can also identify the general direction. Now I can only continue to move forward in the original direction. Only after the stars have reappeared in the evening will they have a way to locate them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon finished the water, tired and fell on the deck, he saw the captain's generous chin appeared in the field of vision. The captain picked up his water bladder. I smelled it under my nose. "Just kidding, this is just water! You should drink some warm drinks at this time! There are some secret wines in my room. Do you like lighter or more fragrant?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't drink alcohol, water can be." Evan thought of his brother Aaron who was drinking too much. "But if you have juice or yogurt here, I would love to taste it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat captain shook his head: "Where is there on the boat. Even the apple It will turn into wine for a long time. I will let the kitchen give you some nourishing food. The sailors are willing to take some effort to get some good fish for you. After all, you saved everyone, everyone thank you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am also saving myself, what is thankful." He sat up in the upper body and suddenly saw a black spot flying in the sky. "What is that?" Evan asked. "Flying over something, not like a bird!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain looked at it: "It seems to be a person?" Without wings, not wings or angels, it should be a mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan squinted for a moment, then laughed: "Captain, don't let everyone be busy. The person who picks me up is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really time for you to come." After Evan saw Siegel The first sentence is: "When the storm disappears, you come over and save people. This is not the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ended the storm, otherwise this is now It’s still raining.” Siegel and Evan shook hands: “I saw a few boats around, only you are going to the Dwarf King’s meeting, the rest is just a supply boat. The storm Just to prevent you from showing it, but why can't I guess it in this form?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people know that I am coming ? Meeting my side no one can tell "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"No problem, this is a small matter, I promised." Evan smiled: "Aaron went to the dwarf's big ship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes I just saw him three days ago, he is still not very good, his body is weak and tight. But he has stopped drinking and is very looking forward to meeting you." Siegel frowned and then picked Appropriate wording: "According to my observation, his body should be too fast to hold on. I have already felt the shadow of death looming over him. Even the power of the Lord of the Morning can not be dispelled. You are probably the last time. Meet him, no matter what, don't make things that make you sad and regret. After all, you two are brothers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, I know Evan nodded and wanted to pat Siegel's shoulder, only to find it difficult to lift his arm. "Good Master helps out, take me to a place with a doctor or a pastor. Even if they have a big beard, it doesn't matter. I feel all the pain, there is really no strength."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage summons the phantom, will help Evan, and fix him with a spell. Upon receiving the order to start, the phantom smashed into the air, and the four hooves stepped out one after another in the air. The horseshoe's dissent is just the effect of a spell, not really shaking, so the passengers on the horse will not feel a bump. Evan and the "Sailfish" waved goodbye and, under the leadership of Siegel, rushed to the direction of the stone boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan, love is born, a boy, your illegitimate child." Siegel suddenly opened his mouth and shocked the king. "She came to me more than half a year ago and was quite a belly. I thought that the half-elves had a longer pregnancy and found no difference with humans. Your child has no name yet, but if you dare to give him a surname like a sea reef I will take you to the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My son?" Evan kept repeating: "I have a son?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned: "Why don't you know? When I was pregnant, I sent a letter to Sir Toby."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been hiding, sometimes moving around, maybe because this has not been received." Evan still seems dizzy: "Half-elves are not difficult to get pregnant? "I am so powerful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master took a hard shot on his shoulder. Then he said, "What do you want? You have to tell me what to do with this mother and son?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news obviously shocked Evan, but still Not to make him a dementia. Evan has many choices, and Siegel also wants to know how he thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so," Evan said. "You have to help me with this matter. Otherwise it is not easy to deal with. First of all, you have to recognize Ai Meng. For my sister. No, if you follow her age, you have to recognize her as a sister, so she has a nobleman. Although there is no historical origin, it is just a generation of nobles. But it is always true. You can give her a castle. Let her be the aristocrat on the ground. After that, you will come to me on behalf of her. The teacher and the Earl of Heim... Marquis - Duke, you don't think about it for a while, the Royal Duke needs blood relations, but the marriage is not impossible. When the words come back, considering the importance of the New World and the need to maintain a good relationship with you, I will be happy to make sacrifices and marry love. But how to deal with children’s problems? Children born without marriage will still be Being an illegitimate child is not good for him in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time I found out that you are very smart..." Siegel said: "The age of the child is also good." I will cast an eternal stagnation on him. Surgery, he will freeze his time. He will not suffer any harm. Just pause all changes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Avon said: "Married When you immediately declare your pregnancy, you only need to wait a little longer to declare your child born. You can then remove the magic, so that everything is logical!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is The best idea you can come up with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If all goes well, this is the best for the child. He doesn't have to take the name of the illegitimate child in his life. Life will always be the son of my Avon star, the heir to the kingdom. I think this is the best situation I think of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, what? I can help you with your sister's arrangement of the castle. As long as you can do your best to fulfill your father's responsibilities, you can't say when you will be enthroned. Is it necessary to wait for the wedding?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
