			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was considered a light-loaded man, he replaced the crimson mage robe, wearing only a light gray leather jacket with a lot of pockets. On the right side of the silver belt is a space bag, a spell kit, a wand and a healing pot, and the other side is a delicate long sword. Space bags and key spaces are loaded with supplies, but the rest of the stuff is related to magic. Special inks for making reels, parchment paper, alchemy tools, and a variety of materials. After the first trip to the North, Siegel finally had a clear understanding of what the Master should do in his adventures, no longer an abstract concept seen in books. When he set foot on the journey again, he made all kinds of preparations and thought about the countermeasures from the spirit and the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel set off, he found that Marjorie did not send him a horse, but the giant Kerry stood at the gate of the city. He was holding two almost identical silver-white horses with saddles and bags. The giant also wore inlaid leather armor, equipped with long bows, javelins, nets, scimitars and ice guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Missella said that I couldn’t use me in the West." Kerry said with a smile: "She said that I haven’t acted for a long time. So let me help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the giant is happy from the heart. If an animal is to be used to describe him, then Kerry is the unfettered eagle in the sky. He is the creature who stands proud of the earth in the free sky. He will use it as a geese who lead the team to kill that passion. Mesera saw this and used this reason to let her husband leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason is Siegel. The Black Wolf Princess knows that in the future development of the Jackdaw Tribe, Master Siegel will play a very important role, and it is even more crucial to continue to deepen the hard-won feelings between the two brothers. For this reason she would not tell Kerry, because she likes her husband to be carefree, and the eagle's wings are as tight as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wants to understand this section, raises his hand and Kerry’s high-five, and says with enthusiasm: "What are you waiting for? There is also a grassland to cross. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let you see and see our horses, feel what is the power of the wind!" Kerry should be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you talk, the two ride on white horses. Embarked on the road to the Black Blood Castle. As Kerry said, this is really a good horse for two gods. When they run, they are like a torrent, and the white mane and long tail are dancing with the wind. Four hooves fly like. Whether it is ice or soft snow, it can't affect its speed at all. When the two white horses ran, the hot air exhaled in the nostrils formed a trail of smoke in the air, slowly drifting in the direction behind them. Not only the speed, but the endurance of the two horses is also amazing. Even for hours of continuous Mercedes, the two horses did not feel tired. They quickly crossed the perimeter defense of Deepwater City. Two white long shadows were left in the exhortation of the patrol sergeant; then they crossed the frozen river and began to melt the loose ice layer, which could only rupture behind the two, but could not catch up with the four hooves. The speed of the two horses slowed down until the mud was encountered, but then Siegel waved his wand and ordered the gas elements to gather around the mount, making the two men and horses light, and the speed increased again. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole day, both horses are constantly moving forward, leaving everything behind them quickly. The person who met on the road. Whether it is the soldiers of Deepwater City or the riders of other grassland tribes, they stopped to watch the two rides. In the face of this amazing speed, they only feel that they are ashamed of making any moves, including taking steps. The sun rises from the east and crosses the sky, watching them fall from the west again, and two silver thin lines straight through the grasslands. Ignore any obstacles, no difficult terrain, and simply rudely defy the power of the earth. The wind, this is the name given to them by witnesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ride in the afterglow of the setting sun. It was not until the twilight came up that it stopped to rest. The two horses gently and happily put the rider down, and Siegel felt that he was falling apart. Kerry smiled and unloaded the saddle, untied all the luggage, and let the two horses freely move. Siegel waved. The surrounding hay was pulled out from under the snow and pulled to the ground in front of him to gather together, and then there was no wind and spontaneous combustion. Siegel took out a piece of charcoal from the space bag and threw it into the fire. The flame burns steadily, giving off a warm, bright glow in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, you can start warming food." Siegel said: "Brother. What do you want to eat?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Kerry still carries a black pocket and hears Siegel’s words and sighs: "This is all right? Don't you burn horse manure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s really convenient to be a mage.” Kerry thought, can’t always bring the fecal fuel from here to the walled mountains? He opened his pocket, and it was really a piece of dried dung cake. It was burned on the fire for a while. However, the flames that burn like this are not big, just short flames. It is impossible to use barbecue, but it can burn for a long time, and it is difficult for the wind to blow it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse's feed is the biggest load on Kerry, because it takes a long journey, so it is all the savings, including oats, bran, carrots. And some apples. In the grassland tribes, the horses often eat well, because the riders know that the horses are their lives. They can't hunt, fight, or escape without a mount. Even with such a good feed, Kerry still pours off the minced bread, crushed and sprinkled in the feed. "You are harder and eat more," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is also prepared, the advantages of the space bag are reflected. No matter how bumpy, the eggs placed in the space bag will never break. The two horses smelling the scent quickly ran back, actually knowing to nod to the two and then start eating. Siegel was amused, and he took out a bottle of honey and poured it into the feed. At Kerry's inquiry, the Master took out the best brown ale and carried the skin to the two horses. After that, the riders began to prepare their own meals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night's vigil, it has been hovering in the sky and will not let go of any close animals. A snake that woke up early tried to climb over and was killed by flame rays. The raven did not stop to add food, still loyal to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no day before they leave. After seeing the horses of the horses, Siegel has been thinking about how to cast spells to make the mount's ability more perfect. Today is the moment of experimentation. More targeted light and floating spells are displayed, which not only reduces the weight but also reduces the wind resistance. The new day spans much more than the previous day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, for three days, they crossed the distance that they could only cross for more than a week, until then the two horses showed signs of fatigue. "You need to recover three times a day to eat normally, and let the two horses recover their strength." He patted the horse's neck with love, slowing down the speed of riding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A chill oozing into Siegel’s neck, he jerked his head and looked north. The figure of the walled mountains is still on the horizon, but it is still faintly visible. A feeling that made him feel like he was coming from the direction of the walled mountains. Suddenly the wind blew through, sweeping forward from the back of Siegel, rolling up the residual snow on the ground, the cold melt water hit the mage's face, and then flowed down like a tear. The faint red light of the northern sky is a sign of ominousness. The mount screamed, then twisted his head, and the horse wiped the "tears" on the mage's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we can't stop." Siegel shook his head and his tone was very firm. "You must move forward and keep moving forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to Siegel, tell me if you feel something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there will be bad things to happen." The Master replied: "The road ahead seems to have shadows, faintly warning those who want to move forward. But my friend is There, I can't stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the horse can't hold on for so long." Kerry said: "Even the most sturdy wind is impossible. There is only one choice now." He whistled and stopped both horses, then jumped himself and gave the empty horse to Siegel. "There are only two such horses in the world, I have used them for you. After the horses have changed, even if they are not as fast as the previous few days, you can keep moving forward under constant rotation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do, walk on this prairie?" Siegel said: "This is the center of the battlefield. You can't retreat without horses, and any one of the battles can It is easy to kill you. Are you willing to take such a risk for my premonition?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the king of the grassland, I regard this as a three spirit pair My test. I am a jackdaw, and it will be me who will stop eating on the body." After that, he began to unload the supplies from the saddle and pick the amount he could take with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stopped him and said: "Kerry, you can do this, it is the brother of my life. But you misunderstood as a mage. The meaning of the representative."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the casting material, rubbed it in his hand, and made an arc in the air, letting them fall like stars and dust. "The so-called wizard is able to create a way in the impossible of others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
