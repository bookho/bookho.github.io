			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general who insists on the front line, a strong half-orc, wearing a magic breastplate, holding a sword of flames - no more black blood than a gram The castle commander is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc commando jumped off the cliff, and only the weak feathers and floats temporarily provided by the witch festival ensure their safety. The forbidden rune array is particularly sensitive to flight-related effects, and all attempts to pass the sky—even dragons—will suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several orcs were blown away by the sudden wind, slammed on the cliff, and died silently. However, many people have successfully landed and seized the top of the tower of the highest tower of the Black Blood Castle. They have gathered together and are preparing to take a second downhill charge from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their plan is like this, first enter the castle, to ensure the success rate of the orc witch sacrifice, and then launch a sudden assault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is no one on this tower, it is simply the best springboard option for ambushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gathered together, the head pointed to the radiant gram, crossed his neck with two fingers, and then pulled out the weapon. The four orcs prepared a heavy bow, four were longbows, and the remaining ten orcs were mostly a combination of flying knives, nets and melee weapons. Four witch festivals have also landed and are preparing to cast spells for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they felt the tower under their feet swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs looked at each other and thought it was the vibration caused by the trebuchet. They couldn't communicate because they were cut off their tongues. Changing the plan is a waste of time and can only be acted upon in accordance with the agreed plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hem’s warriors on the tower have already withdrawn, and they all gathered under the tower. Siegel eliminated the stone wall and iron wall technique, leaving only the force field wall to maintain the crumbling tower. More than a dozen warriors used long wooden poles against the wall and pushed outwards to prevent the tower from falling in the wrong direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out the mace of the death knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the weapon he currently knows to have the strongest impact, and he is much more powerful than the siege hammer, the mind and the psionic impact. many. He took a deep breath and mobilized all the plasma energy on the bones, all concentrated on the mace. The weapon of Nexus trembled, and a feeling of eagerness was uploaded from the hammer handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of disarming the wall, Siegel waved the mace. Head to the support column of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud bang, the tower was like a flat slap, the inner wall smashed onto the outer wall, and everything in the tower was squeezed into a cake. The soldiers who pushed the long poles suddenly lost support. All the filths fell and fell to the ground. The entire tower was pulled up in front of everyone, and then the black blood castle was taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, everyone saw nearly twenty orcs on the top of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs have widened their eyes and opened their mouths. They don’t seem to understand why they are flying out of the castle. Several tenacious orc warriors also shot arrows in midair. Unfortunately, there is no one at all, and only a shallow pit can be left on the wall. The witch festival urgently casts magic and tries to leave the tower. Three have succeeded, and the other, along with the big forces, fell from a height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am on the orc army trying to climb the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a coincidence, but it is also the choice of fate. The collapsed tower cut off the ice and formed a broken wall of rock and brick. This wall is not high, anyone can cross the past, but the problem is that there is no ice, no one can slide over it. When the orc descends from the slide to here. You must stop, stand up, climb over the stone, and then continue to slide. Under the threat of Heim's archers, this is a wall of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knight’s sneak attack plan also failed – although the commandos had been secret before they died, they were only able to succeed, but luck was not in them. Here. The three witch festivals flying in the sky were volleyed by Heim's archers, and the shields against the long-range weapons were broken. They were shot into hedgehogs and fell into mud under the cliffs. The orcs that fell with the towers couldn't even see the bodies, all buried under the masonry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc warrior who was climbing the Black Blood Castle was stagnation and the rhythm was immediately disrupted. The soldiers behind were cut off by the collapsed towers—although there was only a minute or two of pauses—but Zucker immediately organized a concentrated blow. When the arrow is raining, the javelin is a lightning bolt in the rain. The orcs who climbed halfway did not have backup. The offensive effect is greatly reduced. With only a small price, the Black Blood Castle prevented the most dangerous first charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second shock came from the trolls and the hill giants. Their huge body can climb up the mountain wall quickly, but they are defeated in the attack of the power generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the enemy’s consideration is obviously not to attack the Black Blood Castle, but to cover the White Dragon to clear the ramp. It seems that the orc army has no time to make a second-faced dragon shield, so the white dragon has to brave the arrow rain, supported by the defensive spells on his body. Push hard on the big stones on the ice and use the ice to breathe to smooth the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't mind the white dragon, let the archers and pickpockets aim at the giants of the hill." Siegel measured the battlefield situation and issued the entire battle. The only command in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he saw the orc's biggest problem: pure skating casualties are too heavy, but they have been unable to maintain a constant impact on the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Dragon was seriously injured again, barely escaped, but re-created the slide passage. At least the orcs can start to fall again, even though the proportion of war damage is too high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Bai Long will not come back for a while, then Heim’s collar immediately throws a large number of oil tanks to form a wall of fire on the ice. The orcs on the slide couldn't stop, and they could only slam into the fire wall. After being ignited, they mourned, rolled, and slammed into the pile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana saw the opportunity and immediately issued an order: "Move the tank out and all launch to the mountain!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Siegel in the castle understands why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trebuchet's range is not enough for the corpse, but the oil will flow after the can is broken. After encountering an open flame, the oil began to burn and soon ignited the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find wood, break the box, any garbage you don't need! Go all the way for me!" Mike shouted excitedly, the light of Yangyan sword The more bright it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a large amount of combustion aids, the body pile finally burned completely and became a fire wall that could not be extinguished in front of the orc army. Now the orcs face a big problem: only a few can stop in time after going down the slide. Most of them will rush into the fire and be burned with the body. They either find a way to put out the fire, or they can only stop moving forward and attack the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs chose the siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a spear, waving a sling, a stick. The Orc army, which protected itself with a leather shield, began an attack on the wall. This time they are single-minded and will not give up until they reach their goal. The stone magazines shot from below squeaked on the walls of the city, or flew over the heads of the defenders, trying not to let them out. However, the defending soldiers only need to push the broken stones out of the battlements, it is possible to harvest and kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pattern of the defending city is more than that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone is followed by a shovel. A large amount of scrap and a smelt of waste metal were thrown out, and it was everywhere under the wall. The orcs want to get close to the wall, in addition to having to raise their heads to pay attention to the flying arrows in the sky, but also be careful. Most of the orcs have lost their lives, the speed of the attack has dropped, and the number of deaths and injuries has gone up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They tried to clean up these annoying things and the hot asphalt was poured down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing can immediately get the muscles to be cooked on the skin, melted and then peeled off a piece, called "the biting magma" ". It gives the orcs not only the damage on the **, but also the major blow in morale. The orcs could not climb the wall against the threat of hot asphalt. I have no choice but to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asphalt squats on the ground, and after cooling it sticks with the shovel, leaving only the spikes upright, as if forming a nail plate, completely cutting off the orcs I want to clean up the idea of ​​the iron shovel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
