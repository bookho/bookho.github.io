			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Knox Association was merged, the entire Mage Federation had a total of 70 official mage, and only four of them came to Heim’s collar. Together with the two apprentices they bring, the so-called Masters are only twelve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel prepared an open space early in the northern part of Heim, near the forest, and accumulated a large amount of building materials. Although it is called a spell test site, it is only prepared to build a low mage tower on the ground, but in fact there will be another. Under the ground, you will dig a hundred meters and build a library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original work is best for the dwarf, but in order to prevent leaks, the wizard can only do it by hand. Among the four official mages who came to Heim, the half-elf named Idis was the expert who built the magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is almost two hundred years old, and as a half-elf, it is also a leap year. It is said that he participated in the construction of the Sanfeng Pagoda as an apprentice. Later he became the official mage and was responsible for maintaining the building. He is knowledgeable in architecture and engineering, and even the dwarf orchestra has asked him to work at the top of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis came to Heim’s collar on a flying carpet, and when he saw Siegel, he did not get up, but leaned on the cushion. Jaws Head: "Mr. Siegel Master, I have to bother you during this time. It is inconvenient to get older and older, and I will not be able to get old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is my pleasure to come here." After Siegel salute, he said: "If I can, I want to study with you. I am a lord, and construction is an eternal theme."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deliberate compliment makes the Edith Master smile and look very happy, but this is just a courtesy. But when Siegel brought the elemental rune guard, the old wizard finally showed the true feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the reason? Actually apply the power of runes to the element summoning spells!" Master does not care about his legs and feet, go down the flying carpet and touch Earth element. It is difficult to resolve the principle of this magical item because of the cover of the surface rune and the presence of a spell from the gnome to deceive the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did the dwarf have a master of the spell?" He frowned, thoughtfully. "This technique seems to be brand new. I have never heard that the dwarf's rune technique has been greatly improved. Master Siegel, do you know what is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a new product from the top of the Mora. I bought it from a gnome." Siegel evaded the weight and said to him: "This earth element is very convenient for construction work." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idiss nodded and said, "This is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because only Sig He can command this earth element, so he can stay at the construction site. Watch the construction of the Magic Tower. He just can't ask for it, and every opportunity to learn is hard to come by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ordinary people, a hundred meters deep digging is not a simple job, but it is not difficult for a caster with a spell power. Even without Serge's rune element escort, several mages can use the corpse to make a squadron. Responsible for physical labor. From the space bag, Idis took out some tools that had been strengthened with fine gold, including crossbows, spades, and hoes. Except for the walls that have been strengthened by magic and runes, there is nothing in the world that is tougher than fine gold. It can ignore the hardness of most materials, and dig stones like digging mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all castles are reinforced with dwarf runes like the city of Mire, and most lords are unable to pay for this huge expense, that is to say Their castle walls are just plain soil in front of the gold. Each lord reserves the fine gold as the most important material and strictly controls the circulation of this material. Fortunately, the production of fine gold is very low, and the method of refining and attaching to other items is only mastered by the dwarves and mages of Mora, which leads to the high price of fine gold. Even if a small number of large lords have the opportunity to use refined materials, they will first be applied to weapons. Create a family of heirloom swords. Fine gold crossbow and iron shovel? Only the Master will be so extravagant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They easily dig through the ground, the earth elements take the lead, waving the fine gold equipment behind. The three mages continue to cast the stone, so that the surrounding soil becomes a stable rock structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily excavation progress is limited by the ability of several mages to cast a stone. After all, they can't sleep like earth elements and cockroaches. When they are resting, Siegel will ask them questions. In addition to the part that involves the secret of personal spelling, other basics can be answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the new winter arrives, the city of Urs and the underground library are completed at the same time. A large number of books were secretly transported from Deepwater City and placed in the Heim collar. There was still a lot of news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New World has many changes. Gossip followed. Viscount Kira Statt of the Hubburgh fell into the horse while hunting, broke his waist, injured his internal organs, and soon died. A new piece of evidence was shown, showing that the true heir of the hub should not be the son of Kira, but the distant house that should be returned to him. This document reveals errors in the Stadt family pedigree. And the nickname Kira is nothing but a snapper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the heirs of Hubburg affected the situation in the New World, and when Siegel received the news, he actually had a victory. Kira's son disappeared in the chaos of the hub, and a new red magic tower and an eleven-year-old named Marlenstadter grasped the strategic location with the winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more resources the Knox Association has, the less secure it is for Siegel to learn magic. The Red Magic Tower is pressing hard and is laid out on a map of the New World like a brilliant player. One by one, the Unicom port between the old and new continents gradually fell into the hands of the Knox Association. The two red magic towers in Deepwater City and Ximu Town announced the official rise of a new force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ore boulevard in the Walled Mountains is still safe. Although the dwarves of Mora's scorpion work endlessly, they do not care about the changes that have taken place on the ground. Although for the long life of the dwarf, what happened within a year is only a small piece of life, but some wary dwarves have already noticed that it is wrong. Irene often interacts with people outside the Walled Mountains, so she is very keenly aware of the changes in the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote to Siegel for information and asked him to judge the purpose of the Knox Association from the perspective of a mage. Kesig does not know why these bald mage are so keen on expansion, their core purpose has been hidden, only a few people know. Even Janet, who is very close to the core of this organization, has never found any clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is sitting in the seat next to the fire, sitting opposite her is a smiling Siegel. Apart from the two of them, there are no other people in the bedroom of this secret city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want to be a father and I want to be a mother." Janet gently stroked her belly with a happy smile on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was prepared for this news, just as the fruit growers knew that the trees they planted would be the same. He was not surprised, only the purest happiness. The new little life begins to breed, this is a miracle of the world that no magic can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long does it take to produce?" Siegel asked: "How long do you usually have to be pregnant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This depends on the other side's lineage." Janet is not very clear about this. "Siegel, you are bloody, black and dark, so strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage’s mouth is shaking, he’s really bad about this problem. Reply. With the establishment of the library, he has a good place to learn knowledge. The constant reading, while solving some of the problems, added more doubts to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you follow the stage of your own growth, you should belong to humanity, but no one in the world is black and dark. His physical resilience is also extremely powerful, far beyond the level of ordinary people, and even close to some monsters that can regenerate, which makes his bloodline problems more confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel can only helplessly say: "Do all kinds of preparations, I don't dare to say that the expected date of birth is after nine months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we can't announce this news now." Janet said after thinking about it: "If you have elf blood, your pregnancy will increase." My magical lineage will make this time difficult to master. It is better to wait until the belly begins to grow up and tell them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also good. "Siegel nodded. "From now on, you should pay attention to raising your body. Don't be too hard. My recent research has progressed and I have figured out how to make the enchantment of the elemental rune guards huge. So I will I can ask Capricorn to stay in the city of Mire. There is her, the nobles in the south do not threaten our ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet has heard The voice of Siegel’s words. "Do you want to leave the territory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
