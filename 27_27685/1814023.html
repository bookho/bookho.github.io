There is a mysterious smile on his face, and it seems that everything is in the middle of calculation and mastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your room has nothing but the book." Chanem looked up and down after entering the gate. Siegel smiled a little and didn't answer. He used his points and spells to cover his cloned crystal enamel, and he didn't let Chanem see it - it was his card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel swept his sleeves, cleaned the reel on the table, moved the chair to the side, and invited Chanem to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you are ready." Chanem did not care about the lack of drinks and drinks, and sat down straight. His eyes sparkled with excitement, just like the ghosts who saw the treasure. "When did you start the clearance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clear the field?" Siegel snorted, then shook his head: "There is no need to clear the field, that is no for the final victory." Help, but also consume power in advance. I invite you not to hire a killer, but one thing to discuss with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like to speak with a knife. "Chenna's eyes narrowed and looked a little angry. "The time has been dragged on for a long time, and the knife will not be blunt again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If If you say this, I want to know how you think about Anna, how much do you have to deal with her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good question! I thought you would be the woman. Confused!" Chanem took a few shots first, and then he said: "I am coming earlier than you. At that time, the orc saint and the female elf Anna are already here. She recognized me, so she immediately turned to the orcs. At the time, I was busy learning spells to get points, so I didn't pay too much attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;" Later, the Magic Academy experienced a period of turmoil, the orc holy people opened the killing, no students can avoid this disaster. To be honest, even you, at that time can not survive." Chanem I licked my lips and said: "The orc holy person wants to kill me. I use my strategy to deal with him and let other students become my shield. Then I finally let Anna and the orc holy person turn against each other, and two people have committed a fight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Orc Master lost, and then resurrected?" Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the ending is a tie." Chanem replied: "According to the temper of the orc saint, the outcome is the most important, a tie is The most incredible thing, but it happened. The process of the battle was unknown, and the two parties never said it. After the showdown, the orc saints were quiet and not killed as before. Elf Anna also came out independently. , gradually become the current character."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing is eccentric, causing my attention, so I am tempted that the mage around me is close to Anna. After a while, these people seem to have no problem on the surface, but they have lost their fighting spirit, at least for Anna. I have never seen such a thing, those people seem to be unable to go to Anna, even a heavy sentence I don't want to say it. I found that I was also affected and I started to be too lazy to pay attention to this female elf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned and tried to understand the sacred murderer if. He thought of the Knox Commonwealth's mind-controlling spell, and he had a guess: "Is it similar to hypnotized effect, and is a deep hypnosis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I also have this consideration, but how likely do you think that me and the orc holy are hypnotized?" Chanem waved his hand: "Of course, don't be too influenced by me, if there is really one A kind of magic can affect the existence of the saint level without being noticed, so only you can find it. The orc has no good way, but I have an idea. Using the characteristics of the worm, I will think of myself. Hidden among countless worms, constantly changing and cleaning up, using cluster thinking to reduce the possibility of being controlled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good idea. But if you say this If something exists, why am I not affected?" Siegel licked his hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do I know this?" Chanem snorted. “Maybe your protective spells are more comprehensive? Our saints are used to using strong physical resistance to deal with threats, not as flexible as your mage.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"It’s like having a mirror!" Siegel nodded. "I understand it, Anna will give it to me. From what I know now, more than 80% of hers may be that person - or the incarnation of that person."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney’s eyes blinked and he slammed the table. “Are you sure?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I said, Eighty percent.” Siegel said: “He always appears in history as a master of prophecy, one after another. Before he was the identity of a female elf, he had existed in the art institute for a long time, but rarely appeared.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of time, she should have discovered the plan of the ten-faced scorpion, and when she tried to stop it, she left the sight of everyone. From the side of the elf, she is dead, but more likely she is gold shelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Holy One, every time you re-transform your image and identity and die once, it makes no difference. Why is Leer wasting energy on this? If it is necessary to control the world from a new perspective, how can it be more convenient than changing the growth of undead race? He can use the image of the heavenly creature to directly serve the starry royal family, so that it is not necessary to change the body for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, after the change of status, the efforts and achievements related to the previous identity are in vain? Lear will certainly not give up easily, always have to find a way to use it. When the Holy Spirit is transferred to the new body, the old body becomes a mortal. If it can make it move, it may be picked up by the School of Magic. After all, the rules and methods of picking magic must be the clearest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not the Orc Saint is intentionally or erroneously entered the Magic Academy, it is finally here to get started. He was the first student to pass the foggy mountain road and certainly triggered certain conditions. The female elf did not go from that mountain trail. She used other methods to enter here, which is different from everyone else. It is difficult to have other explanations except that the magic god has been pre-set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The possibility of 80% is already high enough, and we must find a way to clean up her." Chanem closed his eyes and thought for a while, but shook his head and said: "I have to rely on you to find a solution. I am worried that I will follow the footsteps of the orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel does not know if this is hypnotized, or Chanem It is a gesture, but it is obviously impossible to make him the killer of the murder god. Siegel knows his strengths and knows his shortcomings. Instead of gradually revealing the Master's cards in battles, it is better to solve them together at the last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite his full confidence, he never overestimates his strength. Even the Lions will do their best, not to mention confrontation with opponents of comparable strength. Even if other people are not as good at him as magic, is it equal to overall backwardness? Everyone will try their best to use their strengths and advantages, and fight as much as possible in their own field. Who does not have one or two unique skills? Before you have an absolute advantage, always unite as many people as possible and put yourself in a favorable position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem, the orc saint and himself, the goal is very clear, is the divine power of the god of magic. Three people can form a balance in combat ability, and this time Serge's mage character gives him an advantage - here is to choose the magic god, not the orc or murder god. The reason why he organized Chanet to kill the orc holy is also considered for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can completely win everyone, Siegel will never be soft. From the evidence currently available, this road will not work. The final outcome must be a melee, and the magical power will test the candidate's grasp of the situation. Siegel has been preparing for this situation, and naturally it is necessary to ensure the arrival of this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is one more thing, that person has more than one back hand." Siegel said: "If the lamp god is repaired, he will immediately Get the news, I believe he always has a way to come in. So I need you to do one thing, this is the only way I think of it might prevent him from coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Say, I try my best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need you to pay three lives, use the characteristics of the worm wizard, and split yourself into three." Geer said: "Even if it is split into three idiots, the key is to be an individual with independent thinking. The Magic Academy will treat these three people as new people and fill the nine places here."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know how much force your three lives need to spend on me? Not to mention that my strength will drop in a short time after the split, and it will take time to recover. This..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
