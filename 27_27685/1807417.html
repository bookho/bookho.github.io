He wore a piece of yellow-brown calf leather, and each of the reinforcing nails was polished, as if the rows of small stars were flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You bastard, I really thought that you have to pack it out for a while, and you still have free time to read here? I didn't expect you to be this. Kind of people, actually do not understand a little etiquette!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel snorted, put down the book in his hand, did not even get up, greeted: "Your Majesty "What else is there to come to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still told me to kneel down? I said this in my mouth, I still don't know how to swear at me." Wenyi kicked a chair off the table and sat up. "Ham led the Marquis, ** Master, don't pretend, you thought I haven't figured it out yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to understand?" Siegel did not expect it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it weren't for you, I must have sneaked into the trap of the Masters Association. But can you talk to me in a more polite way, I am so embarrassed." It’s also your king! Is it true that your Master is like this? If you have magic, you don’t look at others in your eyes. When you talk about it, it’s mysterious, secretive, and curved, and always thinks that others are fools?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that some mages have such problems, and even like to use ancient Chinese to conduct daily conversations, making the conversation atmosphere extremely strange. There is also the desire to incorporate dragon or elf language into everyday spoken language, which is also very difficult to understand. But Siegel thinks that he is not that kind of person. Is Evan thinking what is wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel had doubts, but still restrained himself, made an inscrutable expression, and tried to say: "Do you want to understand? You told me how to deal with the goblin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon’s face with a smug smile, his fingers point in the air, his face hanging A strange smile. "Gnomes are still to be destroyed, but the decision cannot be made by the kingdom of stars. I thought for a long time to understand what you mean in your words! You are right, if I do nothing. Directly approve the plan for the goblin, That will definitely have a negative impact on my subsequent rule. Everyone will treat me as a militant, impulsive king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also hope You are not.” Siegel sat down and looked at him, then said, “What are you going to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am going to get some people into the water. Evan said: "I decided to go to the temples with great fanfare. Ask them what to do. The Temple of War, the Lord of the Morning, the Mother of the Earth, and even the Temple of Death, of course, even the Masters Association is no exception. Even if they propose But I still have to ask for a formal question. Only then will I approve the plan. You are right, sometimes you can't do anything. But what do you choose to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely not what I thought at the time. Siegel was thinking. At that time, the most important thought in his mind was to avoid the Master League's planetary colonization plan, thus protecting the magical advantage brought by the Peruvian nuclear, and not letting himself fall into endless construction work. So Siegel angered Evan and chose to leave. What he said at the pre-conference meeting was his own sincerity, but he was actually not so paranoid. He had long known that this is not a world where the spirit of pure knights can survive. The history is full of countless compromises, and the number of adherence to the end is extremely rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But taking a closer look, Evan’s approach is indeed a better idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If multiple temples do not agree with this practice, then the Starry Royal Family has enough pretexts. Even the Masters Association and the Elf can do these temples." Persuasion work. I saw that the Aurora High Priest kept frowning at the Imperial Conference. Maybe it was going to the Temple of the Morning, and this thing could not go on. I should always be a god when I am a holy man. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded: "No matter what God says, or even say nothing, it is also an attitude. People in the private sector are experiencing difficulties." When I went back to the temple to pray, like the war on the plane of the plane, it is normal for the king to pray for it personally. In this way, any opinion of the gods can be your final decision. At that time There will be a lot less twists and turns in the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you didn't pay extra for my attitude." Siegel smiled. Now this is a moderate relationship and then a chance to stay, and you have to grasp it. The history of the rise and fall of the last Master of the Master is still in the hands. Maybe this time there will be different opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what book are you reading?" Evan asked curiously: "You left me and the entire ruling parliament and came here to see it." Hey, is that important?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking at the record of the last Master of the Master to see how he made himself home and ruined." Siegel smiled. "It's a pity that he didn't write how he was defeated. Otherwise I can learn from it and get some lessons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is there a possible reversal of knowledge for the future?" Evan said jokingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reversal never requires any knowledge." Siegel replied: "Intrinsic, external, all kinds of reasons may be caused, knowledge And skills are often the least important. Do you know what I found in the book? I only saw a conspiracy, a conspiracy to take advantage of it. Your Majesty, if things always look like the surface, how much can you save? "Trouble!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Walk with me, Siegel." Avon said: "You don't call me the King, just call my name. Then tell me a few words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, can I just say that I can’t talk about it?" Siegel said this, But still stood up and walked side by side with the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former guards have long driven away irrelevant people, leaving enough space for two people. They came to the sun from the library that was ruled by the candle, letting the last green leaf before the arrival of winter replace the ink full of history. Evan walked slowly, and Siegel followed slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the magical array of the palace already unable to stop you?" Evan suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't say that." Siegel replied: "This squad makes me very uncomfortable in choosing a spell. Many spells I can't show." But it can't stop me from forcing destruction. Simply speaking, there are a lot of fine tricks, but I can't use brute force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm," Avon After taking a deep breath, "Is it true that for some people in the Masters Association and the City, this magical array is just a display on one level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's right.” Siegel nodded. He has discovered this problem from the transmission of the dungeon. There are many places in the palace's statute that have failed, and there are traces of spells being spy in the near future. The Masters Association or the City of Learning has been eccentric, and maybe they are the main promoters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have always thought that the stars are solid." Evan shook his head. "You know that my father died from hunting, but you know Where is he dead? I will tell you. It is not in the hunting ground outside the city, but after returning from hunting, he died in the palace. He inexplicably fell from immediately and then rolled down the steps. More than a dozen steps. Although he has been a great blessing, but in the past he was a good warrior, never imagined that he would be so embarrassed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Looking at him, I found Evan's face covered with clouds: "So, are you suspecting someone's usage tricks?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I prefer not, but This thing makes me sleepy. The wiki has been checked, but I am afraid it is difficult to find the answer.” Evan said: “The Masters Association and the City of Learning are too strong and have threatened the rule of the kingdom. It is also difficult to compete with the Masters in the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also a Master, you gave me this suit you? "Siegel waved his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a mage, but it is very pedantic." Evan said: "You like to study spells, but hate everything except this, especially Troubled politics. Before the Master, you were a knight, or a knight who had never experienced aristocratic life. Then you became the lord, on the one hand, the desire of the Viscount Bill, on the one hand to raise funds for your spell research. Duke of Carlyle I once said that you are a very simple person. The most unlikely thing for you to do at the moment is rebellion. He said that you are also a genius in the Master, so you become very proud, and you don't bother to do that kind of thing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
