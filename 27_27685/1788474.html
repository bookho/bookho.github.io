			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was reluctant, after a day, with the constant urging of the gnomes, Naria went to Shack with Siegel. ?? 壹 reading ww?w·1?k?anshu·cc along the way, the two Masters did not say anything, always kept silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are far away from the manor and never touch the enchantment of detecting magic. Narya sprinkled a lot of powder of casting material into the air, letting them fly in the direction of the lawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the use of this?" Siegel broke the disgusting silence: "The stuffing material powder does not touch the spell trap, but Is there any help in investigating the structure of the statute?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to explain these spells to you, your ability to cast spells is not very strong, should I can understand it myself." In the words of Naria, the tone of rejection is very obvious, and Siegel is no longer open, and the province touches nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a cargo team consisting of three four-wheeled carriages passed through the gates of the manor, transporting dozens of boxes and barrels of different sizes. Go in. After a while, the servants in the manor filled several large boxes with rubbish and pushed them into the car. Siegel thought for a moment, and after talking to Naria, he separated and he caught up with the three carriages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage went all the way to the west, came to a river valley, then dumped the garbage here and cleaned the boxes with the river. When everyone was busy, a strong man with short, thick black hair was not working, sitting in the carriage and looking at a piece of paper in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel uses magic to strengthen his vision and finally sees the note clearly. Above is a list of the goods that Shaq Manor will ask them to ship next time. A lot of food and clothes must be delivered before dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimation of the frequency of dumping and delivery they dumped, Siegel probably knows that the number of people in the manor is around eighty. When the truck fleet was carrying things, about servants came out to help. Then double the number of servants to the upper limit, then the rest of the people...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he was calculating, a sharp arrow smashed from the bushes The sly shot came over and scared him. I want to read the book w?ww?·1?k?anshu·cc He saw a broken branch hanging on a tree trunk not far away, helplessly swaying with the wind. It was this branch that blocked him and changed the direction of the arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He responded immediately. Rolled back and left. Another arrow, wearing it over the leaves of the holly, with a bang, shot into the place where he had just stood. Siegel took the dust of the stars and the epee at the same time. Blocked in front of yourself. He saw eight people standing on the road, the ones who had just delivered the goods and dumped the garbage. However, at this time they held long swords and cymbals in their hands, and there was a short bow in the hands of one person, all of which were a look of "you are dead". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "White-haired robbers must be the spies of the elves. I want to rob us." The man with black hair said: "You can't let this dregs destroy Kay." The tranquility of the town!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegels swept around and determined that there were no other witnesses nearby. Because there is the stench of garbage, it is rarely seen, it is a place suitable for war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately began to recite the spell, his fingers flipped, and the elemental energy jumped excitedly. The seven men waved their weapons and rushed over to him, and they shouted in their mouths. An arrow shot at Siegel's body, but the untrained shooter again deviated from the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of starry mist flows from Siegel’s cuffs, and the reflection in the sun shines like a golden sand. The seemingly viscous fog slid down the hillside with great speed, and quickly obscured the sight of all attackers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about people? Where did you go?" they shouted. Trying to find the location of Siegel. In the fog, it seems that there is a shadowy image everywhere, and my heartbeat and breathing are clearly audible. But after a while, all the attackers stood on the hillside and their arms drooped as if they were asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel continues to focus on the soul of the fog spell. This spell is a bit overkill for ordinary people. It is impossible to resist this spell without special training or a firm belief. After he determined that he was safe, he walked into the fog and pressed his palm against the attacker's forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel withdrew the fog and talked with them. When he transferred the topic to Shaq Manor. These people’s eyes clearly cast envious and embarrassing emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only to become a core member of the Solidarity, you can enter the manor and get the blessing of the murder god. Oh, I wish I could have that chance. Justice Warrior The armor is so powerful, the weapons are shining, I have to wear it once in my life. It is really alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I become a core member?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must have the skills to defend your partner and be able to expel evil threats. Although we are not talented, we will succeed if we work hard!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people are always full of fighting spirit and think that they have not done anything. This spirit is very good, but it is not efficient. No one can do anything to succeed, and there must be good and not good at it. I have always tried to create opportunities to do good things. I have never heard of hard work to choose the best way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After asking, these people are only responsible for transporting goods, handling garbage and other peripheral debris, and do not understand things in the manor. Through their words, Siegel can only make various speculations and cannot obtain more detailed information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is still a core member in the town, I want to visit." Siegel’s kind smile caught them, and several people screamed. The members of the Solidarity all told Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of castles is not counted. There were more than 500 people in the town, but now there are only three hundred. After many people became core members, they left their homes to complete the glorious mission and went to the surrounding towns for publicity. 66 continued, many poor people came to Kaibu to become members of the new Solidarity. Most of them entered the Shak Manor for training, so the power of the murder god is also growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only six core members remaining in the town, four of whom are knights living in the castle. Unless Siegel reveals a noble title, it is impossible for an adventurer to enter the castle without being summoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recording the names and residences of the other two people, Siegel would say goodbye to these new friends. He returned to the Shak Manor and found Naria who had completed his exploration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing back?" The female mage was busy with her own hands and didn't even return. She is trying to explore the alert spelling array and seems to have found a way to not guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has no explanation for the mood, but only if she is safely sent back to the inn can be assured. As soon as the thinness came, Naria, who had been busy for a day, dragged her tired body and urgently needed a good meal to ease her mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the Master is fine, so I plan to go to the core members of the Solidarity to "dig" some information. Although the gnome Jagger prepared a rich dinner, steaming and fragrant, but Siegel had no appetite at all, just left the longan bread and two grilled sausages with a handkerchief. He had not yet stepped out of the wind-lighting range in front of the inn, and saw the little boy Regis dragging a piggyback and came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master’s heart sighed, and Regis appeared too frequently and too coincidentally. How could it be no problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big... people, meet again, I am here to find gnome Jagger to take cheese money." Regis said after a deep bow: "I haven't thank you for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is something you can do for me." Siegel said: "I am full and want to go out." Go, there is a place for fun in this town, you just take me for a trip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, you wait for me." Little boy running Into the hotel, and then ran out soon. There was a bag in his back, and the copper plates inside collided with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not expect Arnold to follow. He didn't say anything, just looked at the wizard with a serious look. After Siegel shook his head, he nodded again and waved his hand to the priest, motioning him to go back with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is there a place where you can sleep quietly?" Siegel patted the back neck of Regis and gently tapped his collar with his thumb. . The mark of the murderer's servant turned into two tears and black spots, and it seems that he must do something that can raise the class. Poor child, does he know what kind of path he is taking? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
