			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf swooped over and the huge body covered the moonlight. +, far away, Siegel can smell the stench that comes out of it. It is the smell of blood and body fermenting on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The canine hides the figure when the werewolf charges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel began to gradually step up and rush along the hillside. His soft boots stepped on the ground all over the gravel and weeds, like a little water, without a tremor. This is the result of combining the lightness, acceleration and elf steps. After Siegel resumed martial arts training, he had already recovered the original feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defensive staff disguised as an epee shines, and Siegel's spell is released. His figure swayed, and seven identical white-haired face swordsmen rushed up the hill from different angles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a warlock! Warlock! Not a Paladin. I want his brain, I want his blood!" The ghost screamed and waved his hand. Bundle a bunch of straw and pour a bottle of yellow-green unidentified liquid on it. The straw caused a fire and burned in the hands of the ghost. She forgot to shout: "Go, my fire elves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plastic can be spelled, Siegel would not be the strongest mage But when it comes to summoning elements, I am afraid that the entire federation will recognize that Siegel is ahead of everyone in this respect. The "Jie" of the assault is about to hit the werewolf, and then be besieged like a knight's flame summoner, and an invisible canine lurks on the side. But he didn't panic, he slammed the epee on a rock and restored it to the staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pinches the law, the voice of the spell is quick and clear. More than twenty black flame chains are instantly extended from the staff, and they are respectively captured to the enemy trying to besiege him - the monster is fixed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Fire Elemental Doghead" is stupid. There will only be one action. That is the forward charge attack. They don't evade. Being caught by the chain. The elements that maintain the power of these fire monsters enter Siegel's range of perception, and he immediately focuses his attention on the monster's body structure. With only a few thoughts, Siegel figured out the structure of this elemental creature, using the power of the chain to break it up and turn it back into a free element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, they are summoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf tried to dodge in the prancing, but still wrapped around the neck with a snake-like flexible chain. The huge curse shook his bones through the chain and then passed into the brain. Only for a moment. The werewolf found that he lost control of his body, just like being paralyzed. He couldn't adjust the balance in the run and rolled down the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chain turns into an arc and penetrates into the air. Only heard a scream, the invisible canine was also wrapped around his neck. However, as a magical creature, the dog's resistance to the spell is still above the werewolf, so he can still act and struggle to pull the chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black flame burns on the spellchain, and the more struggling, the more Mars splash out. Burn it on its fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flame cannot be extinguished, at least not with his palms and claws. The canine began to deform immediately. Quickly shrink your body and try to break the chains. The chain formed by spells is just a visualization of a spell, not an entity, so it changes accordingly as his body shape changes. The dog demon found that his skin was burnt through, the flame penetrated into the muscle tissue, and a green fireworks ignited in the gap of the tendon. He was terrified and panicked that his body stopped moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he found that the flame also stopped burning and the pain in the body was slowed down. The canine realized that the damage of the flame was closely related to his own movement, so before he thought about how to crack the flame, he decided not to move until he was burned into a skeleton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel left a defensive staff, and the body control controlled the canine and the werewolf. As for the flame on the dog? It was just the sensory illusion that the fixed spell brought him, not real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't try to fly away or send, ghosts, those spells will only expose more of your flaws, let me start better." Siegel turns Long sword, draw three arcs on the side of the body. "The only way you can leave here today is to kill me and step on my body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land trembled and the gravel rolled down the hillside, revealing the soil that was constantly creeping underneath. Then a dry hand came out from the ground, followed by the head and shoulders. Siegel looked at the zombies, which had five appearances and their own eight points, in front of the demon, threatening with dark eyes, teeth and claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This spell is useless to me," Siegel said. "It's better to dispel the herd. How do I give you a happy ending?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hume!" The ghost screamed angrily: "Up! Offensive! His limbs are a reward for you!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel held the dust of the star in his left hand, took a nail from the small pocket on his waist in his right hand, and then recited the spell. The nails instantly become hot and then emit bright lightning. Lightning jumped from each zombie, rounding it back and forth twice, burning them all into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The smoldering of the elemental elements of the gas element." Siegel throws away the useless nails and continues to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost Demon trembled and said: "Chain lightning! You are not... not a demon, you are a mage, a powerful mage. I surrender, I surrender "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finished squatting, then slammed her head and hands to the ground, and ten fingers were inserted into the soil. "I surrendered, I surrendered..." she kept saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are still mobilizing the energy of the earth element but don't say it, he told me that you want to ambush me." Siegel stopped and the sword crossed In front of you. "I have always been curious about the magical ability of the demon ghost, and I want to know how you balance the elemental spells and healing spells. I wanted to ask you, but it seems impossible for you to tell me your spells." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghosts slammed their heads up, dusty and sloppy faces with distorted malice: "Dead, Master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large earth element was summoned from the ground and shook his fist at Siegel. But this is not a real earth element. It is a clay figurine disguised by a ghostly demon. The magic power of the Golem is very strong. If the mage uses the anti-calling ability to deal with the earth elements. That will surely be seized by the clay golem, breaking the protection of defensive spells. Nowadays, the ghost demon does not want a complete body, and some broken flesh can satisfy her appetite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clay Golem punches and penetrates directly from Siegelâ€™s body. "Phantom!" Ghosts recognized at first sight, but it was too late. Her nose with a knotted nose smelled the lilac, and the dry, split ends felt the fluctuations in the transmission of magical energy. Siegel left a phantom in the place, and then flashed behind the ghost demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next move is done in one go: Siegel's right hand touches the magic. Broken armor, shield and protective good spells, his left hand slammed with the dust of the stars. The body of the ghost demon is like a hard wood, and the feeling of stagnation is constantly transmitted through the long sword. She tried to stand up from the ground, so she put her hands and feet up. Kesig died and held her, and the sword continued to press down until it penetrated from her chest and nailed straight to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost demon body shook, and then the whole crouched in the gravel pile, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't pretend, I know you have two hearts. You have two hearts in your ghosts." Siegel casts a spell on the dust of the stars. Keep it firmly in the dirt. "Besides the human heart. It's still the heart of a ghost. I just pierced the first one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil slammed his eyes open and struggled with his hands and feet. Do not hesitate to smash your body, but also try to get down from the sword. The broken body can be repaired with the blood and life of the living creature, but if the second heart is damaged, it can no longer be restored. The dust of the star is only the edge of the sword, and the blade is completely blunt, so the demon can't use it to cut through its tough body tissue. And Siegel's spells temporarily merged the long sword with the rock beneath it, and the ghost-winged woman was kneeling on the rock, and she couldn't lift herself up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage with his hands empty, standing behind her, watching her struggle, asked: "Why do you attack with a beast?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon ghost twisted his head back, but only one eye could see Siegel. It is this single eye that also reveals endless hatred and madness. "You don't want to know, you can't think about it! I won't tell you anything! I want the secret to be in my head, hahahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
