			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the chair and came to the young man and stopped him. Then Siegel crouched down and picked up the ankle with his hand and looked at it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as the orc bundled slave's ankle system, he can also see the words "slave" with the lingua franca and the orc language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is half-squatting, just as high as the boy. He looked at the boy's eyes and asked, "What is your name? Why are you tied up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call it the second, call me the second child. "The young man’s eyes are dodging, and he seems to be afraid of Siegel. He did not want Siegel to touch him, so after answering the question, he took two steps back and hurried away, then picked up the rag to clean up the principle of Siegel's table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees how he runs away, always feeling that his back is a bit familiar. ‘Maybe because it’s the same as seeing people on those slave ships, it’s a group of people who are fearful and miserable. 'He stood up straight, came to the bar, knocked on the table with his hand, called the listless boss, and then asked him: "What happened to the boy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The boss blinked and smiled and said: "Guest, what do you want to drink? You can ask questions here, no one will bother you. And if you are willing to pay, I can help you. Look for the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shenzhen City can not keep slaves, this is one of the local laws." Siegel did not care about the boss, he did not want intelligence, Just want the result. So he said directly: "The young man can't be tied up by the slave's anklet, you must let him be free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hah, this adult, I don't know which corner you got out of, and the Cavalier novel has seen more?" The boss said, while the cup on the counter was packed under the counter, he said: "I advise you not to do anything here!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can tell which is really fierce and which is bluffing. The owner of the pub belongs to the latter, and there is always a wave of hesitation in his eyes. But with his words, there were a few black shadows in the corner, they were wearing large cloaks, and there were weapons of varying lengths under the cloak. The three men surrounded him from behind and stood next to Siegel. Among them was a tall head, a pair of headscarves with a headscarf, staring at Siegel with a gloomy gaze. He first opened his mouth and said: "The stranger, the boss said that you should not do anything, you are far from the gossip! The moonlight does not welcome you like people who are here, this is a peaceful place, so give me a quick start "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two, one is fat and short, the other is tall and thin, they hold their fists, and the knuckles make a loud noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s hand held the handle and then stared at the owner of the pub: “The use of slaves will attract at least the exile of punishment. Someone came to control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the boss looked away from the gaze and asked the three people for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! How many years have you not encountered a stupid knight here?" Mazi's face is full of beer, garlic and laughter, covering his ears He said: "MD, don't go out, don't want to live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel turned to look at the three people, calmly asked: "It seems Are you responsible here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it!" Mazi screamed and reached for Siegel. He tried to hold his shoulders, but his fingers sneaked to the neck, ready to go to Siegel's throat. The other hand of Mazi's face stretched out to Siegel's waist, trying to stop him from pulling out the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not willing to show weakness, his shoulders are shaking, using the spine to break free of the hand of the pockmark, while kicking his heel, let the latter Lose balance and stumble on the bar. Siegel pulled the knife out of the sheath and opened the dagger that stabbed him to the chest with a shank. The dagger flew up to the ceiling and slammed into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the guests looked at it with great interest, and some people also raised their glasses and hoped that this "performance" would be more exciting. Only the couple of women accompanying the wine screamed hysterically, and the sound was harsh and escaped from the gate. The hotel owner trembled and hurried back. But behind him was the wall, so he had nowhere to escape, so he was huddled on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short fat man rushed up and held a short stick in his hand. The stick is tied to the wrist with a belt and is set with a lot of round nails, which are full of blood stains - he likes to use this stick to beat other people's stomachs, and then see how they vomit blood, which can bring him great satisfaction. sense. Siegel slashed from the bottom and forced the short fat man to block with the stick. However, the shoddy weapons are much different from the weapons from the dwarves' skillful craftsmanship, and the sticks are actually cut into two segments. Before the fat man reacted, the sharp scimitar was placed around his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mazi’s face stood up with his hand on the bar and he pulled out the short sword from his waist and wanted to launch a surprise attack from behind. Siegel has been paying attention to him, using his free hand to draw the dagger, while taking into account the battle in both directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the dagger slammed into the blade of the short sword, and then cut the dagger into two pieces like a hot knife. This dagger is too sharp, and what happens when it happens. Siegel didn't want to kill people for the time being, so he didn't use the dagger. He could only use his fist to slam on the bridge of the face of Mazi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You! You actually..." Mazi yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is another punch, another punch, then the fourth punch. Ma Zi's nose and nose are powdery and bloody. He turned his eyes to the middle, lost consciousness, and slipped softly on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel inserts the dagger back into his waist, and then hits the upper chin with a high-heeled punch on the hook, so that he will not continue to hold the fingertips. Called, so I stunned this person. The chunky scream of the neck with a scimitar shivered, his face was full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, can you talk now?" Siegel said: "I will slowly put the knife back into the scabbard, if If there is any threat, then the knife will be cut into the neck, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man nodded and raised his hands very high. Siegel wiped the machete on his clothes, wiped the blood, and then took the knife into the sheath. "Well, can you talk about the use of slaves now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-skinned man rushed to use his eyes to point to the boss of the moonlight and said: "And us It doesn't matter, he knows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss still squatted on the floor behind the bar, but was stunned by Siegel. He looked at the situation in the pub - all the customers were drinking and talking on their own, and no one was willing to take care of this business. Some of the very real guys who came here are never doing anything that is not good, and things that are troublesome are far away. And if no one reports, the city guards will not pay attention to what happened here. This is the normal state of the moonlight. In fact, the boss still hopes that someone can save him. It is because of this three things that the boss dares to leave a small slave to work, obedient and save a sum of money. Until I met a nosy, "Knight", it is completely different from the style here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I assure you that the adult, this slave is not mine." The tavern owner shook his head quickly: "A businessman has been here - of course I am not sure about him." Is it really a businessman, maybe a slave trader? Yes, a slave trader came here and lived for a week, a very awkward guy. He left without a word, then left such a small slave, and Ugly and stinky. He still owes me five silver coins, so I let the slave of this guy work and repay. I am going to let him go after he has finished his work! I swear!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel suddenly reached out to the tavern owner and said fiercely: "Give me the key to the ankle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss subconsciously touched The lower back, then stopped his hand. He lifted his eyelids to see Siegel, showing a sly smile: "This key is placed in the upstairs room, the slave dealer left, but not mine."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, has he finished the work of 5 silver coins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, he just finished."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the key and walked over to the thin boy, squatting down and opening his ankle. The boy looked nervously around, his ankles were wounds, and the layers of knots were thick and thick, which was shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ankle fell on the floor and made a crisp sound. The boy stayed for a moment, then turned and ran. Siegel quickly grabbed it and said to him: "You can't go this way now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
