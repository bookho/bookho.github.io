Www*xshuotxt/com He still seems to be able to see the splash of blood, and hear the sound of Brett's inhaling in his throat - the sound of dying. And the cheers of the cheers in the stands are like dreams far from the horizon. "He is still just a child. Who made him do such stupid things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not your fault, Siegel, don't blame yourself." Janet comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have any blame. In the duel, whether you are born or dead, it's just a contest of will and skill. I won't blame myself. But I have to find out. What is wrong with the Rifen family, why do you need to know this answer repeatedly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take this to the Guard, all in the city of Miele People will cooperate with us," Mana suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. At the same time, the task is publicly released, so that the capable adventurer can provide assistance." The Master said: "Whether it is a real message or a fake message." Any message can't be let go. This can also indicate my position: the Griffin family is deceived or coerced, and Heim's collar does not think that the Griffin family has become hostile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a good idea, dear." Janet nodded hard and then took Siegel’s hand and said to him, "Let’s continue watching the rifle game now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witt Griffin's body and his weapon were taken away by his servant and pretended to be sent back to his family. Heim’s spies have already followed up, pretending to be ordinary residents and exploring their situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The galloping horse and the heroic knight, the stabbing rifle and the broken shield, the splashing wooden shield fragments and the screaming screams of the stilts, the contest is soon Filled with these things. The spirit of the Cavaliers renewed their strength at this time, but Siegel was already disheartened. He gave up the idea of ​​participating in the sword game and decided to be a lord for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers have a round of competition, the Cavaliers who can advance to show their extraordinary skills. Siegel or applause, or cheer, give them blessings. If this will be the last big contest in the mainland, let the participants always leave an unforgettable impression! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every round of the riding competition. It will start the game of swordsmanship and take the form of melee. Dozens of fighters were concentrated in the racetrack, fighting for themselves with "safe" weapons. Even the sword of wood can cause death, so you want to save your life. The most important thing is to shout "surrender!" in time. Witt Griffin has made a wrong demonstration in this regard, and everyone has accepted this lesson. Therefore, although the scene of the contest is chaotic, it is good to have no life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dad, I am sleepy, I want to go back." Isaac yawned. There is also the juice of the berry in the corner of the mouth, and the belly is also bulging. He can insist on watching it for a morning, it is already amazing. So Siegel nodded and let Janet take him back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow passes over their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is certainly not a cloud. Everyone looked up and saw a huge gryphon flying over the racecourse. Its golden feathers reflect the luster of gold in the sun, and the red feathers in the black claws and tail feathers illustrate its variety: this is a royal gryphon, the largest and most powerful of the gryphon. Also the smartest class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's fast, the gas element is chasing behind it, and it always misses it. This gryphon must have been specially trained. I have a lot of experience on how to make a move in the air. Although the gas element can project the spear of lightning, it is deceived by the fake action of the griffin and has been hit in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the people were attracted by the gryphon in the air, and even Isaac did not feel sleepy, clapping his hands. The noon sun shook many people's eyes, but everyone still wants to capture the beautiful appearance of the gryphon. Behind it, the number of gas elements began to increase, and four large gas elements have been chased from different directions. The cross-network formed by lightning is increasingly restricting its flight. It won't take long for the Griffin to be hit. Then it becomes clumsy because of the paralysis or wound caused by the current, and is finally caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this beast bravely rushed to the element of anger, even if the other party turned itself into a violent wind, he did not hesitate to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel blinked. Shake his head. When everyone was puzzled, he pointed his fingers to the sides. Among the crowds on the crowd, several people are constantly approaching. They lowered their eyes, but the steps under their feet were not flustered and walked forward in an orderly manner. These people wore servant clothes, but they did not take anything in their hands. Only the long sleeves were bulging inside. The surrounding knight suddenly understood and immediately rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s gaze did not leave the “tamer” and looked at it coldly. The light of magic swayed in his eyes, but there was a force on the animal trainer that blocked the spell of detection. The guards of Heim's escorts aimed at these "Assassins" with even the power of the pulp, and the heavy-duty guards carrying the long axes will soon come. Mana took the sword and stood on the side of Siegel, and Janet hugged Isaac, ready to use the transfer head ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage raised his hand, and the flame appeared out of thin air, accompanied by a squeaking voice, directly igniting the gryphon in the air. The black and red mixed fire radiated a raging heat under the screaming combustion, and then the barbecued meat fell to the ground in the scattered feather fireworks. The swordsman of the contest hurriedly escaped, but he left a saliva because of the aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people in the Griffin family are in the city of Mith, should they be sent to death?" Siegel said suddenly: "You The body exudes the taste of deformability, but it is not a magic spell. There are not many creatures with this natural ability. Which one are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bearded man's face stood up straight, shook his shoulders, and the guards who grabbed his arm smashed out. The burst of crosshairs immediately provoked, and the continuous scorpion stabbed into his body. With only one blink of an eye, he has at least more than 30 short sticks on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! This thing is really painful!" said the sly face man. He raised his hands and smiled at Siegel: "We will meet again, young mage, you are not far from paying back the promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mana waved her hand and shouted: "Hay's Knight! Offensive!" The Heim Collar Guard, equipped with a full set of magical weapon armor, immediately began to charge, taking the second wave of plasma crossbow as the pilot, javelin and fly. The axe was the second wave of offensive, followed by sharp rifles and giant axes. The element of gas flew down from the air to assist in the attack. They have dazzling lightning in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the man waved his hands up and showed the original shape. The arm turns into a double wing, and the inflated body has a thick neck and a long tail. The plasma sputum inserted in the body was squeezed out by the scales and fell to the ground. A pair of yellow eyes on the green faucet shimmered. Dangerous corrosive acid is dripped from the broken teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Assassin" captured by the knights on both sides of the Siegel, all turned into a mixture of green and yellow smoke, slamming from their grasp disappear. The smell of sour smell made them cough, but there were no other symptoms, and the cough quickly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God of the Warrior! Dragon! A Green Dragon!" Excited Isaac yelled. But being held tightly by Janet, this did not rush forward. The knights who came to the competition looked complicated, mixed with fear and excitement, but were replaced by ecstatic. They picked up the game with a blunt instrument at hand and even rushed up with bare hands. Siegel saw a lot of people coming to the stands and trying to use his fanaticism to kill the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite stands, the audience is running away, you push me in the crowd, many people fall to the ground. But I don't know if I was scared, or I have absolute confidence in Siegel. More people just stood up and looked at the dragon under the rostrum with a more focused look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You passed, the holder of fate. You are not tempted, not afraid of challenges, always put yourself in a favorable position, and are alert enough." The dragon said: "You are growing fast, but I will go to the next one. When I finish, I will come back to you and look forward to seeing you next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, picking up his fist in the air and then forcefully down. Mana immediately ordered: "Stop the attack, all the guards!" The guards heard the order and immediately stood still, staring at the green dragon with vigilant eyes. Only the pickpockets are busy changing the clips. After all, this is not a command to withdraw, and the battle preparation can not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at the fact that we fight side by side, I don't have to attack you with magic." Siegel said to the green dragon: "But you caused a lot Big confusion, why bother? If you want to come to me next time. Come directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All this is necessary, Master Siegel. "The green dragon bowed slightly and put the tail up." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
