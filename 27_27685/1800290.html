			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second magical spaceship was delivered by the Federation to the King’s King’s Room, and the six official federations of the Federation became “Royal Masters”. With the first batch of eight people stay in Wangdu, execute the king's order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Winged and the Griffin Legion boarded two magical spaceships respectively, and the world’s first truly air force was officially established. All the lords of the Starry Kingdom understand one thing, that is, King Avon’s dominance is unprecedentedly high and has become the head of the kings of all ages. The cavalry, the city walls, and the trebuchets, which originally marked the highest force, became a smattering of smoke, and they were useless in the face of air strikes. High maneuverability nowadays not only refers to the speed of movement, but now also represents the ability to strike across terrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The times have changed, the plane war has become a three-dimensional, then the warriors should also make corresponding changes. How to change has become a big problem, and many people with some visions have begun to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the goblin’s musket weapons flowed into the civil society through the channels of the Masters Association, and many lords believed that the weapons had sufficient range to deal with the air strikes, and against the knights. It is the easiest way to transform, so I started to introduce and learn. In this regard, Evan screamed and thundered, in the name of smuggling weapons issued to the Master Association, severely banned the lords to privately equipped with firearms weapons. Although he also promulgated regulations and equipped firearms of the corresponding number and scale with the height of the title, this law does not really deter production. Trying to strengthen your own armed forces is what every lord is doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters Association assured Evan through the school city that it was a mistake to leak the weapon before, and this will not happen again in the future. On the other hand, the manufacturing drawings of the musket were leaked again, and even the formula of the ammunition was known to several big lords. The lords were worried about the magical spaceship of His Majesty, so the new arms race was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can influence the political stability of the starry kingdom at any time by the counseling of the masters of the city. Evan has only one choice, that is to appease, and to establish a strategic group closely surrounding the royal family as soon as possible. At this time, if the school counselor is removed or the power of a certain lord is removed, it is easy to "fire". Lead to a chain of chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repression is OK, and the magical spaceship Evan has an absolute victory. But what are the benefits of being beaten and being their own territory and people? The Masters Association will not be stupid enough to force Evan to break the boat and heal the wounds, and he will act within the tolerance of His Majesty. For example, constantly ask when you can rebel, then join the development of the crystal wall channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are ready, the crystal wall passage is enough for the king's warship to pass." The Masters Association said: "When the king's power arrives, the goblin will run away from the wind." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Evan was sober, and the Union brought Siegel’s secret letter. It details the level of armed forces and equipment of the goblin. This information is much more terrible than that provided by the Masters Association, even to the extent of "sensationality." Looking at the two studies on the earth goblin in front of him, Evan knew that one of them was lying. He believed that it was not Siegel, but he could not understand what was the purpose of the Masters Association if they deliberately deceived them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Star Kingdom takes out the mobile force, put 300,000 cavalry and a magical spaceship into the world of the opposite goblin, then? Even if they all die opposite, what benefits can the Master Association get? How can Evan not find the motive of the Masters Association? And elves, and dwarves, what role did they play in this matter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan couldn’t help but think of the Dwarf King meeting. The attitude of several ethnic saints. Is this another trap for the human race? But what about the bait, trigger, and purpose of the trap? The situation he faced was very weird, which made him a little overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, is it to send a part of the soldiers in exchange for time to appease the domestic lords and rectify the order of the kingdom; or continue to follow the conservative method? Evan has some uncertain ideas, and his ministers also hold the same word, but they still take the majority of the opinions of the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know that it is a trap and step on it?" Evan kept asking himself in his heart. The Masters Association is aggressive in the dark, and the enchanted group of lords are eager to move. Will these be alleviated because they sent troops into the wall channel? Eventually he discovered that this was originally a few unrelated issues, and the Masters Association tried to tie them together and put pressure together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it possible for the lords to send their soldiers to participate in the Battle of the Crystal Wall, so that they can do both?" Someone suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why isn’t it justified to strengthen the lord’s arming?" Another person raised objections: "Even the Royal Guard did not complete the rifle dressup, why? Give this opportunity to the following lords?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a good opportunity to weaken them and strengthen the rule of the king!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will only make some people's ambitions expand. Let the balance between the lords disappear, the country will definitely fall into chaos!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time This is the case, Evan looked at the group of ministers in his hands into a quarrel. The Imperial Council was meticulous and conscientious in executing orders, but it was difficult to get them to come up with an idea, and eventually the King’s problem would be thrown back to the King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please take down the sacred sect, how should we act?" Sure enough. Every time the result is like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan shook his head, not only accepting and not accepting the only choice: "The Masters Association is not in a hurry, let them issue a detailed operational plan. The investigation, marching, logistics, strategy and tactics are all written on paper, clearly and clearly. If you write well, I will organize an army to lend them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Song Shengming!" This sentence is always the most tidy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan lost the problem to the Masters Association. The purpose of the detailed plan is to be responsible for what the Master Association has said to himself, in a black and white way. And lending it an army, it also allowed the kingdom of stars to jump out of this matter and push the dominance of the matter to the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving this reply, Lear was not surprised. He took out a few more letters and said to his students: "Start the next stage. Several of you are going to the New World and carrying out a difficult mission. Who wants to shoulder this burden?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please ask the teacher to tell." Several voices answered together, just like the former parliament screamed at the holy Ming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You all know that the magical spaceship of the Federation, based on the Peruvian nuclear core, can play an extremely important role." Lear said: "This is The progress of magic, but also the beginning of the union's attempt to independence. Once magic and secular power are combined, can the Master focus on research? The power of power will make the Master kill each other, and eventually the magic will be lost in the game of power. Learn. City, why only people with poor spelling ability will go to school to be consultants, but need me to manage the school? It is to prevent the situation of the Master of the Master. Now the Federation tries to tie up with the Star Kingdom, they The primary goal is to learn the city, and then the Masters Association. This is meaningless internal friction. We cannot let this happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, teacher ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that the Federation will be able to return to the original Mage organization in the Three Peaks Period. I have contacted some of these wise Masters. The biggest obstacle is the Siegel Squid. He is a genius mage, but he is too far on the road of power. His prestige is the source of the fall of the Confederation and the heavy burden of improvement. Remember, our purpose is not to eliminate the West. Geer, but let Siegel become a pure master, not a lord of the Master who is accused. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students face each other but still In unison, "Yes, teacher!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that Lear is very clear about Siegel’s political weakness. After using Siegel as his main opponent, Lear used various means to collect Siegel's intelligence, study his character and weaknesses, and formulate layers of plans. In some ways, these plans are even more rigorous than the plans to get Knox spells through the federation and then let them both die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel naturally does not know this, he is only focused on doing what he can. After three trials, the Xingsuo Magic Spacecraft has the ability to start missions. In order to be able to maintain better confidentiality, the existence of the star and the specific details of the mission did not inform the federation at all. The entire Heim collar only knows Janet and Mana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My body is underground this time, I want to wake up only through Raven Barron." Siegel said to Janet: "Remember Live, in any case, bring Baron to your side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
