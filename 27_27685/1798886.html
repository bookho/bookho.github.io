			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the equipment and wand that adapt to the environment, I don’t bring anything this time. @@ ” Siegel said to Janet: "You rest assured, my The real body is still in the city of Miru, and the opposite is just a projection, there will be no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet bite his lower lip and hold it hard Siegel, buried his head in his chest. "You always like to take risks, but only you can go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the moment, only I have mastered the spell of astral projection, so I am safest." Siegel stroked Janet's long hair and patted her back: "The Capricorn is not there, but my body is in the city of Mire. If you are in danger, let the Raven Baron wake me up." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ordered the magical enchantment of the city of Mith to enter a state of alert, and then simply bid farewell to Isaac, and cast a star projection to the north Wall channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer describe in detail how the federation can dig this channel, and there is no need to introduce all the layers of the magical protection array here. In fact, even Siegel I have no patience to look at the masterpieces of the protective division masters. The passage of Mora's scorpion is represented by a huge amethyst. It is said that the passage of the kingdom of stars is a group of black smoke that never dissipates. The northern passage of the Walled Mountain Range is a silver-white pool of water that reflects much like mercury but is much lighter than mercury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation only set aside the pool area that just enough for one person to pass through, and Siegel had to be a group to jump in. The process of crossing this wall channel is full of pain because there is no blessing of divine power. The cold punctured the skin deep into the bone marrow and seemed to freeze the whole body of Sigel. His consciousness became dull. The focus on spells is hard to maintain, and even the astral projections feel dangerous. I want to take him back to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the process was very short. After three seconds, Siegel came across the opposite side and all discomfort disappeared at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a closed, bright cave where countless ice crystals are stacked on top of each other to form an incalculable number of mirrors. There is a slight fluorescence on the top, bottom, left and right, and it should be after thousands of reflections and refractions before entering the cave. A silvery pool of water is in the center of this cave. Surrounded by shimmering icicles. Siegel is now lying on the ground next to the pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his body. Reluctantly find a space to stand up, then straighten up, then he feels that there is a cold wind blowing. It seems that the cave is not completely closed and there should be a gap between the icicles. He searched carefully, gasified himself after finding the passage, and then left the cave along the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside is ice and snow, whether it is the earth or the mountains, pines or rocks, are covered by a thick snow blanket. Looking around. The gray blizzard blocked the line of sight, and there were always large snowflakes coming from all directions. Although cold, the world of ice and snow is more acceptable than the high heat and dust across the channel of Mora. Siegel uses the spirit of vision. No matter what direction is the wilderness, there is no difference in where to go. He thought about it, leaving a magic mark for the first time. It is easy to return to your own world. Just move your thoughts or die. But if you want to bring something back, you still need to go through the crystal wall channel<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The silver line of the astral projection is still firmly on the top of the head, and after a few meters rise, it enters the astral. The goblin should not detect this silver line. But Siegel still has to use a spell to hide it. Then he applied deformation and turned himself into a goblin. He has never been able to see the earth's goblin, so the present appearance is still the goblin of the New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he is now only a little more than a meter tall, with thick black body hair on the tan skin. The narrow neck is covered with a wide face, and almost the fangs can be seen in the flat mouth of the ear. The flat nose is matched with the nostrils pointing to the front, and the big eyelids are a pair of dull red eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His clothes are deformed, and the "no-phase environment adapts to the leather armor" becomes thick fur clothes, which is ok in any world. Because the goblin's arm is very long, the sleeves of the leather coat almost fall to the ground, but it is convenient to hide their wand. Siegel adapted to the condition of the new body for a while, and after finding the balance, he went down in the direction of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least this is less laborious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an area that is always below freezing point. The frozen, stiff ground is like a rock, only those tough cypresses can grow. Siegel cut a tree, and the rings inside it were densely populated, telling the history of the past. It seems that the world - at least in this snow and ice world - the climate is very stable, the trees grow slowly year after year, and fight against the harsh environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is day or night, Siegel is constantly moving forward. Since the blizzard has not stopped, he can't see the starry sky above his head at night. Although there is no space bag, the key space that can be hidden by the scorpion can still be used. He lives on the food and water inside. After three days of dusk, the blizzard finally stopped, and the pale orange sun was lazy on the pine tree tip, almost no warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the rumor came from afar, and there were a few screams that Siegel could not understand. He turned over the hills and watched in the snow. The three goblins were marching hard with a sled pulled by a reindeer. They whipped the reindeer constantly, but the heavy brown bear body on the sled slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s heart and mind, slipping from the back of the hill, ahead of the direction of the three goblins. He slightly corrected his appearance, more like the goblins of the world, and changed the way he was hungry and hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the three goblins who dragged the deer finally came over. Siegel raised an arm and gestured to them, which caused the attention of three goblins. Since he still doesn't know the language of this world goblin, Siegel simply sends out a weak breathing sound, indicating that he is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no help without care, even without first touching the pockets on Siegel’s clothes. After the three goblins came up, they cut Siegel's throat directly. After that, they tried to take off Siegel's leather jacket, one person licking boots, and one person unbuttoning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gently spit out a syllable, "Hey!" The three goblins, like frozen, completely lost their ability to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only their eyes can still turn slightly, and their brains are still awake. In the surprise and fear that could not be heard, they saw the goblins falling on the ground touched their throats and stood in front of them intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a case or a general rule? Siegel is a bit uncertain. He has heard stories of many wicked people, especially pirates. After escaping the merchant ship, some pirates will choose to kill the people on board in order to hide their own traces. Even such a fierce pirate, if he encounters a survivor after a shipwreck, will reach out for help. They are worried that they will run into a similar situation one day, so carefully maintain the final bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs have lower bottom lines, but they will also save people. But after that, he will search for the property on his body, or judge the value of the rescued person, such as whether it is worth asking for a ransom. If the value is not enough, they will kill the person and throw it into the sea. Siegel thought it would be like an orc. As a result, he didn't expect the goblin to wipe his throat, and he didn't hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, he does not need to hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted the yellow-brown goblin fingers, dry and hard, cold skin, like marble, four on each hand, then gently placed first Only the top of the goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muttering mutter sounds from the thin, wide lips, and the goblin can’t understand its meaning, but can feel the flame inside. General strength. Then the pain hit, and the four fingers on the top of the head were like red iron bars, pressed down with the power of a mountain. The skin skull has been broken, then the brain. He felt that his head was like a boiled kettle, and he snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain is unbearable, and the goblin’s face is dead and white, trying to struggle. But the power of the spell deprived him of his ability to maneuver the body, and at the same time deprived him of the possibility of using death to escape suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only die when the wizard lets him die. Before that, he must present everything he knows to Siegel. Knox's spells are overbearing and effective, but Siegel has to adjust to find the right entry point. Then he began to read the memory of the goblins, first of all to learn their language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome here is not the same as the world of its own, and the vocabulary is more complicated. There are too many words that don't understand what they mean, so they need to learn further. The longer you study, the greater the pain experienced by the goblin. From dusk to late at night, Siegel has been inserting his fingers into the mind of the goblin. The bloody smell is mixed with the sparks of the stars to reflect this horrible scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two goblins can only watch, they can't move, they can't shout, they don't even have the ability to scare their pants. Compared to this terrible experience, the environment of ice and snow is rather cute. The first goblin finally died because of the injury, so he could break free from under the four fingers and stumble in the snow. The other two demons reveal the envious eyes: You are free, what should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
