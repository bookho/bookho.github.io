			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel finally found someone who could share the secret, so he told Evan about things that have long been associated with the nephew - except for the nephew Some features are outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found the story of the blind man is relatively simple," Avon recalls: "After returning to the starry kingdom, Aaron was sent by doctors from all over the country. Surrounded by pastors and wizards, it attracted most of the attention, so I was very free to get up. I didn't want to find this scorpion. Later, I was bored. I searched everywhere in the castle, and the right was a treasure hunt."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The specific process in the middle does not have to be detailed, but you have to know that through this investigation, I found the secret passage in the wall, but I saw and heard it. Less secret. Later I finally found the secret room that you described to me. The runes in it were dense and it looked like a headache, but there was no scorpion inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the traces left by the ground, it should be someone who has a good foot. I continue to follow, and I found a scorpion in the treasure room next to the father's study. It was placed in a wooden box that can no longer be ordinary. There is a script that restores the king of my family name. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was very surprised at the time, because according to the law, unless the king directly designated the heir, holding this edict, I am the next king. Although this I have dreamed of a good thing, but I never thought that this would actually happen. And why did you have a script, but it has never been published, and it is still in this hidden place?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to ask my father in person, so I have collected my nephew and the script. The nephew is very obedient. I can fly to my hand as soon as I move my thoughts. From that moment on, I understand that this It is indeed my thing. But the script is not the same. Although it is just a piece of paper, it seems to have a weight. After I took it out of the study, I hesitated for a long time and didn’t know whether to ask."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then, the afternoon came the news that the father and the horse were injured, and then he was surrounded by doctors, pastors and ministers. My illegitimate child was hard to die in him. He was allowed to see him before. But at that time he was already unconscious. I can't say anything, I can't ask him anything, I can only say goodbye to him. But when I came out of his room, Sir Jeter of the Guards invited me to join their troops." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Joining the Guards is an honor, considered part of the royal family, but to abandon the previous family. There has never been a precedent for a prince to enter the Guards. And why should I listen to him? He has been entangled with me for a long time, but he has never dared to pull out his weapons. When the frequency of patrols of the city defense forces near my residence has greatly increased. I felt that the situation was not good and I escaped. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a period of ignorance, no one can tell who is a friend, who is an enemy, and even more can not see the true intentions of these people, the kingdom of stars because of me And Aaron’s things are making a lot of noise. I have always believed that it is mine and mine. I didn't see the trouble caused by this dispute until I came to the city to mediate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is lying on the sofa with his head resting on his hand and his foot on the arm of the sofa, a leisurely look. "I wanted to understand at the time." : I have never prepared for myself as a king before. Now it’s better to take over the aristocrats. It’s better to take a step back and let Aaron be a part of it. I can observe it carefully. He is also in poor health, no marriage and no children. If God wants him to live long or leave a child, then I will help him, or be free to live the day he wants. If not, then I should be a king, and no one can take it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Baron Tiger Bill helped me secretly and let the fat guy take me to the New World." Should it be the safest place? Evan looked at the ceiling. He yawned. "I am here, the days of a mercenary." Give me a high salary, you hire a king! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking beautiful! Siegel said with a smile: "The most important thing in my territory is the mercenary, and there is not much work now." Most of them are escort caravans. If you charge expensive, no one will spend that money. Why don't I hire you as a coach and train my soldiers and guards? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a life that can be stunned every day. Evan said to Siegel: "It's not bragging. I am strong in swordsmanship now." Very strong. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" I know, I will raise my salary a bit higher." Siegel said with a smile: "Otherwise, if one day you become a king, what should I do if I come back to retaliate?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the defensive staff out of the space bag, threw it out, and then held it in his hand with a wave of his hand. He blinked at Evan: "I can, can you tell me something strange?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you still don't understand." Said: "You will understand when you play with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do have some swordsmanship, but the fools are playing with you!" I waved my hand and said to Evan: "I will send the runaway as soon as I open it, and then mobilize the entire elemental array of Heim's collar. When I go all out, you will at least face four large elemental creatures or one at the same time. Very large element guard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although there are some troubles, I can beat it." Evan said: "I am living a more dangerous situation than this." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whenever you win down an element, you will see a new element appear, never ending." Say: "How long can you sleep without sleep? One day or one week? It doesn't matter, the entire array is calculated according to the year."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too shameless!" Evan is very dissatisfied: "There is no knighthood at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Shrugging your shoulders, no matter what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You promised me, always fight me." Evan said: "You don't want to talk about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I figure out a way to make you not shameless, but also to beat you, I will play with you." Siegel said with a smile: "Or You start to learn magic, and then we can fight relatively fair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan waved his hand, too lazy to answer this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel originally prepared a face-changing hat for Janet, which can change the appearance of the user, and now it is handed over to Evan. "King of the King", the pseudonym of Al Protos, a wandering swordsman from the Black Forest, was hired to become the new swordsman of the city of Mith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quite satisfied with this position, because, as he envisioned, he can really justify everyone. He started to be very measured, both to knock down people, and to ensure that the next day can be revived. Continue to linger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to take care of the faces of His Majesty’s generals, Siegel did not observe the actual situation of the battle, but ran to the outside of the city to see the progress of the magic array. The Masters of the Federation have been fully engaged since they took over the commission. The progress of the magic array has been very stable. Already almost halfway through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the guardian Wendy to lead this magical array construction is a wise choice, she played an important role in maintaining the experience of the magic tower enchantment. Not only is she skilled and accurate in spells, she is also able to make a number of suggestions for improvement. Although she still did not see the true use of this magical array, it did not prevent her from making reasonable modifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Lord. Your design here is a bit overkill." When Wendy saw Siegel appear on the construction site, he would leave his work in the hands of The fastest speed came to him. She always has a variety of things to report, and she can't get rid of her before she solves it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the design point of view, this is a section that stores the energy of the fire element. But the magic lines you design are enough to support the energy required by the ten giant fire elements. Even the magical array of the Three Peaks Tower does not need such a large channel width. Can it be reduced? After all, these special alloys made of precious stone powder are expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do not save money for me, this design is necessary." Siegel always puts his face on her face and restrains what expression he reveals. However, Wendy did not know what perfume he used, and he always swayed Siegel's sense of smell and seduce his curiosity. The lord pinched his nose. Stabilizing the mood and continuing to say: "I need this magical array to withstand tremendous energy flow. Under the premise of satisfying this, we can ignore the efficiency problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The rich man of the Lord, I understand." Wendy smiled at Siegel, as she smiled at "Sos". The wizards of the Federation were a little surprised because in their impression Wendy was a timid, shy girl who never spoke to other men. Was it the transformation of the federation that changed her personality, or did she have a good impression of Siegel Master? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
