			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bug." The dragon said. Then it turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel witnessed the death of a tortured and crazy slave. He also personally gave the enemy death. These are just others, only the shallow marks are in him. He left the heart; he experienced the death of the most respected old captain, and the sad feeling was so painful that he was deeply hidden in his heart and even dared not recall. In the face of the burning flame, the sorrow of death buried deep in the heart was re-excavated, and then filled with his body and mind, engulfing his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All said that death has great horror, death has great wisdom, but Siegel has no wisdom at all. After suffering, he now only wants revenge. Even if you die on the road to revenge, it is better to continue to face the burning tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure floated to the side of Siegel, dressed in fishing nets and leaves, black nails, unkempt. He tilted his head and his lips did not move, but a voice was clearly transmitted to Siegel's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go with me, leave here, your destiny should not end here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel glanced at the easy-goers and saw his open palms flat in front of himself. He has a clear understanding that as long as he puts his hand on it, he can safely leave the fire and go to a safe place. At the feet of the easy-to-shape, in the soil soaked with ashes and blood, the ice-cold guns fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am gone, then my heart will die tonight, where is the fate?" Siegel reached out and grabbed the dirt. In the ice gun, pull it out and hold it tightly. The frost condensed from his arm and danced beside him, but he didn't have a cold feeling, but instead he was very hot, just like the temperature of the blood, just like the rhythm of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about killing the beast with me? Or staying with me on the road to fight?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't deal with the dragon and the death knight at the same time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a Death Knight? Well, you just need to hold the dragon, I will kill it, then come back to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you coming from such confidence? Courage?" The easy-shaped person laughed dumbly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To tell the truth?" Siegel smashed the rifle, adapted to its feel, and found the center of gravity. Then he said to the transsexuals with serious expression: "Frightened, scared by death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recites a spell that will be learned for the trial A spell is imposed on oneself and becomes "the enemy must be in the middle." This spell has a very short duration, but it allows the attacker to see the future related to the battle in a flash, quickly predicting the enemy's trajectory and seeing the best attack route. The dragon is flying past Siegel, like the king's patrol of his own territory, admiring his masterpiece of flame. Siegel seized this fleeting opportunity to cast the ice gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver-white lightning strokes the night sky, giving a brighter glow than Longyan. The ice-cold gun was inserted into the wound that Kerry had made in the dragon, and it continued to tear, the scales were broken, and the flesh and blood flew. One of the dragon's wings twisted into a weird angle, and it could no longer fly. It only fell to the ground, and the claws squirmed indiscriminately. The tail was like a whip, and the surrounding tents and bodies flew into the air. The strong bloody taste of the dragon's wounds further aroused Siegel's fighting spirit. However, his goal was the death knight, and Siegel noticed that the knight was slammed into the dragon's back when the dragon fell, and fell in the fire not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Let’s go down, burned to death, don’t get up. 'Siegel secretly prayed to God, but the prayer did not take effect as always. A dark and murderous figure stood up from the flame. It was dressed in heavy armor, and the entire face was wrapped in a tall, pointed helmet with only one slit for observation. The guy stood up close to two meters high, and the steel guard of the lobster back shell grabbed a large, curved hand with a saber, reflecting the red light in the flame. From the gaps in his armor joints, there is a constant spread of black gas, like the burning ash of dead wood - that is the curse of death, the development of the dead soul in the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t throw the weapon away, only the gun can pose a threat!" The prone yelled and yelled: "In addition to magic, there are only soldiers." Can eliminate the death knight, I have to find a way to bring it back to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will have a weapon again. He played a gun and quickly found the center of the rifle according to the method of the dwarf Professor Irene. He looked directly at the death knight and said, "Come on, let me come to an end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jokes." The death knight's voice has a chilly coldness. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s rifle was stabbed, but the death knight did not care, and the curved knife cut directly and cut it. Siegel stunned, understand that the death knight is to change his life, and the flesh and blood can not be more resistant to the dead. He quickly adjusted the tactics and used the skill of the elf's pace to escape to the side. Taking advantage of the death knight, the saber has not recovered its balance, unable to unfold the gap of the next attack, and the rifle once again spurred. The death knight turned around and waved the steel with a fist and slammed the direction of the gun. The gun head wrapped in the force of the ice slid open on the armor, giving a piercing metal cutting sound, and a layer of ice crystals spread out from the scratches, but did not penetrate, and the body under the death knight's armor was still not affected. Substantial damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knight took a step forward and the ground was shaking. His big knife was cut off the head of Sigel, and he was sheltered from being low. Siegel’s rifle was also attackless. After trying a few tricks on each other, Siegel immediately speeded up the pace, circled, stabbed, and blocked, then judged the trajectory of the sickle and quickly escaped the counterattack. The death knight is good at fighting, so Siegel's imaginary tricks have no effect, so you can only rely on the real power, the force, and hard to fight. Fortunately, the lightness of the body can make Siegel gain an advantage in speed, so the Master will continue to chanting spells to maintain and strengthen the effect of the spell. Considering that there are no organs in the undead monster, Siegel will turn the target of the attack to the head of the guy, and strive to pierce his helmet through a narrow observation slit. The soul fire of many undead creatures will be in the original brain position. That may be the only life gate of the death knight. This threat really caught the attention of the death knight, he began to block more, and did not dare to change the life of Siegel with the head injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will be here for me to end." Siegel is speaking to the death knight, but also to encourage himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joke!" The death knight plucked a long shot and continued to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survivors in the camp saw these two battles - Red Dragon and Green Dragon, Death Knight and Siegel. They saw Siegel avoiding slashing again and again, forcing the enemy to retreat with constant spurs. Although the death knight's height and wingspan are better than the Siegel, the length of the frosty gun is two feet longer than the chopper, so the wizard can still get an attack distance advantage of about half a foot, which is between life and death. the distance. Siegel calmly healed this small area and calculated the pace of movement at his feet. The death knight found this. When the opponent spurs, he tries to cut the gun several times and wants to cut it off and cut it short. But the ice gun is extremely strong, at least so far there is no sign of damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knight uses one arm to protect the helmet, and the other one holds the knives and the big knife like a windmill to rotate the slash to hurt the injury. Siegel's dodge ability was pushed to the limit, and the elf's pace was not enough to allow him to avoid all the blows, so the dwarf's technique was also applied. Siegel can use the sturdy part of the armor to meet the sniper, and use the slope and the arc angle to unload the attack. The armor continues to produce scars, and the dwarf's craft has withstood the greatest test, but so far it has protected its owner. Siegel's spears continue to stretch and hit the death knight's chest, waist and knees many times. Now he can hit each other almost every time, piercing the armor, but as long as the soul fire is not hurt, these have no effect on the death knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death constitutes me, how can you kill me?" The death knight attacked and said: "You are just a little bit of power!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said nothing, concentrating on avoiding a slamming attack on his wrist, pulling back half a step and then slamming forward. "I am a little bitch", the long shot stabbed the armpit of the dead horse, making his shoulder armor turn awkward; "I lack strength", Siegel turned to the side of the enemy, his breastplate was chopped Seam, blood flowing from the cracks and his waist; "but I have a cold ice gun, restrain your weapon!" He leaped gently, and then pressed the weight of the whole body to this spur. The long shot hits the back of the death knight's knee, pierces all the movable parts, and then twists them together. "So I will end you!" Siegel shouted. The armor of the death knight's knee was stuck, causing it to be unable to bend and the action became clumsy. This gave Siegel a greater advantage in speed. Before the big knife crossed, he pulled out the long gun and quickly slid away, avoiding the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shards splattered with the rifle's back pumping, and the death knight became stiff and difficult to move. Siegel took the opportunity to pull the distance and throw the flying axe on his body. It is a pity that these weapons became fragments after they encountered the body of the death knight and had no effect at all. So Siegel once again clenched the ice gun. ‘The remote means has no meaning, and the weapon is ineffective. I can only rely on the ice and the guns,” Siegel thought in his mind, ‘the obsidian dagger and the ice gun are almost the same material, which may be useful. ’<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
