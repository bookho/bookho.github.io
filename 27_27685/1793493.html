			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to find the right direction, Siegel used flying to cross the walled mountains instead of transmitting, which made him a man The illusion of the eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vision of being strengthened by magic, he can accurately see things in the distance, just like in front of you; you can also look at the end of the earth, The world embraces the arms. Looking from the sky, the city of Mier is not much bigger than the soap. The spaceship of the federation is just a little black spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blows in the face, with the snow on the walls of the city, the ice is cold and biting. Siegel’s robes soon hang a layer of frost. He chose to fly as short as possible, but the overall height of the walled mountains still caused him a lot of trouble. It’s a hassle to find ways to keep yourself warm while flying. How can a sergeant make himself look awkward? He summoned the elements of the air to carry himself, and then cast a shadow into the dark world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no color in the shadow world, only different degrees of black and varying degrees of white. It is silent, cold but not frozen. Here is the reflection of the real world. The outline of everything is exactly the same as the outside, but there is no real light and heat here. The dark places are lurking with dangerous shadow creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders scared the monsters in the shadows that the younger generation often said, and the hands that protruded under the bed, are creatures in the shadow world. Siegel flew through the sky, and his body radiated a little magical brilliance. Whether it is his position or the brilliance of magic, these shadow creatures will be warned so that they will not dare to approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows of the Wall Mountain Range are fast away, and Siegel will not suffer from freezing cold. Even with the help of the shadow community, it took him more than forty minutes to cross the walled mountains and finally came to a position that made a loud noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spherical missing with a diameter of one kilometer appears on the mountain, just like a finger on the cake. The constant collapse is still going on, and the rumble echoes in the valley. The majestic mountains reveal the fragile side. Are the fallen stones not like tears? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the sphere, there is still lightning inexplicably constantly coming out. Siegel can feel the danger there without going close. Void, this feeling is no stranger to him. Time, space, matter, the end of all annihilation. The residence of Nexus. Can I create a void environment with electromagnetic guns? Siegel felt more and more doubts, and the situation at hand was completely beyond his expectations. How does the metal projectile span such a large distance, avoiding countless mountains, but “exploding” here? What is the loss of this pure sphere? How did the void come about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He summoned the Fire Elemental Warrior. Let it fly to the center of the void. The element of fire is reluctant, but it cannot reject the order of the master. Before he got closer to the center, he grabbed it with a strong appeal and tore it to the middle. The fire element screamed and the color turned dark red. Gradually dim disappeared. It struggled to escape, but it was still sucked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel feels that his connection to the fire element is getting weaker and weaker, as if the distance has become too far and never reaches the same. After a while, the connection was completely interrupted and the fire element officially disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this, completely disappeared? How can there be no annihilation, no energy?" Siegel thought about it and threw it at the core. A few stones are still almost the same effect. The matter disappeared and only some uncomfortable flashes came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phenomenon cannot always be invincible. Elements and substances can't hurt it. Siegel thought about it and then got an idea. He recited the spell and applied a disintegrating ray to the core of the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The means to deal with this thing is to disintegrate the ray and the anti-magic field, a coping substance, and a coping effect. The disintegrating ray played a role and its core was destroyed. The energy equivalent to a small elemental tide is released, and the flames and lightning fill the space. Siegel quickly retreated, and was safe after the protection of the element of gas and the barrier of the protective spell. The mountain here suffered a second insult and finally collapsed completely. The earth kept vibrating, yelling at the culprit that caused it all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Mother of the Earth forgive me. I am just experimenting..." Siegel prayed sincerely, but I don’t know if the Mother of the Earth would ignore it. he. After sincere prayer and forgiveness, he was too excited to be self-sufficient. His own experiments have achieved unimaginable results, and he does not feel that there is any power in the world to stop this destructive power. Consider the speed of sound propagation and the distance of your own flight. Almost as a launch of Heim, the end of the walled mountain range was hit. Near the distance of six hundred kilometers, it is instantaneous, unless it is a transmission, or even lightning can not fly so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly suspended in the air, watching a mountain peak in front of him. Just keep the research going. It is not just a mountain, it can be a magic tower, a city, a country or even a world. After the excitement, he began to tremble for this power. What would happen if one end of the launcher was aimed at the Siegel squid if it wasn't the Wall Mountain? He still has time to dodge the torrent of metal. Does this kind of void attack and triggering have no reaction time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the five-second warning ability of the twenty-faced scorpion still valid? Siegel also kept doubts. At the moment when the projectile is launched, I am afraid that the distortion is not only the space, but also the time, otherwise it will not explain its incredible speed and how to avoid any matter on the way over the entire mountain range. Maybe he still has an early warning, but how long can it be? For a second or two, even the protective spells are too late to use. Look at this round hole with a diameter of one kilometer. The mountain body is much stronger than the **, but it still disappears completely. So as long as you can't avoid it, it's a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big fear between life and death. The transmitter is born at one end and dead at the other end. Siegel suddenly felt uncomfortable in the stomach, and he was so sick that he only wanted to vomit. He resisted, landed on the ground, kneeling on the thick earth, vomiting in the diffuse dust, emptying the debris in the stomach, and filling his eyes with tears, which is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Void Gun." He named the weapon like this, so he always reminded himself of the terrible of Ness and the Void. The way to destroy everything has been clear before his eyes, if the method of obtaining this power is also in his mind. All he needs to do is to continue his research and understand the relationship between all phenomena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vowed never to spread this technology unless he found a way to balance its threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean up the surrounding dirt, he flew into the air and looked. It seems that it is not far from the starting point of the fortress, just take a look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of a stable transmission matrix, the development of the starting outpost has become very amazing, and the tribes on the wilderness have all known that there is a stable and fair trading place. . In theory, it takes only a few seconds to reach the starting point of the outpost from the rabbit ear port. Transportation costs are also all waived by the power of the Peruvian nuclear. The price of sea salt, which was once very valuable in the wilderness, has fallen sharply. The rock salt produced by the Dwarf of Mora is completely uncompetitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel felt that this was a good thing, until Janet pointed out the shortcomings. Now transporting things through the transmission array, and paying taxes to Heim based on the weight or volume of the goods. Don't let the merchants only enjoy the benefits without paying. Part of the money was handed over to the Mage Federation, which slowly repaid the manufacturing costs of the transfer array, and the other part used to hire the caravans to open passenger and postal services between the territories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't do this, there will be a lot of people who lose their livelihood," Janet reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything has two sides. Siegel’s magical reform of Heim’s collar was just beginning. Just as he got a weapon of incomparable power, a small trouble is also bothering him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole starting point of the fortress has turned into a blind man - temporary deafness, which is enough to thank God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through text communication, Siegel finally knew what happened from Moore - although he had guessed it before. The firepower of the Void Gun caused a huge sound wave that swept the nearby area. It’s just like a starting point fortress, and most of them have binaural bleeding and temporary deafness. Fortunately, through the transmission array, the various temples in the city of Mier can send priests to use the magic or potion to treat, but at least for more than a month, it will become confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Send some healthy knights to guard the city. In case of the bandits attack on the wilderness. I received information that there are already a few criminals who are eyeing Here, in case they come, the blind people can't hear the alarm," Moore wrote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will arrange for you to discuss the temporary change of defense with you. Just let your hand go down to the city of Mier City to see and see, and also facilitate your later management. "Siegel writes in the air directly with illusion, much faster than Moore." Of course, direct communication with thought is more convenient, but Siegel does not want to worry about his ability and will easily enter their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the Lord and the Lord are back? I sent her a gift, have you received it?" Moore wrote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
