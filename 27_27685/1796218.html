			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After arriving on board, I will be responsible for protecting you from spell attacks. WwW.XsHuotXT.com 壹 reading book ·kahu·" Siegel Wen said: "My suggestion is that after you have seen Aaron as soon as possible, you will leave as soon as possible. I will take you to the transmission array, so that you can return to the new university as soon as possible and go to your supporters. But the safest place is still the city of Mire. You should also consider it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will consider it." Evan looked at the dwarf's unsinking stone boat. The line of sight is getting bigger and bigger, and it also puts up the heart of play. He grew up with Aaron. Although he never dared to be a brother because he was an illegitimate child, it did not hinder their brotherhood. It is said that Aaron, who has fallen ill, has almost become another person because of alcoholism. However, since Siegel said that he has quit this bad habit, he may see his brother who is familiar with this impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people embarked on a stone boat, and immediately dwarfs came up: "His Siegel Master, who is this? Only invited In order to participate in the meeting of the Dwarf King."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I personally guarantee him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok, ** 师师.” The dwarf just wanted to get this promise, they got it, so they left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan sighed with relief: "It’s much simpler than I thought. I thought I had to register my name and identity. If the dwarf king looks at it, There are actually two star kings on the ship, I don't know what he thinks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one." Avon sighed long and sighed on the deck. Standing on the station. He closed his eyes and listened to the sound of the sea for a while, then said to Siegel in a gentle tone: "Take me to Aaron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well, go here." Siegel took out his wand and first released several protective spells for Evan, then led the way in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Fleet not far away began to gather in the stone boat, the soldiers in the cabin were wearing sea battle armor, and all the weapons were ready. In the bottom cage, the gryphon that was stunned by the waves was also released, and the strong wings were stretched, and the weaker retching.壹 Read the book · Kahu·The tamer opens the weapon cabinet, which is full of special armor with a gryphon piled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two people are unaware of it. They walked in the path of the stone boat and went straight to the room of Aaron. Siegel sniffs the elemental atmosphere in the air, and he will be noticed if he is not right. The Four-Dimensional Arrow can suppress the fluctuations of almost all elements and even change the attributes of the elements. So persistent spells and spell enchantments are as fragile as a piece of paper in front of him. When Lear saw it, he also withdrew the prophecy perception. After all, he could understand it again. What could be used if the spell could not be played? He sorted out his robes and picked up the stick of the sergeant. Quietly standing in the middle of your room, closing your eyes and waiting for further exhibitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King Guards all know Evan. When he saw him coming with a sergeant, he was very nervous and immediately took the sword in his hand. come out. The magic armor is decorated with large and small stars, and it is now lit up. Around several guards, the anti-magic field opened, and the activities of the elements were suppressed, but the magical equipment and the sword in their hands were not affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Siegel’s surprised expression, Evan had a happy mood: “Look, the King’s guard’s equipment suppresses all spells. But still keeps I have magic support. Each set of equipment is worthless. With the power of the starry kingdom, I have created ten pieces for so many years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very interesting, to the general The Master is a non-war combination, but it can only be a tricky problem for the sergeant.” Siegel shook his head and said to the guards: “Like the last time, I am coming again, you are looking for someone to pass. Let's pass it. I don't want to spend another time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the bedroom is open, the guardian’s door is open, and his weapons are still In the scabbard. "Take the sword up. Take the post," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron stood trembled, his feet could not bear, and he was supported by two crutches. "I haven't seen you for a long time, Evan." He gasped and said: "I heard that you got on the boat. But I really can't change clothes. There are no servants here. The card **** (guard captain) is big and big. Feet, and I am more clumsy, so I can only wear pajamas. I am very happy to see you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Card ****, pushing my wheelchair, I can't stand it anymore." Aaron staggered and barely sat in the chair. He lost his cane and made an invitation gesture: "Come in. I have to wait for a few people, and I will be able to do it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also invited Who, I thought this was the meeting between the two of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Aurora of the Temple of Dawn, the Master of Lear in the City of Learning. Ke makeup became an accompanying physician, and he followed Mr. Smedley, and these people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many people." Evan said, while solving I took my own sword and took the daggers on the belt, the knuckles, the flying knives in the boots, and handed them to the guards. "I was afraid to fall into the water and drown, so I didn't bring a lot of weapons. That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron squeezed a smile and said to Evan: " Sit down, what do you want to drink? Say well, I don't have any drinks here. Although I have stopped drinking now, it will be very difficult if I smell it. But the juice here is good, it is the only thing I can taste. "Things are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, now I am not thirsty, but thank you." Evanmai stepped, and Siegel followed. The guardian stopped him: "The Earl, your weapon and wand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I still have a wand, and the sword can be handed over to you. "Siegel untied the dust of the stars and handed it to the card." The card **** took the sword, but his eyes were still staring at Siegel's wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let him come over, card ****. You just took the sorcerer's wand and still will not affect his spellcasting." Aaron said. Dao: "Since I have gathered everyone, except for some formal things, there is no need to divide them into difficult ones. Let's eat something first, but you have to understand that the things I have here are very heavy and may not be yours. Taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will have something to eat at this time? Lear, the priest and prophecy master of the Temple of Dawn, lived nearby, and they soon arrived after hearing the summons. After a minute, others continued to arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora is a middle-aged man with a neat short hair. Dark black eyebrows and deep eyes are not angry and often describe themselves as "the piercing morning of piercing the darkness." He wore a hard leather armor decorated with a sun emblem, a prayer book in one hand, and a golden spiked hammer in his hand. He never solved his mace. So I stood at the door consciously, just like another king guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm printer Sorke is small and thin, but disguised as a chubby accompanying physician. He untied the wide robes and took out the hidden parcels from inside. It is made from the skin of some animal and is naturally strong in magic resistance. So the detection of magic can not be seen through. He held the parcel in both hands and stood on the side of Aaron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great prophet Lear put the stick of the sergeant outside the door, and put his hands together and walked in. His eyes kept looking at Siegel, and Siegel looked at him. The elements felt the power contained in both eyes and began to avoid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King Guards closed the door and then stepped inwards. The armor forces on them unite to form a magical suppression space. Here, elements are not allowed to enter and exit, and spells are difficult to construct. But they can't suppress the elemental confrontation between Siegel and Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not impossible to cast spells in the anti-magic field, but it requires extremely precise control and powerful mana support. If you describe the anti-magic force field as a desert under the scorching sun. Then the element is a solitary water droplet, and as soon as it is exposed to high temperatures, the water droplets will be steamed immediately. And the Master wants to cast spells, just like using these drops of water to make ice sculptures on the desert ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no water nearby, the Master can only squeeze sweat from the body. The more you squeeze, the more materials are available, but the closer you are to death. Even with enough water, there is not enough skill to control it is the next obstacle. This is not something that can be done by dreams. It takes time and effort to manipulate elements and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, Lear clearly has a great advantage. Just under everyone's eyes. He cast a spiritual link spell, hoping to directly read the thinking of someone at the place. The tentacle of the spell is as subtle as a spider's silk, slowly crawling into everyone's ear. Siegel shook his head and he tried it many times. There is no way to build a stable spell structure, so you can only use the power of simple elements to compete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
