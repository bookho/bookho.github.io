			<div id="content">Read_content_up();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking <路 www guest siluke〞info update the fastest novel network, no pop-up window! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sit on the wooden bench in the most comfortable position - except Yao En, he is still rubbing the stool under the butt and the table in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chubby boss comes with carefully prepared food, and the drink is the ale from the deepest part of the cellar, cool and sweet. A group of people gathered around the inn's fireplace, and the burning sound of firewood could help cover up their conversation. However, Siegel still kept his voice down and only let his companions hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I directly listened to the Earl of Siegel, the mission of this investigation is to investigate a manor of a suspected murderer." He said: "murder The god's assassin attacked the city of Myrtle twice and was already listed as an enemy of Heim. According to the clues, they were hidden in a manor near the city of Kaibu, which is our destination."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The God of Murder?" Ai Meng said: "Is the evil spirit that is dead after being stared? This is much harder than exploring treasures. You have to add money." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no intention of getting you involved in the battle, you only need to crack the organs or traps - if the manor has such things." Siegel said "You are just a technician. I have already said this clearly with Yao En."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome nodded and admitted that there was such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides, you may need to rescue someone from their estate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This needs to add money, for sure." Ai Meng looked at Naria and sought her support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rescuing people from the hands of the murder god is a move of justice." Arnold said: "We are willing to help you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this does not mean there is no need to add additional fees." Ai Meng grinned and blew his hair: "Jie, all three of them are embarrassed to speak. So this is the case." I have to say. We need gold coins very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you show professionalism, I can reflect this to the count," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aimeng leaned closer to Evan and said on his shoulder: "I like this employer, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan slammed his forehead and didn't know what he should say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome took a clap and attracted everyone’s attention, but hòu said: “First put the rewards aside and concentrate on hearing about me. This is not an easy task, the god of murder - God. It is basically the most difficult type of people to deal with - I guess they are composed of evil pastors, warriors who are proficient in assassinations, and technicians who are good at using poisons and traps. And maybe even cultivated their own combat team. This is the most dà challenge we have encountered so far!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it more trouble than the lich? Asked Ai Meng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome nodded: "So this time, everyone puts a feeling of play, must be fully committed to the task. Do not want to think about extra bounty, can It is the first step to make the 1,500 gold coins in the hands. At present we know very little about the target, so we need to conduct a comprehensive investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He looked at Siegel, and Siegel waved his hand and said, "Mr. Yao En. If you have any plans, let me know. I fully cooperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We want to enter the town of Kaibu as a team that has completed the previous task. While trimming, we will find a new job." Yao En took a thick booklet from his backpack, sandwiched between them. Various hand-drawn maps. He put on his glasses and looked through it for a while, then hòu pulled out a piece of blackened parchment and said, "Look, this is a treasure map of the past - by the way, this is forged, it is useless. ——I found it a long time ago, I thought it was a good job. We accepted the commission from Heim, and came here to verify the authenticity of the treasure map. The treasure does not exist, so we only got 420 gold coins. That is, the reward of 70 gold coins per person. The winter in the north is too cold, we decided to spend the winter here, and by the way, earn some money, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold coins or gems?" Siegel looked at the gnome and realized that his intention was to get some advance payment. This is no problem, Siegel feels that these people's credits far exceed a few hundred gold coins, so he did not hesitate to take out a purse. “The Chamber of Commerce of Rabbit Ear Harbor also has a payment voucher, which can also be used as a gold coin, but I am worried that it is too far south, and it is very difficult for you to use it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naria blinked and looked at Siegel's purse, but hòu said: "Gold coins and gems are half, we have always been like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Kebu City has an inn called Nanhaiwang, which was opened by one of my people. The pygmy Jagger Carter, a very violent but very kind person, has a very strict tone, we can live there, then We can do it separately.” Yao En arranged: “Anomen, you and Jie, preaching the teachings of the Mother Earth in Kaibu. If the believers of the murder god exist, they will feel uncomfortable, you are the bait. Be careful. Ai Meng, let's get together, go to the market and have some tools. Naria, you and Sol want to find a way to go to a manor - I believe Jay will tell us later. Try to investigate. Note yì don't be found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need to go to the manor to investigate, let Sol listen to the teachings of Mother Earth." Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The gnome didn't even lift his head. It seems that he had already thought of Siegel's opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, then I am not good at buying things? Although I like it very much, the mother of the earth is not my faith." Evan said xiào. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emmon and the gnome said in unison: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, this time If there is a mistake in the task, it is likely to bring devastating results. Others I don’t say that the assassin of the murder god is a murderer who is not blind, and is harder than the bloody scorpion union (a low-key killer organization). They don't work for money, you can't buy your life. So, remember the following..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome is still talking, hotel The door was pushed open rudely. Three people wearing full armor and chain armor appeared at the door. They stood upright on the back, and the armor on the chest was marked with a snake emblem that was rolled up. Their eyes glanced under the full helmet, and they did not say a word, but they seemed to have a squeaky voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are the people of the Roo family?" The dull voice came from under the helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel turned around and squinted at them. Although it is winter, the air in the south is still wet, and the full face helmet and body armor are not suitable equipment, let alone add a layer of chain armor. The three of them are like sea monsters that have just come out of the water, and they still have fishing nets. Is this the strange Southern Warrior dress up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four servants sitting in the corner stood up and did not speak, pointing directly to the fully armed person behind the inn. The helmet was clicked, but hòu retired from the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servants stood up and walked straight to the back door. It seems that these Tin Man are the passengers who are looking for the boat in the pavilion, the nobles who are cooling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s none of our business." Yao En said: "Where did I say that? Yes, there are a few things..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this sentence is destined to be interrupted, and a loud noise is heard at the door. It seems that someone is struggling, kicking the fence and bucket at the door and making a lot of noise. Siegel could still hear the sound of the chain and the chirp of his mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan put his hand on the hilt and sucked his nose, giving Siegel a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's focus on what's going on, don't rush into other things," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Help! Who will save me!" The voice slammed, but hòu was shackled with something and turned into a sly Muffled. The Tin Man's armor swayed, and it seemed that someone was slamming with both hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shi Shanxing has good news." Arnold said: "And he called for help, I will go and see."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
