			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea took Siegel’s walk in the camp and didn’t seem to care if he saw everything here. Perhaps because of pride, perhaps because of self-confidence, but Siegel thinks that the biggest possibility is that Leah thinks he will not attack the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also saw that most of the elves are not preparing for the siege." Lia and Siegel stood on a hill. She pointed to the field in the distance. "Have you seen the forest? A few days ago, there was still a wasteland burned by fire. Now the elves are transplanting trees. After a few years, there will be a forest of scale, and countless animals can be here. Perched. Then, after a few decades, when the trees grow up, we will plant new runes trees, and then the elves will move here. We want to make this place better, instead of setting fire to everything like humans "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The place you said I used to ride horses. Before you arrived, there was a pumpkin field. Although the harvest time was over, the fruit was Pick it up, but next year there will be new pumpkins planted.” Siegel responded: “Even if the forest looks more harmonious and beautiful, there is nothing wrong with the pumpkin.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lia glanced at the two behind him, and Master Rosian was still with them. Siegel knew that Leah had something to say to himself, so he turned his head and looked at the wizard wizard, and then said, "You don't need to learn spells or practice spellcasting skills? If I want to be bad for the wizard master, you think you Can I stop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will do my best." Rosian's eyes trembled, but still tough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Lia, I gave you the most straightforward demonstration, telling you why the elves can't beat the Knox Association." Laughed: "If you don't know that Knox will be more devastating than you, why should I come to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I know you. The meaning of it. As long as the soldiers led by Heim are honestly behind the wall, our elves will not attack, and many trees are much more meaningful than war killing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and he needed such a promise. Since he had achieved his goal, he decided to leave. "If you are in trouble, I will come back to you. Be sure to be careful with Knox and take care of yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liya waved her hand and said: "Okay, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the city of Miele. Several people took a sigh of relief. The most difficult step in the entire plan has already passed, and the cooperation with the elves has won time for Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you get past the priest of the Moon Temple?" Fazak was very curious. "When I went to see the elves, the most feared were the pastors. It’s hard to avoid God’s magic again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “My situation is special, you can’t learn. But what I said at the time was also true. Even Luna will not say anything more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are we going to do next?" Janet asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry up and build the fortress, and then look for the barbarian around it. I need them to provide a lot of meat immediately, so that the gnome Dingbao will develop his canned food. Janis, how is the communication with the southern lords doing, can you still form a transportation line outside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenice wipes the sweat on his head, Said to Siegel: "The elves control the wilderness, and the roads are difficult to pass. But they are understaffed, the war tree goals are so obvious, and the small caravans are easy to avoid. Whether it is mercenaries or smugglers, Find them to do the job. The more difficult thing is how to get into the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Each castle has escaped tunnels. Find some agility The mercenaries enter the castle. Tell the lord of the lord. Either use these passages to deliver supplies, or be stunned and killed. You should not worry about this matter. On the one hand, we must wait for our first supply problem, another Aspects of the preservation of the castle I can hold on for a long time, and now I will say that no one will pay attention to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennis nodded and said to Siegel: "The Lord, I got the news outside. The Uther is prepared to work with the elves and is secretly looking for allies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want a way to find someone to tell him, I said that his attack plan I already know, I will bless him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennis stunned . "Ah? Just say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. Even he heard the news, can the elf know? I hope Uther can understand the implied warning of this sentence and quickly close it. The mage then asked Zucker: "You have been in the castle recently, have you seen the konjac?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean the iron can that walks. "The Orc thought for a moment: "He should be at Rhett. The soldiers who went to the treatment once said it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK, I went to find it." You lightly click on the soldiers, it is your own. Not the enemy." Siegel heard about the strict training of Mike, the whip and the stick are his magic weapon, even when the hands are waving, even more than using the epee skilled. Every day, soldiers were wounded and sent to Rhett to heal, but fortunately there have been no deserters so far, and the training progress is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Recently they were obedient, well practiced, and played less." Zucker scratched the short hair on his head and said, "Currently pumping now." A few times, it’s better to shoot a few more shots by the elves than on the battlefield.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You’re also quite right, pay attention to the size.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the presence of the person Janet knows Siegel best, she sees the Master's eyes turn, and knows that the konjac plays an important role in his new plan. “What do I need to prepare?” she asked. “I don’t know what the second tuod has.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who is the best blacksmith in the castle? I want the kind that is good at casting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the dwarf, it is Brent. He is also a good armor, able to build a full body, Craftsmanship is the best in the blacksmith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, call him too, just say that I have a big business to hand over to him."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel came to Reid's Temple, and he came here for the first time. Here is a simple stone-studded building with stone smears covered with mud and airtight. Ryde built a stone and built it here, and then lived here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a shrine without a holy emblem. There is no cumbersome rituals and complicated rules except to persuade people to provide treatment for goodness and goodness. People in the city of Mire like to come here, humans, orcs, dwarves and gnomes can all get the same treatment. Rhett is very happy to be able to help others, and the tolerance of the foreigners here has made him feel very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that many people have recently asked him why the elves are going to invade their land. Drive them away from their homes and plant trees in the fields. Is the life of the elf necessarily noble, must be more meaningful than the days of the peasants? Rhett can't explain this question, he can only persuade everyone not to worry. Lord Siegel will find a way to solve everyone's predicament. As long as life is still there, everything has hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Siegel walked in, Rhett was helping to adjust the body parts. This konjac, which came back from the void, has always had problems recently, and the steel shell is twisted from time to time, as if it had been smashed. Fortunately, such a situation has no effect on the health of the konjac. It is very inconvenient to let it act. It is obviously a blacksmith's job, and Er Duo has to say that he needs treatment instead of repair. Almost every day he has to help the konjac to adjust the body parts, but the next day I don’t know why it will always go wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage looks at the konjac, the latter forks his slender fingers and his thumb keeps turning. "I can keep a repair on you so that your shell won't go wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Repair is useless!" The answer is: "You can't control the treatment?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the second rhyme is not aiming at Rhett with a rounded eye, I am afraid that Siegel still Can't understand his plans. The ability to use the magical image of the gods proves that if the living creatures have life and death, then it is possible to go to other gods in addition to returning to the mechanical plane after death. Konjac has never wanted to go back to where it used to work forever. So he tried his best to be different from Rhett's god. The magical image does not know the source of the magic, and it will not help the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
