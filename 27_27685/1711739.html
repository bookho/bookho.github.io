			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that the dwarf’s short legs are not suitable for tracking the enemy, and the wizard has long since escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the cell, the trucks of Siegel and Leah were also attacked, and all their things were rummaged. At the same time, the dwarf's warehouse was also broken, and many precious materials that had not yet arrived could be stolen. The potato bags are raging and think it is a shameless challenge to the dwarf kingdom! This incident greatly accelerated the speed at which the dwarves “trial case” and Siegel was officially released two days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He retrieved his armor and weapons and rearranged the truck. The two scorpions were scared to death in the battle, and only one scorpion and two horses survived fortunately. Both of them will re-prepare dry food and water to prepare the feed needed for the next trip. At this time, the Gerald dwarves found them and apologized and said: "The facts prove that you are innocently implicated. I am sorry for the delay in your time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The dwarf unloaded the baggage behind him and found it was a large bag of clothes. He said: "I understand that you are going to the top of Mora, on the way to the snowy mountain road. There are some warm clothes, including robe, gloves, shoes, etc., all of which are excellent products. Please accept them as The symbol of reconciliation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liya thought for a moment, understand that these are actually the goods that Gerrard has purchased from his own pocket, and the furnace hall will not have such kindness. The style of doing things. She knew that there was no need to conflict with the dwarf at this time, so she pretended not to understand anything, and happily accepted these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dwarf, your name is Gerard-Born Mine Pack?" Leah confirmed it again, then she said: "I have touched a lot." Dwarf, you are the one who knows the most. I hope to see you again in the future and have the opportunity to get to know you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf smiled and finally emerged from the beard mouth. He had a happy gesture, then shook hands with Leah and Siegel, and then rode the violent dog to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two need to continue west, just in the opposite direction of the dwarf. They are back to the state of training and rushing. Leah suddenly found out that Siegel was a little absent-minded when practicing archery, so he called him over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with you, what's the matter?" The elf asked with concern: "Is it still in the cage that still affects you?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No." Siegel was a little unhappy, and he paused a little, only to show his courage to the elf: "Master Lia, can I learn magic?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, Siegel." Leah said: "You may have the talent to learn magic, just like you practice martial arts. In my opinion Magic is a very strange and powerful force. A few people who master magic are called legendary powers. But magic and other forces, such as natural power, god power and martial arts, are a kind of world power. If you want to learn magic, of course, I will support you and Sir Bill. But now there is no such condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I become a Master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea thought about it carefully, then said "I think your problem is how to be a strong." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Siegel smiled, he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Let’s talk about becoming a mage first, otherwise you will always remember. There are three ways. One is to join the Master Tower, start from the apprentice, and slowly accumulate Knowledge. This method is the least expensive, but only accepts children, you are too old. The second is to find a teacher who is willing to teach you, but also to receive systematic education. But this is only suitable for the powerful aristocrats or mages. The civilians can't afford the teacher. The third way is to spend more money and learn by listening to the Master's lectures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you spend a lot of money? How many?” Siegel was surprised to hear about this for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Learning and studying magic is probably the most expensive thing in the world. I heard that the Freedom Masters Association in Deepwater City needs one hundred gold coins per day. The cost usually requires half a year of listening and two years of study to become a formal mage - and only a low-level mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily." Lia smiled. She lowered her voice and quietly said to Siegel: "Let's go to the top of Mora this time to make a fortune. The Eileen dwarf found a dragon in the past. It was taken up by a guy after the dragon slaughter. And that guy might be screaming when he was out – anyway, the treasures there are waiting for the new owner.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder you have to hurry to the top of Mora." Siegel said: "What about Sir Bill? Can he arrive after he has finished his work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Don't worry about him, let me talk about your business first." The elf said: "My thoughts are like this. You don't have a way to learn magic now, and you don't know if you are suitable for being a mage, but you don't know. Which step to develop. But you do have the talent to practice martial arts - don't waste this talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and clenched his fist to cheer himself up:" Master, you are right, I think too much influences the training. I try to be a knight first. After you have the wealth that can support you to learn magic, you will try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this episode, they are very safe along the way, arrived at the motorcycle At the foot of the mountain. The city here is called "Mountain Town" and is home to about 3,000 people, mainly humans and halflings. They mainly operate a variety of wineries here, there are hundreds of them, so the whole town is filled with the taste of distiller's grains all year round. Most of the food harvested on the Great Plains was shipped here and became the dwarf's favorite drink. The dwarves will give back the gold in the mountains, the gems, and the fine iron they built. The caravan is in a constant stream, and it is full of cargo here. A lot of things will go east and north all the way, leaving the New World from Sham Shui Po. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to wine and minerals, there is also a very famous commodity: distiller's meat. The large amount of waste generated by the brewing workshops has spawned the booming pig industry, and the dwarves can just consume the product nearby. The town where the pigs are raised and the wine workshop are separated by five miles, in order to avoid the smell of the pig pens affecting the pub business. Unfortunately, the Cloak Avenue from Hubburg is just going through the 'Pig Village', which gives a good workout to Siegel's breath-holding ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town has two gates, one facing the Great Plains and one leading to the mountains. The town is nominally a resident of the area, but everyone knows that short people are truly influential managers. They always guard the gates leading to the Mora, and strictly examine every passing traveler to check their carriage. This work began after the dwarves came here and continued until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front door is full of caravans, and there are hundreds of carriages to form a spectacular long river. Now it is just the procurement period before the big celebration. The merchants who heard the news all gathered here, which immediately caused unprecedented congestion. The merchants saw that they were obeying the order in terms of money, and the guards had long waited for impatientness, and a group of people gathered around the truck. In order to better pass the time, they carried out two businesses: gambling and wrestling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel came here in a carriage, they already understood that it was impossible to bring a truck up the mountain in a short time. The two people basically spent all their money on the road, leaving only the toll of more than ten gold coins. It now appears that the dwarf's promise of "good hospitality" is especially important for the lives of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, first store the truck, let's walk the mountain." Lia thought about it and made up her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has asked several hotels in succession, they are all full, and there is no place in the circle. A large number of foreign businessmen have made the town's affordability to the limit, and it is impossible to find a suitable place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless you are willing to pay a big price, you can only go to the residents' homes to try your luck." The innkeeper told them: "But even then, the pigs can't do it." Take care of your horses, especially the little pony. People who raise horses have found a job at the hotel, and they are too busy now. You should consider it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If there is no way to take care of the horses, then you can only take the mountain." The elf thought about it and then asked: "Now that so many caravans are transporting goods, should the trucks be able to sell for a good price?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, trucks are now in the same position as hotel rooms. Usually, a two-wheeled truck can only sell more than ten gold coins, but now it can be twenty gold coins, or it will be sold immediately. The two men sold the remaining scorpions and cleaned up some of the debris that could not be carried on their backs. In this way, the two men and women together made a total of forty gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not enough to listen to the Master's course in Sham Shui Po. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
