			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want my people to live in the dark underground, eating the dwarf moss, living like a mouse?" Evan and others After leaving, he said to Siegel: "The days are just as good as death. Are you sure that this is not a punishment? Is it a punishment for my support for the destruction of the goblin world?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "No, Evan, I don't mean punishment. Now is the survival, what to use at hand. Life in the underground is at least a life, immigration to other planets. The action can continue!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan looked at Siegel and wanted to get his real thoughts from his mouth. However, he can only see the deep eyes that belong to God, and there is no slight fluctuation in emotions. "Siegel, how long do we need to stay underground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This depends mainly on the dissipation of the dust radiation and whether the new world can be found. However, according to my estimation, the dust will always cover the sky in two hundred years, and its subsequent influence can even last for five hundred years. Therefore, in the end, we must find a way to colonize the stars, use the secret nuclear, transmission array and magic spaceship. This is not without a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the longevity of mankind, I can't see the day coming." Evan sighed: " After leaving the starry kingdom, am I still a king?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't think it is a tall seat of the Star Fortress or a sentence of the first king. You are in charge. The reason for the king? As long as you can make something worthy of being followed, then naturally someone will respect you as king.” Siegel encouraged him: “I admit, you are facing an unprecedented crisis, but also This is the case, you are likely to create great achievements beyond all ancestors."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A great achievement?" Evan was silent for a while, only a finger on the belt with the star badge embedded in it. After a while he said: "Siegel, you have a very interesting story about the gods, about the blind. But the world is going to be destroyed, and my starry kingdom will be destroyed together? I don't believe it. Since the Kingdom and the Masters Association parted ways, magic is just a tool, no longer a belief. Do you know why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. In the past, as the lord of Heim, he did not know these secrets, but as the god of knowledge, he knew the history that was recorded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of magic is higher than the sword, so a mage lord wants to build a magical empire is... it is a matter of course, the knight's class is difficult to block." Evan face The pale choice of this wording, "In this, the magic god's will played a very important role in promoting, after all, the jurisdiction of the magic user and the jurisdiction of the magical empire is not a level of things. Humans do not have racial gods, is the best The goal, and the gods in order to complete this experiment, it is a heavy disaster for the ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I and Aaron, or our generation, already Gradually forgetting the heavy disaster caused by the magical rebellion against the kingdom and the kingship, the result is that you have been the master of this mage. But it has always been good, as a lord you have been very loyal, and willing to share the inventions that improve the living standards of the kingdom. When you hand over powerful weapons such as muskets and magical spaceships to the royal family, I actually have a sigh of relief for a small group of people who know the inside story. After these decades, your lord's position passed down to Isaac, should it be too peaceful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't expect you to be Magic god. I didn't believe it at first, but after seeing your ability, I had to face it up. You gave Isaac the position of the lord. This is very good. Actually, I should be very happy. But you tried It’s too dangerous to let everyone believe in yourself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel interrupted his words and said: “I said before, this is only temporary. The measure. Afterwards, I am willing to believe and believe, and I don’t want to believe that I am not reluctant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you are saying this now, but you still have a sentence. Evan took a long breath and said, "You said, you won't let other gods return lightly. Siegel, you have already regarded this world as yours. This is your territory. Other things that God can't touch. When you have tasted the power of the fire that is pushed up by faith, can you quit? You are the only god born, no one To check and balance you, as long as you have a greedy thought, you can rule the spirit and thought of the whole world. Tell me the truth, can you do such a thing, can you guarantee that such things will not be guaranteed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wants to make a guarantee, but he also knows in his heart that all gods will become greedy to varying degrees. As long as the fire has its own right, then it will be inevitable. Even the Lord of Light and Justice, did not arrange a saint to try to kill Evan? Siegel can now suppress the greed of divinity with the brilliance of humanity, but still regard the world of thunder wall as his own possession. After a few hundred years, after thousands of years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The outside world is not suitable for the main material plane to survive, human nature will be wiped out, and there will be only the tendency of the plane. If you lose a lot of different postures, can it be called a person?" Siegel frowned and replied: "And outside The horizon is too dangerous, I can't protect you all. The terrible creatures, the unbearable climate and the harsh geological environment, I am afraid it is very difficult to grow enough food."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same is true in the underground." Evan said: "Let's say, my biggest concern is that when everyone turns faith into you - whether it is temporary or not - This thing will change you forever, and it will never be in the right direction. I can't know if there is something wrong with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Even if that happens, everyone is still alive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a mortal, you are a god, I can't convince you." Wen shook his head and could easily see his inner guilt and uneasiness: "Give me back, I There are a lot of things to be prepared. I can order the transfer, but I will not order a change of faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Temple of Dawn is not always in close cooperation with the royal family. Why can't it be my magical temple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan did not answer, perhaps because this answer would hurt Siegel's heart. Siegel knows that suspicion and hope are the most fundamental sources of human power, but when this suspicion points to oneself and hopes to be almost fantasies, the taste is still very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use divine power, Siegel can easily "convincing" Evan and turning him into a sly king. Not only him, but everyone who is not protected by ethnic gods can easily be distorted by magic and become a prisoner of Siegel's followers. What's more, Siegel still has a strong tranquility array. This kind of mind control effect can not only bring death, but also bring absolute obedience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the mind is powerful, and the power of independent thinking is the most basic but most important component of the multiverse. Even the mechanical konjac with order and unity as the most important task, they also have the ability to think independently without interference, and there will be guys like Erdu. If Siegel changed his mind extensively, he would not be much different from the most evil demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan said that it is not unreasonable. After having tasted the good taste of higher spirits, can you still control it? It was an extremely painful process for Siegel to abandon the priesthood of the prophecy when he was just in contact with the fire. If you haven’t really tasted the sweetness yet, and humanity still has the upper hand, Siegel can hardly believe that he can cut a part of the fire! In fact, why did you not plan to become the only true God in the world? How to go deep into the lives of ordinary people, how to promote magic, how to become an indispensable god, this step has not been calculated many times in the mind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the best way is to find a safe half-plane, which eliminates the need to cut the wall channel and avoid a temptation. Lear once said that some people are willing to exchange the technology of the secret nuclear core with a half-plane, which is a very cost-effective transaction for Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately Lear’s memory was completely removed by Siegel, and there was no such thing as a record of the knowledge of God. So after sending away Evan, Siegel came directly to the Masters Association, and perhaps the people here could have some impressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters Association has always followed the tradition of "respecting the magical god but not worshipping", so even if the magical god comes true, it is only greeted by the standard of receiving guests. From the eyes of the Association Master, most of what Siegel sees is excitement. Not excited to see the gods, but because it is possible to know that the Master is going to God. This road is a way to get through, so I am very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lear ** is often acting alone, we are not very clear. But I think his apprentice may know one or two." There is a ** The teacher said to Siegel: "But since the conflict between Lear and you, his apprentices have rarely seen it. It is not easy to find it immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to find them as soon as possible, but the ultimate goal is still half-face." Siegel said to the members of the Masters Association: "With the astral projection, you should be able to enter safely." There is more information in the gate city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magical god, the silver line of the astral projection is very fragile, and many races in the outer domain have direct 斩The means of breaking the silver line. If we can, we would rather use the door of the outside world to go directly to the gate city, so that there are more protections available."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
