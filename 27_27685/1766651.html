			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the excavation has been lingering in Siegel for a few days, and now it is finally free. When the pneumatic drill of the gas finally penetrated the rock formation and the fresh air from the outside continued to flow in, Siegel felt as if he had been reborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days outside are not yet bright, the world is silent, gray. Everyone just woke up from their dreams and fell into this lonely gray. Siegel stood on the hillside of the cave, and adjusted his sense of direction after a while. He has long been accustomed to the western part of the city in the territory of the city, but now he is in the west of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is finally through." The dwarf's breath is transpiration in the air, which is colder and drier than the east side of the mountain. Maybe it’s too long to stay underground, and the winter begins quietly? Siegel is somewhat uncertain, maybe this is just a local climate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people walked down the hill to a low ridge. At this time, the morning light finally revealed, and a faint golden light appeared from the top of the walled mountain range. Siegel thought that because of the blockage of the mountains, it is necessary to see the sunrise later than the east, especially at the foot of the mountain, the cold and dark nights are longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stopped and they have reached a few miles below the hole. Looking out into the distance with the morning light, the grassland is awkward in the field of vision. Under the cold, the grassland became yellow, but it still seemed to have a thick blanket on the ground. Siegel has been seeing the distant horizon until the eyes are sore and the so-called hills and gullies are not found. It seems to be wider than the sea, and it is terrible to teach people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the scenery west of the Walled Mountains." The dwarf said. He knelt down, pulled out a thatched grass, and grabbed a handful of dirt from the pit. "You see, the soil here can be cultivated, but it has never been used. What a pity! More waste!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No tribes nearby?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know this." The dwarf said: "The barbarians are wandering around, they don't have a fixed home, they don't build castles. Because they can't always care for farmland in one place, There are a lot of wild animals here, and if you don't pay attention, you will destroy the crops. So they are rarely planted. There are very few stones on the vast grassland. Unless they go to the ravine area, they also lack iron ore and copper mines. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But these have no effect on me, I can come from the mountains to the east." Siegel asked: "So here are the barbarians What can I offer? What I need most is food.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s winter now. I’m afraid there won’t be too much meat, but dairy and fur they always have. The dwarf smiled and said to Siegel: "In fact, the most land in this land is still various animals." I have seen many 10,000 bisons migrating together. Do you have enough weapons? Hunt for it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now I am afraid that it is not hunting. "Siegel said: "Is it necessary to protect the hole first, and avoid being discovered by the Mullah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right. The Lord is the Lord. This is the first thing.” Dwarf Locke replied: “But let me breathe the air outside the cage.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a while, when the sun sprinkled light on everyone's shoulders, they went back. The dwarf's rune master, together with Siegel, set a spell enchantment around the hole. Other than the person who knows the specific secret language, other people cannot open the entrance to the cave. And if you want to destroy this layer of protection silently, you must remove the runes and wizard spells at the same time, which is too difficult for outsiders. After they planned to build a fortress on the slope below the cave, as a transitional base, it could be used as an important hub for material exchange. Because it was not built on the hole. So even if someone took a fortress and couldn't find an entrance to the east of the mountain, Siegel could always mobilize his troops to kill and recapture his castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is necessary to continue to lay the ropeway system, especially to solve the transportation problem of the original emerald mine section. Because of the fear of being discovered by the Rune of the Walled Mountains, the width of this tunnel cannot be easily expanded and vehicles cannot travel in it. If you rely on people to pull a shoulder or a unicycle, it is difficult to form a stable transportation environment. The ropeway system can undulate in the direction of the tunnel, which will save a lot of manpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, Siegel’s experience is far less than the dwarf. These strong miners have extensive experience in underground construction, ropeway and hoisting systems, so that the Master can't fully insert it. They gathered the remaining rune materials. The metal rope made of alloy is used as the main body, and the sliding hook is made with the solid rune, the repair rune and the light rune. The dwarves tried it, each slipper could support four hundred pounds of items, and it was able to advance very smoothly with the ropeway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Janet, Fitzak, Mana, Zucker and Janis knew this secret passage. If they heard the news of the tunnel. Will inevitably cheer. However, Mana is not in the city of Mire. She is carrying a guard team of 50 people to the north of the city wall and visiting the lords of a castle chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel called Moore, patted him on the shoulder and ordered him to kneel down. "Mor, are you willing to swear allegiance to me, be a brave and upright person? Can you face your enemies without fear, and remain honest even when you may be guilty of murder? Can you live with your own life? Weapons protect the weak, and never because of the evil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol nodded, clenching his right fist on his chest: "Yes, I swear!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel taps Moore's shoulders with the icy sword of the stardust, and then lets him get up. "You are my knight now, you have to remember your vows, even if you are not with me, you must strictly ask yourself. I want you to go to the temple of Reid for a long time, then go home and celebrate with your family. Tomorrow morning At the time, you have to be ready to go. Remember, you will be the first person to build a castle west of the Walled Mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, you are Say I am going to have a castle?" Moore's hands and feet trembled, apparently excited and somewhat overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be nervous, you are right." Siegel said: "I plan to build a fortress to protect the tunnel exit. There is still only a prototype, everything is there. You need to worry about it. Mier City will fully support, especially the construction of the castle. You can also let your grandfather help recommend candidates to help you manage the daily affairs of the castle. My request is simple: this life and death channel must Keep it safe and smooth, and you should pay attention to maintaining the trading relationship with the barbarian and let the resources flow to and from the two sides of the tunnel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following, Lord Lord, I must Do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, go find your grandfather, I have to ask him about the elves."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor hesitated for a moment, but still bravely said with courage: "The Lord, there is something I want to tell you in advance. The elf force outside Heim’s collar is Led by Master Lia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow It enveloped the room, into the dark shadow seems to have flames burning sound. Siegel’s body suddenly appeared heavy and powerful, as cold as a rock, and the shadow that obscured all the light shone from him. Moore couldn't help but shudder when the shadows hit, but soon felt huge heat, like being in a volcano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel squeezed his fist and slowly released it. The fiery shadows faded and Moore resumed breathing. "Go, call Fazak." Siegel said weakly: "Let the kitchen send some warm red wine and then find my pipe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mol quickly went to Zhang Luo these things, when the one-eyed old man came, Siegel had already sat in the chair of the study, apparently calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Fazk to speak, Siegel said by himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am quiet After thinking about it carefully, Leah is a good thing in the opposite legion, which means she still has feelings for Heim, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zach nodded and then shook his head again. "It’s not necessarily for Heim, but it is definitely for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Master Leah left the city of Mire, she probably didn’t know the elves. Strategy. At the time of Islois, I felt that his Druid’s father seemed to have something to say. Now I think it might be the Elven War Tree Project. Leah returned to Isloris and learned about it. She has various choices and can go in all directions, but she finally chose the southwest, which is the direction of Heim."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak agrees Said: "As far as I know, Heim is the region with the least impact and loss in this chaos. And a few days ago, she gave us time to let the farmers quickly seize the turnips and increase the grain reserves. Geer, I suggest that you still see her as soon as possible, which is good for both of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What identity do I see him?" After drinking a red wine, after clearing the scorpion, he said: "My plan is to provoke the Elves and Knox to join the war. Point to the north, and prepared some information and intelligence for this. But the information is true and false, if submitted by Lia, after the end of the war, if the elf is still, she will be implicated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
