			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood in the middle of the magical array and began to sing the spell initiated by the Faction. The Elean language, the dwarf language, the lingua franca, and the Turkish language used by Nerikes sounded in turn, and all of them were attributed to the mysterious dragon language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender magical line begins to shine, which is an alloy formed by the secret silver, silver-plated mixed red copper, and tin liquid. The magic array first extracts the energy needed to start from Siegel, and then the crystal pillar stone begins to function, and the free elements converge toward the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel's carefully crafted spells began to utter the first roar in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quintessential magical energy runs through the mage's body from head to toe and then blends into the circle of the feet. This energy is like Mars, igniting the intricate fuse. The summaries of the spells are activated, like the gear version interlocking with each other, to work together precisely for the same goal: on the edge of the circle, there is a ruby ​​there, the purpose of the entire array is to crack it, turning it into pure Magic energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s senses blended with the entire magical array, and he “sees” that he is slowly crawling into the ruby, starving in the belly. He grew his claws from his body, sharpened his teeth, opened his mouth, and prepared to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruby is as delicious as he thinks, but it’s hard! He couldn't crush it directly, and he didn't dare to swallow it. He restrained his own **, sucking a little bit, a little bit stunned. In this process, the material disappears and the energy is continuously produced. The entire magic array is enveloped in an incredible amount of elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth began to vibrate, and the nearest Wendy suddenly fell to the ground and rushed back. The soldiers led by Heim took the weapon nervously and tried to restrain the urge to escape. They witnessed the rise of a sun, and the dazzling light made them have to raise their hands to cover their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of Heim’s shadows have changed direction and have escaped the “sun” of the magical array. Animals with keen senses, such as dogs and pigeons, all crouched on the ground, and did not dare to move and did not dare to scream. The mage who lived in the city flew to the roof and opened their mouths in surprise. In their senses. A sun made purely by elemental energy is shining. That kind of energy is very pure and has the power to assimilate everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary spell?" Half-elf Idis squinted and looked at the elemental sun thoughtfully. Age makes his body gradually decline, but it seems to be full of vitality under the light of this new sun. He feels that he can mobilize more power, and the difficult magic does not seem to be unconquerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recites a spell. Summon a flame snake and let it fly around his wrist. The spell was successfully completed, but all the energy came from him. The elements around it turn a blind eye to his spells, and even avoid snakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For years, Edith was so surprised for the first time. Maybe it's the last time. The element actually betrayed him and made him thirsty alone next to the sweet stream. Edith only felt that his heartbeat was very fast, his breathing was short and superficial. Death is an indestructible stone, lurking under the magical lake, and when the lake is exhausted, it will emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushed to dispel the magic, sat down and began to meditate, slowly replenishing the body's consumption. It allows the elements that are neutral to obey the command, without giving the mage the support of the spell, if such a feature can continue. So within the sphere of influence of the law, isn’t there a way to live without other casters? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of power is this? God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not so optimistic, now he has hardships. From the time the first gem fragment was broken down, the entire array was out of his control and began to run on its own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tide of the element runs through him from beginning to end, stripping his consciousness and body. His senses continued to expand as the energy of the element expanded, covering the entire city of Mire, but his body was still in place, still motionless in the center of the circle. He tried to return to the flesh and blood body, but was constantly pushed away by the elemental energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this. He also discovered that the element is learning from his mind, constantly assimilated his knowledge and ability, and connected his consciousness and magical array. Siegel became an element, and he could control the flow of elements within the scope of his senses. For example, don't let the spell of the half-elf wizard Idis get any energy supplement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to flip the spell, but his body still had no action, and the magic array was still "normal". For the present, only the desperate throws into the state of the undead, with the power of the soul fire to withdraw the sense of freedom outside. How does this cause changes in the law? Siegel is not very sure, but hopes not to cause disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His thoughts just rose, and he found himself back in the body, and did not become awkward. Everything around it became very slow, and the flow of time was hard. Even if he is at the heart of the "Elemental Sun", the light here becomes dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even saw the elements and the light itself moving slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't watch, it's all because the light and the elements are slowing down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A voice rang from behind Siegel, and he quickly turned to look. In a world as dark as the night, there is only one form that emits a ray of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the light is a gray robe, old and broken, with three patches on it. The man in the robes bent over and licked a curved wooden crutch. His head was low and he was covered in a hood. It stands to reason that this is like an old man, but Siegel’s intuition is not the case. He noticed the hand holding the crutches: the skin is not young and firm, but it has nothing to do with aging relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you? All this is what you do?" Siegel pointed to the magical array that became slow, and then said, "Come out of you." The true face, don't huddle in the shadow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been gone for a long time." The man raised his head and Siegel kept his eye on the hood. The shadow below. A familiar face appears, black eyes and black hair. Siegel took a breath of air, and he saw himself, exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world becomes instantly silent, and two identical people look at each other. In this moment when even the light can't move, countless thoughts shuttle through Siegel's mind. Who is he? Is it me? How is this going? where is he from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, "Siegel" wearing a gray robe finally broke the silence: "I am you, from your future."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel slightly opened his mouth. A word blurted out. The gray robes also spoke at the same time, saying with the same tone and voice and Siegel: "Time travel is feasible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is feasible, but The conditions are very harsh." Siegel of the gray robe asked himself: "I know what I want to ask, so I will answer directly. To avoid wasting time." He sighed and licked his waist, then said: "Despite the control of time, time seems to never be enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master raised his hand and was about to speak. “Greypai Siegel” said: “I know the answer to some questions, but the process is as important as the result. I can answer but I don’t want to answer. As for another question, the shuttle time is extremely energy-consuming. This array is only the basis, but it is stubborn. Enough for me to show up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his crutches and pointed at the ground. Siegel saw the lines of the magical array change in his hands, and the runes on some of the crystal pillars were also modified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really admire my own shackles when I was young, almost turned into a pure magical creature." The gray robes said: "Don't connect your consciousness to the elements in the future." On - as well as the construction - such things are too dangerous, leading to big problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still need to learn. Open-minded learning." Gray The robe said: "I use a question to convince you: the elemental surge of the elf has been studied for thousands of years. Why did you make this array? Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elemental Array, Energy Focusing Lens, Battlemark, and Pipeline and Plasma, including all kinds of things in the future," he said with a smile: "Why? You are better than everyone else." Smart?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel couldn’t answer this question and could only shake his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Learn magic, does not mean mastering strength; learning knowledge does not mean having wisdom." Gray Robe Siegel said: "I have already repaired the squad. You can use it with confidence. Although the error did not happen, you should also remember this lesson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
