			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ticket, the name was registered by handwriting. Whoever can match the name, whoever can sit on the caravan of the caravan. However, no one in the world checks the ticket. As long as there is no overcrowding and no disputes, the driver who drives the car does not care about a few people. Siegel continued to learn the accent of the surrounding goblins, and consciously did not leak, so he used the two Mao Tabaka to put the weapon in the obvious place as a deterrent, and then left the red foot town with the eyes of the chosen person. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feet here are all red, bloody red. When Siegel left, he wanted to understand the origin of the town name. What kind of character will be created on what kind of land. The people who step on the farmland bear the wind and rain, they are persevering; the people who step on the water know that they will sink when they stop to move, so they go forward; the people who step on the grassland are broad-minded; the people who step on the marble floor of the palace are heart-wrapped. . People who step on the soil that has been soaked in the blood have absorbed the bloody breath from their pores. What do they know? Obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel still uses the name Taka, and made up a story for him: he is a hunter from the mountains, accidentally dug a gem, made a Pen Xiaocai left the place. He wants to go to the warm purple city of the south to find new life opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it Purpletown, Taka?" Asked is Siegel's only travel companion, a goblin who is overly obese, appetite and curiosity. Even if it was snow and ice outside, he was bare-chested and looked like a yellow-brown sea lion. According to him, half of the vehicles in their fleet are this fat goblin, especially the other two cars loaded with gun bodyguards are his direct subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked up at him and touched the handle. Clearly shows what you mean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen. Tower Ka..." Fat Goblin stretched out his tongue and licked the shredded pork in his teeth. Then he licked the fingers of the oily light, and then said: "I know Taka is a cautious hunter. I have recently lost my tongue and my face has been caught three oblique and deep wounds. You are also called Taka. This is fine, but you are taking the ticket for the Taka who has no tongue and hurts his face. What you don't know is that Taka is the person who works for me, so you are my own."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say. Fat man?" Siegel did not find this paragraph in the memory of Taka, but it is not good to directly deny the fat man's statement ■■ ,. So he snorted, and he was a wicked pirate. Maybe he could "dead" a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat goblin didn’t care too much about the fat man’s name. He blinked and said, “Do you know what version update is, what about the country? Is there a More agile, more ferocious, smarter, the key is that the more fortunate Taka replaces the previous one, this is the upgrade update. You can sit in the same compartment with me, and have nothing to do with your ticket, your gun. It’s just that I want to know the features of the new version. So either you will satisfy my curiosity, or you will go to the car behind. Then you will be blasted by twelve strong gnomes!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your life is in my hands, fat man." Siegel patted the musket and said with a swearing voice: "Did you not forget this?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, I almost forgot." The fat man tried to turn around and took out a "white" soft plastic "plastic" box from the back of the crackling chair and carefully opened it. The six large snails are squatting on the green leaves, and the cold outside makes them shake their tentacles and shrinks into the shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, Taka, the snail thought that he had a shell and it would be protected. With the leaves, there would be happiness. Their eyes were so short, not at all. Know who is the one who controls everything.” Fat Goblin picks up a snail with two fingers, puts it on his mouth and sucks it, then chews it up. "The gun in your hand is nothing but a snail's shell. It's useless in the face of real power. You see, the shell is still there, the snail is gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to say?" Siegel took out the rifle and aimed at the head of the fat goblin, then threatened: "There are only six bullets in the gun. There is no guarantee that all your bodyguards will be destroyed, but it will be enough to smash your head. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, listen, you impulsive fool. This was originally to find Taka, but who told you to go on this? Car? This is your luck, don't squander easily." Fat Goblin said: "Killing an adult bear can make you earn 9000 yuan, but the value of a prey is 60 times that of a bear."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fifty thousand?" Siegel deliberately showed a greedy look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This description only matches the dwarf, and Siegel immediately raised his ears. However, he turned to think that he was just a goblin in the deep forest, and he could know the limited, so he made a curious expression: "I haven't heard of it, what is the use of Zhuofu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course is to create a youth pharmacy." Fat Goblin said: "A Zhuofu can top three hundred units of material, the natural value of that price. I happen to know the approximate location of a few Zhuofu hiding, just nearby. My The hands are smart, but not good at snow tracking. Would you like to join in and hunt together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?" Siegel took the gun Get up and ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"10,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final negotiation result is 25,000. Because Zhuofu wants to be valuable, he must be alive, and the more he jumps, the better. Siegel said that he is good at tracking in the snow and ice, and can take the lead. "If you want to shoot at the back of me, you can try it." Siegel threatened: "I promise you can't get out of this snowfield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel will not follow, but relying on positioning techniques to find traces of dwarves is not a difficult thing. A group of seven people - fat goblin and his remaining four bodyguards stayed in the car - left the forest road and marched into the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By knocking along the side of the road, Siegel finally figured out the matter. After the dwarf entered the world, he did not immediately fight, but built a fortress and tried to trade with the Goblin. The goblins who deal with the dwarves are the weakest of all the kingdoms of the goblins and are not qualified to add stripes or stars to their flags. They also kept the original worship, and thought that the fire-breathing dragon once ruled the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, "a big star" discovered this group of dwarves and then started research. They found that these "Zhuofu" have a very long life and are very suitable for refining youth medicine. So they tried to capture the creatures with anesthetic smoke. The dwarves are very resistant to toxins and diseases, and most of the anesthetics have no effect, which has led to war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the dwarves were killed, many were captured, and some escaped. They hid in the cave and used the excavated passage to run into the mountains. The goblins didn't want to spend a lot of time looking for them. After all, they thought that as long as they passed the amethyst, they could lead to a world full of "Zhuofu." But the goblin did not find the key to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scientists" believe that using huge amounts of energy for stimulation until spatial shock is the only way to unlock the door. Therefore, while the goblins attacked with nuclear bombs, they searched for the Zhuofu who was hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblins have made these things to Siegel in a big way, and there is no reservation at all. It seems that they do not want to leave a living after the event. Siegel listened and listened to his own experiments. The body structure of these goblins is no different from the goblin of their own world, and even appears to be thinner. It is not difficult to deal with the removal of firearms in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toxins, diseases, and fatigue can work as usual, and these people do not have the slightest sense of magic. Flames, ice, acid and lightning, the goblins are not at all resistant. They will also fear, shudder, be petrified, and will be robbed. In the day before going to hunt down the dwarves, except for Siegel, the other six goblins constantly changed their patterns and died until the last two goblins resisted the cold and pointed the gun at Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all the ghosts you make, isn’t it?” The goblin’s teeth and fingers are shaking, his eyelids are heavy, and he always wants to shine outside. Cover. It is clear that if you close your eyes, you are really dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Taka" sat in front of both of them, and said calmly: "I did it, I was poisoned in your food." If the two of you are begging for mercy now, and listening to me at a later time, then you can live and get a lot of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We detoxify, or we will die!" The goblin shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You point the gun at me, then I have the medicine for you, do you dare to eat it?" Siegel snorted. "You are the only one." The possibility of living is to guarantee me and to carry it out. Only then, your life is valuable to me, and I have the need to save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Go to you! Go to hell!" Two goblins fired at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
