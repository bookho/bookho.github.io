			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short temple was finally quiet, even though it was destroyed by battle and magic, the stone pillar collapsed, the wall broke, the floor broke, and the magic array was burned. However, Siegel still took a long breath, and the battle was over, and finally it was temporarily safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet lies quietly in his arms, his face pale, his lips are chapped, his body is soft, and he is weak to the limit. Siegel gently placed her on the ground, found the preserved red wine from the key space, plus a half bottle of sugar, and fed it into Janet's mouth. Then I watched her face get better and her breathing was steady, and then she let go of her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he handed the rest of the wine to Evan, and the young man of the blonde took it and poured it into the prince’s mouth. "Thank you for your help this time." Evan said: "I didn't expect this to survive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't provoke such a dangerous thing." "Siegel looked at the twenty scorpions on his chest, and the number on it was completely dimmed." Magic resistance has saved him many lives, but it has been ruined in this adventure, which makes him very sad. However, Siegel does not hate others. After all, entering the cave is his own choice. There are many times he can choose to leave, but what makes him insist on it? Siegel asked himself, maybe a rigid knight spirit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone can't help themselves." Evan should have a sentence. He found that the blood-sucking morning guard had already died, so he dragged his body to the side. Count Todd was lucky to live. He was stumped by the collapsed pillar, injured in the head and back, and temporarily comatose. He escaped the blood sacrifice, was attacked by magic, and was possessed, but suffered some skin injuries. Evan cleaned the wound for him and awakened him with water. Earl Todd woke up low and cautiously looked at the situation around him, then barely stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young man, thank you for your assistance." Earl Todd bowed and said: "The kingdom of stars will not forget your help."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, thank you for the kingdom of stars, I am just helping my master, Sir Bill, I think you all know him." Siegel did not stand up and return, but everyone saw him Janet in the room did not care about this. Heroes always have some privileges, and saviors are even more. Count Todd nodded and said, "So you are the sergeant of Bill Baron? How old are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seventeen."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't have a chance to save the prince when I was seventeen, otherwise I have already become the Duke." Earl Todd smiled, short white beard with his smile And shaking, he said: "At the age of seventeen, I was still working hard to pursue Miss Marinna and wanted to get her favor at the ball. At that time, I didn't know what was wild, what was dangerous, what was It is the responsibility of the knight. You see, I got married the next year, and in the next three years I inherited the title of the Earl from the deceased father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened quietly Finished the count, but his eyes kept looking at Janet. Then Siegel smiled and said, "You are very lucky when you were young, but don't be in danger when you are old. There is a prince lying there, and too many people's well-being is still on him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s true, young man, responsibility should always be the first." The count replied: "I have known this after many years as the count. I believe that the prince will learn the lesson after this time. Growth is important, and returning goodwill is more important than growing up. Young man, what do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Count Todd looked at Siegel quietly, his eyes wide. Many people will be afraid in front of his bright eyes, because he can see the hearts of the people. If Sigel asks after the prince is awake, then the prince can only promise, this is a necessary gesture for the future king to face the savior. If this young man asks for too much, he will make His Highness very embarrassing. Earl Todd intends to ask first, so there is a cushioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came here entirely for Sir Bill, who always wanted to be the lord of the land." Siegel finally looked up and looked straight into the count's eyes, calming. Said: "I hope that this matter can be reached as soon as possible, so that Sir Bill becomes the Lord of Bill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is my knight, my vassal, this There is no problem with the matter.” The count said: “I will arrange for him along the riverside city. It was originally prepared for my second son. It is a wealthy and calm town. I believe that Mr. Bill’s lord will become a good courtier. As for You, boy, you are the servant of my vassal, are you willing to be my knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl sighed, and was disappointed that he did not include both of them. However, he will not be happy, after all, the most basic purpose of the bottom has been reached. "Let's get out of here," said the count. Siegel was wearing the clothes of the morning guard and finally finished the state of the **. He packed up the things on the ground, except for the daggers and wands that he carried with him, and the others were thrown into the key space. Evan came over to help, and handed over the scattered things, including the blood magicians who were not destroyed by the war, to Siegel. "I have to learn to play light, good friends in the future." He deliberately said: "All are taken, don't lose it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel does not I care about other things, but when he saw that the four magic books of the Blood Magician were all thrown into the key space intact, they were very happy. The battle just made him feel dizzy and almost forgot to clean the battlefield. It is estimated that Janet's injury has filled him with the idea of ​​'getting out of here as soon as possible and going outside to find a doctor'. He whispered thanks to Evan, and then waited until the entire space was filled, then regained Janet and walked away with the old man who was carrying the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They returned to the Skull Hall in the shortest path, which is exactly the same as before without Janet. Siegel thought of his promise and picked up the leader from the platform. "Lonklaga?" He whispered, then saw the flame reignited in the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young apprentice apprentice, you are back." The leader said: "I am sorry that I can't protect your woman. I can't show my way in front of the blood magician. "Too dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Siegel said: "If you are discovered by him, we have no hope of winning."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your understanding." The soul of the Taikoo dragon responded to him: "Are you coming to destroy me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"If you still hope so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally, I can rest in peace." The dragon said calmly: "I am happy, happiness." Over, anger, sorrow, and then life and death, all the emotions have been smoothed by the endless years, my soul has no color, and the dead is no different. I only want to be free and enter the eternal calm sleep. I will repay you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say it again, Lonclaja, otherwise my guilt will Bad you desire. "Siegel put the keel back on the table, he took out obsidian dagger. "Do you think this can make a difference?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Align the position between the eyes." The dragon skull said: "Your dagger is born in the void Condensed dragon inflammation, so it has the ability to end me." The flame in the keel eyelids finally flashed a few times, then gradually extinguished. The last sentence of the Taikoo dragon Long Kelga is: "Don't be guilty, apprentice mage, this is not a farewell, you will take my blessing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing the dragon's skull, and then seeing numerous cracks spread from the breach. Siegel called the name of the dragon again and there was no response. The dragon and his dialogue only happened in the mind of Siegel, and the other people did not know what happened. They only used this as part of the mysterious action of the wizard. Several people reorganized their spirits and embarked on the road of returning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a precise map, Siegel and his team no longer have to go through the long sacral passage, they only take half an hour to leave the other side of the valley . It was separated from the ruins of the entire fortress by their camp. Although the ground was covered with snow and it was slippery, the guards of the camp saw them far away and rushed to the horse with a trailer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gods are on, the prince and the countess are all right!" Everyone gathered around and could see that they had a long sigh of relief: "Come on Dr. Rees, the camp quickly burned hot water, ready for the biggest tent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocratic jazz and mercenaries are detached from the fur cloak on the trailer Then, put the prince down on it. Their attention was on His Royal Highness and the Earl. Only Sir Bill came up and photographed Siegel's shoulder. He said with relief: "You will come back safely, this time thanks to you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled happily and was able to satisfy Sir Bill. At this time, Janet woke up. She has been in a state of demon, and she has not used her ability to disguise herself. She smelled the smell of Siegel, arched her head into the arms of her lover, and wrapped her tail gently on Siegel's wrist, sleeping peacefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill frowned, and he almost consciously took out his weapon when he saw the demon's first time. “This is Janet?” asked Sir Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
