			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical pain can be easily detected, but mental problems are difficult to recognize on their own. Siegel was immersed in madness and noisy meditation, and each one tried to convince himself that he was caught in constant internal friction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his mind, many clones have closed their mouths and no longer speak. This can make Siegel feel calmer and have a sense of accomplishment that conquers others' arguments. But the person who closes his mouth still has his thoughts. Siegel only replaces the diversity of thought with the unity of the fire. If he continues this way, he will soon become the next Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the outside, there is nothing wrong with Siegel. The magic god meditates in his own temple, and the body exudes a stable and peaceful elemental fluctuation. In the past, Siegel once said that he had to think about the problem of the crystal wall passage, so everyone did not find that he was in trouble. Including the Ryder Pastor, everyone will take a light step when passing through the Siegel room, for fear of disturbing his contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor and his wife Nata did not return to the starting castle after the meeting, but borrowed the messenger from the city of Mire to return the letter. The starting point of the castle population is not much, most of them are from the residents of the Nata tribe. Although they have settled for a long time beside the Tears of God, they still have not forgotten the habits and abilities of nomadic life. For them, preparing for a long-distance migration in three months is only a common thing. The only problem is how to say goodbye to the place where they lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, Moore and Nata lived in the city of Mire, hoping to have the opportunity to meet Siegel again. For the twelve-faced scorpion in her hand, Nata has been confused about how to use it. She only knows that when she carries it, she will become invincible, and the wound caused by the monster is extremely difficult to recover. Relying on this ability, she became the best hunter in the group, but this ability is also very easy to accidentally hurt someone close to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a child, my father Diou suffered many injuries, and even the tiniest scratches took three to four months to fully heal. So she has been trying to figure out how to control this ability, she will not miss the meeting with Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant brought the news again, the magic god adults are still meditating, and did not meet anyone. Two people can only sigh and sit back in the chair with disappointment. "If you can't do it, go back first. I am here waiting for the lord." Nata persuaded her husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord of the Lord is Isaac now, and Siegel is the former lord." Moore corrected, "I am with you, if the world really wants Destroyed, I still don't hurry up with you, that is the biggest fool in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flower words..." Nata smiled, suddenly Wrinkled brows alert. "There is a strange smell, not human!" The two of them took up the weapon and carefully pushed the door of the castle of Mire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, not only the two of them, there are already six giant gas element rune guards gathered around, surrounded by the garden platform of the castle. They watched a black energy sphere with lightning on its surface gradually getting bigger until it expanded to a three-meter radius. The flowers and plants planted on the local area were forced by the force of space and stacked on each other to retreat around the ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This energy is obvious, but the magical alert of the city is not triggered. The whole sphere is the ultimate use of a space spell. The original space is perfectly reproduced on its surface, and the magic fluctuations are not aware of the fact that there is more. Those who can cross the alert circle in this way must be magic masters, but why do you still notice the energy signal? Despite the puzzling, the defenders of the city of Mith were ready to deal with the danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy ball stabilizes, the reflective mirror becomes a transparent bubble, and then disappears with a bang. The removed space rebounded and the flowers covered the ground again. Two people appeared in front of the crowd, one was the dragon girl, and the other was the male mage who had never seen anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am coming back, I brought a guest to go to Siegel, can you tell me where he is?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The weapon is put away, to report to the lord the adult, the dragon girl Capricorn is back," said a guard who knew her. "Miss Capri, Miss Siegel is not in the castle now, but in the new magic temple in the west. Do you want to see Mrs. Janet first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "When I come back, this friend is not very patient." Capricorn whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out from the second floor of the castle to the west, the Temple of Magic is not magnificent, but it is already very conspicuous. Lynch put her hand on the shoulder of the dragon girl and sent it with her with a bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array of the Temple is stronger than the city of Mire. It is forbidden to fly and transmit here. The only feasible way to move is to have both feet. Although Lynch has a space-volume, it is harder and more time-consuming to dismantle the space defense system here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside enlightenment hall left a deep impression on him, those who stood in the hall to learn the language and the most basic spell knowledge come from all walks of life, different Class and identity. They are at least equal in the face of knowledge, and they need to learn to master in the morning and evening. Lynch and the dragon girl passed through the crowd and walked straight behind the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room that Siegel used to meditate did not have a door, or that he was unconsciously meditation, and did not want to find a closed room for himself. The priest and paladin of the Temple of Magic will come back and forth, and will take a look when passing through the room. They can feel their divine power shaking in excitement and feeling the warmth of going home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Lynch frowned, and looked thoughtfully at Siegel sitting cross-legged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The idiots, their gods are in trouble, and no one can see it." Lynch said to Capricorn: "Go away Some, I have to play with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Capricorn stood between the two mages: "If you two are fighting Isn't Heim the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is caught in the maze of thinking, only the crisis of life and death can make him wake up early." Lynch to the dragon girl Smiled: "I have experienced this kind of thing, I have experience, and I will not have a big problem. If someone tries to stop it, it is best to stop it and don't get caught in the battle group and cause accidental injury."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, he moves one step at a time, and the energy of the magic spell gathers in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the temple is the godland of the magic god, where the spells are subject to the consent of the magic god, and the spells that attempt to attack are forbidden. A flash of light flashed, and the spell in Lynch's hand was directly dispelled, and the elements around his body were all dispelled. In this way, he can't borrow the elements of the outside world, and naturally he can't build a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ability to control the elements is so good, do you still have the elemental duties?" Lynch moved his neck, then his shoulders and wrists. As soon as he took a belt, a mysterious scroll lighted slightly, providing him with the energy he needed to cast his spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is still arguing with himself in meditation, suddenly feeling a threat. This threat is so strong that it has not been since he became a god. Even in the face of the wall of the storm, attacked by the power of destruction, there is no such feeling of life and death in a moment. At this moment, the mortal's survival ** overwhelmed all the discussion of moral and operational standards, he finally shouted "all shut up!" and then opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of God fades from the eyes, and the black scorpion is revealed. Lynch’s spells have come to the front, and Siegel finds himself unable to fully see through this spell. Even with the help of divine power, he can only see the surface of the spell structure, knowing that its most basic role is to target the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell will avoid everything except the fire, and will not be affected by anything other than the fire, such a spell is unheard of, not to mention the eye I saw it. If you don't know what this spell will do for the fire, you can't choose a hard block. So Siegel moved his mind and changed his position in his own kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is still indomitable, turning around and heading towards Siegel again. As it flies, it is faintly visible that it grows its mouth, horns and five claws, and the color begins to shift to gold. The five claws represent five mysterious scrolls, and Siegel doesn't know that he is still trying to remember what monsters are five claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change position again, he came to the attacker. "Mage Lynch, and Capricorn, are you two?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon girl waved her hand and made a "嗨..." sound. Hello. Lynch’s hands swayed quickly, and the spells that were constantly being pursued screamed helplessly and then disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
