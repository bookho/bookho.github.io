Siegel looked at the Knight Mana, right She said: "The pursuit between the two parties is rule and land. It is not a justice move to fight in the name of hatred. Therefore, there is no honor in this, so I will not send troops. You will pass this message to the territory. The knight and the lord, let everyone be vigilant and preventive, do not take the soldiers out of their own area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana said with some worries: "Then the king squats What should I do? As the care of the New World of the Starry Kingdom, the adults also shoulder the burden of maintaining peace within the human race. And the Jackdaw Tribe and Deepwater City are not the subordinates of the Star Kingdom? If you ignore this matter, will it not? Caused by criticism?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Giant Kerry called himself the king of jackdaws and decided to unify the northern part of the Walled Mountain Range. The first target is Deep Water City. The city has not been able to complete the formalities of joining the kingdom of stars, otherwise Who is the lord of Deepwater City?” Siegel said: “There are not even the lords of the deep water city. I just want to send troops and contact with them? So this thing, unless it is the two of the war, ask for help, Otherwise, follow my instructions and do not move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana nodded and said that she understood. She looked up and glanced at Siegel, feeling that his temperament and some changes in the past seemed to be more restrained and rounded. The horsewoman blushed and hurriedly cleared her throat and said: "The Lord, there are still a few problems. The hub has begun to arrange patrols on the Ore Avenue. Although it is far from the Heims, it can lead to the Jackdaw Tribe. The business road has an impact. How should we deal with this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought for a moment and thought that this was the intention of the hub for the purpose, just to To a certain extent, it affects the power of the Jackdaw tribe, supports the defense of Deepwater City, and creates some trouble for Heim. Since he has this plan, it is impossible to write a letter or send a messenger to change the status quo. At most, he can only look good on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The current period is rather special, and some things should not be shipped to the north." Siegel looked at Janis and arranged: "Tell those businessmen. North The ore boulevard is not safe. If you can, it is a good choice to choose the Castle Hill Road in the Walled Mountain Range. You can use this road to attack the orcs and elves, and now you can use it for business."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenice licks his lips. The tone of speech is light and fast. "You may not know that the Marquis adults, these days from the sea, some deep-water city merchants, want to buy goods in the rabbit ear port. They are not higher than others, and always look like a high. I have already sent The words went, Deepwater City did not always resist the entry of our goods. This time simply do not ignore them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think they are really coming "Is it something to buy?" Janet shook her head. "If you want to buy something, you don't have to offend the supplier. They are clearly looking for a reason to stay for a long time to observe the movement of our Heim. If you mobilize the soldiers, they will I can find the suspension from some clues and immediately warn the north."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, they are more likely to be spies than businessmen. Siegel agreed with his wife and then said to Janis: "What are these people coming to buy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sword, armor, and some Firearms," ​​said Janis. "These businessmen are very careful. The musket must be purchased from His Majesty the King. So he is only going to buy some bullets and firearms repair tools."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel understands that these things were all during the war When the product is tight, the price generally rises. Although the things that Heim has received are cheap and good, they should also be raised with the market conditions, and it is impossible to charge at the usual price. This is not a slap in the face of fire, but it has been the case in the war for a long time: there is no ordinary reserve in advance, and it is necessary to spend more money in an emergency. Merchants also use this method to remind the lord that there are many things to buy in peacetime. Just as craftsmen and merchants are producing and selling all year round, they all need to support their families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shenzhen Water City started as a business. Merchants who come to Heim will not understand this practice. "Although these spies will not cause any harm, they can't let them sway all over the place, and they will encourage other territories to send secret agents." Siegel said: "Let's find a hotel. Take them all." Place it there. Tell them to either buy things at twice the market price or leave immediately. Deepwater City blocks the goods that I have received from Heim, this matter before the Sham Shui Po lord explained it, the merchants there Not welcome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
