			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem has been hungry for five days at the top of an unknown iceberg. "lwXs520.coM he dug a snow hole with a killing dagger, sheltering from the snow and the cold. He is not a saint now, so the body needs to eat and drink to keep warm – these three things he can't do. The only thing that can sustain his life is to kill the dagger - a shadow weapon that is condensed with the power of the sacred sacred. He continually kills the process of killing himself - this is a relatively short sentence, presumably meaning that there is no death process, there is no death - barely keeping himself on the verge of sudden death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Siegel saw him, he was very embarrassed. Chanem also didn't have the strength to talk. The eyeballs that almost fell out of the eyelids looked straight at the magic god, and there was no trace of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I didn't want you to be guilty of this crime, but my mind is clear, but the temper is not convinced." Siegel rushed to dispel the cold with divine power Repair the body, then take out the food and light wine and pass it over. "Don't dare to eat too much for you. If you die, you can't tell. You can restore your strength and status first, and when you can accept the priesthood and divine power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chennam spit out the elf biscuit in his mouth, and squeezed a word with a hoarse voice: "Now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. You eat first, and I don't mean to do it right away." Siegel communicated with the kingdom of God, letting all the clones gather and start distributing work. Some clones must think completely about future prophecies, while others must never have related ideas. In this way, the power associated with the prophecy will be concentrated on a small number of clones, and the fire will also be transferred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of clones that are predicted to continue to decrease until the prophecy cannot be completed, at which point the fire that they gather on them has about two forks. Siegel sighed with a sigh of relief, biting his teeth and cutting it out with the method that Chanem gave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like cutting off one of your arms, or pulling a leg down. Obviously, the body will not have any wounds, but always feel that there is a big part missing. Looking at the fire that was thrown out by himself, Siegel forced to re-swallow it*. Even if he didn't swallow, the two forked fires tried to drill into Siegel's arms, just like the children who depended on the mother (?). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, I didn't change my mind, take it quickly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem It’s hard to raise your hand, let alone take something from someone else’s hand. Siegel finally reached out and handed it over, and he was already sweating. "Do you know the disadvantages of being the god of knowledge? Now I have all kinds of knowledge in my mind. How can I kill you without leaving behind? How to use the loophole of the original contract to terminate it, and how to play it. It’s a good word, so you’d better absorb it quickly, then tell me where you are going, I will send you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney looked at the fire in his hand, "This is only two forks, and no more. No, I can form the realm of the Kingdom of God. The conditions of the Dragon Lear are higher than the ones you gave me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want to compare Lear's chances of fulfilling the contract and the results that have already been achieved?" Siegel snorted: "The priesthood has already been given to you, and the fire is also available. There is no agreement on how many fires there are. I think your purpose at that time was to kill me. I don’t care how much I have absorbed. After I have adapted it, I will be at your fingertips. Do you say it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem will not be stupid enough to answer this question. He first inserted the killing scorpion into his stomach - seeing Siegel a glimpse - let the sacred spirit of the sorcerer enter first, then open the mouth to swallow the god of the prophecy, use this force to repair Your own wounds. Regardless of the priesthood, the commonality of the gods is unbreakable and recoverable. Absorbing and adapting to the fire with the wound is basically the quickest way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel raised his hand several times, and the power to destroy the lightning was in his palm. In theory, he has fulfilled his promise, and what happened later is completely new. He can shoot Chanem in one hand and bring back the power of the God of Prophecy. As for the question of the Styx vows, he can hand over the dice to Isaac and avoid it. Even he can give the prophecy to Janet, isn't it better than giving Chanem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method of saving effort is always there, but how can it become stronger without being honed. In the end, Siegel had only one thought left, to overcome the influence of the fire on him, and to surrender the prophecy in any case. Giving the priesthood to Chanem is what he promised as a mortal. If he can't complete the mortal promise after becoming a god, then the will of the fire will win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While trying to fuse the fire, Chanem squinted at Siegel. Of course he saw the destruction of lightning, and the terrible taste of that kind of thing reappeared. He can only gamble now, bet the current magic god can be like the Siegel in the original magic school, in the end can still adhere to his own heart. He knew very well that if he was replaced by him, he would definitely not give up the fire and the priesthood, but he could not do anything to confess himself and unite in the place of the School of Magic. All his hope is that Siegel's heart is still big enough to carry the original greed of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and Siegel simply leaves the snow cave, and his eyes are not bothered. However, as a god, I don’t know what happened within a few meters behind me. To be exact, what happened within 13 miles around him, all the details are in his mind, and closing his eyes will not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a full four hours, Chanem, or the god of prophecy Chanem, swaying out of the snow cave, the first thing is to use divine power Fixed his body. "It feels so good to live again." He patted the residual snow on his face with a rare smile on his face: "Siegel, you are a committed person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the God who keeps the promise." Siegel shook his head. "In any case, I am now a medium power (11 to 15 forks), and you are weak. Even when I was talking, I was constantly pouring out the urge to kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, I will be excluded soon." You can clean it up. I am really curious how you did not be excluded, is it related to the more than 10,000 clones?" When Chanem spoke, he began to feel the crystal wall against him. The oppression, only the power below the saints allowed to enter the crystal wall, so he began to feel uncomfortable. "I probably won't see you again, don't leave me a parting gift?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to other worlds, don't come to me "Siegel has nothing to be tempered." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a magical god, give me an artifact or something. A solid staff with a crystal ball is good, if you make a dagger The style is perfect.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s wrist turned, grabbed from the void, and a dragon claw held the French-style staff Lying in the palm of his hand. "Let's go, I wish you all the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish you all the best." Chanem did not take the staff, and It is a little on the crystal ball. "I must leave some of the ability to predict spells before I can leave, or the crystal wall will still tear me. The prophecy is a part of the world, it can be weak, it can be less, but it can't be impossible. You remember my words, no Maybe not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, he was wrapped in a shadow and disappeared into the sight of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s finally gone, and Siegel’s mood slowly returned to calm. In fact, he still has a loss and a trace of regret, but these should slowly disappear with time. Losing part of the fire, giving up a priesthood, the progress of the clones to integrate the remaining power will be greatly accelerated, it is estimated that it can be completed in three years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem said yes, Siegel’s ability to use divine power within the crystal wall is caused by these clones. It is like the prayers of a large number of high-ranking priests that can make the surviving of the saints come true. Every clone is a perfect saint, and they have the same will, and the heart wants to go to one place. There is no difference between the body and the body in the body structure, so the power can be transmitted. This delivery will not cause a counterattack as long as it ends before the reaction of the crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different abilities require different powers, which are related to the size of the ability to change reality and rules. Siegel doesn't have to change the reality all the time. Most of the things that depend on the power of the saints and the divisions are enough. However, he said that he can use the realm of the gods in the crystal wall, and he can't do it before the integration of the fire. He will not try this easily. The kingdom of God is continuous. At that time, there will be enough time for the crystal wall to react. Even if the two rules can't help anyone, will it still cause the loss of power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of the priesthood is a loss, but it can also make Siegel's life more colorful. The feeling of always knowing what the other person is saying in advance is difficult to adapt. In particular, Siegel's idea that the gods keep their minds from being erased requires constant contact with mortal life and enthusiasm. Predicting the ministry will hurt this enthusiasm. There must be a trade-off between gains and losses. Siegel is both to fulfill the promise and to think about the interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
