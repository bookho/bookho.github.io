			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the treasure house of the Jackdaw Tribe, Kerry took out the best armor and weapons for his four warriors. They chose a round helmet and a steel shield that did not affect their sight. Originally they chose a long gun as a weapon, but they were stopped by Siegel. In addition to the ice and the gun, the general puncture weapon is difficult to leave a scar on the golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry does not need to wear armor, when he is fully engaged in the cold, any metal armor will become brittle and lose toughness. In addition to affecting the activity, it will also destroy the protective effect of the frozen gas. His armor is taken from the dead red dragon, and only this magic-resistant scale scalp can provide adequate protection at low temperatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant asked for a cold ice gun and solemnly tied it to the back. Then he wore a helmet that symbolized the power of the chieftain of the Jackdaw tribe. The horse's mane fell from his back, like a long beak. He walked out of the longhouse, and Mesera immediately took the alcohol and went forward: "To pay tribute to the king of the jackdaw tribe!" She said: "Drink the wine in this cup and wish you all the best!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry took a sip from the cup and kissed his wife’s cheek. This is not part of the ritual, but everyone will not care about the love of the chief and his wife. She then handed the cup to the other warriors of the tribe, letting them drink a glass of wine, and shared the blessings and difficulties. When she stood in front of Siegel, her eyes shone with excitement: "Bring my husband back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the glass, one Drinking it, then replied firmly: "This is the first place, I promise you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are all listening!" Kerry Station To the front of the team, I said to everyone who came to see him off: "I am going to fight, so you will give me a good drill! I will go to the activities and activities, and when I come back, I will check if you are lazy!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people laughed, even in the face of the stormy battlefield, they will respond with a smile, there will be no slightest fight. After the original home was destroyed, everyone thought about revenge, and the Jackdaw tribe who had eaten the dragon meat had no fear of the behemoth. Can not graze in winter. There is nothing else to do except martial arts, so the entire tribe has entered the atmosphere of preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I left, Mesilla could do the Lord's tribe. You must believe her wisdom as you believe in my strength. Do you understand?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people sneered and nodded and promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Cavaliers came to Kerry and reported: "We found Mr. Siegel’s entourage, and he will be able to arrive here soon." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally here." Siegel said: "I thought he couldn't find a place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to pray for all the best, Mesera insisted that everyone share a glass of wine, so that the late Moore is counted. Kerry and Siegel walked side by side down the hill. Others are following. When riding the horse, the giant Kerry looked back and looked at it. Mesera was holding the child at the door of the long house, waving his hand to him, then lifting his arm high and raising a thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant did the same thing, and then took the lead and rode to the west of the Walled Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They roared all the way, singing a free and cheerful song. Snow flutters in the sky, but it does not slow them down. The return of the raven allowed Siegel to regain the scout. So they all went very well along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rest is halfway, Moore will report to Hegel about the situation of Heim. Two patients who lost their intelligence were properly placed, and their identity, Fazak and Janet, had speculations and were seeking safe channels to verify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lady guessed that it was probably the lord of the missing of the hub, Chila Start II. The aristocratic son who disappeared near the hub, and also There is such a person who likes to play the piano." Moore reported that "the identity of another knight is unclear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why didn't he be killed Got it, but become an idiot and hold it up?” Siegel couldn’t think of a reason, maybe he could only wait for them to return to normal to know the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many knights still rely on our monthly salary, the maintenance costs of armor, weapons and mounts are not cheap. And we have not sealed them." Siegel said: "If you lose gold, they have Worried, I can understand. As long as you continue to obey orders and obey the oath of allegiance, these things can be ignored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also brought the castle All the reels, including Master Edith, were taken from the library and handed over to you. He said that you need to go back. But you don't have to worry about it for a while.” Moore said: “He heard that you are still using it. The master of all kinds of weapons, also gives you a cloth belt, so that you are wrapped around the handle of the weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the cloth, It was found that this was not a textile at all, it could only be made from the outer skin of a certain creature. It was cut into a finger-width, nearly two-meter-long tape, and the spells were permanently sealed on both sides with stab ink. Siegel read it carefully and learned that this is a powerful magic that can make the weapon sharper and can damage the invisible creatures such as ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally this type of reinforced spell is made on the scabbard so that it can be constantly warmed up. However, due to the different forms and weapons like hammers and mace, there is no sheath, and this method cannot be used. The mages have been constantly researching and progressing on the basis of their predecessors, and now they are able to make such a wrap. As long as it is a hand-held weapon, it can add the effect of sharp front and combat virtual body for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel carefully tied the hand cloth to the hilt and then chanted the activated spell. They have left the scope of the Holy Land and magic works. I saw a faint light wrapped around the blade, and then the rhythm of the earthquake trembled and eventually disappeared. Siegel uses the spell of detecting magic to know that the dust of the star has been attached to the magic effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master's spell is always improving, and there will always be new technologies and new ideas coming out. Siegel’s rune element guard is an example, and the sharp front hand cloth is also an example. Maybe one day, the whole world can see the convenience brought by magic everywhere. The Master is no longer a lonely researcher in the Master Tower, but the backbone of the era. I don't know what kind of world the world would be like, it should be much better than it is now - as long as it is not the same as the Knox Association, the Master will be in power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three days of riding, they arrived at Longshi Cliff before the snow-covered mountains. It has been guarded by dwarves, and seven people in the tower under the mountain are on duty day and night. It is said that there are more dwarves patrolling in the mountains. With the letters issued by Elinte. Siegel was taken to the foot of Longshi Cliff. In the place where the original Knox co-founders set up the camp, the tents of the four dwarves have stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A red-bearded dwarf is the leader of the eight-person team, named Occam Stone. He is 500 years old and is an experienced warrior. When Siegel shook hands with him. Can feel the grip from his wide hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occam has a strong voice and speaks to the subject: "Mr. Siegel, Irene has entrusted us to assist you. What are we going to do?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel refers to the platform that stands out from the mountainside, calling everyone over and saying: "On that platform. There are two statues. Every one They are close to six meters high and three meters wide. Their attack control range is about three meters, but I don't know their speed and flexibility. Our task is to kill them and break them into parts. Only in a very secure way. In this case, you can try to capture them.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What kind of gothic image?” The dwarf asked, apparently he had some knowledge of the creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not very clear." Siegel replied: "Irenet once said that these golems are very strong and can repair the body with the surrounding soil. When fighting around them, pay attention to your feet, and there may be mud pits at any time. It will affect your pace. Let's call it the rock golem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How are they resistant to magic and elements?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “As far as I know, it’s strong,” Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Mr. Master, this is not good." The dwarf said: "They are on the platform on the mountainside, one side is a cliff, a few hundred square There is no similar place in the distance of the meter, so it is impossible to build a trebuchet or a cannon. Even if the platform is drilled on the mountain wall, the ordinary shooting weapon may not have any effect - and the opponent can recover itself."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have defenders. There are throwing hammers and a rock priest, but we can't fly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said with a smile: I am worried about flying. As long as the magic image does not fly, we have a chance to win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf blinks. Looking back at the platform, I said to Siegel: "You want to remove the whole platform? It is not easy. I see that the rocks in the mountain are very strong, the construction work surface is very small, you can guarantee that when you dig the mountain The Golem won't attack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So drag the Golem." Siegel said: "First take a break, let me test the attack of the Golem. Ways and resistance, then we started to build positions.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Position?” Kerry’s incomprehensible question: “Is the battlefield not on the platform? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want a safe victory. So the position is indispensable." Siegel replied: "What if this height does not break the Golem?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd entered the dwarf camp, and Moller took the horse to the horse's lap, where he would take care of the mount and restore them to their best. There are already dwarves ready for hot food, but everyone is concerned about the fighting that will happen, so they will not eat any more when they fill their stomachs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to attack the Golem, the Dwarf repaired the ladder to the platform, both channels are now available. Each channel can only be used by one person, and everyone can only climb one by one. When Siegel approached the platform, he signaled everyone to stop and took the reel from the backpack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fossil is mud", a spell that only works on natural rocks. Unlike Siegel's earth element rune guards, this spell is of little use to the processed stone of the wall and foundation. However, the earth element cannot be unfolded on a steep step, so you still need to use a magic scroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mud formed by the stone flows down the mountain wall, leaving a three-meter square pit. Here, as a platform for observation and support, it can cover a small half of the platform area by bulging with a bow and arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can it be used as a platform for erecting a catapult?" Siegel asked the dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occam poked his head, looked up and down, then shook his head. "The angle is not good, unless the sling rack is in midair. Can you do this by Siegel Master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One two small The trebuchet is still possible, and it’s impossible to do more.” Siegel said after a visual inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's useless, it can't be hit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this is the case, then use Original plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a deep breath and held his breath. This time he will try a trick that he has never used before. In the face of the Golem, a single summoned monster does not pose any threat. To know the limits of the Golem, you must increase the number of summoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is constantly thinking about summoning spells in his mind. One hand waved the wand to condense the gas element, and the other hand drew the dwarf rune of the earth element to the ground. The surrounding energy is all excited, and the fluctuations of the two elements affect each other. Siegel clenched his teeth and tried to make the light elements of the spirit rise and the turbid earth elements sink. Gather together to the two element cores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a weird feeling that needs to overcome a lot of incompatibility. It's like looking up with one eye and looking down with the other eye. Fortunately, the cohesion of magic has inertia, and Siegel has been very skilled in summoning elements, unlike newcomers who need to keep an eye on it. When he can't be distracted, he quickly switches his attention between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whirlwind-like gas element appeared more quickly, slamming into the golem. Then there is a thick earth element, stretch your arms and try to balance your body and climb up the steps. In pursuit of quantity, Siegel summons the elements of small and medium-sized. This way he will not instantly evacuate the energy of the surrounding elements. The first two elements climbed onto the platform, but the Master did not stop and continued to use the elemental summons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golem felt the enemy of the invasion and stood up in an instant. The dust attached to them was shaken off, revealing their huge body and thick limbs. The gas element approached from the air and escaped the first punch with lightness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
