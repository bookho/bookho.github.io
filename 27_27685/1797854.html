			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon girl brought a few gifts from Siegel to the dragon before leaving, the "food" version of the elemental rune. Inspired by this desire to help Capricorn meet the appetite, combined with the design idea of ​​the magical prop "Endless Spoon" which can infinitely create "rice paste", he specially created the dragon-like elemental rune table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific role is very simple, constantly collecting the energy of the surrounding elements, and then mixing with the free, all things that can be eaten in the air, making the element version at regular intervals A big meal. Adjust the taste through magic, tailored for those lazy dragons who do not leave home. At present, only two flavors have been made: a variety of barbecues and various stews, and the amount of the tube is full, but only the strength of the dragon's stomach can really digest and absorb this food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel hopes that the dragons will like this novelty gadget to increase the possibility of getting help from them. Since the war between the dragon and the mage, the dragons have been on the verge of the main intelligent ethnic society, and almost everything has been involved, but it has always been the "three no principles" that do not express their strength, do not contribute, and do not cause trouble. In the past, Siegel could hardly imagine that a powerful dragon would choose to live in seclusion, but since he learned the dragon curse, he knew how much the threat of this spell was for the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage who invented this spell must have an unforgettable hatred or affection for the dragon, so that the study of the dragon can be so thorough. Every advantage and disadvantage of the Dragons is fully utilized to help the spell function. It took him four months to learn the spell of the dragon, not only to master the spell, but also to learn the hidden high-level spell knowledge behind the dragon curse. Siegel even splits each spell and tries to extract some ideas and contexts from the sorcerer's spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent a lot of time on this, but the effect was not good. If the basic mage spells are similar learning methods, then the more professional the spell becomes, the stronger it will become. The more difficult it is to master it completely. If there is a spell book, Siegel will draw the magic out of the gourd to produce the effect. This is not difficult, because it only uses "casting skills and magic control capabilities". And want to be from nothing. Creating a spell requires a lot of knowledge and accumulation of operational experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each spell is so unique and the knowledge involved is not the same. For the spell of the spell system, Siegel has a stronger summoning element corps spell than the monster summoning technique. He also uses the knowledge of the sacred sage to transfer the spell of the spelling system. But in other factions, he has almost no clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a slow process and it is not easy to repeat the path of the predecessors. Just like the door spell of the opposite world. It can be said that the curse is the pinnacle of high spells. Once this spell is cast, it creates a stable, cross-dimensional connection to the specified plane, a circular, illuminated channel ring that travels two-way between the two planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on the Master’s personal ability to cast spells, this alien portal allows any volume that does not exceed the ring to pass. Although the door of the outer boundary cannot open the regular barrier of the crystal wall, it can only reach other planes starting from the main material plane. However, when returning, as long as you can use the prophecy spell to locate the target wall, you can use the door of the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trans-planet spell is full of danger, especially to open up those hostile worlds. The devil in the abyss can be no matter who is opposite the door, they will only want to vent their violent killing tendency. For these enemies. Masters who can open the door to the outside world have a way to deal with it, but some dangerous worlds, such as the fire element plane full of devastating energy. Or the chaotic sea where all the rules do not work, this place is the most terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of the blood and fire of countless sages has gradually improved the spell of the door of the outside world, and Siegel wants to derive it from the beginning? Although it is not impossible, how much time does it take, how much risk it takes, and how much does it cost? A master can spend his life and can contribute a new high spell that is enough to go down in history. Siegel has a higher ambition and understanding, and does not dare to say that he can invent all the higher spells again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Capricorn took his hopes to the Ring Dragon Mountains. If you are not worried that you and the Dragon Girl will leave Heim, the territory will be in danger; at the same time, you will be worried that you will lose the support of the great prophet, Lear. Siegel really wants to go to the end of the New World West in person. Go to the site of the dragons to see and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same reason, he couldn’t find the owner of the ten-faced scorpion in the east of the Old World. The Old World is also the site of the Masters Association and the City of Learning. The ten-faced scorpion must be under the close supervision of Lear, and Siegel could not dare to cast the net. So after the meeting of the Dwarf King. He went directly to the city of Mire, so that he was always in the scope of the secret nuclear core to prevent possible dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have no reason to fail, and the entire operation is completely confidential, just to take an unexpected surprise. Just after the Dwarf Kings meeting, the representatives of the Masters Association just started to return, it is estimated that they will take some time to understand the role of the magic spacecraft - it was already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Siegel sent away the Capricorn, the Federation’s magical spacecraft returned to Heim’s collar and docked in the open space north of the city of Mire. They made a look back from the dwarf meeting, but they actually raided the two magic towers of the Masters Association. Using the "unstable polymer model" that Siegel gave them, they induced the tide of the elements of the association's secret energy core in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the image crystals brought back by Wiewood, Siegel can also see the grand occasion at the time. To be on the safe side, the federation parked the magical spacecraft a hundred and fifty miles away, and the raids used the teleportation to trigger the association's nuclear nucleus and then left immediately. In just a few minutes, the Masters Association was able to produce an explosion, and massive elements spewed out, sweeping all the space within a hundred miles. Siegel could feel the "grandness" of the time through the video recording. All the casters were ignited by the elemental energy and turned from people to torches. The wizards who tried to escape by teleport were burnt into pieces in the mezzanine of the space, and they could not even keep the body. Even the mage trying to hide in the ground will be ignited, and the energy of the earth element can penetrate the earth far more than the spells of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way to count how much the caster has died. Everything happens too quickly. There are a few who can keep the body. All magical arrays, magic items. And the magic creations are finished, the elements of the tide have fundamentally changed the basis of their existence, so there is no one to be spared." It seems that Wywood is still sad about the loss of these things: "The loss of the support of the spell, the two Master Tower They have collapsed and have had a great impact on our excavation work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or let me know what to gain," Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two cores are shipped back. You specify a place we are unloading. When you fix it, give us one more. From the association in two In the case of the materials hoarded by Tari, they are at least ready to make five nuclear nucleus, all of which have been pulled back by us, and there is nothing left. Although this is not comparable to the hoarding of the Confederation in the Three Peaks Tower, it is enough. "Our current expenses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it just enough?" Siegel looked at the smile in Verowood's eyes and couldn't help but ask: "You still have What did you find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the texts in the two Master Towers, even if there is a graffiti-colored grass, we have all come back. The Master of the Federation They are trying to classify them and store them in a library that Isidus sells. But everyone has a general look at it, there is no high-level mantra. The two mage towers are used by the association to build equipment and experiment, so There are not many books, but it is because it is a test. So we found a drawing. It is very fresh and looks like some kind of large magic device applied to the wall channel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel immediately reached out Asked, Verwood was already ready. There are 36 sets of drawings, which are like a drill with a lid. From the results of the general browsing, this is a powerful magical device that opens the wall channel and can be blocked at critical moments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can refer to and extract some of the good ideas inside, and use them in the crystal wall passage of the federation." Siegel thought, added. : "First carry out the magic project of the federation, and then let the manufacturer learn this. I have two concerns. One is that the drawings of the Masters Association are limited to our own ideas, and on the other hand, the things of others are not thoroughly understood. It's best not to use it before. The Masters Association didn't expect our Secrets to blast out the tides of the elements, and it's hard to be sure if this thing in the hand will create an unexpected danger."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it will be collected first, pure research, learning is more secure." Weywood said: "Siegel ** division, this time a lot of harvest, plus stars The order of the kingdom, the federation is finally on the right track, which is inseparable from your strength and the opportunities you bring. We have reached a consensus on the return journey. At this stage, on the basis of continued development, priority is given to you. Arranged tasks. Like magic spaceships, serial transmission arrays The things of the class have played an important role in promoting the syntactic research of the federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, this is good news." Siegel laughs. Said: "I also plan to build a magical spaceship that Heim is leading. It is in need of the Federation to provide standardized parts and appliances. With the two ships under Avon, the recent pressure on the Federation is very high, and it is necessary to allocate resources from the whole. With the experience of the first ship, I think the latter two half-- my own one I assembled myself should be better improved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
