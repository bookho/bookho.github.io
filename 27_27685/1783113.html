			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coal in the iron brazier burned, the tent was very warm, but the siegel of the fever still couldn’t stop shaking. WwW.XsHuoTXt.com He lay on a thick cushion, covered with fur on the quilt, wrapped him like a cocoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master's skin is very hot and almost instantly becomes a fire element. The heat around it is like a false illusion, completely unable to pass on the body, and the feeling of exhaustion that continues to make Siegel feel dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started to have a fever after coma, and then fainted and became more powerful after three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Siegel’s memory, he has never been so sick. The shaman of the Bovine Tribe came over to see that Siegel had drenched the cold water, which led to the illness. However, when I was a seafarer, I went to the water all day, and I never had a fever like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaman is ready to treat him with bloodletting and is rejected by Siegel. "Give me some herbs, then let me warm up, I am fine." But after he took the medicine, he was comatose again because of a fever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a general condition, Siegel only needs to become a state of undead for a period of time to suppress the symptoms, and then sent back to the city of Mire, so that Reid priests to expel disease The magic of the gods is fine. However, this fever can actually affect the strength of the elements in his body, making him extremely weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he woke up again, the brazier was extinguished, the sky was dark, but the body finally had warmth. His skin was stuck in the bedding by sweat, and the tide was uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air around it is warm, with a smell of incense. The senses that have been lost for a long time are starting to live, and then a weird smell is introduced into the nose. Siegel thought about it, it was the taste of himself. The sweat drained the toxins from the body, and the thick quilt wrapped itself tightly. What kind of taste is expected? He turned his head dizzy, no one in the tent. Men are dedicated to their warriors and guards, but they are careless in caring for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very difficult to climb out of the tomb made up of cups, leaving a layer of gray-black mucus on the surface. Fortunately, this group of people ignited the incense, driving all kinds of biting bugs. Otherwise he was eaten under the quilt, I am afraid no one knows. Siegel himself found the water to drink. I ate two elf biscuits and then changed the water element made of pure water to wash my body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until he was dressed neatly out of the big account, other people found that he was awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it was during the war, I had to let you get on the gallows." Siegel reprimanded Moore without mercy. "Does the camp patrols include any things that should be forgotten? Shouldn’t every camp be checked regularly? I woke up for more than an hour. If you add the fire pit to the process, you don’t know how long it will take.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore hangs his head and says nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to swear all your guilty?" Siegel said: "I know that many soldiers and knights in the outpost are just commissions in the past. Soldiers are free, and you are free to use it. But you should know that only discipline can guarantee the victory of the war. You have a good relationship with them, but when it comes to camp safety, etc. You should not just indulge. Only gentle and unauthorized No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud noise coming from outside, and it seemed to be hit. Then I heard a female voice shouting: "Mor, where are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore looked up at Siegel and looked very nervous. This familiar voice is Nata's, and she can hear her emotions. If she rushes in and sees that she is being reprimanded, she might wave her fist at Siegel, and that can't be cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is Nata?" Siegel patted Moore's arm: "Go, remember this time, and reorganize the army." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice is still gone, and the account door is opened. Nata rushed in. This is a tall woman with a deep, high nose and a silvery white pair that looks very mysterious. She tied the long red hair behind her head and swayed with her actions, like a flame. Nata saw Siegel, and I didn’t know where the anger came from, and it hit the mage of the Master with a punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are rolling together. Moore hurriedly said to Nata: "You are crazy! That is my lord, Count Siegel. How dare you just throw your fist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard him bullying you!" Nata grinned and said: "And I see him is not pleasing to the eye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up and let me go He apologized." Moore squinted, his angry expression was not faked: "I heard that you have to do something, and the countess ran around to help. If it wasn't him and his magical equipment, how can I finally swear?" To you? Moreover, Siegel is also my teacher. My martial arts and knowledge are taught by him. You must respect him very much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nata glared at Moore and saw that her husband’s expression didn’t soften at all. He had to squat and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel came out and saw the newlyweds who were still on the ground, laughing and saying: "Okay, get up. Later, there is time to do this." "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morra apologized to Nata, Siegel said he didn't mind. But Nata was curious about how Siegel beat her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the power of magic, I can teach you if you want to learn." Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol shook his head. He also learned magic for a while while following Siegel, but the difficulty of getting started stopped him. The magical words, the basic principles and the elements of the physique are all layers of obstacles to him. Moore knows that Nata doesn't like reading, so it's hard to imagine her learning magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nata, under Moore’s suggestion, said, “No, I’ll find another way to knock you down!” She blinked and used her. Asked as politely as possible: "You have nothing to look for Moore?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel just nodded and saw Nata glaring at Moore Arm, drag him away quickly. With the body armor, Moore has more than two hundred kilograms, but there seems to be no weight in the hands of Nata. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and couldn’t imagine what life would be like in the future, only to bless them, and to bless Mordo. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that the Lord’s adult finally recovered his health, and Evan helped Fitzak to visit him. One-eyed and old-fashioned look of concern, will check Siegel from start to finish, this is reassuring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Lord. What happened to you suddenly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retire recently, rest It’s all right.” Siegel comforted him and said, “I’m strong, I’m sick, and I’m fine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan On the edge of the tent. Squinting at Siegel: "I don't think so. After you fainted, I thought it was the assassin of the murder god who poisoned or cursed you, and went to your room to see. Hey, I found out. Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These manuscripts that study metal plates are all in the room and are not cleaned up at all. Most of the above have been deciphered. The reader's story can be concatenated with careful attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are really at ease, a blood spurted out." Evan grabbed before Siegel and said: "What is your name? It is hard to see To the tragedy in the history books, you have to take a bite of blood? It’s as simple as killing the wizard, and it’s all right to show him tragedies and tragedies.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Evan, Not what you think, I am not so naive." Siegel held Fitzak and sat down, then signaled Evan to come over. "I just want to talk to you about something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people in the center of the dense fog camp, surrounded by a bonfire. The fire was ignited with sheep manure, plus some poor coal, the fire was not strong but it was very resistant to burning. The hand of Siegel's hand spelled three large potatoes out of thin air. Put it on the fire and barbecue. The potatoes are rotating and each side is evenly heated. He can already be distracted under the same spell. If you talk to two other people, it is four thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wall of the storm surrounds our world and is an insurmountable and accessible obstacle. So far, no one has returned alive from the other side. No?” Siegel added: “Those who claim that their spirits have reached the other side are temporarily not accepted.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
