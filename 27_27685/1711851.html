			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Interfering with my destiny, how do you say this?" Siegel leaned forward and asked the pipe in his hand to go down and asked in a curious tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember the earthquake on the volcano, and the sorrow of the sorrow in the town of bacon." The bachelor's eyelids are drooping, a look of weakness, But what he said made Siegel shocked. "Since you chose to go north in the pre-war conference, I have been paying attention to you, applying magic through my falcon magic. I thought this time will be as successful as before, so that you can complete Macabu more smoothly. He’s ruining the task, but he didn’t expect the counter-attack to be so serious.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fingers of his right hand twitched and he saw a cushion covered with a blanket floating over . The bachelor opened the blanket and Siegel saw a bird shaped like a donkey. Its feathers are burned like flames, and then the skin is full of signs of acid corrosion. One eye of the bird has been smashed, and the other pupil is covered with a layer of egg white film, almost blind. In addition to being seriously injured, the bird has almost no vitality to support it. There is already one foot in the grave, just like its owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there no way to treat it?" Siegel's first concern is the health of others. "You are a ** teacher, or a bachelor's degree, there is always a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I say no, it is deceiving you." Gently cover your magic pet with a blanket and let it continue to sleep endlessly. Then he took a small box made of platinum from the bag in his chest and used different spells on its six faces in turn - no one could identify it. When the box is opened, you will see a small crystal bottle that is as thick as an adult's thumb, with a black potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel asks what this is, is it an antidote. After the bachelor nodded, he shook his head again: "This is a potion that turns a mage into a lich. After drinking it, I will not be dragged by this body again, maybe I will live for a hundred or more years before my mind is lost. Although others call me a bachelor's degree, I really haven't experienced the experience of becoming a dead soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young mage looks at his predecessors in awe, staring The little drops of medicine in his hand. Acquiring eternal life is a feat that every life wants to accomplish, and the stronger the individual expectation, the stronger it is. Even God is hard to say forever, so the mortal is more about studying the method of deceiving death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of research, who in the world can go further than this in this respect? The conversion of the Lich is a pioneering work of the Master. When a caster's spell ability, magical knowledge, and magical manufacturing techniques reach a certain height. You can try to make a witch potion for yourself. Then pick the best day of your own state, drink the medicine, you will gradually lose flesh and blood within ten days, leaving only a skeleton full of magical runes. Different from Siegel's transformation into a scorpion. The skeleton of the lich is extremely strong, and the ordinary sword does not cause any damage to it. The new body contains the energy of magic and the power of the dead, and the combination of the two will also form new changes. For example, it is a touch of numbness and a breath of fear. Of course, the most important thing is that the residue of the old body will form something like a crystal stone. There is only one. The Lich will properly preserve the crystallized stone and make the container protection, which is called the life-threatening, and then hide it in a place that only you know. If the lich's body is destroyed - although it's hard, it's still possible - the lich will condense a new body next to his life and regenerate again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of this method is well known, but the specific recipes and details are treated as secrets and hidden in the secret locations of the various mage organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give, hold." The old man threw the bottle to Siegel, and the young mage quickly caught it. I was so busy that I almost fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you nervous?" asked the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One point." Siegel smiled and admitted: "After all, this thing is very precious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Unfortunately it can't solve my current predicament." Bo Xueshi sighed and said: "If I drink this bottle of syrup, I can live in the lich state for a while, but when I am the original time Once it arrives, it will still dissipate in this world. I am not running out of life, but spending my fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand." Siegel Frankly speaking. "Is this related to the shadows of the dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your intuition is right." Bo Xueshi said: "I used to deal with them, they helped I improved the effect of prophetic spells and allowed me to see a more accurate future. I know that if the shipyard of Macabu is not completely destroyed, Deepwater City will inevitably face the fate of being broken. Although there are lions In the cross-continental transmission array, the Masters Federation will still stand still, but the price paid is too great. So, I cheated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time will eventually flow and death will come. The old man went on to say: "I have seen a possible future. The scene is clear, stable and strong. It is a good future. In that future. You go to Macabu, causing the shipyard to be completely destroyed. So Deepwater City avoids After the disaster, the battle of the entire northern orc quickly ended, the Masters Union is more powerful. Many details of this future are ambiguous, but all the keys are on you. You must go to Macabu."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I will be left to attend that meeting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, young mage, That is an important choice.” Ba Xueshi said: “If you didn’t take the initiative to go to the north, then even if I order you to participate in the expeditionary army of Count Maxim, even if you finally follow him into Macabu, the future will be different. It will lead to a more miserable ending. So when you made up your mind, I really enjoyed a sigh of relief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that I should be able to Make a difference, read a book at the Sanfeng Tower all day Lower my acumen." Siegel said: "I didn't really think too much at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man nodded and asked Siegel to give him After a cup of red wine, after running through his throat, he continued: "I am too anxious afterwards, using all kinds of means to make you go to Macabu faster. When you are in danger, you can't help using magic." I was warned again and again, but because it was not from the custodian of knowledge (another name for the god of knowledge), I ignored it and eventually got the bad results. The last time I applied the spell was in the town of bacon, asking for the shadow of the dead. Help. They responded to my request, but then launched an attack on me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Why?" Siegel called out in surprise. Sounds come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if there is a singularity in the shadows, some of them think that I have done too much, so I form a whirlpool in the river of fate, will me Suck in. No magic can be used there, I am free to break out with willpower, but death is inevitable, my fate trip ends early." He pointed to the sorcerer's elixir in the hands of Siegel and said: " It’s just that this thing is useless, so I want to give it to you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What happens after I drink this thing?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt, you will die." Bo Xueshi said: "And you don't expect to stand up in the form of a lich, this thing is for me, only Can be used for me. If you look at someone who is not pleasing to the eye, give it to him and keep it safer than any poison."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this is the case, then Just rest assured.” Siegel put the small bottle up and said, “I think of it as the most powerful poison in the world.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Faranese said: "You are a promising mage, this does not require me to predict the future, just look back at the past. You succeeded in Macabu哒Complete the task, what do you want?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought about it, one thing is very urgent, and maybe only the ** division can know . He asked: "I want to know Sir Bill, Janet and Evan their whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The prince without your allegiance?" The beard was shaking with joy. Siegel consciously swears that Prince Aaron is his own book, and there is still the word "royal" before the name of the baron. Faranese saw Siegel's symptoms and didn't know why he became very happy. For a time, it seems that the breath of death has also dissipated a lot, and his face has regained its brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After my falcon found your whereabouts, I have already reported it to the royal family of the starry kingdom. This morning temple lost face, actually let the prince Seriously injured, relying on the members of the Masters Association to be saved. The relationship between your blessing, the kingdom of stars and the Sham Shui Dominion has been eased, whether it is a warship or aid can be sent continuously. As for your friends, they are indeed in the black The blood castle stayed for a while, almost the same as the prisoners, but now they are all right. The great sacrifice of the morning temple is three, with a whole team of paladins. The starry royal family also sent mountain cavalry, with a scale of 50 people. Riding the six-legged lizard. They took over the black-blooded castle, and the Schlint family was detained and waiting to be sent. Even the Kingdom of Saus did not dare to ask for a redemption at this time, how to fight the orcs. After the winners and losers, your friends are still in the Black Blood Castle. Since the war is not over, the Guardian Guards will not dare to act rashly. After all, the walls are well defended. Poor those homes. Did not know how to transfer a spell, they do not open it, it will not take the initiative to help the Federation, is not it "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
