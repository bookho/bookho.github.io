			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ranger in the team said that the meat of the lion is not delicious, but it can barely be hungry when hungry, if the adults want to try it, they are willing cooking. However, Siegel also claimed that he allowed the Rangers to dispose of the lion's internal organs and use the spell to protect the rest of the body from the threat of **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can be used as a gift to the bull rhinoceros," Siegel originally intended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, many of the people who started the outpost grew up on the grasslands, knowing the etiquette here. They say that lion skin is a precious thing, but only those who kill the lion can use it. If given to others, it is considered a threat of force. It is more appropriate to invite the other party to send a craftsman to help them process the lion skin, and then pay the tail as a reward to symbolize friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, just do it according to this." Evan is purely for fun, and does not care about the results of the lion skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They go through the hills of the ups and downs, like a boat passing by waves. But they soon found a small river, walking along the river bank is smooth, and often see other tribes. They used grass-lined low-lying huts, except that they could lie down and sleep, and nothing else could be done. No wonder that no settlements can be seen from the starting point of the outpost, they used this natural cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people looked at Siegel’s nine-claw squid flag with horror, not knowing what kind of monster it was. They have not seen the sea, but they can feel the danger from the touch of the wind. At Moore's suggestion, Siegel agreed to replace the flag and remove the nine-claw squid, and used the flag of the Viscount of the starting point, Mol. Moir: an inlaid iron shield with a one-eyed eye, followed by a crossed mace and long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw this banner, the residents changed into smiles and they came together and started to exchange things. Exchange rock salt, cotton and ale with fresh milk, straw, and crepe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are tasks in the body, the transaction time is short, but enough to get the information ahead. The blind date of the Niu Rhino tribe will attract a lot of participants. "From sunrise to sunset, queue up," they said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them are the Lux of the barbarian on the mountain, and the rider of the lowland barbarian. There are gray dwarves who climbed up from the ground. Trying to snatch the flowers on the grassland, there are also tigers and bears who came by camels from the burning desert, thinking that the grasslands are also their territory. But the most dangerous thing is the eagle who sleeps in the sky. They have wings and their eyes are sharp like a torch. But the woman on the grassland will not fly. She will fall to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at Moore and asked, "Have you seen these people? Are they also guests of Caohai?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohr shook his head: "I just heard some stories, but I always thought these were legends." He started sweating on his head, and everyone saw it clearly: "I didn't expect this. Actually it’s all true...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Would you like to turn around and go back? Then I will find you a beautiful and virgin virgin from the daughters of the Southern Lords. Be a wife?" Siegel snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Moore looked up. "The Cavaliers will never fall without a fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;They speeded up, leaving the low thatched tents and the cool rivers behind them, and rushed to the Bovine Tribe as soon as possible. Fortunately, the weather is beautiful, the wind is beautiful all the way, the bright sunshine and the blue sky have been covering the top of the head. Follow the guide and they found the deep blue tear lake. And at the lake, I saw the camp of the Niu Rhino tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a thriving tribe. They have tents made of canvas instead of straw mats. They have bricks instead of gravel stoves. They also have A fruit tree. There are two hundred tents, which means thousands of people. These tents are built along the shore of the lake to facilitate water intake. A little further away is left to the animals, they are surrounded by straw to prevent encounters with beasts or lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Hornbucks are willing to entertain guests, not all guests are honoured and courteous. Therefore, outsiders are arranged in a place opposite the tribe across the lake, away from the camps and captive cattle and sheep. According to the number. Every five people provide a piece of cheese, and every ten people divides a roast sheep, but the same tribe who asks for love can only divide two pieces of cheese and one sheep a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore naturally knows this custom, but he did not mention it. In his heart. Siegel’s safety is more important than everything else, and naturally higher than the ridicule that his flag might incur. When a group of people came to the stationed area according to the guidelines, the laughter and the provocative voice were heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they talking about?" Evan leaned over to Siegel and asked, "I don't like their eyes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time is to help Moore to marry the bride, so you don't want to grab his limelight." Siegel slammed Evan with his elbow and confessed: "Who said that you are a king, but this is not the land of the kingdom of stars. If you mess up, I will definitely not agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how to be serious "Are you?" Evan rolled his eyes and replied with no anger: "Mor is a good boy, too nervous in front of you. I will help him, but you have to promise me one thing." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan cocked his little finger and gestured around with a provocative gesture, attracting countless snorings he couldn't understand. Then the king smirked to Siegel and said, "Call me when there is a fight. It should be faster to see this scene."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are Barbarians, but not fools.” Siegel said to Evan: “Even if it is a fool, there will be an instinct for danger. At least we understand that we are the one with many people. When I follow the wizard master, Understand that those who take the initiative to provoke you have no purpose, you should not have a general knowledge of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, you are a mage, naturally think much, According to my temper, I cleaned up one by one, and the provincial look was uncomfortable in my eyes.” Evan patted the dust of the star and said to Siegel: “You can fix my bonfire soon, I am excited now. This will happen before every battle comes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mohr was riding over, and he slammed Evan hard and scolded: " You are just a swordsman, how can you mess around? These people are not reasonable, do not understand etiquette, if it is a threat What do the Lord's adults do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan smiled at Siegel and sneaked a thumbs at him, then said to Moore: "Mr. Viscount, I I was so angry that I couldn’t hold back. What should I do now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let’s make a low-key, enter the camp and arrange the guards.”<br /><br />&nbsp Evan shook his head and said to Moore: "You are a loyal good boy, but you still don't understand the real aristocracy. Go ask your family, then you know what went wrong." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caught the horse's belly and went to the front of the team, leaving Moore unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the war, you can hide your strength in a low-key way and achieve better results, but when others don’t understand you and need to show strength, Your low-key will only cause unnecessary trouble.” Siegel patiently explained to Moore: “The reason why the Cavaliers want to be angry and angry, the nobles have to raise the banner, they are actually telling others that I am not irritating. If you clearly have the power to solve the trouble, but put on a low-key appearance, and then expect trouble to stay away from you, is it not self-deception? It has never been to pinch the butterfly, not to pinch the hedgehog. Take out the confidence of the Viscountess, There is a starting point outpost behind you. There is a whole Heim to support you. You are coming to marry your wife. It should be the focus of attention. Don’t be like a thief!”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol nodded, thinking about holding his head a few times, but they all collapsed. "Lord Lord, I can't shake the prestige in front of you, I always feel wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, go to the camp and say." Siegel can understand His feelings. After all, it’s about to start welcoming, and looking around is all “enemies”. The tribe residents on the road said yes, there are indeed some strange people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw bears, tigers, and lions, tall, full of hair, and still retains the habit of animals. These are actually beasts, that is, patients affected by veterinary diseases. The disease can be found in races such as humans, elves, and dwarves. It is very difficult to cure and may be passed on to the next generation as it proceeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women's disease will affect the patient's psychology and living habits to a certain extent, but it will not completely change his mind and intelligence. Because I have never heard of a large-scale outbreak of veterinary disease in the New World, the beastized people who came to the Niu Rhino tribe are likely to be the patients who have migrated to avoid the eyes of ordinary people in the past, and the descendants of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
