Lear’s teacher ended his meditation, opened his eyes and asked Awaiting the apprentice. Time is unknowingly close to dusk, and this body is getting old for a day, getting closer and closer to re-replacement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Master. Although it was two days later than expected, it was only because of transportation problems that the goods themselves were safe and sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it checked, is it a stable version of the secret nuclear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that they are running Very good, no different from the convoy spacecraft." The young mage answered cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two secret nucleus of the Mage Association’s explosion brought huge losses, and everyone knew that there was a difference between the stable version and the timed version. In order to develop the planetary colony of the Goblin World, the Star Kingdom, the Elven Kingdom, and the Dwarf Kingdom ordered a large number of Secret Energy cores from Siegel and emphasized that it must be a stable version. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that the words of His Majesty’s words have played a role, or are exciting prices. After a period of wrangling with each other, Heim’s collar finally promised to provide a stable core of nuclear energy. The Federation and the Masters Association mobilized the manpower to make the outer shell and the basic structure, and after the shipment to the Heim collar, the core was installed by Siegel. It is said that the Marquis’s Marquis’s teacher spent a lot of time studying magic every day, rarely showing up, but the stable energy core that was shipped showed that he had been in Heim’s collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, only he really has the core secret of being able to nuclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of prophetic spells still can't find Sigel's traces, and he can't see his future actions, which makes Lehr very uncomfortable. He has always been very curious about how Siegel did it. It was him, and there was no way to completely cover the prophecy detection. He blamed this on the mysterious power of the blind, and it is increasingly difficult to suppress the greed and curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the penetration of the city of Myrtle, telling me that I am close to the core of the castle?" His eyebrows rose, his fingers flicked, and he was majestic. Asked in tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Returning the master, the spy we hired is already in the castle, able to master the life of most people. But the Siegel sergeant is by him. The lady Janet and a few servant portraits are inseparable from the living."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Janet is ill or has other things, she will soon be vacant." Lehr said: "More brains, learn to be active for the goal. Those agents must be able to do things, not as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you explain the wiki? After all, it is his manpower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interpretation? When he is stupid to explain to us, It’s not too late to think about this!” Lear quickly swung a few hands and signaled everyone to leave. "When you solve this problem, come back to me. I want the result, as soon as possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His students immediately got up and quit after the ceremony. Even if this thing is not done well, how can we expect them to help in the confrontation with Siegel? It has been a long time since no outsiders saw Siegel appear, and only plausible news came from his family. I don't know what genius was hiding and secretly doing something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit that his development potential is too great, and the growth of strength is also worrying. If he used to be able to counterbalance himself with the help of the power of the Peruvian nuclear power, now there is more of a weapon of legendary spells, which is more and more difficult to contain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple a caster is a good deal, after all, double fists are hard to beat. But Siegel has a very high reputation in the world, and his series of creations have brought about great changes to the world, and they are basically positive. It would not work to fight him from his fame, and few Masters would be hostile to him. Lear needs help, maybe this helper needs to find it from other worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just thinking about countermeasures, suddenly there is a bad premonition that hits my heart. It is a feeling of forgetting what I have forgotten. He was sitting in a difficult position, he could only walk back and forth, and his fingers kept counting to calculate where this feeling came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last lamp god was repaired and the signal from the School of Magic finally passed. Lear was shocked. According to his previous predictions, the School of Magic would not open in a few hundred years! The barrier that closes the entrance is only fascinating. Is there any other god involved in this matter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the call is answered, he knows that his biggest nightmare has come true. Someone has entered the School of Magic, and his fire is in jeopardy. Even if the secret of the dice was stripped of the power of God, Lear still regarded magic, knowledge, and prophetic priesthood as his possessions, and one day he would withdraw it. He knows that Shenhuo has the autonomy to find a new owner. The pressure is uncontrollable. Directional guidance is the only solution. Therefore, he placed the fire on the mainland of the mine wall and used the intervention of shielding other crystal walls before the storm. The next layer of protection is set to delay the possibility of being found, but obviously these methods have not received the expected results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naan Lina’s intermittent voice came from the squad, sounding like a rush of screams. Lear knew that the female elf's body was not perfect, but she would not have a meaningless voice anyway. In combination with the characteristics of Shenhuo, it took only a few seconds for him to figure out what was going on. It turned out that the School of Magic changed the time flow rate, which led to the disappearance of the barrier that had been there for hundreds of years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of the female elf was also formed for the same reason. Lear understood that she was shouting something. "Siegel, the sacred murderer is here!" This sentence is repeated, indicating that things have reached a very urgent moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel! Lear understood all of a sudden. It turned out that he did not hide to study the spell, but to hide and study the power of God! There is a setting in the School of Magic. As long as someone can permanently go to the third floor, they will not attract new people, so there will always be vacancies. Lear began to recite the spell and asked the college to send him in immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the college was opened, but when he stepped in, he found it wrong. An invisible barrier blocks his body. What is the student's fullness? Not to mention that he made all kinds of misleading, it will let the mages fight each other and kill, and he said that he left Na'Anna in it, also to clear the empty space. The School of Magic is unlikely to have a harmonious unity. He knows the character of the Master too much, and mutual doubts will ruin them sooner or later! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most incredible things happen one after another, and Lear has not wanted to delve into the reasons. The inability to enter the Magic Academy can lead to a significant decline in his strength, so it seems that there are only two moves. The strength of the Tongtian Tower is enough to keep the door of the School of Magic open, and Lear bites his teeth and throws his will and soul first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel!" Lear screamed, destroying the statue of the mage who suppressed the spell's ability, and then sent himself in. Although there is only one illusion, with the familiarity of the essence of the Magic Academy, he can still exert the power of the sergeant level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear had to send all the cards, and walked in with the sorcerer's wrath, and saw the square that was blown up by the spell. A gnome hides behind four Mithril Golems and constantly superimposes protective spells on himself. His spell level is quite normal, and it is a standard in textbooks. It is enough to deal with general spells, but the world at the legendary level is not enough to guarantee safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female elf is entangled in another four Mithril Golems, and it is difficult to draw a hand to attack. The gnome does not kill her, just want to maintain a balance of power. "Too naive, this time I thought I could be merciful. After I had no legs, I really couldn’t get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille took a deep breath and will The legendary spells are kneaded together to create a killing spell ball at the top of the illusion of the enchanter's staff. As long as the gnome is dead, he can send the body in and play 100% strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death!" Lear slammed the staff, and the energy of the killing quickly flew to the gnome. The gnome, who had been focusing on confronting the female elves, did not find the existence of Lear, but when the spell ball flew to him, the early warning finally responded. The best way to deal with a spell with a flying trajectory is to use a spell bounce shield. So he shifted the shield and thought he could let the attackers taste the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand stretched over, and the devastating lightning jumped back and forth at the five fingertips to form a pattern of pentagonal stars in the middle of the pentagon. The ball of the killing hit the figure, the two annihilated each other, and the gnome escaped. Siegel twisted his neck and took a sigh of relief. "There is good news when you come, you can finally send it here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lil looked at Siegel, the two finally met again, they knew This will be a battle for you and me. "No wonder I can't find you, you are hiding in my house." Lear glanced at the gnome and calculated the possibility of a forced kill. Without Siegel, he would unite with the female elf and it would take a long time to resolve the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
