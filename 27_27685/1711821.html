			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Siegel’s spells are not as powerful as they are. The spurting scene is caused by the combination of blood magic and illusion. The mage also added some cursing effects to it, which can make the sorcer feel tired and even collapse. In addition, the continuous pain caused by the real wound on the right hand is combined to achieve the deception effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this method can not be reused, otherwise it will inevitably lead to enemy suspicion, it is likely to lead to a chain reaction, making it easier to see the effect of the previous spell. So Siegel took the cursed instrument and re-used the flames. Since he seized the opportunity, he naturally took the opportunity to attack. This was originally a reckless move. After all, the mage who did not protect himself was too fragile. Now that Siegel has no wand, there are only two kinds of implements, and there are too few spells that can be used to perform. He can only win if he chooses a constant attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More, the enemy has only one layer of protective spells. The Masters of the Knox Association did not solidify too much defensive power when they were placed in the Magical Array to avoid being discovered by the Mask Mask. Therefore, the two Masters were in a hurry and a preparation was insufficient, so this strange battle was formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel slowly retreats and has a word in his mouth. For a moment, there are flaming flames around, and the dazzling light makes it difficult to open your eyes. The sorcerer sneered, and the pale face showed a disdainful smile. He raised his wand with his left hand, pushed the energy of the fire element shield to the limit, and then pushed it out. A semi-transparent shield visible to the naked eye swells and annihilates the layers of blazing fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel predicts that the enemy will do this. The fire waves he releases do not rely on temperature killing, but for other purposes. The dazzling light that broke out at the beginning was to cover up his next action, and the flames annihilated by the element shields all turned into black smoke, once again obscuring the sorcerer's line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a full five seconds, and the wizard lost the whereabouts of the wizard. He realized this and the instinct felt dangerous. A twisting light spell is being recited, and he has to try to hide the trail. ‘The distance is enough. He thought, ‘there was a ruin behind the mage, and he would go there to find a bunker. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell of the transposition has not been finished yet, and Siegel has already rushed out of the smoke. He pretended to retreat, use the flame and then block it with smoke to cover up the intent of the forward. And letting the sorcerer not release the correct spell when he approaches is also within his calculations. Siegel held his long sword at his waist and strode through the land covered with flames. The ray of psionic light flashed in his eyes, and it was this ability that allowed him to locate the sorcerer's wand through the smoke, ensuring that the route of the charge would not go wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protective shield shines, and Siegel feels a stagnation, but with brute force he regains control and restores speed. Too much protection against fire elements makes this shield less protective against other forms of attack, and Siegel itself is stronger, not much different from the swordsman, not to mention that his wizard's pace can increase speed in an instant. Siegel rushed to the front of the sorcerer with only two breaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, are you a mage or a warrior!" The sorcerer screamed out loud and tried to dodge to one side. He also ordered the shield to contract immediately, preferably to stay close to the skin for maximum protection. Siegel's hands were forwarded, and the sword stabbed into the waist of the man without stagnation, and passed through the back. Unfortunately, he could not cut his spine directly, but the pierced intestines will also kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I surrender!" the sorcerer shouted, while throwing away his wand. "Give me a life, I surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel blinked and loosened the sword, leaving the weapon in the enemy's stomach . He showed a smile, although it was only through the face of the zombie, this smile was only horrible, but he still laughed: "How do you surrender?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am willing to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the sorcerer have not been finished yet, and a dragon tooth dagger has been inserted into his mouth. Siegel twisted his wrist and determined that the dagger had smashed the sorcerer's tongue and throat. A lot of blood spurted out of the man's mouth and flowed down the handle of the dagger. The sorcerer's eyes widened and he wanted to use his last strength to read the spell, so that he could activate his magical equipment. But he couldn't talk at all, blood and broken meat filled his mouth and throat. His last move was to smash three feet, and then with a full face of unwillingness and fear of death, softly backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't have time to rest, and the black smoke that was constantly rising in the bacon town attracted too much attention and must be left before the orc patrol came. But he will not forget to search for spoils. With the wand, Siegel finally had a wand again, although some were not very easy, but enough to cast various spells. Of course, he will not forget to bring the magic material package and all the paper things around the sorcerer. Now it is not a matter of distinguishing between those that are magic books or anything else. The sorcerer's ring seems to be a magical item. Just as he was begging for mercy, Siegel saw the ring making a slight reflection. Some sly wizards will set the activation spell of the magic item to "I surrender", "Please let me go", and maybe this ring is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things in the Witch House were also roughly cleaned up. Siegel got a purse with the bones used by the orcs. He finally got rid of it. The dilemma of paying only with silver ingots and gems. He changed back to the human form, put on warm clothes, and placed various bottles and jars in the key space. In the house of the Witch Festival, he also found a good sling, but there was no suitable ammunition. He really wants to have a bow, so it is much safer to hunt or defend yourself. When thinking of this, the Raven Baron yelled angrily, reminding the owner of the spit ability he had. Siegel stroked its feathers, sent it to the sky, and hovered around to detect the movements around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the form of the undead, in the case of a last resort, Siegel can become a cockroach to avoid hunger, thirst, sleepiness, he can even not breathe, The price paid is that you may lose the vitality of the creature and become a walking dead with no feelings. But in any case, Barron needs to eat, and its appetite is very good, comparable to a three-year-old boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also wants to go to the general of Kaka’s team, but I’m afraid it’s too late. Who knows if there will be a wolf cavalry patrol on the wasteland? Moreover, the town is covered by heavy snow. If there is no new snow falling within a few days, he will also consider covering the footprints. Using the pace of the elves can keep your feet from falling into the snow, but it also limits the upper limit of the load. Siegel puts heavy things in space as much as possible, but this will not increase his carry-on items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, clothes, chains, and weapons add up, and Siegel thinks that if you can have something to do, you can do it. At this time he recalled the yak that General Kaka used to pull the slave team. Those animals would probably survive if they were picked up. Siegel immediately let the raven go to scout, and as a result he did not see the still-lived yaks, these poor animals have long been seen as pieces by the crazy orcs. But he found an unexpected living: Lin Ke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This southern man, the village head of the stone village, did not receive the treatment he wanted when he sold the information. Because the orc patrol did not find what he claimed as a human espionage mage, General Kaka ordered that the swearing guy be locked in a cage and used to peel the skin during the celebration. Since then, Linke has been in great fear. One slave after another in the cage was pulled out and tied to the shelf for torture. The scream of death and death almost collapsed him. When only one of them was left in the cage, the spells of the syndicate were launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirit is on the verge of collapse, and the idea of ​​a madman is hard to interfere, so the grievances don't pay much attention. The iron cage protected him from the end of being hacked by the crazy orcs. When the morning sun rises and everything calms down, Linke has no strength to struggle. He has no eyes, just staring at the sky. The spirits who used to help him looked at him with compassionate eyes, did not say a word, and did not respond to his prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood in front of him, holding a bloody sword in his hand. He looked at Lin Ke, who was huddled together, and saw that his face was full of wounds, all of which he had grabbed with his fingers, and there were pieces of rolled nails in the wound. Siegel sighed and cast a spell that stabilized his emotions. Curse spells in Blood Magic can both be mad and timid, and these are the different manifestations of spells. Siegel only needs to use the appropriate method to use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linco bowed his head and looked at Siegel calmly. Under the influence of the spell, he wanted to be afraid and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you sold my message to the orc?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linco closed his eyes and recalled the situation when he found the situation in the alleys of the town and reported the situation to the orc leader. That person is not me, just a moment of fascination, go astray. The retribution always arrived inadvertently and on time, and the mother of the earth said yes. Just like a person who cuts down will lose water and soil, people who are indiscriminate will lose food, and those who sell customers will end up. It is estimated that it is a sword to wear the heart, at least a clean and dead way to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
