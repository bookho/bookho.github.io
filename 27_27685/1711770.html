			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two horses were pulled over and their tails were tied with thick ropes. The two jockeys began to tie the ropes to the two wrists of Jarrell. Siegel immediately understood what was a torture and quickly asked: "How long will it be towed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From dawn to dark, or horses The inability to run the position." The chief said: "If he fails to persevere, it proves that he is not worth saving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is too cruel, chieftain! Said Siegel. Jenny Trat took him and said a few words in his ear. Siegel frowned and said to the kitten, "I believe in you," and then let it go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emirates, this troubadour came to the northern grasslands, did not intend to offend the customs of the tribes, but accidentally made mistakes. Although he has grown into adulthood However, in the face of the Spirit of Nature, he is only a mischievous child, and should be educated rather than sentenced. And Jarrell was struck by lightning during the battle with the Greenfoot Snake. The whole body was wounded and his physical strength was weak. If he died of torture, I would say that this is not a punishment imposed by the ancestors of the majesty, but a merit of a beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and Qing The snakes have fought? Are you?" The people standing next to the chiefs laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the three of us, there is Kerry-chenko, I guess that might be your other son."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of discussion until Kerry rushed out of the tent. There are several people behind him who hold him, but they are all in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, don't be excited, I don't think they are the murderers of your brother." The chief of Kraft pressed his son's chest and comforted him: " Don't worry, our jackdaws have a hatred, but they won't anger their innocent people. This is different from a stinky bear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now only using the torture will only make him die, and the woman is right, I don't want a monster to affect the tribe's reputation." Kerry said in a low voice: "especially before the harvest festival."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other tribal leaders will come to the conference, so this time can only show fairness and majesty - this is what Kerry wants to say. The chieftain’s face changed and others exchanged their eyes. After the death of the chief's eldest son, Kerry became the first choice for the next chief. He has always been acclaimed for his strong body and bold personality. If he also has insight into the wisdom of the people, his status will be unbreakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is some truth to you, so I give him an extra option." The chief said: "Yarell, either immediately accept the torture or pass the fate Give the spirit of battle. Competition, the winner will determine the outcome of the loser!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flag is blown by the wind, everyone watching the cruise poet. But he still fell to the ground, his eyes wide open, his body shaking. He can neither listen nor speak, just the result of waiting for the horse to be towed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chieftain frowned and then stretched out again. A coward who is afraid of death, being dragged to death by a horse is nothing, as long as his son can establish a prestige. Then he thought of the dead oldest son, his voice and smile, the appearance of hunting, and the elegance of visiting other tribes. Nothing is more desperate than the father watching his son die, so his face is full of pity and sadness. He now only wants to solve this matter as soon as possible, and then to a corner that no one can see, to vent his painful feelings alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the chief raised his hand and said, "Well, since he can't make a choice, he still maintains..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Siegel took a step forward and stood in front of the chieftain in the eyes of everyone. "Although I didn't let him steal the property of the dead, even though I have never known the existence of this thing, I don't want to watch him being dragged alive. Because I am the employer of Jarrell, I can speak for him: I chose the trial, and I came to play for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet knew his heart when Siegel started talking, so she rushed I reached out and wanted to hold Siegel's mouth. However, the squid hugged the kitten and took her in her arms, or finished the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is talking to each other, and the scene is a bit confusing at one time. “Can it be like this?” someone asked. "Who is playing with him?" Some people are planning. Several people cast a contemptuous look toward the poet, believing that he was a coward, both afraid of death and fear of fighting. Some people shook their heads and felt that Siegel was too reckless. Only a few people looked at young people with appreciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd applauded and shouted. They are familiar with Kerry's strength and know that he is martial. There is no doubt about who the final winner is. Siegel frowned, but he did not expect this result, after all, this decision is also between the rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet in the arms of Siegel, looked up and asked him: "Are you worth doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and replied: "Intellect tells me that it is not worth it, but I think it should be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You can't lose." Janet bit her lower lip and nodded hard: "Even if you fight against that big man, you can't lose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nod Then watched Kerry stand in front of him. "Giant" is a lot higher than Siegel, and it is a circle wide, occupying absolute strength and body advantage. Moreover, Siegel was only exposed to regular martial arts training for less than a year. Kerry trained in the tribe from an early age and was a hunter and warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry looked at Siegel and shouted to the people around him: "I am Kerry-chenko, the son of the Kravchenko. The giant of the jackdaw tribe, please listen to me. Today my opponent is Siegel, who recently killed the green-footed snake in the storm with me. For this reason, his thigh is also a snake. The bite was poisoned. After that, we divided the flesh and blood of the green-footed snake together. Therefore, under the witness of the fighting spirit, we are fighting brothers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Everyone is quiet, there is only one voice here, that is the giant: "I am going to fight for the dignity of another brother, so I can't even have the slightest taint. I can't leave behind because of the opponent's side." Wound and cheap!" everyone shouted, then continue to listen to him. "The only way to solve this problem is to ask the therapist to come over and cure the wound. I believe that the Spirit of Nature will approve of my practice. I also believe that the spirit of the ancestors will answer my request. The battle will be seven days later. It was done just before the harvest festival, under the witness of everyone, under the watchful eye of the battle. But before that, this person is my brother, I want to treat him!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay! Well said!" The camp was boiling, and countless pairs of arms were lifted up, shouting the slogan "Giant! Giants must win!" The chiefs swept over the elders on both sides with their eyes. Everyone nodded and agreed, so this matter was settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do in seven days? Janet can't think of it, maybe she can find a chance to slip away? But the idea flashed in her mind. Siegel will not run away with her, no matter what happens he will face the battle. The kitten wondered if he would give Kerry some harmless poison and let him diarrhea or something. However, seeing that Siegel was eating with Kerry, the two men did not worry about becoming an opponent. The kitten thought about it, measured the risk of accidental injury and Kerry’s exaggerated physical quality, and put down the poisoned mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cryra had a good meal with Siegel and two people ate one sheep together. Then the therapist arrived and used the best plaster to ensure that Siegel's wound was good for two days. Then the giant laughed and picked up a big parcel, and had to pull the squid out of the camp. There is a piece of sand here, the grass is not born, and it is pressed very flat. And there is just a small bag left in the camp, no one will see the things here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My brother often took me here to train, took a spear to teach me, and said that I always use my fists." Kerry sighed, oh He grabbed a handful of sand and watched it pass between his fingers. "The spear is a weapon belonging to the chieftain, just like the ice gun that my father is holding. So I never use a spear, but my brother always doesn't understand. Every time I can't beat him, of course he won't. I am hurting. Now my brother is dead, so I have to pick up the spear. Siegel, you will practice with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished the long story It was only after I thought that Siegel’s Northern dialect was only the primary level, and Janet was not nearby, and there was no translation at all. He couldn't help but laugh, patted his stupid head and opened the parcel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a variety of weapons inside the package. Kerry picked up the spear and then sat on the floor and wrapped the spear with a cloth. Siegel looked at it and there was no scimitar that he used to do, so he picked the hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people slowly learn from each other and fight against each other. The Cree is a tall man, and his hands and spears can be flexibly controlled with only one hand in his hands. Although his tricks to use spears are not yet sophisticated, the size advantage is still difficult to overcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
