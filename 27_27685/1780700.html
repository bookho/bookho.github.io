			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At breakfast, a letter was sent to Siegel’s table. The edges of the envelope were slightly damp, but the seal was intact. The pattern above is a robin with a balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The letter was sent by a businessman who claimed to come from Ximu Town." The servant reported to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who's the badge is such a robin?" Siegel had some doubts. If you don’t have Janet’s day, you can only check the things like the aristocratic coat of arms emblem. But the thick "Cold Family Records" can be regarded as the most boring books in the world, and Siegel can't stand it every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has officially become the Earl of Heim, and his coat of arms and his life are enough to record in the book "The Family of the Mainland", the official viscount of his men, The baron will also be recorded. But now only Mana, Zucker, Moore, Kenki and Grenner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stuffed the peeled egg into his mouth and opened the letter. Just looking at his eyes, he stood up violently, squirting eggs in his mouth and asking, "What about the person who sent the letter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside," said the servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hallway outside the hall, Jeff Gold is sitting on the bench, yawning bored. The strong body he had trained from the blacksmith shop had already been blessed, and the muscles had long disappeared under the fat. It was not easy for Siegel to recognize him from the face surrounded by three layers of chin and wavy hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Siegel Lord, Mr. Bard Squid." Jeff Gold Coin quickly got up and shuddered and said hello. "Jeff is always at your service."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now I am the count, but don't care, it's nothing in front of old friends." Siegel I have to use both hands to straighten him up. "It must be very hard for you to cross the ocean like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Fortunately, I took the initiative to pay the two people's ticket money, and divided it into a big one. Point the cabin, so it is not hard." He is close to Siegel. He lowered his voice and said: "But the other passenger is not very good. Seasickness has not fully recovered yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you put him?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A hotel called Swan Lake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know there. Wait for me to change Casually, just go together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Rabbit Port" and "Walk Road" put into use. The transportation of goods has driven the development of commerce. After the war, the thirst for all kinds of materials allowed the development of the territory that still retains production capacity, and the leader was Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First. There is a well-preserved agricultural system throughout the New World, whether it is food, vegetables, melons or livestock, and the Heim collar can sell it on a self-sufficient basis. The iron mines in the Wall Mountain Range and the mines in several reclaimed castles have started to work again, and various industrial products have a large market in the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The novelty from the northern jackdaw tribe and the starting outpost became another big selling point, enough for those businessmen who traveled to and from the two continents to smile. The original city of Miele is not enough to accommodate the expanding city size, but also to allow the Lord's adults to have a quiet space to study spells, the residential area and the commercial area all move northeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of houses began to be built, and everyone is optimistic about the future potential of the city. It is said that it is enough to sell the gold coins of the construction land for only ten years of spending – of course, only the remaining part of the Siegel magic research expenditure is excluded. The Swan Lake Inn is run by the youngest son of Viscount Grenada and is considered one of the better hotels in the business district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Siegel heard about this hotel was because it sent three roast swan to the castle when it opened. "This is a big dish on the aristocratic feast of the Starry Kingdom. I hope that the Lord of the Lord can like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dish left a good impression on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wearing a guard's blouse and a businessman's cloak, and the defensive staff was collected, but still with a rainbow light ball ring. I dyed my hair with magic, changed the color of the pupil, and brought a brilliant smile. Siegel is like a businessman apprentice, and can no longer find the temperament of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is getting married in the fall, I guess it is impossible to catch up with the wedding." With the bumps, Jeff's flutter trembled, but his voice was still steady. "The Countess Ferrara Tomonte is a beautiful woman. It is said that there were half of the kingdoms chasing her fifteen years ago. The former Count of Tomonte had just married her and died on the battlefield of the annihilation of gangsters. There are rumors Said that the countess may still be a virgin, but I don't believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Her life is... chaos?" Siegel frowned. Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, not what you think." Jeff said: "Sir Bill. How to say it, he has a unique charm. Very popular with noble women. Welcome. The Countess Ferrara Tomonte has seen the pursuers of half of the kingdom, but worshipped under the charm of Sir Bill. He will marry him in life and death. I think, in addition to the swordsmanship, the insights and temperament on the battlefield, he The effort in bed must be amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is possible, Siegel thinks that Sir Bill has always been conquered in the town. "It is a fact that Jeff knows that the guess is probably the truth." He listened carefully to the story of Sir Bill along the way, knowing that he had annihilated thieves and bandits in the starry kingdom, cleaned up the nest of the two-legged dragon, and destroyed the eater who was entrenched in the mountains. He rushed west and made a name for himself. He will soon have his own territory because of marriage and realize his ideals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is very memorizing you on the other side of the sea, but I also believe that you can do it well. But because the sea is blocked, the business is busy, he can't see it. You." Jeff stopped the carriage and said to Siegel, "Adult, it’s here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swan Lake Inn has ten rooms, Jeff and him The guests with the pair occupied one. Siegel hadn’t knocked at the door, and he heard a woman’s giggling laughter. He glanced at Jeff and asked with his eyes: "Isn't that seasickness not recovered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff. Gold coin made an unwitting gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is unlocked and will be opened as soon as it is pushed. Siegel walked in and almost stumbled over the skirt on the ground. Evan Kim, now Evan. Stars* is on the upper body and is lying on the carpet doing sit-ups. A petite woman sat naked on his navel, holding her chest and pointing her finger at Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not bad. At least you are still wearing pants." Siegel rolled his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good times always end very quickly." Evan combed his golden hair with his fingers, then stretched his elbows on the ground, holding a woman Then stood up. He said to Jeff: "Don't forget to give some tips. Jenna is a good girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," the woman slid over her fingers The chin of the text. He licked on him and began to lick the clothes on the floor. During the period, he did not forget to throw a wink at Siegel, and then ran away with a gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Recovering from seasickness?" Siegel nodded to Jeff, who left the fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan lifted a bottle of wine from the plate, smelled it, and threw it back. "If it wasn't pretending to be seasick, the fat man could kill me along the way. Your Royal Highness Prince. The Prince's Highness, I am sick of me. You have no water here? Alcohol can also be."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not the same as your brother." Siegel opened the space bag, took some herbs from it, and soaked the tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aaron is a poor fellow, who is poorly dying, and who wants to be a king. He doesn't understand that the burden will crush him?" Evan's mouth will pour the tea, and let's lick it, it's still unfinished. "I feel that I will fight again, he will be mad at me first, so I will withdraw."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out. Shu lived and said: "I want to go, you are the best place. Stay away from those troublesome things. Safe, you can get the best hospitality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not long ago, Count Todd came to the New World, we have seen one side. He suspects that you came to Heim to look for me, and let me report his whereabouts to him at any time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you tell him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you jump in front of him, I will modify his memory and let He forgot about it.” Siegel waved his hand and drove away the sweet aroma in the room. Then he said, “You can rest assured that I am here. How long does it take to live? But you are better. Makeup. I am not sure if there will be a detective of Count Todd in the territory. Of course, if you are not bored, you can live in the castle. It is safer and more secretive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
