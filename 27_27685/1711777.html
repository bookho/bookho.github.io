			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel licked his head and wanted to turn over without success, so Janet intimately helped him change his position. ‘Let’s go to the king, I just have to look at Siegel. The kitten lowered her head and looked proudly at the wound on the squid. ‘That’s a heroic job to find me and to avenge me. She is very satisfied with Siegel’s performance and believes that this is a truly responsible man. She can safely hide behind Siegel, avoid danger, rest assured, no need to be afraid of the sharp edge of the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I’m Janet now, no longer the spy kitten. Janet only wants to let time stay at this moment. Even after seeing the majesty and pride, richness and luxury of the imperial court, there were always endless tasks at the time: camouflage, tracking, spying and poisoning. Everyone lives behind a mask, and many people have more than one layer. She has never seen a true friend or loved one, and there is only the naked interest and use. In addition to trying to maintain the level of skill required to complete the task and keeping herself a "useful" person, Janet couldn't find anything that would give her peace of mind - she was insecure at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knox Association’s mage is a madman, but it’s a sensible and organized madman who can wisely analyze his weaknesses. They can't hide out of sight like a kitten, and use the fake identity for a long time to lurk and spy on intelligence. Spells always leave traces and are easily restrained by spells, but the technique doesn't - this is also the way the kitten survives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning that the city’s consultant, Master Lear, made a prophecy for His Royal Highness, she sold the news for a good price. After that, she was sent to the New World to continue to serve the organization. The reward for the on-line was very good, so she stole the secret will of the Stadt family. There, she disguised as a little boy and defrauded Siegel’s trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was just a fledgling adventurer at the time, and it was easy to be cheated. This is one of Janet’s favorite things. But she decided not to let him know that it would suffice to be a small slave who was saved by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the true identity of the lords of Sham Shui Po? Let that mission go to hell! I am very good now - Janet works hard to courage and comfort herself - I only want to live a normal life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened outside?" Siegel opened his eyes, just looking directly at Janet's gentle eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry became the new chief, he was speaking with a cold ice gun and arranged for disaster relief." The kitten held the hand of Siegel On the shoulder, put him on his lap and lie down: "You don't want to move, the wizard said that you are too tired now, you can only rest and rest." She said a good lie, and the flaws on her expression were not revealed. . "There have been a few people who have just come over and call you the Dragon Warrior, the Terminator of the Death Knight. If you are not resting, they have already quarreled you. Let Kerry go to deal with his tribe. Now is the time for the leader, the warrior should be rested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet, I found you different." Siegel stared at Janet. Face, suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet’s heart panic, but it’s a good cover for the past, ‘Is it just too much? Is it too relaxing to forget the role of playing a slave? Am I too anxious, and haven’t waited for the performance of reading and studying, and said something philosophical? 'She thought this way, but her face showed a smile and said, "How is it different? Lying on the leg, so are you ready to say something sweet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel blinked, swallowed a spit, and swallowed the words that had been to the mouth. It happened that his stomach made a squeaky voice at this time, covering his embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Janet, you are a fool. ‘The kitten concealed himself in his heart. ‘Why don’t you let him say it? '<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet, sorry to make you in danger." Siegel moved and said, "When the tent is lit, I am scared." However, I did not have the ability to extinguish the flame of the Red Dragon. Later, I fought the Death Knight and relied on the power of the Ice Gun to beat him. But if I didn't add the magic in advance, I didn't even have the qualification to play with him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have destroyed him and escaped his life from his spells." Janet said: "I heard them say, you are the only one who has withstood." Death spells, so you can stick to victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
