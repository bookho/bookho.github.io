			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf’s patrol appeared on the Ore Avenue at the same time that afternoon, and the lineup was the same as yesterday. In order to avoid getting their attention, Siegel and Mana looked far away with the help of stealth. The two were hiding behind a huge rock and there was no communication throughout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient tree of war walked slowly, carrying three Rangers on their bodies, guarding different directions. A black bear followed the tree, and Siegel pointed out that it was the elf's druid. On the high sky, the two falcons patrolled round and round, and from time to time they made a clear scream. It is too difficult to sneak in this battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no place to hide in a dozen miles. The birds in the sky must be able to find us in advance." They watched the elf walk over and observed it again on its return trip. Mana said: "Even if you ride a horse, you can't achieve the effect of a surprise attack. The Elf archer can shoot three or four arrows before we get close. So after a few rounds, only two or three horses can get close to the enemy. This is completely "It didn't work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After she thought about it, she asked Siegel: "Lord Lord, can't you cast magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have my considerations, this time I have to do the same without the participation of the Master, in order to better involve the Knox Association, so no matter how Magic.” Siegel is not uncomfortable, saying: “If you can’t, look for other opportunities.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana thought for a moment, then shook her head . "If the elves always configure the patrols like this, they will always take advantage of the investigation, and they will all be the same everywhere. But I have a way, maybe it can bring the distance between everyone and the elves, but it is more risky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Talk about it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana’s approach is to play a show for the elf. The ten knights were divided into two groups of two and eight, and eight were besieged by Mana and two other knights. The elves can find the scene of the battle far away, and they are likely to be careful to get close to the battlefield and even try to save the "poor woman" Mana. At this time, everyone will attack the elves again, and maybe they will achieve good results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel firmly opposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program has too many vulnerabilities. If the elves are parked in the distance, just wait and see what to do, let everyone fight all the time? Obviously there are many loopholes. Even if the elf tries to rescue Mana, if he is far away, he will shoot arrows at the siege. Do you watch your companion die under the longbow? The elves are also martial arts masters, and the Siegel knights are not professional actors, and their "play" is too likely to be dismantled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a way." Mana is not in a hurry, said to Siegel: "Unless you can lead the elves out of the Ore Avenue. Let them go to the Walls Advance, only in the mountains, we have enough cover. The only uncertainty is whether the elves will go up the mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This method is very good at other times. Ok, but it can't be used now.” Siegel explained: “So far, the elves have ignored the chain of human castles on the walls of the city. But that doesn’t mean they didn’t notice this. If we used the dwarf’s wall mountains as Relying on, whether it is provocative or indeed launching an attack, it is possible for the elf to make up his mind, rather to risk offending the dwarf, and to clean the castle on the mountain. This way, the business road we just got is meaningless."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana is immersed in contemplation, and if there is a better way, it would be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding terrain is very unfavorable, the elf is well trained and takes advantage of the weapon's range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a way to make the elves' ability to detect the discount." Siegel said: "You ambush. I try to shoot with a longbow." Eagle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana shook her head and said to Siegel: "The Lord Lord, I know that your swordsmanship is good, can you shoot without so much magic? The Falcon can hardly hit, and the uncertainty of this approach is still too big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only a storm?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only do this." Mana said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me think again." Siegel still does not give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary is still the case, and the knight is not vague. The spirit of the Cavaliers includes courage and sacrifice, and now is the time to realize your promise. Although Siegel was still frowning, Kemana had begun to call her men. Carry out the training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, they had a good meal, fed themselves and the mounts, and then began to polish their weapons. In the process of charging, in addition to the shield, only the long sword in the hand can open the arrow. The arrow of the elf is fast and smashing. It is a technical job to block. Everyone just asks not to be hit, not to be shot, so that they can get close and then launch an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They slept early, so they can wait for the battle of tomorrow. Siegel didn't sleep all night, and he was always thinking of a way. In this battle, he set too many rules and restrictions for himself, just like self-binding, so it is particularly awkward. He really envied those unfettered people, and he could let go of his reckless consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They started moving in the early morning and headed east to the direction of the elf. The sooner you solve this problem, the later the elf camp will find out, the farther they can run. Near noon, the sky suddenly became gloomy, and it seemed that a blizzard was brewing. The majestic wall-walled mountains stand below the black-pressed clouds, appearing dark and ominous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind is pouring straight into the neck, and the knights who remove the armor can wear a layer of thick clothes, which will not feel too uncomfortable. They looked up at the dome, the black clouds moved very fast, and the wind continued to increase, just like the raging tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good thing!" Mana said: "This big wind will affect the flight of the Falcon!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and prayed silently. Even if he knows that there will be no gods to respond, he will still think of all means to bless his knights. In a short while, a large piece of snow fluttered in the sky, and it was almost swayed under the scroll of the wind, and it was shot on everyone's face. The horse screamed with uneasiness, swaying his head back and forth, shaking with his hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight was blocked, the weather was so bad, I don’t know if the elf would appear. Siegel’s flash of light flashed, regardless of the snow on the ground. The ore boulevard is a hard road made of gravel and slag, and the footsteps in the distance can be passed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the elf is also a big guy with a war tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow has been down, but under the sway of the wind, it did not quickly accumulate on the ground. Siegel was kneeling on the ground. The ear is close to the ground, only looking forward to the elf can appear as if. His heart pounded and he thought it was the voice of the ancient tree of war, and he almost shouted out excitedly. Fortunately, the cold made him wake up very quickly. There is no wrong estimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is about romance and freedom, the elves are obeying military orders and remain patrolling in such bad weather. The heavy footsteps finally came over - this is definitely not a heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be prepared, we will win!" Siegel said to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden weather provides the knights with the coveted concealment that everyone sees as the blessing of the god of war and the smile of victory. The moment when it started to snow. The knights acted immediately, wrapping the horseshoes with cloth and binding the horse's mouth. The opportunity to have a sneak attack is exciting and morale is getting higher. They have long crouched on horseback and prepared for the assault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, the elves of the war ancient tree is the first goal, even when necessary as the only goal." Siegel refers to the cross bow and bullet Hey, "testing weapons is the purpose of this battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people nodded and then swallowed the poison of the delayed episode. When Mana waved her hand, the knights began to walk slowly along the ore boulevard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their speed is slowly increasing. Their figure is gradually disappearing. The wind and snow rolled and covered all traces. Siegel would like to know what happened, but without magic, I can't really see how far in this environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the wind brought intensive hooves, then the cries of the knight and the roar of the ancient trees of war. Siegel also heard a heavy knocking sound. It should be something hit by the war tree. I hope that I will only sway the ground, not my own knight. Then came the cicada of the horse and the roar of some kind of beast. It was so unclear that it was so far apart. The heavy knocking came again four times and then never appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
