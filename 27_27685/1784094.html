			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man roared, desperately rushing to Evan. All but Siegel’s influence on the judgment and ability of the battle is more or less influenced by the “History of the War”. This time is a test of whether everyone can concentrate on the battle and be alert to the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can see that Evan has also been affected. When the 徽 徽 emblem is cast, it does not distinguish between the enemy and me. This problem cannot be solved for the time being, but it does not mean that the creator of the spell has no preparation. Under the command of Siegel, a golden ball of light swayed onto Evan's shoulder and heard only a soft sound like a blister burst. Evan's world was finally quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank God!" Evan used the bonfire to block the other's sword and slash forward with the black man's short sword. This is a sham, and the assassin reveals the flaws of his knees while trying to avoid it. Evan was bypassed by the stream like a stream, and the sword was swept down, cutting off the assassin's legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element of gas blew a whirlwind on the other side of the force field wall, and no one could stand in the two tornadoes. This side of the wall becomes two-on-three, and if you add an assassin who has lost the calf, it is three and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out the dust of the stars and responded to the enemy with a scepter and a long sword. Evan rushed to the top of the assassin's head and rushed to the other two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not fall into the wind even with a pair of two, the water-like sword technique played a magical effect, the two enemy weapons often collide together. The scene quickly became a one-on-one melee. The assassin glanced at each other and immediately dispersed to both sides, trying to open some distance and take the way of front and rear pinch. Their coping style is correct, but in the cooperation, they have been affected by the emblem of the war, and there has been a flaw. Evan threw the dagger to one of them and then immediately approached the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is almost face to face with the enemy. The breastplate and breastplate are all together. At this distance, the long sword can't play any role at all, even worse than the power of the teeth. However, Evan learned some skills from the dancer Danser and used it on this occasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wrist turned. The elbows and the shoulders cooperate to form a weird spiral. Maximize the steering ability of the arm. The long sword that originally pointed to the ground turned into a posture of anti-hand-held grip and sword-tip up under a series of dazzling fingers. Assassin bites his teeth, can't take it, and chooses to use his forehead to slam into Evan. Evan, a springboard bridge, first fell backwards, and then the body was like a winch that had entered, and when it suddenly bounced, it gave off a rapid force. The long sword turned into a flash and pierced the throat of the black man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s opponent’s feet throw the heavy weight of the launch, and now use a huge sword with both hands. He put the giant sword in front of his eyes. Slightly bowed to Siegel. It seems that he is a very disciplined opponent, so the impact of the emblem will be small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't talk a little?" Siegel put the defensive staff in front of the body, and the long sword was slightly swayed, ready to slash from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man did not say a word, his feet were opened before and after, and the giant sword was flat at the forehead, pointing straight ahead, like a horn. He moved halfway through the half-step, staring at Siegel's figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel draws an arc. Leaving sideways behind the defensive staff, and pulling the sword farther away from the body, the blade is completely hidden. The black man has never seen this posture. But it seems to be a tactic to counterattack. So he is more careful to approach Siegel and keep his body in balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vortex of the gas element, the black man with the double sword shouted loudly, but the wind and the force wall covered his shouting. "He is a mage, you idiot! Don't grind it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that he is correct, but even if such words are passed over, It will also be mixed with the "freak" of the emblem of the war, which makes people unable to distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tornado is not very lethal. But the blocking effect is really good. Seeing that the situation fell into the wind, the black man’s leader, Yong’s greatest voice, shouted: “Shadow to the opposite!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen the black man using the shadow movement. Attacks can be launched without warning. In his tactics, dividing the battlefield with a force field wall is an important step. Naturally, it is necessary to prevent the enemy's class transmission ability. If they still have the ability to use a mage spell like any door, then Siegel can only put them over. But now the situation is that the shadow jumper of the black man has been known by the Master, and the Master will have no restraint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prepared mage is the most difficult enemy to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel puts the defensive staff on the ground, and the elemental energy converges on top of the staff, bursting with bright light. At the same time, five equally bright balls of light flew out of the staff, and they continued to spin and dance in midair. The light pervades every inch of space, and there is no big enough, dark enough shadow for the assassins to jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was even a rush of an assassin’s shadow that was forcibly interrupted, and only half of the body barely squeezed out of the shadows. Which half doesn't matter, anyway, he is not a troll, and he can't survive on half his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light on the staff itself is not glaring, as long as you narrow your eyes, people will adapt quickly. But Siegel shook his staff, and the light that was shining reflected on the sword of the Great Sword, reflected in the eyes of the black man, and flashed quickly. He closed his eyes, and the warnings in his heart rose, and the sound of dissuasion was "slow block, fast back!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword of the Great Sword draws a circle in front of him, but only the air is caught, and there is no intentional attack. The black man opened his eyes and thought that his opponent was still in a state of rest, waiting for a fair sword fight. I didn't expect the Master to drop him, and he had already rushed to Evan's enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tough opponent who uses a thorn chain, and with the help of a weapon he has a lot of control. A thorn chain is a thick chain that is connected in series with a series of steel rings. Each steel ring has a specially made sharp iron thorn. This is a weapon that is difficult to master. It is said that the user must memorize the direction and characteristics of each spur. It is familiar with the different center of gravity and usage of the chain when holding each ring. It is a terrible suicide for novices. arms. But in the hands of skilled people, it can be attacked and defended, can be close, can be thorny, can be tangled, and has great deterrent power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan was entangled for a while, but not very good. Therefore, the user of the chain can not be distracted. At the same time as the light shines, Siegel uses the pace of the elves to suddenly accelerate. Close to the enemy using the thorn chain from behind. Evan took the opportunity to play a sword flower and attracted the attention of the other party. The dust of the stars pierced from behind the black man. I exposed the tip of the sword from the chest and then disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth body fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man who used the giant sword found himself being played, striding forward. His heart is full of anger and self-confidence, and uncultivated swordsmen like Siegel are not worthy of being called knights! The giant sword of both hands was ignited under his anger, and the red flame illumined his black armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give it to you," Siegel pointed his finger at the Assassin. "I need to prepare the next spell."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan laughed and passed by Siegel. Welcome to the black man. The bonfire and the giant sword collided together, and the demon smashed the flame sword. The light and heat were all gone, leaving only a group of gray smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame is easy to solve, but the power of the giant sword is not so easy to resolve. Black people rarely use fast slashing, but use the techniques of cutting, turning, and scribbling as much as Evan. I don't know if he has always been such a style or is he currently selling it? If it is the latter, then Evan's troubles can be big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are dead!" The black man used the giant sword as two sickles, limiting Evan's left and right movements and forcing him to retreat. "You are an evil accomplice, executioner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan snorted and looked serious. He used a long sword with one hand and suffered a lot in power. So I changed my hands and speeded up, trying to take the initiative in the situation. The percussion of metal is endless. If you don't see it with your own eyes, you will think that four or five people are in a melee, but in fact the crazy attack is all created by Evan alone. This storm-like attack made him take the initiative to avoid being pushed to the wall by the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can still get faster," Siegel took out the power puppet from the space bag, hung it around his waist, and then it was a piece of paper. reel. "You have the rhythm of your own habits, but I have used acceleration for you, you have to play it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
