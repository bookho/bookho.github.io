Www*xshuotxt/com plus the beauty of Shanghai, the passengers can hardly find themselves moving. But now everyone can be sure that the stone boat has finally stopped completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The destination that has arrived at this trip, we are just above the split sea, from here there are more than 30,000 meters to touch the bottom of the sea." Dwarf The king sent messengers to inform the participants one by one. "There is still half a month from the start of the meeting, we will rest here and wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger, in addition to bringing this sentence, also sent it A roll of parchment, which wrote the same thing in more than twenty languages, including dwarf, lingua, dragon, and elf. William called this "map legend", and Siegel called it "the world's instruction manual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings during the meeting, The dwarves suggest that you use a more gentle way to name the world. Although the New World and the Old World have been said for many years, the Western and Eastern continents will speak better, and the "middle sea" between the two continents will become a "segmentation of the sea." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Many sensitive places have not touched, after all, the dwarves have not called all races." William threw the "World Instruction Manual" aside. Said to Siegel: "The orcs, the trolls, the mountain giants, the centaur and the beasts, I guess it is impossible for the dwarves to give them invitations. If you add them, this parchment will be three times longer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still half a month, do you have any plans?" Siegel also threw the parchment aside and waved his hand to stand aside. The dwarf messenger sent it outside the door. After hearing this, William became very alert and his ears were erected: "You must have any thoughts, and you are errands. So I am also your predecessor!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alright, then let me go this time." Siegel shrugged his shoulders: "Don't you stay on a ship that is no longer moving for half a month? The boring thing doesn't know how much to do. Although it is not too irritating, I still want to go back to Mier City to see my family and eat some real food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp William turned his head and smiled. "Don't bother, I thought I had to go back to the federation. See how their spaceship is going. Although I didn't catch the spaceship when I came, I can't lose it when I go back. I have to supervise the chiefs of the factions. I can't do anything without light!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure you are not bothered?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not the thing to pat the wings! The ability to position the sea is no better than your water. Poor! One round trip for half a month, no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. Not flying back, but sending it back." Siegel shook his head: "I I received a message from Wywood this morning, or sent it through a supply ship hired by the dwarf. He said that the cross-continental chain transfer array has been completed, and they need the teacher to carry out the final inspection and verification to avoid errors. After the division, the feeling of space magic is much higher than before. But I think this is more like an honor. There is an island transfer station about 1,000 kilometers from here. You start from there and just look at the stability of the transmission array. Sex."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William’s eyes are shining, the excitement of the hand: “Siegel, I saw your design when I was in the federation, I I always wanted to try it. I will run it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knew that it would be the result, and he took out a letter from his pocket. Come to William: "By the way, send a letter to my wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp; after William left, Siegel was completely idle. Every day he goes to Evan to chat, the rest of the time or a spell meditation. Or staring at the sea. It stands to reason that the sea is always the same, especially in the middle of the sea, looking around to see no land, only blue ruled the horizon. Kesig has a feeling that he has been here and he is very familiar with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when he stood on the edge of the island, quietly staring at the deep waters. Between the swaying light and shadow, there is no 30,000 square meters of water that any creature can reach, and there is a huge attraction. The dwarf is familiar with the rock and is familiar with the earth. They are convinced that this is the deepest part of the sea and is called the "Abyssal Sea Eye". Legend has it that in the deepest part of the world, the gods have left a heavy artifact that is enough to crush the earth, and no living creatures can afford it. So after a long period of time, it will become deeper and deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See what Siegel?" Evan squatted, followed by the Guardian Card. "It is said that the Earl of Heim has a pair of legs in the sea. Is that true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where did you hear this nonsense? "Siegel shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard a lot of rumors about you in the Old World...the East China. People around me always seem to want to mention you, so that I am Note. Siegel. You still don't know who your parents are until now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head. The only information he heard about his own life came from the Green Dragon, saying that he was just an entity created by the twentieth scorpion. If so, how much difference can one's own soul compare to a smart magic item? He didn't quite believe this, but the Green Dragon also said that the twenty-faced scorpion flew to the deepest part of the ocean to hide, just in the abyssal sea eye, and this place is indeed very attractive to Siegel. . Siegel even had the illusion that he once thought that his heart had returned to Heim’s collar and returned to his home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already begun to arrange things that Heim has received. I will give you a kiss after receiving a reply. In this way, we are two brothers and sisters. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, it seems that you can't wait to be a Marquis." Evan said: "I have thought about this, I have already thought about it." The name of the guy. I want to call him Aaron. If my brother does not have a child, I want Xiao Aaron to live with him for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Geer nodded and said: "This is also good. You can have such a brother is very enviable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I always stop I don't think about him. I have imagined several times that if we change two, I am in his position, I am afraid I can't do it, and give up the throne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You? If you are weak, you can't even wave your sword, you will definitely commit suicide, and you will think about the throne." Siegel snorted. "But you have to pay attention, and soon the world is no longer the world of swords. The weapons of the goblins will completely change our lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I know. You gave us all a good lesson that day, and even the Aurora High Priest, whose expression is unchanged, was moved. I even saw a little panic. This is not easy! You know that afterwards he What did you say to me? He said that he would go through a seven-day bath and then report the matter to the Lord of the Morning, saying that it would affect the survival of the temple in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The concern of the gods may not necessarily be a good thing." Siegel looked at the sea, ships appeared sporadically on the sea level, and representatives of the dwarf meeting were brought in one after another. It is said that the ship of the Elven King is already on the road and may arrive within a week. As long as he arrives. The kings of the three races of humans, dwarves and elves have officially gathered together. Although this does not fully represent the owners of the three major races, such specifications can already shake the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no point in this specification once the gods c hands. The war of the elves failed, and the war of the dwarves failed. Fortunately, the human race gods either don't have it, or hide it. In short, there is no messy intention. This is the only good news. But if the Temple of the Morning God continues to strengthen the cooperation with the royal family, then if the Lord of the Morning is given the will, will the human empire also be dragged into the water? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan, you are your Majesty. You have to master everything." Siegel said: "Although smart magic weapons have their advantages, you prefer. It’s a long sword in the hands of Shun Shun, is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I understand what you mean, I understand.” Evan accompanied Siegel Standing on the edge of the island, although it is not a word, it can be worth a thousand words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Heim's collar is booming, don't forget me if there is anything good. The Masters Association and the City's headquarters are all on the East, I can't Rely on them. But the Federation does not have no chance. After all, most of them are human beings, and my starry kingdom is also natural. The former federation is in Deepwater City. It is an independent merchant city that is not convinced of discipline. The kingdom is not good at saying anything. But now the headquarters of the federation is in Heim, and the Royal Earl of the Starry Kingdom is in charge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Strictly speaking, the headquarters of the federation is in a magical spaceship. Up. Floating around and drifting away." Siegel c. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
