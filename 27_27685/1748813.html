			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Siegel rarely paid attention to the temples, because he has always lived by the old captain of the god of the storm. On that sea boat, the god of the storm and the squid of the squid continued to rewind in his ear, impressed. But occasionally passengers will remember the names of other gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mother of the Earth has many believers, but she has no mana at sea. The god of the morning is in charge of the day, and the Lord of the Shadows rules the night. Like the god of the storm, they are the god of nature and the foundation of the world. As long as this world exists, they will last forever. Unless they are boring to the extreme, they rarely send the saints to the mortal, and only the big things that affect the composition of the world will do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more unique is the master of knowledge, a supreme powerhouse in charge of the Star Library, the Master of the City is respectful to him, the Masters Association is slightly Worse. Although most of the Master does not "believe" him, most of them regard him as his own teacher and role model. The master of knowledge is supported by the concept and curiosity of his kingdom. His "Sacred Library" of the Kingdom of God eternal records and constantly analyzes the rules of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patron saint of race is a very powerful group, and it is the most important thing for these gods to let their races multiply and perpetuate. In addition to the human race patron saint in the astral, choose to avoid the attention of other gods, in order to avoid the war of the gods, the patron saints of other races affect the world with various images. They have the most saints and walk in the mortal world when needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other gods supported by various professions and ideas, such as the god of warriors, the god of craftsmen or the god of luck. They also have their own temples, but the temples of the same god are often divided into factions, and it is difficult to unify. They rarely send sacred avatars because it takes up a lot of their power. It is precisely because of this discovery that the Masters have learned the essential characteristics of Divine Power - still only a power system, but it is difficult for mortals to master. This cognitive basis leads to an inevitable result: there is no god of the wizard, only the master of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of shrines are scattered and powerful in the old continent, and each of the lords' territories will have their traces. Many shrines are very focused on influencing the great lords so that they can be allowed to build temples on their territory. Especially the god of warriors and the god of craftsmen, almost become the standard configuration of each territory. But the big church like the Mother Earth and the Temple of Dawn. No need to ask, every lord is very welcome to join the territory's belief system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the New World is rather special, there are many spontaneous temples, but there are few temples built by the church system. The god of the storm has a shrine in Ximu Town. It is already a handful of forces on the west side of the ocean. Except for him, only the Mother of the Earth has an altar in Deepwater City, and the Temple of the Morning is not even able to enter the city. The temple of the Lord of Shadows is always hidden in a hidden place, and only a few members know his size and condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hub of the fortress has the belief of the god of warriors and the god of craftsmen, but only simple gods. The level of the pastor there is not high. Only simple blessings and minor injuries can be applied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the hub, there is only one temple with enough level of casting: the Elven Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are love-free, independent races, the soul features inherited from their race patrons. Moreover, the hub has always been intimate with the Elven Forest, and I believe they will pay special attention to the Spirit Control Tower here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel copied the core enchantment of the magic tower to the elf and found a chance to send them to the past. But throwing trouble into someone else is not complete. What if the elves don't care about this tower? He thought about it and tried to make a hand in the magic circle, causing some trouble for Knox. But he turned to think that there will definitely be a mage coming to the tower in the future, carefully checking the cause of the magical array of wrong operation. If it is done in it. It's hard not to be discovered. Unless you think of a particularly good idea, you must be able to do it in a very fast time, otherwise there will be danger of being hit by the vine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to think about it, and he can’t find a way to do it in the magic array itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has stayed in this magic tower for more than half a day, presumably outside has been deep in the night. Although there is no interest in this magic tower for at least five or six days after the accident, it does not mean that the aliens here will never be discovered. Those who want to come to the "Mage Federation" will eventually find that the magic tower of the hub has lost contact, and the explorers may appear at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to open a new secret passage in this secret passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knox Commonwealth will check all the spells. Focusing on every possible spell map and magic structure, they may ignore something. Siegel very carefully concealed his whereabouts, and did not trigger any warnings and protective enchantments. It is difficult for latecomers to realize that there was someone invaded here. Will they check the channel like a magic array? Siegel thinks it won't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, by building his own castle, gold mine and magic tower, Siegel has accumulated a lot of knowledge in construction engineering. It is not too difficult to dig a hidden passage. He found a corner that was not easily noticeable, using the technique of the dwarf rune to cut off the surface enchantment of the original reinforced wall and then unloading it as a whole - just like opening a door panel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is thick soil behind the wall that leads to the city. Fortunately, the magic tower is built outside the castle wall, otherwise it is still a problem to dig under the wall. Siegel does not need this passage to pass through thousands of troops. It is enough to have only the passage that he can walk through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth elements are constantly excavated, and the excavated soil is placed in the space pocket. Siegel carefully processed the unloaded walls and kept the dwarf runes as small as possible, hiding them at the seams. Then he bent down and walked into the passage to reinstall the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf runes came into effect, and the cracks were firmly stuck, and there was no trace of damage to the layers. In the dark passage, Siegel pours out the soil inside the space bag, piles it behind the wall, and fills the gap to ensure that there is no air circulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Siegel cast a positioning spell to find the nearest water. There are many wells in the town of Hubburg, which is suitable as a secret entrance. The earth element turns a bend, and the well wall is dug out of a mouth that can barely enter and exit, and then dissolves in the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s late at night, no one is silent. Siegel floated out of the wellhead and remembered the environmental characteristics around the site. When the enchantment of the magic tower was repaired, this is the passage he once again sneaked into. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, he changed his appearance and left the hub for early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven Barron leads the way, letting the mount go straight to the direction of the Elf Forest, and Siegel has been frowning. He is increasingly worried about the Knox meeting, knowing that their shadows have begun to gradually cover the New World. First, killing civilians to collect the smoldering crystals, and then using this kind of thing to create a bigger killing - in which one has added a force. They also extended their influence to politics, affecting the Prince of the Star Kingdom, and actually began to control the local lords of the New World. Ximu Town and Hub Fort have fallen into their control, and with the power of the Masters Federation, Deepwater City will not be spared. Now Siegel finds that they are secretly associated with the tattooed undead. Although they don't know who is serving, the undead has never been kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can stop them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows that he is afraid. He is just a mage, and even the transfer is only a preliminary study, not yet at the point of mastery. Among the people exposed by the Knox Commonwealth, there are more than a dozen mages who are stronger than him. Each of them can confuse Heim with a dog and a dog. If it is not Capricorn, he will not leave now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Knox Association has been in operation for a long time, and Siegel’s departure from the sailor is not two years, and there is no way to compare it. Although he has become a lord, but among the various forces in the New World, people speak a little, and only through the help of Elinte can still have a little influence at the top of the Mora. In the Elven Forest, in Deepwater City, in the Hub Fort, and in the Southern Lords, I am afraid that no one can listen to his warnings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the Elf Forest, Siegel frowned and thought about the current situation. For him, the situation has become very unfavorable. It is impossible to say when the Knox Association will be in trouble and control the New World. Regardless of the elves and dwarves, only the northern grassland tribes and the southern lords of human power have not been mastered by Knox, but how long can this situation last? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those sorcerers also don’t see the fighting power of tribal nomads. They prefer big towns with dense populations. But the towns of the southern lords are definitely very attractive to them, and perhaps the next red magic tower will appear in the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
