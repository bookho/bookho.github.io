He found that the small eyes hidden behind the lens had the power of insight to see his heart. He didn't realize that spells were working, but he was so intuitive that he couldn't be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am just a person and you perform the task, then there is no problem, plus Arnold is also fine. But Naria and Emmon are good girls, I have to be careful for them.” The gnome helped the glasses and replaced it with a pale green lens, which made one of his eyes look like a snake. "My name, occupation, and age are not important. Your purpose and way of doing things determine whether you are good or evil, good or bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel nodded and agreed with the words of the gnome: "Mr. Yao En is not wrong at all. Tell me, what do you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Not much, I know that your spell ability is much better than your swordsmanship, but it is still unknown how much better." The gnome pointed to Siegel's finger: "Every time Naria swears a curse Your fingers are shaking, just like a wand, but it's faster and more accurate. It's definitely better than a little girl. Is this a habit, don't you notice that you haven't noticed it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No?" Siegel looked at his hand and smiled after a moment: "You are testing me, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, you really don't have the habit of shaking hands, but you obviously exposed the information." The gnome said: "I don't know who gave you makeup. It’s so vivid that you can’t see what you were before, but this disguise is still not enough. I can’t see the expression from your eyes, and many of the muscle movements that should be covered are covered. Unless you are a very sophisticated assassin, I also mastered quite good warrior martial arts and a certain degree of magic - this I deeply doubt - otherwise you are using camouflage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel caught Grabbing my hair and rubbing my cheeks. His mouth raised a hesitant arc and looked at the gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too much is not a good thing for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomish Yao En shook his head "We have a division of labor for each of the four, Naria is responsible for solving the magic trap, Imon is dealing with the traps of the organs, and Arnold is dealing with things related to divine power. And I get intelligence from people and analyze various clues. For now I don’t know much about the tasks, so I can only make inferences by observing both of you every day. Sol knows that there should not be much. I classify him as a thug. So the mystery can only be solved from you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are going to a dangerous place to find someone who is among some dangerous people." Siegel said: "On her. There is a very important clue that the Lord of the Lord asks to find her and bring her back in good condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Similar to a kidnapping?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Between rescue and kidnapping, because I am not sure who the target is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is to find the target, observe the venue and then take the person away after confirming the target?" The gnome frowned. "Then this task is not simple. More than those who explore the family treasure house." More trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Earl of Heim will really find trouble for his men." The gnome snorted and threw a piece of wood into the fire. He was very hard, causing Mars to splash and the bonfire almost extinguished. But the flames tried to adjust themselves, finally swallowed up the newly added fuel, and began to burn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people looked at the flames without saying a word, thinking about their own thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the gnome said: "Jes, we are just ordinary adventurers, and we have no loyalty to the Siegel Lord. When it is dangerous, The safety of the companion is more important than the task of the lord. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I fully understand." Siegel nodded. "I can understand between you." Friendship and harmony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope this trip will be smooth." Yao En said: "Can you tell me more information?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome Yao En is constantly observing "Jie" and "Sol", and Siegel naturally observes the four-person group. Since the Elf Saint did not elaborate on the destination in the letter, Siegel was not sure that his own power could solve all the troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are sure that you are the stronghold of the murder god, you can find a way to get in, how can you tell Janet? She definitely changed her race, changed her appearance, and even changed... gender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel played a cold war. Fortunately, I am a magician and have the ability to solve such a situation. However, this will place higher demands on how to accomplish this goal. As the gnome Yao En said, there is not enough intelligence. No one can make a correct judgment, let alone arrange a reasonable plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that as Arnomon prays all day long, all the way, all the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s prayers are always unresponsive, but Arnold is just the opposite. He is a devout person. And devout people have a return. The Mother of the Earth rules the traveller's well-being and continues to bless the way. After a few days of windy and sunny days, they did not encounter wild beasts on the road, so they came to the south of the New World smoothly. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a world dominated by saplings and lush grasses that grow year round. It is very simple to open farmland, but it is difficult to overcome wild grass. In order not to spend all your energy on weeding. People in the south are mostly planting fruit trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel can see a piece of orchard that spreads across every hill of vision. Tall chestnut trees and slightly shorter pear trees, raspberry-high raspberries and grapes on the scaffold. Although there are no fruits hanging on them now, they will definitely become alive here in the coming year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unspoiled villages and orchards can be seen to be quite close to the southern coast. During the Elven War, because the Heim's collar involved a lot of troops in the north, the elf's tentacles stretched out here, but not as strong as other places. Moreover, the life pattern based on planting various fruit trees is more consistent with the idea of ​​the elves, so there is no such thing as returning farmland to forests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can be hung on the gallows next to the road? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wood of the gallows has long been eroded by the wind and rain, but the black tung oil brushed on it seems to be new. The bodies of the two women's cognac swayed with the wind, making a "clam" crash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sign on the ground next to the body. The parchment is somewhat faded but barely able to see the writing. "The elf invaders are not dead, this is the end of the spy. The act of breaking the rope or putting down the body is considered to be against the Duke of Kaib."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yao En said to Ai Meng: "Cover your ears, it is not friendly to the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan pointed at the notice, confused Expression: "Duke? Is there a Duke in the New World?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is estimated that the lord lord himself sealed it." Arnold said: "Many people stand on the mountain." I thought I was more great than the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this shows that we are very close to the town of Kaibu." Siegel suddenly said: "It is time to tell you About the task of this trip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the gallows, I saw a home inn far away - which is why there is a gallows. Its upper layer is painted white, with a slate roof and light smoke from the chimney. A clean stable was in the corner of the courtyard, where only two shackles with blankets on his back were parked. There are enough nine horses to stay here. The pile of grass next to it is enough for them to have a good meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a gazebo behind the yard. Two men and one woman have three people talking in the pavilion. They dressed properly, dressed like aristocrats, but did not see servants and carriages. So I don't know how they came to this inn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the horse was approaching, the group heard the sound of drowning, and understood how the three people arrived. There is a small road at the back of the inn that leads to the pier. A small passenger ship is on the dock, and there are five family flags on the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the inn heard the hooves far away and ran out on the apron. This is a little fat man who is only in his teens. There are many acne on the face that is worrying. The red spot is followed by a happy smile: "Welcome to the adults to visit the Rabbit Inn, Panlin will help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
