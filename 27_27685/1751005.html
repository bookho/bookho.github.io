			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the bowstring almost arrives at the same time as the feather arrow. The sharp arrow drills into the gap between the cervical vertebrae and shatters the sole support of the skull. The other two arrows were inserted at the junction of the neck and shoulders, cutting off the large blood vessels. Under the enormous pressure of the heart, the blood is squeezed out like a fountain, forming a reddish rain and fog in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental weapon that Siegel casts spurs power, ignites the flesh of the trolls, and begins to burn from under the skin. The red light shines through the outer skin, and even the cheesy eyes, ears, mouth and nostrils smoke. Such an injury can not be saved regardless of the ability to regenerate or the ability to heal. The huge body of the trolls falls to the ground, and the cane in the hand rolls out far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his death, the magical techniques that shrouded the trolls also began to dissipate, causing their strength and speed to begin to decline, and their ability to regenerate gradually recovered. To the original level. Originally, they were very disadvantaged in martial arts. Now their weapons are not very cheap in front of the steel armor. The advantage they just got disappeared immediately, and the battle began to stalemate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The besieged knights were in great spirits and saw the real hope of winning. They roared again and again, encouraged each other loudly, and tried to force their strength from the potential of the body. They firmly believe that as long as ten minutes have passed, they can sit on the enemy's body and rest, naturally no longer have reservations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea frequently pulls the bow, and a feather arrow shoots at the enemy. The elf's shooting is fast and accurate, even if it is shot to the enemy in the melee, it will not hurt the allies. The armored trolls should not be able to avoid or block every feather arrow. They only choose to let the body that is not the most important - most of the time is the arm - to be a shield. The blood ran down the wound, and their actions began to slow down, and the enemy in the back was letting them have no morale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will they kill them?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One does not stay." Lia is firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Siegel nodded and patted his head with his hand, invising himself. He approached the battlefield under the hills, and reached the distance of the knight's vitality with the spirit of vision. Then he took out the reel and poured the power of water and earth into the body of the friendly army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight warriors swelled up. Their weapons and armor also increase with the help of magic. With only two breaths of time, the warriors' bodies are more than the trolls, and they are two higher. The eater's horror retreat is just at the best attack distance of the long sword (Great Sword). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors have a silent understanding. They also launched the final counterattack. The huge weapon with a huge body and strength, instantly suppressed the cheetah's defense. First, the axe was smashed, then the arm was broken, and even the armor of the body could not resist the attack of the weapon. In the continuous mourning, the corpses of the eater are falling down in turn. Stacked up indiscriminately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge cast of spells that will make Siegel a physique, but victory is a foregone conclusion, and there is no danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The effect of the spell is not over yet, everyone put the bodies of the trolls together." Siegel said: "You must burn the body with fire. They won't be resurrected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to the commander of the wizard." The injured brown-haired man said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is busy with the hands and feet, as much as possible to bring back the broken body. Legend has it that the trolls have only a small piece of nails that can be regenerated - this is of course only a misinformation of the villagers, but it also reflects the powerful regenerative power of this monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel summons the power of the fire and ignites the body. The flame likes this kind of fuel very much, and even the blood can help to burn, so it burns vigorously. The soldiers cooperated in threes. Put the trolls into the fire like firewood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the brown-haired man, with the support of his female companion, walked to Siegel and took a deep bow. "Thank you for the friendly assistance of the Master. I am Dennis Leslie, a businessman from Deepwater City, this is my wife Dana."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel The squid, Heim led the lord." The Master replied: "Helping you should do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poetry?" Siegel stunned. When he led the Orcs to the south, he told Fazak to tell his story. It is good to enhance prestige and increase cohesion, but he never thought about poetry. The mage sinked for a while and suddenly felt that it was a good idea. Perhaps through the poet, the message of warning is passed through poetry. It may attract the attention of the public, or eventually it will attract the attention of the leaders. Deepwater City is now the base of the Knox Association, and the effect will not be too good, but this method is not infeasible in music-loving elves. If you can win the love of the elves, soon the lords of the South will follow suit and invite the poets to perform. to a certain degree. This is better than writing letters to each lord, and it is safer and less likely to be exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is the right work. Siegel could not solve this problem for the time being, and he could only leave the plan in his heart. If you encounter a talented troubadour, implement it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't know where you are going?" Siegel asked: "Why can the shemale attack you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dennis spread his hand, a very helpless expression: "We just finished the game and collecting wind in the Elf Forest, we are going back to Deepwater City, I don't know where to get this group of shemale. Before we got from I haven't seen it, but they seem to have decided to kill me and my wife. If the soldiers are not saved, I am afraid we will die in this wilderness like the poor people."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These trolls believe in the murder god, I am afraid that you will not be peaceful along the way." Siegel heard Dennis's pretext, but he did not want to go deeper - after all, do not want to say to strangers Information that may harm you is also excusable. "You think about your own enemies, who might hire a troll, or can have a relationship with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dennis frowned and glanced at his wife Then he said to Siegel: "I really can't think of it. I am just a low-key businessman who runs ordinary goods and has no conflict with others. It is reasonable to say that the possibility of kidnapping me is better than killing. I am much taller, but this group of cannibals is obviously coming to my life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can't guess the other person's origin, then others It can't help too much." Siegel said: "I can only remind you to be more careful. There are many ways to murder the gods. They are actually better at hiding in the dark, using intrigues to take human life. Like this I am afraid that there will not be too many opportunities for confrontation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will strengthen defense." Dennis said, "There is a Mage Federation in Deepwater City, where food The shemale can’t make it. I won’t find the messenger and destroy them. Relax and be vigilant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I were you, choose the Temple of the Morning." Siegel said: "The Masters Union is not the best choice." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you say this?" Dennis asked very curiously: "I remember you are also a member of the Masters Federation, aren't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and patted the robe with his hand and said: "The Masters of the Master prefer to study, and the murder god is just another research object for us. The bodyguards have always been unqualified, but the pastor who has a firm belief and can focus on dedication is different. The pastor of the morning temple is scornful of the teachings of the murder god. If you hear that you are being pursued by the believer of this evil god, you will definitely I am happy to defeat the enemy conspiracy and help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said it makes sense." Dennis said: "But there is no morning temple in Deepwater, only sporadic Several altars, at least I have not heard of a serious morning priest ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you know the direction, many times the road needs to be out of the wilderness with your feet." Siegel said: "Our mission is completed." Now, I have to be separated from you. Deepwater City is in the northeast, and we will move west, so we can't accompany you back to Deepwater City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, what! Dennis opened his mouth: "I still want to entertain you in Sham Shui Po and give you a taste of the landlord." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need. "Siegel said: "There will be opportunities in the future, I wish you a safe journey. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Siegel’s salute, he turned and left, and Elijah also retrieved a lot of feather arrows from the body to supplement the quiver. She looked far away. Busy warriors, pay attention to their mode of action and the habits shown in their hands and feet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
