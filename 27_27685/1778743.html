			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the New World, Xuecheng is a distant and mysterious organization. It is closely linked to the Starry Royal Family, serving the human nation and providing intellectual advice and magical help to all human lords who need service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only those big lords who have real powers will really get the help of the Master of the City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bachelors Faranis once said to Siegel during his lifetime: "The most active wizards are in the federation, the most traditional guys in the Masters Association, and Those who are not allowed to have a spell ability and have full brain knowledge will go to school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the deep research in various miscellaneous knowledge, The school can judge whether a mage meets the criteria of a bachelor's degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter of the school city attracted the attention of Siegel, and it was sent by the messenger of the Uther family, and the meaning of the representative was also thought-provoking. After the fall of the Magic Tower of the Mage Federation, it became clear that the Masters Association began to personally intervene in the affairs of the New World, and the emergence of the school city began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The political struggle of the Starry Royal Family is over?" Siegel couldn't ask for an answer at Fazak and Mana, and he hurriedly ended the meeting. Find the Lich ** Alexandre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Deepwater City, he stayed in the third floor of the underground city of Mith, next to the array of energy-focusing lenses. This array seems to have a great appeal to him, so that he can not move all day, only the golden soul of the eyes keep jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel worried that Alexander was happy, and erased the identification of the law and controlled the biggest amulet of Heim. On this issue, the Lion King shook his head and said in a sincere tone that he could not do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Elven War, Alexander once went to the Star Kingdom to mediate the contradiction between the two princes as required by the Masters Association. He knew more than anyone on the New World. many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two princes, Aaron and Evan have their own supporters, but Aaron is obviously more dominant. If it is not because his body is broken, There are no children, I am afraid that things will not evolve so much trouble." Alexander said: "The City and Master Association means support on both sides, but only limited to the help of Zhimou. Do not use spells, so as not to evolve into spell warfare. The main purpose of my visit was to convince the two princes to agree. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the result?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aaron has always had the support of the Temple of the Morning, and the need for the wizard's magical ability is not urgent, and naturally agrees to this condition. Evan hopes that the school can at least Provide magic protection. Prevent the other party from causing spell damage. This thing is still in dispute when I leave, but if the letter you show me is true, then the school must have a decision, support Ya Prince Lun became king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, Evan is not in danger? Siegel is worried about his friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is your peace of mind. The city has always left a trail for yourself - their political skills are very good. Even if they decide to support Aaron, the city is also Will protect Evan, after all, he is also the son of the former king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will be more relieved." Siegel said with a sigh of relief, " Listening to your statement, the school seems to have been very smooth, how suddenly the attitude is clear, do you think this letter will be forged?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander shakes his head "I can tell you with certainty that the magical emblem of the school is true. It may be to prevent the kingdom of the stars from falling into a full-scale civil war and to deplete the power of human beings, so the school will suddenly be clear." His eyes are still motionless. Stare at the core of the element runes. The mouth said to Siegel: "If I were you, there is no need to conflict with King Aaron. The Uther family is not the loyalty of the kingdom of the stars, it will not affect your relationship with the elves. As long as you do not have The idea of ​​investing in elves, why not cooperate with the kingdom of stars and Uther?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the end, you don't have the title of Baron Royal Stars. Isn't Aaron still your object of allegiance? Do you want to be a vows?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sighed and sat down a little. "Mr. Alexander," there was a hoarse voice in his voice. "Is there any way to know the latest news from the New World?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemingly knowing Siegel's thoughts, Alexander went on to say: "If you use the energy-focusing lens array to increase the concentration of elements in the territory, I can use the teleportation to go to the starry kingdom. But that will definitely cause the Master Association to detect it. As a dead monster, or a theoretically dead Mage Federation giant, I am still staying in your squad here and don't tamper with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel nodded and collected the mind floating in the air, ready to leave. Alexander stopped him and said, "You have a martial arts master called Tiger Bill. Is it? As far as I know, he is now a Viscount. And is a supporter of Aaron. Maybe his choice can give you some Prompt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What tips? Siegel pretended not to understand. If Janet is here, Siegel may be able to get advice from her. The rules of the game between the nobility and the nobility have not always been Siegel's strengths, but one thing he can do is to be a mage and use the power of magic to deter others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he decided to attend the Southern Lords Alliance meeting initiated by Viscount Uther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three patriarchs are Viscount Drey Uther, Baron Brown Leicester and Baron Siegel. The Uther family has the strongest strength, the Leicester family has the widest area, and the squid family... a mage lord and an undefeated record are enough to explain everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Siegel Baron is fully armed, with a golden magic ring, wearing a light red shifting cloak, and the milky elf magic breastplate protects the key. The long-sword of the scorpion star, holding a defensive staff, stepped into the Chamber of Justice. Here, the two casters of the school city provide protection against peeping and sneak attacks by the elves. If there is no such guarantee, Siegel will not follow them to Gaco Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venue of the conference is not the West Ling City of the Uther family, but the territory of the Leicester family, which is said to also avoid the attention of the elves. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Smile. Patrick lived in the city of Mire for more than three months until Sigel completed the occupation of the five castles and stabilized the defense of the territory before leaving him. Patrick had a lot of whispers - after all, he had been helping Siegel - but then with the growing strength of Heim, these "complaints" had no practical meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is sitting in the middle of the three big lords? Siegel looked at the empty seat left in front of him. Go straight ahead and sit next to it. He will not be fooled and commit a young and angry mistake. Drey Uther is a high-ranking person and has a relationship with the city. It is the perfect choice for sitting in the main position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the city, Siegel carefully looked at the two mages standing in the corner. The Masters who came out of the City were called "servants" or "consultants". They wore uniform brown hoodless robes and their hands were always placed outside the long sleeves - most of the time they were staggered in the belly. before. They rarely wear magic items, but they always have a wand around their waist. The other side is not a magic book or a scroll. They also noticed Siegel's gaze and then greeted with a kind smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical fluctuations in these two people are not strong, and Siegel himself has a gap, but does not rule out the result of deliberate concealment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Uther was wearing a loose purple velvet coat, carrying a steel cane, smiling and sitting on the main seat. The Baron Brown was much stronger than the last time he met, and his face was more rosy, sitting next to the Viscount Uther. After the three "big lords" were seated, others were seated on their own. Among the southern lords, Siegel did not know many people. This work is handled by Janet. Fortunately, Drey Uther directly started the meeting, eliminating the time wasted on the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elves have failed in Deepwater City. They have suffered heavy losses and have been unable to unify the entire New World." Viscount Uther said it was easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New World in their mouth is just a piece in the walled mountains, and Siegel laughs in his heart. The world outside is so big that the elves could not rule the entire New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a kingdom of common awe-inspiring humanity, the new king of the king of the stars, Aaron. The stars have been enthroned. The new king is ambitious and cannot bear to sit down on the human beings of the New World. Suffering from the damage of the elves, I urge everyone to unite and fight against the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
