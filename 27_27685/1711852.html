			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel left the Sanfeng Pagoda with great enthusiasm, and the respected scholar of the Bachelor went to the time of medication and then went to bed. It was a great physical effort to meet the young Siegel, but he finally got a satisfactory answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help the Masters Association save books and knowledge?" Siegel stunned when he heard the request, and replied: "This is absolutely no problem. Then he raised the doubts in his heart: "How can I help? Do you need me to copy books?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the time is up, you will know, let me be this old man." Keep the last mystery." Faranes, who looked at Siegel, couldn't help but sigh that young is good. Young people have enough time and hope, there are endless changes and futures, and they don’t want a squat old man who is destined to end up. But young people are also impulsive. Sometimes they make mistakes because of impulses, so the old man swears: "Knox Commonwealth requested to be merged into the Masters Federation. This matter has been approved by resolution. You are not playing with them. Dealing, so don't have any conflicts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is more shocking than any other news, and he quickly said: "Common Masters modify Others remember, control others' thoughts, and use the spells of grievances. They are not good guys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They claim to be sorcerers, but they are still Master. Casper is willing to open all the techniques of the confederation, including their Yanshenjing and Eternal Magic Tower, and accept the rules and regulations of the Federation. We have no reason to reject him."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not everyone agrees, but it is indeed the general trend." : "But the time of the real merger is still early, you are in contact There are still few feelings, so I feel that the association may have some unscrupulous means. But they have never harmed the interests of the Master. This is the core." He sat up and patted Siegel's shoulder and said with deep words: After all, we are all mages.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the topic is terminated. Since Siegel contributed to the Mage Federation, the apprenticeship in his title was removed. And received a spell book provided by the "Lion King" Alexander Pilsen, enough for Siegel to learn for a long time. In addition to secretly giving him a bottle of Lich Potion, the Faranis Baker gave him a book of knowledge on the face, which included a copy of the notes of many senior mages. The debates of various hypotheses are full of sparks of thought that collide with each other. Siegel solemnly took the two books together. Upon seeing it, the bachelor gave him a small space pocket to hold these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the spell book is available, Siegel is ready to go to the Black Blood Castle. After learning about the safety of everyone. He has time to carefully prepare for the road, without having to travel in a hurry. A new wand is necessary. This adventure gives him a new master and has a lesson to let him know what is so-called good preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he chose a wand that adds spell effects to the spell. Summon-like spells are mostly spells, and most of them are spell-like, and they can be used for a wide range of purposes. And this magic wand feels very good, and the spell energy is not stagnate when it passes, so it is taken by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many gold coins left, and Siegel bought a pack of no trace powder and two bottles of healing potions. The lamp god of the authority tower is still tirelessly selling to him, but Siegel is not moving - gold coins are always a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After. He returned to his residence in the northern district. Looking at the three-story building in front of him, Siegel has a feeling of being separated from the world. It’s only about half a year to leave here. Why is there such a feeling? I remember that the leaves on the tree had not been lost when I left, and the chrysanthemums that Mrs. Dip had planted had not faded. Who shovel the garden into a vegetable field, what is planted inside? Siegel thought for a moment, only to recall that the housekeeper had said before leaving, to plant some peas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the building is locked, and Siegel’s door key has long been lost in the Walled Mountain Range, but the door will not stop him. With a simple spell, the door lock will open with confidence and fear. But Siegel is in a good mood. Decided to go to the backyard to see. So he stepped through the vegetable field, be careful not to step on the seedlings on the ground, and then came to the back of the yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a horse in the past, and it has now been split. Piled up with large and small boxes. The fangs Janis was lying on a temporary bed that was put together in two boxes, covered with thick blankets and snoring. Seeing his appearance is a good life, he is a bit fatter when he meets, but now he is not sleeping. The Raven Baron suddenly screamed and woke him up from his sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Everyone is okay?” Siegel asked. “How do you sleep in the yard?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“All good. Good, huh, huh.” Nice smiled and revealed the neat teeth. He saw Siegel's doubts and pointed to his teeth and said: "Isn't it all been beaten? It was too inconvenient. Later, Carl found me a filling artist. Now I can bones again. "He is very satisfied with his current state. When he jumped out of the box, his skills basically recovered from the agility of being a sailor. "These goods are the good things that Trinity has found. Most of them are special products of the northern grassland savage. They are mainly fur, but also some horns, herbs and the like. It is said that some are casting materials, no matter the gods. The temple is still needed by the Mage Federation. A lot of wild people come to the south together, and they treat these things at low prices for their food. Trinity is a good investment, and prepares the goods in advance with the news you gave. Savage exchange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No strong buy and sell?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not do such a thing." Janis replied: "Ms. Linda is afraid that we will affect your reputation, so let his son Carl supervise every time. Trading. He is now a pastor of the Temple of the Month, and he is very serious every day. Naturally, no one dares to do evil. I almost forgot to say that Ms. Linda has prepared a sumptuous dinner today. It is said that Trinity has known A very important partner who wants to entertain him. It was originally going to the hotel, but Ms. Linda insisted that Carl join the banquet, so she changed her home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good." Siegel said: "Do you know that Alexander Pilsen, also known as the Lion King, has a manor in the North City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennis nodded and pointed to the position on the east side and replied: "Not far away, the Lord’s Council gave him. But he never lived there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went there to see and tell others that I would be back at night. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; seems that only complete their commitment to real peace of mind, Siegel walked think. Since the food in the city is enough for everyone to eat, and the war situation is also developing in a good direction, then even after the half-orcs have lived, they have completed the promise of them. The Walled Mountains still need someone to defend, and the Orcs are better. Maybe they can arrange their wives and children on the grasslands, and then let the men grab the weapons and serve as soldiers. Compared with the miners as a miner, which one is better? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing he is not sure, only experienced lords can answer this question. Maybe in the end, you still need the half-beasts to choose. As for the humans in the ranks, they are no longer slaves after entering Deepwater City. If they have family members to go to, they will give them the remaining gold coins, even if they sail across the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lion's family estate, all the half-orcs are honest, not even one who stands up and walks, obedient like a gentle dog. More than a dozen servants are helping them prepare meals. The cauldron is cooked like a broth with green vegetables. The long black bread is steaming in the basket, and no one dares to take it. Siegel was deeply puzzled when he saw this scene. He just stepped into the door and heard the footsteps coming from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A steel giant with a height of more than five meters came over, and each piece of stone that was stepped on it would be sunken into the mud. Fortunately, this did not cause the ground. The vibration. It is covered in steel armor, full of complex runes, and green gas leaks from the gaps in his armor. Siegel only felt that his teeth were sore. I didn't expect to have an iron monster here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder everyone is honest, and Siegel thinks about going backwards. The Iron Golem is a terrible enemy, powerful and extremely aggressive. The runes on him protect it from magic and absorb the energy around it to make a poisonous spit. This means that all who want to defeat the Iron Golem can only launch an offensive in the area where the Golem is best at the melee field. But I believe that few people are willing to teach the pair of big fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention that Lion King Alexander also specially equipped this Golem with a "small" shield and a "short" sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akeqi Master is still here, he heard that the actor Alexander will appear, arrange these half-orcs, and maybe he can ask him for advice. problem. So the suffering became a welfare, and he finally had a good face for Siegel. It is said that after the approval of the bachelor Faranis, Siegel is wearing the crimson robe of the official mage, which is exactly the same as him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
