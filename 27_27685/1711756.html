			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub is located in the southern part of the city, also known as the commercial storage area. The goods unloaded from the port and inland are piled up here, and the merchants are on the spot. Can talk about the terms of the transaction and complete the sale. There are many pubs, hotels, and exchanges to provide a warm and attentive service for everyone. Nancheng District is more than three times larger than Beicheng, so it is inevitable that there is some confusion. From the heights, the entire Nancheng is like an arm, and the port area is in the arms. A curved "Peace Street" has three largest goods in series. Area. The foam barrel hotel is on the side of this road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mix of fish and dragons here, so Siegel puts on the adventurer's clothes so that they don't seem to fit in with their surroundings. He rode through the streets and walked down the gravel street from the flat stone street. The bubble barrel pub is uncharacteristic today. There are alcoholic drinkers early in the morning: more than a dozen sailors are scattered all over the table, drinking and singing here. They kept yelling loudly, thanking the sea gods for letting them go ashore safely, and to return to Poseidon with joy and piety. The waiter said that they arrived by boat in the middle of the night and came to the pub with stars. At present, the sailors’ celebrations are coming to an end, and the pubs are in a mess. The guy who has been drunk is screaming in the food residue, and he is trying to get drunk and try to get back to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marcus-Gulen is temporarily absent, he wants a problem with red wine, is in the dock and captain theory. The attentive waiter brought Siegel a table and chair and asked him to sit in the window and wait for a while. Siegel asked for a piece of fried fish and mashed potatoes with a glass of ale that was sown by well water. He still has the habit of a seafarer and likes large, oily, full-bodied food. Siegel, according to his previous habits, reached out and pulled a thick loaf of bread and ate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a good time to eat, suddenly heard the door screaming, Siegel probe looked out of the window, saw a few people standing opposite the grocery store, the store owner With two burly guys, they are shouting a man who is dressed in a ragged. The man had blood on his arms and knees, and his body was covered with mud, and he couldn’t see the appearance, but his body was somewhat familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bastard, I’m going to get dirty with my cloth, I want to go?" The boss yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person seems to be stupid, and will only whisper to the fierce store: "I didn't hit you, but you fell. Green skin Dog!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man is furious, punches and punches, hits the man's nose and knocks him up. There were two lines of nosebleed, lying in the mud and yelling: "Why are you hitting me? Why are you hitting me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not paying From my cloth, I have to make a sigh of relief!" The boss rolled up his sleeves and actually wanted to do it himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel couldn’t stand it anymore, hurried forward and stopped the man behind him. It was only after a close look that it was identified as "fangs" - Janis, but his signature tooth decay was gone, and the center of the mouth was an obvious hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenice seems to be unconscious, not recognizing Siegel, his eyes are still straight. Siegel even called him a few names and found that he still knew the promise. When the boss sees these two people, he can find a way to "compensate for the loss." He reached out and grabbed Siegel's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could Siegel let him catch it, he swept his arm and caught the hand of the hotel owner. The two clerk next to him will come over to help, and they will want to fight if they clench their fists. Siegel shouted: "Don't move thick, isn't it a rough cloth? I bought it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the two don't stop, the fist is still I have to fly over. Siegel was angry and punched. His speed naturally exceeds these untrained ordinary people, and his skills are fully suppressed. I only heard two screams, and the two clerk had already sighed with the curved fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look like this half-volume is locally produced, up to half a gold coin, I bought it." Siegel pulled out a pocket Gold coins, a bomb in the air, and then quickly pulled out the black dagger from the belt, volleyed a wave, and then quickly into the sheath. The gold coin was cut flat in half and quietly fell into Siegel's palm. Siegel threw half a gold coin to the boss and then pushed him into the store. He grabbed Janis and grabbed the cloth in one hand and returned to the bubble barrel pub. The shop owner looked at the neatly cut face of the gold coin, and thought of the sharp knife light, sobbing and screaming, no longer dare to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you come to Deepwater City? How is it so miserable?" Siegel used ale to help Janis clean the wound and tear the cloth to bandage him. Although it hurts to tremble, but knows that Siegel is good for him, so it is not called, just forbearance. Siegel found a scar on the back of the tooth, which was caused by a knife. In addition, there are wounds left by his arrows on his shoulders and calves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janis looked hungry, grabbed the fish and grabbed it. Three or two mouths were swallowed, scaring Siegel to grab the fish bone and pull it out of the mouth to avoid the danger of him piercing his throat. The malt grabbed the mashed potatoes with his hands, and all of them were stuffed into his mouth. He chewed it twice and swallowed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel quickly said: "What else do you want to eat? Just say, I will give you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence does not know which nerve to touch, Janis suddenly red eyes, two lines of tears shed. He choked and said: "The sailor is long, I want to drink fish soup, I want to go out to the sea..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, let's go home!" Siegel pulled Janis, helped him to go to the horse, took the horse to take him to the north city. I didn’t say anything when I was licking my teeth. I just lowered my head and nodded with the bumps on the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the small villa in the North City, Siegel reached out and helped the fangs. He greeted the cook to prepare the food, took a bottle of wine from the cupboard and poured it on Janis, and brought a plate of smoked sausage. Janis looked at the furnishings around with a very cramped look and didn't dare to sit on a clean, soft sofa. He pointed to the clothes on his body and asked where he could rinse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First drink two, eat something, just be your own home." Siegel pressed his fangs on the sofa, giving him peace of mind: It takes a while to boil the hot water. You should wash it first and then take a nap. I am still your sailor, you will stay here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The tooth fangs nodded and his eyes were filled with tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel went back to the room and found a set of his own clothes. He took it to Jenice and found that the tooth decay had fallen asleep on the sofa. He put the clothes aside and then gently brought the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that a former friend of the young master?" asked Ms. Linda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we used to go out on a boat and are familiar friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is also a sailor? There have been a lot of big ship accidents recently. The port area is full of people. Some of my former businessmen and friends who have lost their lives are now shutting down the market and many people are unemployed. Carl said that the temple has recently received a lot of jealousy, the city watchers. I also posted a notice to maintain order, and I was also recruiting members."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what happened?" Siegel frowned. He has been learning spells lately and hasn't paid much attention to changes in the city. As Ms. Linda said, he also thought that when passing through the Nancheng District today, several cargo distribution centers were indeed empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that it is a pirate, but I am not sure about it." Ms. Linda said: "But food, cloth and fish have all gone up." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lords didn't do anything?" Siegel had a feeling that this thing would gradually expand and cause trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lords haven't done anything yet, but the merchant guild has organized a few additional teams to go to Mora and Xinlin, and the price is very good. I haven't heard anything about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said: "If you see an increase in the number of people on the street, you must Pay attention to safety. You help me get five hundred gold coins and let Carl hand over to the Moon Temple, which is to make more donations for poor people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lin Ms. Da thanked her, and such a thing is also very beneficial to her son. If you can bring in donations, you may be selected and participate in the activities of resettling the displaced people. If you perform well, you may be noticed by the pastor, so it is possible to continue to learn higher knowledge in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slight snoring in the living room, and Siegel asked Ms. Linda to take care of it and returned to the study. It was not until the time of dinner that he was called down. At this time, Janis had been groomed and replaced with clean and tidy clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, the sailor is long, you saved me." The fangs are hard to conceal gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Being a sailor, knowing that if you die, you will lead to bad luck." Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good intentions are good, sailors are long, you have been like this, so you can live a good life now." Janis took another sip of whiskey and smoothed his mood. . It is not easy to recall the disasters that have been encountered, just like tearing the wound that has just healed again. Siegel did not urge him, just waiting quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
