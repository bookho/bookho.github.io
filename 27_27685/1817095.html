			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of goblins is full of ruin and destruction, and the radioactive dust covers the sky. Only in the depths of the earth, the dwarves can still survive in the caves excavated. . As the world of the thunder wall gained a half-plane, these underground works lost their meaning, and the dwarves began to withdraw. Only some jealousy and zombies who had not received orders were still tirelessly waving their hoes and dig a piece of rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan and Siegel chose to play a "duel" here, but more like a contest. Moore and Nata are witnesses, and they are far away from watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for choosing here is to keep the participants as confidential as possible. If they know that the King of Stars and the Magic God want to use swords to decide everything, then it’s not to fry. The thunder wall world is full of portals, there is no quiet place. There is not enough open land within the half-plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, this battle is meaningless. I just have to fly to the sky and you have nothing to do." Siegel took out the dust of the stars and made a few strokes on his side. Circles, making a loud noise. It has been a long time since I have not used a long sword, or a long sword as the main means of combat. But fortunately, the physical quality is strengthened by the fire, and there is magic as an aid, the real strength will not decline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you last told me to strengthen your sword training, I did. I learned this when the dice showed up to eighty." The text opens the space bag and draws a sword from it. The sword is golden yellow, the same as Evan's hair color, like the morning sun. "This handle is called morning light. It is the weapon that I received after I became the Lord of the Morning. When my sword was in my hands..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Double Sword Gently waving, the momentum is different, Evan actually floated slowly. "My speed can't keep up with the transmission, but the general flight is no longer a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can ask, how much is the value of your nephew now?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ninety-nine." Evan smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hundred scorpions measure whether a technique has reached its peak. If Evan’s swordsmanship can fly at 80, then it’s nine. What is the concept of nineteen? Siegel may ignore the threat of the warrior to the wizard, but will never underestimate the power of any blind man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not too late, let’s end this thing as soon as possible.” Evan holds the sword and is ten steps away from Siegel. The spell is possessed at this distance, because it takes time for the swordsman to run, which is enough for Siegel to cast two spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's get started." Siegel clenched the dust of the stars and nodded slightly according to the Knight's etiquette. "The mortal king and the magical god are here more than the sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, he felt the golden light flashed, so he quickly raised his hand to resist. Only heard a bang, the dust of the star was hit hard, and Siegel’s mouth was sore. A dozen steps away from Evan, did not consume time? This is obviously impossible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously screaming twice, Siegel separates Evan’s sway, while the left hand pushes, the power of the elements forms a shield, and two people Separated. "I thought I couldn't use it, but it seems that I can't beat you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is not surprised, he is slow outside the element shield Slow pace, with a relaxed look on his face: "This passive shield can't stop the sword. I just need to open it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still using swordsmanship?" Siegel frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course. The sword is developed to the extreme, and 10,000 kinds of spells can be broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That try this!" Siegel throws the dust of the stars into the air and suspends it with the "Mage's Magic Sword" as a threat to attack at any time. Since you have cast your spells, you should go all out and there is no need to entangle too much in this matter. Therefore, the cold air of the deep icy ice spewed out from Siegel's palm and went straight to Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the four elemental forces, the water element is the least destructive, and it is a big deal to freeze the opponent and then have the opportunity to thaw. Each of the flames, lightning, and acidity is more harmful to the body than the ice, so Siegel chose to use the frozen air to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Evan broke the cold, he immediately rushed to Siegel, but was forced to open by the large elements summoned by Siegel. He used the time of the three swords to smash the element and found himself facing the legion of forty-three super-large elements. With apologetic expression, Siegel spread his hand and explained: "This is my best style of play, you can play slowly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, Evan shook his head. "When the scorpion reached 85, I realized a trick. It’s exactly the same as playing 10,000." After that, Evan jumped and jumped into the net. Jumped into the arms of the earth. He used the "morning light" to block the fist of the earth element, and then pierced the "bonfire" into the heart of the element. From the wounds caused by the demon sword, a bright flash is constantly emitted, and the most basic force that constitutes the elemental warrior is suppressed by the demon attribute and begins to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wan Jian!" Evan roared, and the sword in his hand turned into a reddish state, suddenly appearing in the chest of every legion element. The power of the same demon and disintegration elements was passed away, and it took only a moment to disintegrate Siegel's summoning spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the swordsmanship? I don't believe it!" When Siegel sees it, he no longer wastes his efforts to use group summoning spells, but opens different The door of the world directly brings together the powerful creatures of other worlds. The sorcerer, the Titan, the morning angel, these creatures that can conquer some small worlds have not yet been able to wake up from the transmission of the door of the outer world, they are slammed, quickly lose their advantage, and then they are killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I arrived at 88, I was able to attack all the weaknesses of my creatures, and their protection and resistance had no effect on me." The mysterious silver golem in front of the dismemberment, said to Siegel: "I don't have so many means for you, only the long sword, but I know that the development to the peak, the only thing left is the power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He killed a few steps in front of Siegel and swung his sword from top to bottom. Siegel took a shot on the chest and used the power of space folding to send himself out. But when he stood still, he still couldn't avoid Evan's sword. His sniper broke through the space barrier and landed on the target without any stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the surging, the wound that was opened quickly healed, but the pain was still deep. Siegel looked at Evan. If it was not a god, this sniper would be enough for a life. "Do you really want to kill me?" The blood of his hand shines in the rainbow. The power of the elemental polymer has already penetrated into every place. Every drop of blood on the ground can burn a deep hole. "Is this a swordsmanship or a duel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't come up with a duel, how can you compare it with the gods?" Evan turned his wrists, two long The sword is right and wrong, pointing to the front of the body. "Using space transmission is not able to escape my sword front. When I reach ninety, I have been able to integrate sniping into the enemy's space power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemies?" Siegel snorted, his palms lifted up, and two stalagmites with enough three people hovered from the ground, swaying and turning at an angle, pointing the tip at Evan . Siegel’s lame, the high-level creation law spread out from his toes, bringing bright light to the cave. The two stalagmites began to become fine gold under the influence of the array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You see it!" Siegel waved his hand and stalagmite rushed forward. Then one stone after another came to Sigel, and all of them were turned into fine gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan double sword waving, even if it is a fine gold material, he can quickly open. The sky was crumbly flying, and with the help of the gas element, a tornado was quickly formed, and Evan was in it. There were small wounds on his face, body and arms, and the double sword could not completely protect him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Avon doesn’t seem to panic, but he’s still smashing a piece of sword and a piece of fine gold. Soon, Siegel discovered the problem: the sword light that was thrown out did not completely disappear, but hovered around Evan, like a firefly flying around the night flower. The power of these swords can still be shredded to throw the fine gold of the past, which seems to represent some strange rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the rule begins with the legendary spell seed, attributed to the gods, and it is reasonable to say that Evan should not master this level of power! Siegel's curious look, using the characteristics of the god of knowledge, attempts to analyze the composition of this rule. At this time, Evan roared, and all the swords slammed out and shattered all the substances along the way into powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel quickly retreated, using the transmission of any door to avoid sniping. He saw Evan coming out of the smoke, and the "morning light" in his hand was already damaged. All of the wounds were wounded by fine gold, and the blade became jagged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
