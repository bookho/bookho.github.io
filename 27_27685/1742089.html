			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a whole night, by the dawn of the morning, the earth element warriors reunited and stood in front of everyone. Siegel stepped forward and beat the rock that made up his body with the knuckles. "It’s exactly the same as last night, it seems to be completely reorganized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a miracle!" Dwarf Runner Taklin praised. They are like the explorers who discovered the fine gold veins, and their eyes are full of knowledge. When their big hands touched the earth elements, the power of the dwarf runes was triggered and turned into silver-colored letters floating on the body surface. "Siegel Master, you must have noticed that it is these runes that guarantee the stability of the earth's body, so that it maintains a stable structure and does not disintegrate due to excessive expansion."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, read a spell, ordered the earth element to open his chest and show the core. "You see, the core of the summoning device continues to attract the energy of the earth's elements. But when it has a thick layer of rock outside, the rate of absorption will slow down, eventually balancing the absorption and consumption." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, you are right!" The dwarf Rune Master became respectful, "a self-recovering earth element warrior, this will change the times!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and said modestly to the dwarfs: "This technique is not so good. Someone must be proficient in magic and runes at the same time. But you also know that dwarves It's hard to learn magic, and other races can't use the runes. You can't let every magician climb the Morro of the Mora, and get the blessing of the dwarf patron, then cast this spell?" The dwarves smiled and their beards shook with a smile: "Master Siegel Master, don't be too extravagant. Success is always gradual, never a glimpse. Be patient, just like a gem, It will take a long time in the soil to finally emit a ray of light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel bends and bows: "You are right."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new combination spell is named "Siegel's Elemental Guard" and became his first homemade magic. In order to make this spell more applicable, Siegel and the dwarf rune are constantly improving. In the end, they thought of the method of embedding the runes on the earth elemental instrument, so that the mage without the rune ability can also cast this spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of implement can be made by our dwarves." The Runners said with a smile: "I think the price of 30,000 gold coins is a good start." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three thousand?" Siegel stunned. "The manufacturing cost of this device is only..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf waved. Shaking his head with a smile: "Although the earth elements created are not strong, the benefits are that they can be regenerated continuously. As long as there is the power of the earth around it, it can be reused. We have helped the lion king Alexander of the Mage Federation to create it. Iron Golem, know how valuable a powerful warrior can faithfully guard the Master. Siegel. At this point you have to believe us, 30,000 gold coins are not expensive at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I listen to you, Elinte's friend is my friend." Siegel also laughed: "This is really a good deal."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf runeman Taklin eyebrows lightly pick it up and then asks: "What do we do below?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel touches the chin . He has been working in the spell lab for seven days, and he is physically and mentally exhausted. He believes that the dwarves are the same. But in his heart, this spell is still flawed. "This spell can't be done without the help of the dwarf Rune Master. It's not easy to do this now. But if the dwarves can't use this spell, then I think everything is meaningless. Now Let's stick to it and see if we can think of a way to let the runemen drive this instrument."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words touched the dwarves, so four The dwarf runesman came up in turn to greet Siegel. Then they are jointly invested in the research. Since the young mage is not very knowledgeable about the runes, this time he is more assisted. When the dwarf clerk draws the rune map, Siegel will sit quietly on one side, ignite the pipe, let the smell of incense emanate from the nostrils, quietly think and try to absorb knowledge. They painted a lot of sheepskin rolls, each of which was a little better than the previous one. Siegel continued to draw nutrition from their debates and enriched their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, before the end of his death, Faranis Baker would like to establish a magic laboratory in Heimchu to preserve the research results of the Masters Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to draw God. The curtain of the tent was opened, and it was not known whether it was a sunrise or a sunset. The glare of the light was almost flat inside the tent filled with smoke. Siegel thought about the orientation of the curtain, knowing that it was the sun rising from the east - it was a whole night's work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His knight followed Moore and came in with a breakfast in his silver plate. Siegel couldn’t remember what he had eaten yesterday. He saw the ham omelet, roast chicken and oatmeal bread in the plate, and only felt hungry in the belly. Poor Moore was smoky with smoke, his eyes still shed tears. When he didn't find his lord in what position, Siegel had waved his wand and moved the food on the plate to the table in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mor, is there anything to drink?" Siegel chewed the breakfast and only felt dry: "Go, give me some wine." Come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult," Moore blocked his chest with a plate, as if it were a shield. "Fee... Mr. Fitzker asks you to go to the castle." At the construction site, there are some important things that need to be...you need to decide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, does he say this?" Siegel speeds up the meal, nor does it What kind of wine is waiting. Fitzkack must have something important, otherwise he will not bother to Siegel who is learning magic. At this time, he discovered that his beard had been half-finger, and the greasy chicken and the pieces of the fried egg stick to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly realized, "How long have I been out in the tent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s been half a month, adult." Moore whispered: "Since the last time you made the giant, the moon has become rounded from the ruin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Hey. It seems that you have read a lot of books recently, including the Pan-Continental Travel Notes? You can already use the sentences inside, and the progress is not small." Siegel said with a smile: "You tell Ferza Ke, I will go to the castle site to wait for him. By the way, I will go to Janet. I want a can of good liqueur for her, I really need to moisturize the scorpion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol nodded and ran out with his legs. Siegel hurriedly finished eating things, then gave birth to magical flames in his palm and took his beard off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study focused on magic made him forget the flow of time. When he observed the world outside with his eyes again, he was shocked by their changes. The castle has already taken shape, and the outer walls and gates have been erected, and the occupied area of ​​the building has been set. Within the city walls, the foundation has been dug, and the "Siegel's Earth Element" is under the command of the Raven, helping the dwarf artisans to level the ground. On the other side of the site, you can see a brick factory that smokes smoke and a blacksmith shop that spits on Mars. Siegel felt that there was a smart voice in his ears: the bellows screaming, the hammers, and the piling. He stretched his limbs hard and walked to his castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Lord Lord!" Someone greeted him from time to time. Siegel also smiled and returned. From the perspective of the people's temperament, they have done a good job recently. The Mora has a steady stream of food, so that all those who work hard can eat enough. Even the half-orcs who make the most effort every day look strong, and the muscles in their arms swell faster than the bread that puts the yeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s castle is a simple rectangle that extends from the two turrets of the main castle, encircling the future stables, armor, wells and barracks stand up. If there is a need in the future, you can continue to build the outer wall and use the access bridge that crosses the city to connect the inner and outer walls for military use. An empty space of about thirty meters square was left in the courtyard of the castle. By the time the castle main is about to be completed, Siegel is ready to build his own magic laboratory here. Now it is only going to the construction of the underground part, and the planned storage room, cell and drainage system will be completed first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel whistle, Raven Baron flew back happily. Parked on the back of his hand. The bird has grown bigger and smarter. He can give orders to the summoned earth elements like Siegel. So on the construction site, there was a strange sight of the dwarf talking to the birds and the birds talking to the earth. When Siegel and the Raven looked at each other for a while, they knew the important things that happened in the territory during this period of time—although only the part that the magic pet knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed daddy soon arrived. He held several reels under his arm and carried the gray robes across the mud. "Lord Lord. Sorry to call you out, but there are certain things that you need to decide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
