			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the inspected navy from being an orc warship, especially far from being attacked by a trebuchet or a bow, Siegel will be deployed after approaching the deep waters of the city. Illusion magic, printed on the huge sails marked by the Masters Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method worked. Several sea-going vessels hired by Deepwater City - according to Siegel's gaze, clearly the pirate ship of the past - did not immediately launch an attack, but asked after approaching. In order to avoid misunderstanding, the Orcs did not show up under the deck, only the humans in the original slaves were on the ship's side. After Siegel negotiated with several ships, he chose a seemingly honest person, the captain of the Silver Mermaid, who hired him to return early and return to Deepwater with a paddle boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war seems to have not yet burned to this affluent city, but refugees can be seen everywhere to escape the scourge. Many places in the lower city have been overcrowded, so the dock area has also opened up many warehouses and stacking yards as the place where they live. In the face of war, it is very rare to be able to open the gates for refugees to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood at the bow and looked far away at the refugees’ residence in the port, where there were only a few cigarettes, but the flow of people waiting in line for the meal was very It is very long. Different from Siegel’s expectations, the order is well-organized. Everyone advances in advance, and there is no competition. Everyone’s face is more hope than anxiety. This is rarely seen in wars, at least Siegel has never heard of such a thing. I remember that when I left Deepwater City, the price of food had started to rise, and Mrs. Dipp also reminded Siegel to prepare some food to deal with the crisis. Is the sea passage restored? Siegel subsequently denied this idea because he did not see a large grain cargo ship in the dock area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paddle sailboat lost its meaning after arriving in Deepwater City, and neither the Siegel nor the refugees needed the ship. Captain Coquetté wants to buy the ship, just to make his brother a captain, and the two form a small boat team to make money together. He offered 20,000 gold coins and wanted to try his luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will not be fooled, his life on the boat may be longer than the young Captain of the front. The sailboat that Siegel snatched was an excellent offshore warship with a full angle of impact, all paddles and flexible steering. What it lacks is nothing but a small trebuchet and a heavily armed sailor. Even in peacetime, a warship of this kind would have to sell 25,000 gold coins, and the price of such things would only rise in wartime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After bargaining. Looking at the one-time payment of cash, the ship eventually sold for 25,000 gold coins. The refugees on each ship are divided into 5 gold coins for use as emergency reserves. The remaining 18,000 gold coins were handed over to Fitzk, and he was responsible for everyone’s wear and tear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is like all refugees. I only got 5 gold coins, which he strongly requested. This behavior made Fyzak very admire, he thought that Siegel is a loyal jazz. Before disembarking, he kneels in front of Siegel, hoping to send his children to the Baron. Be a follower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My two sons have already become a family. If they have children of the appropriate age, please accept the adult as a follower." Fazak said with a low head. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First help to settle the refugees on board, then take it with you when you go home, I will choose one of them." Siegel stopped In the footsteps, watching Fazak said: "I try to teach you my descendants as much as my knight tutor taught me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you adults." One-eyed The old man said excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was the first to step down the ramp, he took the baron’s ring and identification and put the Prince Aaron’s will ready. To win a resident right for half-orcs. To his surprise, it was. On the dockside of the dock, a backbone member of the Mage Federation, a middle-aged mage Akzi who once told Siegel about the spell analysis is waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Faranes-Cresto has foreseen your arrival, and I am here to meet you." He took the lead and touched his eyebrows with his right hand. A mage ceremony, Siegel quickly repaid. "Welcome home, Mr. Siegel. Squid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really embarrassing to have trouble running around yourself, and the attention of the bachelor’s scholars makes me flattered. Although the time spent in the federation was not long, and then the long-term action was in the wild, but the guest between the wizards, Siegel did not forget clean. “What are the instructions in the Federation?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head. Said: "I am sorry, but I still need to settle the refugees on board. There are many half-orcs. If they can't coordinate with local officials, they are likely to be arrested and sentenced as enemies."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akeqi Master brows slightly wrinkled, then stretched out again. Being invited by a bachelor's degree is an excellent opportunity for a wizard. Can enhance the learning of magic and the accumulation of knowledge. Few people will refuse and delay, and Siegel, who is still an apprentice mage, is the lowest of the rejecters. Master Akti fears that this will cause the dissatisfaction of the bachelor's degree, and even affect his own evaluation in his heart. However, at this time, the voice of the bachelor's master crossed the distance between the federation and the port area, and echoed between the two mages, so that they could understand: "Siegel, come here to me. Akzi, you will squid After the transfer, I will arrange the refugees on board according to what he said. I remember that the Alexander Lion had a house in the northern area. He did not live in the house, and there were no relatives. You placed them there. Some people asked if they asked. It is the action of the Mage Federation, and it must not be obstructed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Akti hurriedly nodded, and Siegel also voluntarily expressed his gratitude. Just in case, he gave the prince's will to Mana for safekeeping. After all, this is the only person who has sworn allegiance to him. Then he gently supported Akzi's shoulder and asked him to transfer himself to the Three Peaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Transmission can only be here, you go up as soon as possible. The bachelor is on the ninth floor of the heart tower." Akzo no expression, always Very serious: "I will complete the squad's entrustment and arrange the things on board. You can rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel bends and bows, heartfelt Say: "It’s bothering you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Three Peaks Tower is no different from leaving, still looks majestic and calm. The heart tower is a place for meditation and rest, and it is always comfortable and quiet. The soft, immortal flame provides long-lasting illumination, with sofas and cushions for rest and relaxation. There is always a coffee table next to the sofa that prevents the fruit bowl and the light fruit wine. Several invisible servants wear the vests used to display the orientation and fly back and forth in the air to clean the ash in the small dish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carpets and tapestries here all have the effect of absorbing sound, so the entire tower will not have any echo. Siegel saw no one on the spiral ladder, and the bachelor's bachelor was very anxious, so he ran quickly in three steps and two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two rooms on the ninth floor, but all belong to the Bachelor Faranes. One is his private library and laboratory, and the other is his rest room. Siegel came to the two doors, but did not know which door should be knocked. While hesitating, the door leading to the rest room opened, and the voice of the bachelor’s voice came from inside: "Come here, Siegel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Room The decor is very simple, with only a single bed, sofa, recliner and coffee table, but these are fine. Faranis sat in a recliner with a thick blanket that allowed the afternoon sun to shine on the white beard. Compared with the last time I met, the bachelor's degree is even older. His skin is slack and his wrinkles are deeper; his lips are dry and he is slightly bluish; his eyes are swollen and he is tired and tired; he slowly raises his hand and can see his fingers still. Trembling - For the Master, this is a state of fatality when casting spells. Only the bachelor's voice is still steady. He pointed to the sofa and said, "Sit down, Siegel, I have something to say to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Sit down, but I feel very nervous. After all, the old man in front of him is one of the three giants of the Masters Federation. He is one of the three men who won the bachelor's title in the entire New and Old World. He is proficient in spells, tactics, alchemy, divination and strategy, and is regarded as the most intelligent of the deep water city. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Squid, are you still okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bachelor, I am very good "Siegel responded. He looked at the old man's eyes and then saw his old and weak hand. The fingers are constantly shaking, like the branches shivering in the cold wind, even the last leaf has abandoned this dying body. "How are you, Bachelor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very weak, uncomfortable." Faranese said: "I feel my magic is losing, and my Life has also disappeared. But before I say this, can you help me to ignite the pipe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pipe made of bronze floats over and hangs on it There are small pockets of tobacco, but there is no fire. It stopped in front of Siegel and then slowly fell. The mage understands that this is testing his magical control, so he does not reach out to pick it up, but uses a spell to exert control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
