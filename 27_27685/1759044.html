			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens when a mage without a spellcast effect is close to the warrior? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wuke penetrated Felton's chest with a giant sword and then stabbed it from behind. The chief disciple of Casper’s sergeant died under the siege of Heim’s leading heroes. His body gradually became smaller and eventually shrank into a middle-aged man with deep eyelids, dry muscles, and thin, long-term malnutrition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is his true face," Siegel said after looking at it: "I have to say, plus the need to maintain the southern lord Felton. Appearance, he can maintain three kinds of local deformation at the same time, it really is very powerful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarf Locke shook his head, wiped the blood on his beard with his hand, and then said "This is purely a path of evil! I have seen more monsters and more kills. How can he change again? But it is opportunistic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Siegel is undecided. Masters who are proficient in the Department of Change are either very ordinary or strong. The sorcerer in front of him just set foot on the road to the strong. Dwarf Locke is right, this is indeed an opportunistic approach - the power of the Master is to create, to open up the path that the predecessors did not, rather than simply imitating. It is true that there are countless examples of learning that can be learned in a strange creature, but the re-image of the deformation cannot exceed the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the other hand, the dwarf Locke’s words are not right. When the wizard can become a dragon, become a Titan, or can be transformed into an angel and a demon, such a body plus the ability to cast spells, almost irresistible. So there are a lot of changes in the strengthening of the Master, and in the Masters Federation, influenced by the travel collector William **, the proportion of Masters studying the Department of Change is higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have a number of advantages, he was besieged and killed. As a mage, he is already very good." Siegel said: "This way The enemies still have a lot in the Knox Association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like the metamorphosis?" Locke’s mouth slammed and spit on the ground: " I don't like my own blood, I want to pretend to be like other monsters, I really can't understand these metamorphosis ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves Liya came forward, she The longbow in his hand has never been relaxed. There is always a feather arrow on the string. "Siegel, what about the coalition forces of the southern lords?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already thought about it." Siegel said: "Take all the items on him." Take it away, then send the body back. I am afraid that the southern lords need time to digest the facts at hand and tell them that I will negotiate with their new representative at noon. This thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his companions around him. There is no suitable messenger. Siegel shook his head helplessly and said, "I still do this thing myself. They don't dare to treat me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is Be careful," said Elf Leah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼克 squeezed the sore shoulder and finally found the opportunity to say: “Can I be responsible for finding the spoils?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel patted his shoulder and smiled and nodded. Then guide Mike to find valuable and easy to use things. "The speller armor I will stay for a while, study it. It looks like the craft of the elf, is the master of Lia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves shake Shaking his head, saying that he doesn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with the outer casing, the cock prefers the claws and teeth. The Orc first picked up Felton's long sword and found that it was only a fine product, and was crushed by Siegel's star dust, revealing the hidden wand inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is actually a root wand," Siegel said, coming over, and then said to Mike: "You want a good weapon. I will help you make one." The handle, the sword of the long sword can be. You see, there are messengers coming over there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Southern Coalition, a rider holds a white flag against the duel Come from the field. He wore a tight leather armor and did not bring any weapons on his body or saddle. This is a messenger used to communicate with each other during the war. Segal held his long sword and waited quietly for him to come. At the same time, Zucker used his big hand to touch every pocket of the body. "Maybe he has a space bag, there are treasures in the bag!" he thought optimistically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lord of the lord, I am speaking on behalf of the coalition forces of the southern lords." The young man said: "The duel is over, please don't slay the body of the deceased."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel shook his head and responded: "This is not a duel, but a meticulously planned killing. I am the only mage lord in the New World. I don't know if this person who fought with me really has the status of a lord. Take your sword when you go back. Let the lords look at the hidden wand inside, and then think about what kind of person is going to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No matter what the enemy, a knight should play a good moral role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You swear that I am not at home, bring soldiers to attack me Wife, threatening my unborn child, what good morality is said?" Siegel tightly caught the other's eyes and suppressed the emotion of the messenger, and the other party quickly lost. The messenger was pale, and several times involuntarily touched the empty belt. His weapons were left in the camp, and nothing could bring him comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Among you, is anyone still qualified to talk to me?" Siegel said: "Your coalition, there is still no unity. Command? Or find a brain that is smart enough to understand what I am going to say? Peace or war in the South will be decided in the next time. I can only admit one: "I still have time, roll!" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will convey this matter." The messenger looked at Siegel reluctantly and tried to lift his head. The dwarf snorted and touched his shiny head and slammed the hammer. The young messenger thought he would be attacked and quickly stepped back two steps. This poor performance made the lords of the Southern Allied Forces stunned, and pessimistic emotions began to spread like diseases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lord coalition hopes to return to Felton’s body and bury him. Anyway, he has fought for the interests of the southern lords, there should be Tombs and inscriptions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, this is a sorcerer disguised as Felton. His purpose is to provoke the Southern Alliance and my fight. If you still can't see this, it's a problem with your brain, or it's still a fool who is being tempted. And it's not a good choice to be buried in the soil, unless you have the ability to get rid of the curse. Otherwise his body is best. Cremated.” Siegel deliberately scared him: “Mage who is proficient in change can use a variety of means, and the deformed body may also cause damage after death, such as poisons, plagues or curses. If you can handle it, then I have no objection. Buried. Otherwise it is better for me to do it. However, you can send someone to check the body of the deceased and verify if I am telling the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes, but I can’t do this in the cremation. Only to the lords to decide. "Knight nodded and bowed slightly to Siegel. Then get on at the fastest speed and turn around. The half-orc smiled at the figure he left, and he had finished searching and showing things to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He doesn't have a space bag, and he doesn't bring a spell spell on his body." Siegel said: "Maybe these things are among the southern coalitions, hope." I have a chance to come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible?" Elf Lia shook her head and felt incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We need to perfect the death curse. If all goes well, the sorcerer's things will be ready." Siegel replied while checking him. Items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is a worn ring. But the spell power contained above is extremely powerful. Siegel recognizes that this is a magical item used to cast a rainbow light ball. It only needs to be continually swayed with fingers, and can be activated according to the text on the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a good thing," Siegel said. "Let me study it and see if it can improve its effectiveness, and then leave it to Janet. This I picked the things first, and the rest of you came first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These things I have left are useless." The dwarf Locke said: "I have the hands. The weapon and the armor on the body are enough. Let's divide it slowly. I will go back first. The beer at the Shield River Bar is calling me, if it is reserved for the novices and rookies. It will definitely cause a fight."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he put his hammer on his shoulder and swayed into the tunnel. It saves distance from the ground, but he still likes the feeling of underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
