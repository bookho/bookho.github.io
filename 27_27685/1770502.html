			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s snowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heam collar is located in the southern part of the New World, but snow is not uncommon, there are always one or two times a year. However, this year's snow is exceptionally spectacular, and it has been overwhelming since midnight, and the ground has been covered with a thick layer in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A thick feather quilt." Siegel said to Janet early in the morning. "If it is normal, I will say that this snow is a good harvest for the coming year, but now this snow is really not the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet is holding Isaac, While feeding, he said, "What's wrong, is this snow still irritating you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jennis's truck team can't act well." Siegel replied Tao: "No matter how careful planning can not cover the traces of nature, the elves will find their whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jenice is very smart, not here. When I was on the road, Janet comforted him: "The snow in the south will always be, and the territories will last - at least longer than the trucks have been in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right." Siegel waved his wand to make the fire in the fireplace warmer and no longer war-related. This time is a rare and precious time, no one will bother to disturb, so that the lord family can take a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the lord of Siegel, the residents of Heim are very fortunate. Although there was war in the winter, the loss of the field was heavy, but there were no disastrous consequences. It is said that the lord negotiated with the elves in order to make everyone have something to eat. The elf seems to be very worried about the name of Hegel, who was slammed by Siegel’s “One-Day War” and had to agree to a temporary truce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine of the elves and the meat and milk that "do not know where to come from, must not be from the other side of the walled mountain", were distributed by the lord according to the head. Coupled with some food, everyone found that this winter is not sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to food, in the winter of the year, everyone worried about whether the winter wood is enough. This year, I was surprised to find that the room was not as cold as before. Many times, even if it is snowy outside, there is no need to ignite inside the house, and everyone only needs to wear thick clothes to endure. Many people are curious to go around. There is no feeling of heat on the wall or the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of a Siegel spell test. In order to establish the magic equipment assembly line as soon as possible, he constantly improved the elemental rune matrix of the territory. In addition to adding some energy focusing lenses and the function of the "battery" of the inflammatory soul crystal, he began to try to use the mutual transformation between elemental and plasma energy to change the surrounding environment and generate energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first benefit is the "heating" system. The elemental array releases a portion of the fire element slowly every day. Heat the air inside the territorial house so that everyone can enjoy the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the effect of the entire castle covering element is not yet achieved, and the aggregation of elements in the non-closed space has not yet been resolved. Siegel found that every time he made progress, he would lead to new problems. The study of magic seems to be endless, and he must now concentrate. Put the unrelated questions on hold and complete the most urgent things first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I went to the lab." Siegel said: "If there is something in the territory, inform the raven."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kissed his wife and children, tightly collared, and walked out of the castle. Snowflakes are flying, this is a wonder of the earth. I have never seen snow on the sea for so many years, and I can only see this white landscape when I am close to the port and land. Now, snow, the earth, the castle and the magic have become a familiar part of his life. In the courtyard, the snow is already deep. A whispered coat was put on the shoulders of the patrolling soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weather, everyone else is resting, only the soldiers are still walking around. Zucker trained them very well, in full accordance with the standards of the War of the Northern Walls, cruel, harsh and unsympathetic. Some knights think that such a practice is not kind enough, and even find Siegel for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel remembers saying this at the time: "The elf has been staring at us, I dare not reveal any flaws, what about you?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers can't refute. Then Siegel let them stare at Zucker: "Severe training can be, but abuse is not acceptable." This matter has set the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding snow was blown away and then slammed together. Siegel succeeded in transforming water and gas elements. The next step is to try to turn the gas element into a fire element. If it is a change cycle that can form four elements, it will have a subversive effect on the magic spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just go on this road. It is inevitable to be able to stay in the history of Qing Dynasty and become a famous teacher. Siegel smiled and chilled his hands. This matter has to be long-term, and it is still focused on making plasma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped into the courtyard and walked to the entrance to the basement opposite. The boots left a deep hole in the soft white snow surface, and the chill crawled down the boot. Then he uses the pace of the elves, and then he won't get so deep and will not make any sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw another row of footprints also leading to the basement, a pointed soft boot. The footprints are shallow, and it seems that its owner is very light; it should be an adult from the distance of the footprints. Who has the same genius martial arts skills? The guards of the castle can only step out the deep and dirty holes. Is it that the elves are coming in? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel immediately took out his wand, and the entire array of territories began to vibrate, and the elements of power gathered on him. Just like unfolding a pair of wings made up of four elements, Siegel flies through the courtyard, with layers of shadows passing through the entrance to the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor of the basement, the konjac and their assembly line, must not let the elves discover! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiral stairs cover the line of sight, and Siegel cannot use any door to reach directly. But the elemental wings allowed him to fly like a gas element, and he rushed down with a huge wind pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not allowed to go in!" The voice of the konjac was clearly audible, and then Siegel heard the ping-pong. When Duo often sorts out his square metal body, he often makes such a voice. Did he receive an attack? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel finally landed, and he saw a man in gray dress kicking out the two toes. The konjac keeps spinning in the air, making a long-sounding scream "Ah..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master did not waste time shouting "Stop" and so on, a lightning strike The man in the gray robe. The light of the lightning illuminates the darkness around him, and the person perceives the light, so he turns his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s actually a Capricorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a look of surprise on the face of the dragon girl, and the big eyes that are moving are very innocent. Siegel stunned, but it was too late to take back the spell. Just listen to the bang. Lightning accurately hits Capricorn, and the elemental power of the cockroach blasts her hair and clothes and dances in the air. However, the dragon's own powerful magical resistance made her only take a step and did not suffer any harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second mutter fell to the ground. Then he climbed up and rubbed the flattened body with his hands, and the ping-pong sound again and again. He walked over his slender legs and twisted and said, "You are not allowed to go in. Siegel will be angry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems There is nothing wrong with konjac. What can you do with Moss? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon girl looked at Siegel, some confused and said: "You know that lightning magic has no effect on me, why do you still use this? I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing here?" Siegel said: "You don't see the warning sign outside, you should also know that there are multiple layers of spells here. Protection, it is not allowed to enter casually."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn lifted his arm and grabbed his hair as if he was making a strong reason. Her eyes lit up and she quickly said, "I am sleeping, I heard it squeaking, so I will come over and see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are silent runes here. How can there be a sound?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our dragon is better than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a silent rune..." Siegel shook his head and grinned, knowing that she would have been humbling in this matter, and had to change a question: "How did you get down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am good at invisibility, your detection runes can't be seen!" Capricorn said proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
