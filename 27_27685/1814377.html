			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf Anna’s ability to cast spells is not strong, because she is only a mage apprentice to the Elven Forest Art Institute, even fireball Not mastered. Her heart is full of curiosity in seeking knowledge, full of embarrassment for progress and a desire for knowledge. It was just a sudden landslide that took her body and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of the elf big prophet Na An Lina found her, and took away the soul of Anna with the magic soul pot. When Naina Lin was born to Lear, she placed Anna's soul into her original body and threw it into the Magic Academy as a hidden ambush. Encourage students to suspicion each other, increase the difficulty of their survival, and ensure that there is always an empty position to spare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In exchange, she can learn the magic that she had in her body, she can see the novel world, she can continue to "live." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the green death finger hits the forehead, she is surprised that the so-called living is just an illusion, there is no free will to live and structure What is the difference between decoration? Death is not terrible because she has already died once in a landslide. Only this time she hopes that she will not live anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one was there to help her, even Siegel didn't move. His eyes were all on Lear, and there was not even a single concern. Anna sighed and then was shrouded in darkness, knowing nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't try to stop it." Lear's body began to become solid, which also meant that he gradually entered the magic school. "You can really get down, it's a good progress!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't save her." Siegel said calmly: "I can't Instantly cracking the protective spell on her, it is impossible to prevent her from committing suicide. The only way to have a chance is to use anti-magic force field around her, at least to suppress the way of death by spell. Down? You will still order her to kill herself. In the end, she can only exacerbate her pain in one trial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this explanation, gnome Ke Ke Look down. He thought about it carefully, and although it was emotionally difficult to accept, Siegel said it was true. The murderer is undoubtedly the old mage, listening to Siegel's meaning he is called Lear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You better not mix me with him." Siegel said to the gnome: "Whether or not we two have won, the one who survives It won't hurt you. You are just a mage to learn, and there is no ambition for what we want to fight for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille also nodded, gnome Said: "Siegel is right, you are just an irrelevant role, now you have the opportunity to retire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not forgotten You want to kill me before!" The gnome said loudly: "Since then, you are my enemy! I see it now, your spell is much stronger than me, but I am not bad!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out the necklace from his chest and threw it off and threw it on the floor. Along with the hum of the gears and the harsh metal friction, the four-armed magic statue with dark yellow gold luster emerged. It is five times taller than Siegel, and its width is amazing. It is like a high wall in front of the gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Golden Golem is a rare thing. The whole multiverse is nothing but two hands. What kind of golem do you find from the corner? Lear saw the essence of this golem at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All magical immunity, its melee ability is second only to the legendary creature hundred-armed giants - the latter attack more times, but not as heavy as the fine gold golem fist. Absolutely obedient characteristics and the development of the ultimate fighting body make the Golden Golem one of the most powerful works in the structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It won't fly, this is a fatal flaw." Lear said: "The wizard can be perfect, but all the manufactured items are connected to perfection. You can't do it. You still have a lot to go, and a lot of things need to be learned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time he has become a full entity, flying in midair. "I am very confident, Siegel, and still have the spirit of knight? You have not attacked, what are you waiting for? This is not a mage duel, I will not salute you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think more, Lear." Siegel shook his head. "I have no idea of ​​stopping you from coming in. From Anna, I understand one thing, that is, you can't appear at the same time. In two places. As long as you are here, then you will not go to Heim, I will have no worries. If you try to leave now, I can also know how to get out. You feel my understanding to see your actions, can Can't I learn immediately?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I win, I will make sure that you don't reappear." Siegel nodded slightly, believing: "I won't be merciful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lear will not naturally. The first thing he did was to communicate with the School of Magic and modify the rules here so that all activities without their own intelligence are not allowed to appear. The magic tower shines brightly, and the power of the magic is spread out. The power of the rules is similar to that of the legendary spell, but it is more complicated and solid. Siegel narrowed his eyes and felt it as he passed through his power. He also has the body of the saints and has been able to capture the most subtle changes in the kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly the same as the one that Chanem said. As a consumable of the war of the gods, the saints are used to find out the rules of the other gods and find out the loopholes that can be exploited. Therefore, the saints have a keen sense of the beginning of the design, and have considerable expertise in this respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the rules, even the Golden Golem is suppressed, and the necklace is returned to the neck of Ke Ke. His Mithril Golem troops also changed back to a silver ball. However, the more affected are the Sigel's elemental regiments, which are not intelligent, so they cannot be summoned at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred power of Siegel caused Lear to narrow his eyes. "When did you become a saint? Which god dared to violate the contract of the gods, Are you under the door?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new saints did not answer this question, but suggested in a sincere language: "You will demonstrate it several times, I am already trying to figure out the rules here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie!" Lehr shouted. He exerts his strength again, and the magic tower shines again: "The effect of the combination of the banned elements, each spell can only be composed of one element!" Siegel's Lord of the Rings began to heat up, and the position of the fire was more and more certain. However, Siegel's focus has always been on the power of the rules, and the fire is only a matter of time after the victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you worried about my elemental aggregate?" Siegel smiled. "I understand, you can only ban the power you know, or the power recorded in the magical priesthood. There is no record of elemental aggregates in the library, so you can only block the mix of elements. But you understand the wrong, the aggregate It's not a mixture of elements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of flames appeared at Siegel's fingertips and then split into four identical flames. One of them remained unchanged, and the remaining three were converted into cyclones, dust and water columns. The four elements re-engage together, they are born from the same root, and there is no mixed concept. The four-pulse arrow leaps at the fingertips of Siegel. With it as a seed, it only needs to constantly replenish the energy of any kind of element. The four-pulse arrow can be repeated and attack the enemy constantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your presentation, it turned out to be like this." Lear smiled and waved his sweat on his forehead and continued to stir the power of the rule: "The ban The elements are transformed into each other!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not allowed!" Siegel screamed and suddenly shot at this time. The sacred power of his body burst into a flash of light, with the power of the legendary spell seed "dissipating", blocking Leer's command. The two forces are killing each other and the two orders cancel each other out. The fire in the magic tower shook, and was indifferent because it did not receive a clear command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Lear was amazed. This is clearly the way of God's war. How did Siegel use it? The elves have reported that Sage and the sacred slayer are in the School of Magic, but where is he, are they hiding to prepare for a fatal blow? Siegel can learn the skills of the war, must be taught by him, and two people have formed a stable alliance? This is a big bad news. We must spare no effort to deal with possible emergencies, and we must not allow the sacred murderer to take advantage of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome only knows that all his corps can not be used, this time he finally understands the level of this battle, so he put away the magic ball on the ground. Run away. Lear did not stop him because he knew that any action on the gnome would give Siegel an opportunity to attack. Now Siegel doesn't need to worry about Heim's collar, and there is no need to learn how to block the rules. Any flaws represent a constant attack and a deadly attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must go all out and be as focused as possible. Lear descended slowly from the air until he was down to earth. Flying will increase mobility, but it will also give the enemy more offensive direction. It would be fine if only Siegel would fall, but the Holy One of the murder god did not know where to look at it, how can he not let Leer worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a place, Elf Anna will not have to die, and the number will naturally have an advantage. Lear frowned and realized that he had fallen into Siegel’s plan. It is not that people who are more familiar with the kingdom of God master the rules, but those who know more about the opponent and can prepare in advance to set up the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
