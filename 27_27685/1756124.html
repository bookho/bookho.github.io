			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a trial, Siegel learned that the weapon of Nexus is powerful, but it also has its weaknesses. It consumes a lot and needs constant energy supply. The pattern on Siegel's body quickly dimmed, and then the mace in his hand became an ordinary steel weapon, and there was no tyrannical destructive power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding magical energy is converted into plasma, slowly adding to Siegel's body. He can't stop this supplement, but he won't feel uncomfortable. Putting down the mace, Siegel returned to the initial position of the production line with the konjac, ready to watch it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the huge roar of the machine, Siegel looked at the manufacturing process of the weapons over and over until they were all printed in their heads. Such an effort was not ineffective, and he gradually discovered the laws in the runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look directly at the finished product, those complicated, uninteresting lines simply don’t understand, but if you learn from it through the manufacturing process, The order of manufacture can reveal its secrets. Nass engraved the runes under the surface of the object, which contained the abyss and the celestial language, and then changed it in a twisted and pictographic manner, and cleverly used the lines to cover up and concatenate. On the surface of the item, only the line segments that do not cross each other can be seen, and the runes below are not visible at all. To disassemble the line, it will destroy the rune below and still cover the secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nass is doing something that is almost impossible to accomplish, and the application level of Rune and Magic Array technology is very high. However, such a precise structure can only allow electric energy to pass through. The four basic elements of water, fire, wind and earth are tangible and qualitative, and cannot directly act on the rune line, and must be transformed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel understands the secrets of their runes, but he knows that he can't do the same precision as Nens. Just as dwarves use runes, although they are all the same character, different dwarves have different styles in their portrayal. Minor differences can make a big difference. The style of Nexus is small and hidden. Siegel can copy these runes, but he can't make it so small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Zegel is to make a complicated rune on a hammer, he needs to use a mountain to describe it. But if someone can wield a mountain, it will soon be able to reach the strength of the soldiers. Why do you need a rune? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, as long as they try to cut off the resistance of the soldiers to the weapons, they are not difficult to overcome. What kind of spell can be applied to such a small rune structure? Siegel remembers his spells and has begun to dissipate when he comes into contact with the golden body. This means that the Nethered spells will make other spells unstable. The more precise the spell, the more stable it is, and the more you want to manipulate the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is immersed in meditation, is there no other way than to be more subtle and smaller than Neckar? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly picked up the mace and carefully experienced the process of energy conversion. The energy stored in the body is absorbed. Then it will continue to replenish from the surroundings. If you stand on the plasma circuit, the speed of replenishment is very fast. If you are close to the sacred crystal, put your hand on the white line on the surface, and the lost energy can be filled almost immediately. At the beginning of the armor of the golden warrior, there must be a similar part, but it was all damaged in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is magical energy here, why not experiment? Siegel took the runestone and parchment from the space bag and experimented with his ideas step by step. His first thought was to isolate the electrical energy matrix, using the method of displacing elements to isolate the plasma. However, the equipment of Nexus is basically self-contained. The conversion of energy forms other than plasma is highly efficient, and elemental magic is either rejected or absorbed, making it difficult to interact. If Siegel’s Faction wants to take effect, it must maintain direct contact. This cannot be done in actual combat and can only be abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then tested the next method. An amber-like substance is used to isolate the rune lines of the gusset. If it can be mass-produced, it can block the scorpion warrior from absorbing the plasma energy from the surroundings. He thought of a clay monster. Or use a spray gun to wrap the enemy to block the energy supply. Siegel opened the alchemy matrix and constantly took raw materials from the surrounding for analysis. The results were disappointing, and the material contained in this material was so complex that it could not be resolved at his current level. This road is also nowhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the alchemy material back into the space bag and sat quietly on the floor. Although the roar of the surrounding machines was still deafening, but he was immersed in his mind, he could not hear the noise. The world of meditation is like a windless sea, calm and deep, allowing him to calm down. In the world of thought. Siegel constantly imagines various situations, makes bold assumptions, and patiently proves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very similar to the design of the Dragon and Lion Cliff Guardian Golem. Using the terrain and the magical array of interactions, the intruder must be able to fight against the Golem through melee. Siegel broke the designer's ideas through the severing platform, let them lose the pre-requisite advantage, and then solved the magic image by playing the power of siege weapons in the pre-set home field. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But want to use more advanced means to destroy the persexual rune system, which has studied thousands of years of technology? This is not something that can be done in a short time. It is necessary to change the way of thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sat on the floor like a sculpture, and the konjac two toes walked back and forth between manufacturing to satisfy their curiosity. It is very similar to the world in which he lived, mechanically, regularly, and unchanged. The roar around is a very pleasant music for him, only a little worse than those in the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, he also began to feel bored, and boredom would be a headache. In order to alleviate this feeling, he began to do all sorts of weird movements in front of Siegel, similar to dance, but more like a gust of wind, Sigel, who is contemplating, did not pay attention to him at all. Usually in meditation, the Raven Baron warned him to whistle, but now there is no such sentinel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the body of the undead to meditate is very dangerous, because it is difficult to escape from the state of meditation without physical needs. Hunger, thirst and fatigue are signs of physical self-protection and a warning before soul fatigue. In order to find a countermeasure as soon as possible Siegel forgot this in the roar. There is no change in the sun, the moon and the stars. The passage of time is hard to detect, so he sat motionless and did not know how long it took. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine that manufactures the mace is not always running. They are also constantly consuming the energy of the soul crystal, which is always a useful day. Nexus plundered in various worlds, just to supplement this consumption. The halo hieroglyphics extracts the power of the sacred soul crystal, making it smaller and smaller until it disappears. The gear has no driving force. The conveyor belt is no longer running, the steam stops, and everything is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge changes in the environment have finally awakened Siegel in meditation. He looked around and didn't know how long it had been, and he had long since lost the shadow of two tones. The surrounding light begins to dim and the machine needs to sleep, but it won't bother the undead with dark vision. At this time, Siegel noticed the base used to fix the sacred soul crystals, those hieroglyphics that were gradually dimming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Extracting the power of the sacred soul crystal and driving the machinery - why are these hieroglyphs on the base of the sacred soul crystal not tiny, hidden and line-like?" Siegel talked to himself and there was an idea in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the base where he placed the soul. Carefully observe and learn the role of this device. In order to be able to place the inflamed soul crystals of different sizes and shapes, the patterns of the runes and the weapons on the transform are two styles, and the same dragon language writings as the mage spells are used. Although this rune is still very complicated, it can be copied for Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use this rune to provide energy for the surrounding magic items," Siegel said to himself: "If it is used to drive the Golem, it can be greatly Reduce the cost of manufacturing, the same for other magic items. This can be applied in many places, it is a mechanical independent link."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Runes used by the Nagas warrior Self-contained, but this is independent. Like a sailing ship, it is a combination of different structures and systems, and any problem can lead to overall defeat. Since it is almost impossible to block the gas supply system of Nexus. Then increase their consumption? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic items do not actively consume energy, and must have the user to issue the correct order. Just like a flying cloak does not fly to the sky, there must be an order issued by the user. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but must it be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element Rune Guard breaks through the time limit of summoning elemental spells, using the dwarf's runes. But the final key to making this spell constant is the new illusion system of the gnome. It’s hard to surpass them in the old roads that have been going through countless years, but using the latest spell techniques, another way, may have unexpected effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the surrounding magical equipment needs energy, it will be extracted from the soul of the soul, which is the role of the device in the hands of Siegel. If it is deceiving it. What does it think is the need for an infinite supply of magical energy around it? Presumably, Yan Ling Jing will be quickly consumed. Increasing the range of absorption is like making a collection of elements from Heim's collar, and then consuming all the absorbed energy. As long as these energies are not provided to the Nethers, it is equivalent to cutting off their source of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
