			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky in the west is overcast, and the black magical skylight is densely covered with smoke. Numerous black columns of smoke hovered from hundreds of fire points and were absorbed by the spells made by Knox. The same fate was the grievances that Siegel released. Fireballs, acid rain and hail are constantly falling in the sky, and only the vicinity of the light column is safe. There are cries everywhere in the city of Macabu, most of which belong to slaves. As for the orcs who can pick up their weapons, when they face powerful magic, they will eventually succumb to the control of the power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three finals of the admiral did not know, he planned to go to the Beastmaster Hall, but he did not find him on the battlefield. At the same time, there were thousands of wolf cavalry and scorpion shooters who were originally stationed in the wood yard outside the city, but no one had seen them after the chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is not known. As he sailed to the East Ocean, the Akam Minaret was just showing its prototype, even with black eyesight. After a whole night, they finally came to the vast ocean, and the eastern sea level began to shine slightly, which also heralded the arrival of new hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can finally breathe a sigh of relief. Some refugees have come to the deck with excitement and are crying in the direction of the sea. Siegel let the paddler rest and take the long paddle back into the cabin. By the wind blowing from the west, the spinnaker just played a good function and was driving smoothly to the southeast with a big ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is very tired. He used a small number of spells this night, but there are many times that require precise control, causing him to consume a lot of energy. Now he wants to sleep a lot, but there is still a lot of work to be done on board, and some are hard to fake others. Zucker arranges the life of the refugees, counts the amount of food and water, and then distributes them. But this work is too difficult for him. Fazak, who was soon wounded with a wound, took over. He has been a grocery store owner for many years and has a lot of experience in counting supplies and distributing water. Mana is responsible for looking around, and any ship appears to report to Siegel. As for the Master himself. He is working with several gladiators to prepare to hang the mainsail on the mast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work originally required at least six skilled sailors to complete. And it is necessary to stop the boat. Siegel does not have such a good hand now, and can only use the slowest but most secure way to hang the sails, which will take several hours. He climbed up and down from the mast many times, and his agility was not lost in the past, but now he is awe, so there is no more cheers and good voices. For this, Siegel is somewhat lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun jumped out of the water, everyone was trying to pull the sail to the height with a rope. Fitzak limped. Take the basket and bring everyone's food to the deck. It is very simple to eat, only a few dry apples, with figs of oatmeal and a dried meat, can be washed into the stomach with red wine. Most people on board have eaten before the night, and now it is more sleepy than hunger. So everyone seldom talks, just after eating a few mouthfuls, they fall to the ground and sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t distribute so much food next time." Siegel’s one-eyed old man said: “All are distributed according to the lowest ratio. The people in the stone village have not sat. Boat, don't waste food in seasickness and vomiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Siegel." Fitzk replied: "I don't know Macabu. "It will become what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can probably guess it, but I don't want to say it." The mage said with some sadness: "Although this is an inevitable situation of war." But after all, there are too many deaths. While I am destroying the orcs, many human slaves are also involved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not your fault."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This of course I know." Siegel put the fig into his mouth and chewed it hard. "I don't think that the slave is created because of my fault, but I am somewhat annoyed that I have insufficient ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are already strong." Zach said: "You are the strongest young man I have ever seen. And I am knightly and willing to help the weak. Everyone on board can be rescued for your reasons. But how are you going to reset them? Most of them It is a half-orc, and Deepwater City will not accept these potential threats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people may choose to disembark in advance as long as I can find a place to dock. But there are others who have arrangements.” Siegel said: “I have a royal order, approved by Prince Aaron, issued by Count Todd, with the orders of half-orc soldiers and farmers. With this order, at least Deepwater City will temporarily I will accept everyone. As for the things that follow. What I lack now is the land where they can be placed. Maybe I can find a dwarf to help me, at least I know that Longshi Cliff is still uninhabited. Although it is desolate, it is always more than a tear. The original is much better "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Yes. Baron of the Starry Kingdom. I will not lie to you on this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak said quickly: "Sorry, adult, before me I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, everyone is living together in danger, don't be restrained." Siegel said: "You are a spy, I am a Sailor, isn't that good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My spy career can finally be over. After returning to Deepwater, I might open another grocery store. Continue to do this, after all, more than ten years." One-eyed old man said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't forget to help me smuggle something at that time, but don't even want to steal my wallet." Siegel was also joking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can no longer accept the smugglers, and finally I can be a real earner of the money, those things are still not good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-eyed dad can retreat and enjoy retirement, but Siegel has a long way to go, and his adventurous heart is still there. He also remembers that Janet, Sir Bill and Evan have been separated from them for too long, and they do not know how far the war is going. How about the jackdaw tribe and the giant Kerry on the prairie? Did the two-headed wolf’s iron ride find their trace? Siegel only hopes that they will be safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel finished eating the rice in his hand while continuing to sort out the sails and thinking about the plan. He estimated that if he was successful, he would arrive in Deepwater City from Macabu in about 12 days. After all, he burned the orc's shipyard, and he believed that neither the Masters' Federation nor the Masked Lord's Council could remain indifferent. Regardless of whether Deepwater City knows the current situation of Prince Aaron, whether to send troops to meet, Siegel is ready to rush to the Walled Mountains after the acquisition of the spell books and scrolls to find the whereabouts of Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is equivalent to a long way, and Siegel knows this very well, but still makes this choice. He can't leave these refugees ahead of time and choose to go ashore near the Walled Mountains. It can save a lot of time, but it will violate his conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conscience is a very heavy burden, but only by igniting this burden can it be a hero. When Siegel thought about it, he stepped up his work. After the magic, the hanging sail is much simpler than expected, especially after the activation rope spell that can be moved as desired. Under the control of Siegel, the rope became a flexible tentacle, as if several sailors who were skilled in this work were working at the same time. The people on the deck looked at it with admiration and lowered their voices. Normally, people rarely have access to the caster, so their fears gradually deepen and they will soon become obedient. This will make the whole journey a lot easier, at least Siegel doesn't have to spend too much time managing passengers. But deep inside the Master, he hopes that this obedience comes from love, not awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big sail is open, and the naughty wind is caught immediately, and the speed of the ship is gradually accelerated. The entire hull is also more balanced, no longer the undulating sway before. Siegel cleared a clearing under the mast and made a simple windbreaker with a box. Here is his territory for some time to come. Even if the cold winds of the winter sea are cold, the deck is even more difficult, but only Siegel can master the sails and heading, so this is his unshirkable responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana and Fitzak both advised him to go down the cabin, but the scorpion half-orc decided to accompany him. After learning about this situation, the refugees brought together a few of the thickest and warmest cloaks to send to Siegel. Da Dewa has a barrel of ale from the warehouse. It is the best dark brown ale, which can be used as a porridge. Dwarf has found a brazier and is responsible for collecting pieces of wood everywhere, so that there is always a heat source in the brazier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not just for you." Xiao Dewa said: "We just moved the kitchen here, don't mind."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real wilderness is impossible to learn the name "Yes, my adult", but Siegel does not mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is endless, Siegel grasps the direction of navigation according to the position of the sun, he chooses the route away from the coastline, so as to avoid the unscrupulous on the shore. Eyes can also avoid hidden reefs under water. But the biggest advantage is that you don't have to spend all your time adjusting the direction. He can calm down and read the magic book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not felt like this for a long time, it’s been nearly a year since he last took the boat. Returning to the ship, he had a long-lost familiar feeling that made him feel as comfortable and peaceful as a baby lying in his mother's arms. When it was near noon, the sky became very clear, and there was no longer any orc territory in the field of vision, nor the shadow of other sails. At this time, Siegel took out his wand and applied protective spells to himself. Then he let the Raven Baron whistle, and he finally got a good night's sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
