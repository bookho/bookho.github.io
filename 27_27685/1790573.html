			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental aggregate can plague Siegel through its own expansion, and he has not figured out why. Www/xshuotxt/com Even if the polymer is placed in an isolated space, such as a space bag or a key space, it still increases at the same speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just the volume, but the total amount of energy it contains is also increasing. These sources of stable energy are a new puzzle for Siegel, and he is puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, elemental aggregates store a lot of energy with great efficiency, enough for Siegel to use everyday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dorn, you are really sad." Siegel let the elemental polymer float on his chest and then slide over it with his hand. The power of the four elements entangles on his fingers and converges at the tip of the index finger to form an iridescent ball of light. He said: "You are not a human being, a ghost, or a ghost. It is just a monster that is infused with evil energy. If you don't rush to repent and then give up the evil energy, death will be your only end."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't death be your end? Morning and evening, little wizard, it will come unexpectedly." Dorn smiled, then raised his hand and shot a holy force Flame, burn the sword of the wizard. "Unfortunately, I am not as good at you as spells, but the power of the great gods is far more than you. You will soon be burned in the divine flame!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his words are finished, he raises the holy emblem and uses the ability to control the undead creatures. A flash of flash swept over Siegel's body, but it didn't work. Siegel continues to absorb energy from the elemental aggregates and brew powerful spells at the fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don Although he does not understand why the control of the undead is invalid, he will not be stupid enough to continue to try. As he yelled at the name of the god, he summoned a fall from the void and hit the top of Siegel's head. The mage lifted one of the empty hands and knocked on the defensive staff, calling for the power of the spell to bounce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A milky shield blocked St. Yan and turned it to attack Dorn. The flame from the murderous god will not harm the believers of the murderous god, but will still scare Dorn. He gasped a few mouthfuls and saw the expression of Siegel's eyes as ridicule. Wrath and angry waving the only remaining arm. His shouts filled the passage: "The great murder god, please give me the power to destroy this shackle and make me your strongest weapon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When the divine power awakens from the depths of his soul, he is in tears. Fall into the bliss. Siegel shook his head and thought of the people controlled by the peaceful circle, which is not the same result. He raised his hand and pointed his index finger at Dorn and said softly: "Destroy it. It’s strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rainbow-colored ray is silent Without any warning, he hit Don's body and opened a fist-sized hole in his chest. If there are still colorful remnants remaining in the air, I am afraid that Doen does not know the reality of his being hit. He bowed his head and looked at the wound with some accident. It is a perfect hemispherical cavity with no traces of heat, corrosion, cutting or other external forces. The things in that area simply disappear and are erased from the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorn tried to wriggle the body to fill the gap, but his body did not feel a piece at all, so he did not listen to the command. Siegel tilted his head. Put your right index finger in front of your eyes and pose for aiming, then say: "I gradually master the use of disintegrating rays, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The iridescent rays of the four-pulse arrows and the disintegrating ray spells shot and caused one wound after another. The priest calls for the protection of divine power, but it seems that no force can stop the ray attack. He tries to counterattack with the magic, but is also dispelled by the ray. The quality of the body of the colloidal structure is constantly decreasing, and Dorn can't support his body very quickly and fall to the ground. In desperation, he applied anti-magic force to himself. This blocked the flying spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha! I will recover and stand up again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啐!"西Geer said disdainfully: "You are perfused with divine power and become like this, and the anti-magic force field will invalidate all spells, so you should first pay attention to your body."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manage mana that is not his own without the knowledge and skill. It will be like this. A glare, dazzling lightning exploded from the anti-magic force field, slammed on Siegel's shield and pushed him back one meter. What followed was not the sound of thunder, but the scream of screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning blew from Dorn's body, and the already collapsed body could no longer store the divine power. Then he turned into a spell stick that was constantly exploding. The anti-magic force field tried to suppress this explosion and weakened its damage to the surrounding environment, but for the Dorn in the center, the damage he suffered was not weakened at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor is helpless and trapped in the sturdy body and anti-magic force field, nothing can be done. The explosion of lightning followed by a flame, one inch and one inch swallowed the body he had turned from the inside out. Since having the body of the clay, Dorn can only get the pain from his wife, but how can the pain weakened by the spell compare with reality? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His failure is inevitable, so the god of murder took away the grace and abandoned him in the sea of ​​fire. Organs such as internal organs reappeared in the body of the clay, and immediately became the raw material of the flame, bringing more pain to Dorn. He madly twisted his neck, licking his head and making a scream, but he couldn't die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-magic field dispels with the disappearance of divine power, and Siegel looks far and wide at the struggling Dorn. He has always believed that the process of slowly understanding death is a gift and that the pain is a kind of praise. Now that he has tasted bitter fruit, the feeling of coming from the natural body has made him doubtful about this theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dare not doubt, because it means that the murdered god abandoned, and the soul after death did not return. While enduring the pain, he prayed to the god of murder, praised his greatness, and praised his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Siegel with the lingering light of his eyes, and the words of praise produced an interruption, and the trembling lips seemed to say something different. Siegel said nothing, waiting for him to speak openly. As long as he asks for mercy, he will give him a quick and painless death with four arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master thought that Dorn’s current state is the punishment of his failure for the murder god, but there are other reasons. In order to be able to keep his wife injured and to be able to feel from her mind, Dorn has been taking the blood-staining agent that Rees Mage has configured with her. The gelatinous body does not suffer from any side effects, but it can prevent him from dying in the event of a serious injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how much he knows what his current situation is, he ultimately does not dare to ask for mercy. Continue to recite the praise of the murder god. Siegel didn't want to look any further, so he summoned a flame wolf with the remaining elements condensed on his fingers, letting him guard here and returning to the transfer room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission array has stopped working. The saint of the murderer has completely left here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle in the stronghold should not be over yet, but there should be no more surprises. Those colloidal warriors will not be the opponents of the Elven army. Even if they are super-level, they will be followed by Heim's army equipped with plasma. As for Evan and others, if the Elves are not even protected by them. What use is there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about the Elf Saint, he suddenly appeared next to Siegel. Siegel blinked and seemed to find something strange. In the past, the Elves of the Elves came without a trace, and there was no warning when they appeared and disappeared, but this time Siegel discovered the special fluctuations of the elements. Although it is weak, it is definitely a mantra that breaks the space. It seems that the power of God still needs to obey the rules of the world, that is, the rules of elements and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that I can only choose between saving my companion and coming to the transmission array. Now I have done it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't go to Evan, you can see the open transmission matrix. With your ingenuity, you must have the ability to follow. Then you can know more. Now We still know nothing about the other strongholds of the murder god.” The Elf Saint said the cruel fact in a gentle and beautiful Elvish: “The clues are broken here.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we have this array, we can find out how to use it, figure out where it goes, and where it has been." Siegel pointed to the rune on the ground and said to the elf: "The clue is In front of you, why do you say that he is broken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the priest of the murder god can open this circle of law, and can lead to where it depends entirely on murder God's will." The Elf Saint said: "You also see it, this is completely different from the Master's transmission. In simple terms, this It is a manifestation of God's will and power, and there is no possibility of reappearing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any force wants to operate in the world. It is necessary to obey this world." Law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
