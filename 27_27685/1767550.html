			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to survive in this war, relying solely on the secret passages of the secrets of the walls and the elves. As a small character in the crack, Siegel must have the weapons to protect himself and balance the strength of both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially facing the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He carefully measured the threats that Knox and the elves threatened him, and then found that the most urgent thing to do now was to find a way to deal with the elves. When building the city of Mire, he began to use the dwarf runes in a planned way to protect evil, protect the dead, and guard against mental control. These are very targeted measures. Until now, in the defense of the Knox Association, in addition to continuing to improve his spell ability, he has nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sighed, or his magic level is not enough! Magic protection like the Three Peaks Tower is what he wants most, conveying recognition, plane movement locks, element-oriented fixed-point suppression, powerful anti-magic and de-magic enchantment, and intelligent guards around the clock - the god of lights. According to the half-elf wizard Idis, the Three Peaks Tower also has a legendary spell returning to the ruling. Whether it is an elf wizard or a priest, their power is hard to penetrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to truly defend against the elves. The Red Magic Tower in Ximu Town and Hubburg has similar spell protection, so the elf can't attack at once. The city of Mire is only a cheaper one. The army led by Leah has only a mind surrounded and no attempt to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it would be better if it could be like the spell of the Masters Association. Legend has it that it is more powerful, with layers of nests nesting in each other, and generations of the most powerful wizards constantly adding their own peak spells. To this day, even the association itself has no way to lift these protections. They are hoping that there will be intruders to help, at least consuming some defensive enchantments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving the defense of the castle, Siegel knows most, but still can't display it. Underground books manage these spells, but it takes a lot of time to learn, and he is always quiet. He once asked himself. Is becoming a lord slowing down the path of his Master? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be a lord does not mean to become easy, his responsibilities will not decrease. Instantly like the mage who is studying in the library all day, he will have his own tasks to complete, and he will find ways to find funds to maintain his own learning. At least after the zebra mountain gold mine. He knows that he doesn't have to worry about gold coins. The gold mine is enough for him to complete all magic learning. How many wizards can you say this? Magic experiments, spell transcripts, creation of magic items, and alchemy work, which ones are not built with rare materials? If there is not a Jinshan, can he start immediately when he wants to conduct a certain experiment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like trying to make a weapon. When the giants of water rushed past him and carried the alchemy test bed, how many people could be as comfortable as him? Siegel continued to direct the elements to do this, and to clean up the new alchemy room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having Isaac, it is necessary to move the Magic Lab and Alchemy Lab away from the Castle of Mire. The place that was originally reserved for the Master Tower is only a base, so the original warehouse on the second floor is the best choice. It is built on the solid squad of the castle and is arguably the most indestructible place. And the core of the elemental rune matrix is ​​here, as long as Siegel has a thought, it can increase the concentration of elements here, greatly speeding up the pace of experimentation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Alchemy Experiment Tool. The konjac assembly line will also be placed here. Now the blacksmith shop is working hard. In addition to the two beeps, the gnomes and dwarves also heard the news. But they don't know what Erdu is doing, just simply come and help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all necessary for confidentiality. After the magic rune guard and the roots of Mora - the dwarfs are very fond of the name of the drug - everyone is very interested in Siegel's new project, any progress in it can bring Great inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This enthusiasm is very high, but it will bring hidden dangers in the war. The elves are not far from the city, and they must not let them discover any clues. Therefore, the konjac was strictly forbidden to disclose the specific details of the manufactured articles, and all the articles and parts had to be taken apart, and the blank materials were purchased from the blacksmith shop in the name of making the magic image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The completion of the assembly line takes a lot of time, and the most fundamental is the specific specifications of the production project. Siegel took out the two layers of war ancient trees from the space bag. Carefully placed on the bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, you can carefully check the samples you get, and every stripe road can be seen clearly. He found that to hurt the ancient trees of war, he must solve the two barriers of toughness and fire. Considering the size and quantity of ancient trees in war, if you simply use a good material with high hardness, you can't stand the war. On the one hand, it can be refined from the ore, forged and polished, and on the other hand it grows directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient war trees were first used to deal with dragons, and different dragons have different elemental energies. Siegel thought about it carefully. I found that the ancient trees of war I saw were all of a kind: Rune Tree. However, Rune Tree is not a species of ancient times, but after the Dragon War, the elves have time to develop their own magic, and slowly cultivated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of the records he saw from the library. The elves had a variety of ancient war trees to adapt to different fighting situations. It was through the massive sacrifices of these trees that they gradually gained the upper hand in the war. However, after the end of the war, the dragon used all means to secretly destroy all the ancient trees of war and destroy related materials and records. This action almost caused the second war with the dragon. After the orc's frenzy caused the elves to suffer heavy losses, the sharp-eared guy slowly lost the cultivation method of the war tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the predecessors can do it, there is no reason for future generations to reproduce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel suddenly thought of one thing: What would they do if they let the dragon know that the ancient trees of war reappeared? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question makes Siegel shudder. It is okay for Capricorn. From her story, her father does not seem to be in this world, which means that his blood is not continued from the local dragon. There may not be much thought about the ancient tree of war. It is believed that the dragons in the far west of the New World will not forget the weapons of the elves. If they decide to eliminate the danger in the bud, and then team up to the walls of the city...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; If it develops into such a situation, the situation is absolutely beyond control. I hope that the Mage Federation will not play such an idea, otherwise it will really be a life. A piece of scorched earth. Siegel thought about it carefully. This was not good for Knox. The dragon suffered a loss in the grievances. When he didn’t know, he would deal with sharp ears or big bald heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a deep breath. Pull your thoughts back and focus on the experiment at hand. He carefully sliced ​​and tested the resistance of the bark with the strength of various elements. Almost incombustible, the damage caused by ice is very small, the acid has some effect but can't go deep, only the energy protection of the electric system is weak. It seems that the big tree is still afraid of thunder - Siegel is not malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he has some understanding of the sinister expression on the face of the Elf Master when he summoned the lightning to crush the rock. It was not only worried about the direct threat to the rear casters on the battlefield. Also worried about war ancient trees! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the elemental array, Siegel can make a mine for defense, but that doesn't mean he can attack. Besides, what about other lords in the South? What about humans in the New World? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head to continue the experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second layer of the skin beneath the outer skin is covered with a layer of sticky material. It seems to feel like grease, but the elf can't put flammable things so outside. Using spells to continually resolve its composition, Siegel discovered that the layer of viscous material is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called viscous effect is caused by the innumerable fluff of the naked eye, and the subtle translucent fluff stretches and shakes like a drifting seaweed. Siegel thinks this structure is very familiar. Where have you seen it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moss!" Siegel suddenly realized. The moss in the ghost fog swamp changed its shape. Just attached to this layer. Remember that they have the ability to absorb the surrounding elements and transmit them, so it is no longer reasonable to be responsible for the transfer of nutrients and energy under the skin of the rune tree. The original magical energy was stored in the grainy leaves, and Siegel had been wondering how the energy was transmitted to the feet of the war tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This layer of "bark" is easily destroyed, but the speed of growth and recovery is also amazing, and will soon make up for the gap. Even if this layer is completely stripped, the war tree is just faltering and will not be fatally hurt. Basic elemental forces such as fire, acid, and ice can easily destroy moss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Siegel found that because of the hairy structure, it can attract and transfer electricity. Lightning spells are quite high damage in all spell power. It is also the most violent, and a little release can destroy this layer of moss, and it is impossible to use its permeability characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
