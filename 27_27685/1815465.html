			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a visitor, the Elf Saints finally said what they wanted, even though Siegel had already used the power of prophecy to look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new magic god, I am representing the gods, I hope that you can fulfill the previous agreement. The items left by the creation god are valuable to this world. Property, no gods can hold research privately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before I became a magician, my nephew was mine. This is very clear. You have no reason. Let me give up my own things. The last person to try this is Lear, who has been completely erased. Maybe you forgot who he is? I have a clone of his body here, maybe I can help you remember "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elves of the Elves seem to have not heard the threat of Siegel, and the face is not changed: "All the gods made under the vows of the Styx." With this agreement, the abandoner will be at the cost of demise. Siegel, don't take this risk, there is no advantage at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually use meditation The river vowed to restrain himself, but I didn’t think of it.” Siegel squatted I could not help but face up to the seriousness of this matter since. The Styx vows is a very mysterious force in the multiverse, a constraint on God. The price of breaking the vow is to lose the deity, to 5,000 years in hell, to imprison, torture, and ** not to die - unless the mind first collapses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortal cannot make a vow of the Styx because their own power is not enough to draw the attention of the Styx. The most annoying thing about this vow is to follow the fire of the gods (both swear by God), which means that when Siegel became a magical god, he also inherited the vows of his predecessor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have just become a magical god, the fusion of the fire has not yet been completed. So the power of the Styx has not yet arrived. But it will come one day. "The Elf Saint admonished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know. Thank you for your reminder. Is there anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is one more thing, although it is not the restraint of the sacred vows, but it represents the common will of the gods. All the research on the scorpion should be shared, which means that you need to place the scorpion in a place that the gods know, such as 骰盅 盅 。.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;骰盅 The prison is the place where the ten-faced scorpion is held, and the blood of the Holy Mother of the Earth is stained with the land in front of the entrance. "This is impossible." Siegel said: "Even if I don't carry the donkey anymore, this donkey won't leave my family. Don't think about it, it won't enter the prison. In fact, the prison should also Abolished. Turner is one of the heroes who protects the world of thunder walls from being destroyed by the devastating storm. It is very unreasonable to hold him like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also the destroyer of another world, responsible for the death of a billion people. Until now, there are nearly 20 million dead souls staying in this world. If the god of death has been trying to contain it, after the resentment, the orcs, dwarves, The elves and you humans will suffer from the catastrophe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t be so innocent, many things are artificial." Siegel can be so cunning at the School of Magic. The place to find allies, with the power of everyone to achieve their goals. But the gods can't reach peace with the nephew holders? The fundamental key is that the gods are high and the world is their own. Everything in the world is also its own, too lazy to follow the mortal theory of life in the world, only to convey the will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When encountering a person or thing that is unwilling to accept, God suddenly becomes a thin skin and feels insulted and despised. There must be some reasons for the excitement of the fire, and it is not because God is too far away from the main material world, resulting in the loss of universality, or the normal heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a broken world, and it will be swallowed up by the devastating storm at any time. It is unwise to leave too much energy here." The Elf Saint said: "In the foreign domain, you need friends, and it is a very important step to get the friendship of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, God's friendship? From my notes, my Prayers never get a response. Of course, this also depends on your good implementation of the Styx contract. Without your help, I have been a god from a mortal, do you think I still need to pray to you? Joke, I It will be very good! Anyone who tries to make me bad will not go on!" Siegel noticed that his emotions began to fluctuate wildly under the influence of the fire, so he quickly closed his mouth and took a few mouthfuls of water to suspend a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Saint’s mouth twitched and did not answer this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, the magical priesthood has been restored, and the art institute is still changing its name. If magic is an art, I will say that art is affecting emotions. A kind of magic. This ambiguous concept of strategy goes on, it is not good for the elf god. He has been unable to attract the priesthood and fire from me, and at most will only bring hostility to himself."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Saint was just about to speak, and Siegel waved his hand to stop him. "I know what you want to say, I don't want to hear your reasons. You are a saint, you can't do the Lord, so you just need to give my message to someone who can be the master. You think I will listen to you." Lessons? Only her is almost the same.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel points to Elf Leah, who has a pale face and looks exhausted, but overall it’s fairly health. Siegel can see the future with prophecy, but he is not a recorder and will not know everything that happened in the past. It seems that the elf has no interest at all, so Siegel's gaze is directed at the Holy One and asks him what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frequent violations of military orders, and recently leaked the secret information of the elves to outsiders, that is, you." The Elf saint said: "So she was accused of treason, He was tried in the court. The most serious punishment of the elf was exile. Leah was sentenced to exile for five hundred years, but it has not yet begun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Siegel snorted," Master, don't go back this time, the Elf Forest is no longer a place for a long time. Everything is because of me, you are suffering to take care of me, I will "You can get justice for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves Liya shook his head: "Siegel, no need. Since my father died, I was not very happy in the Elven Forest. There is nothing wrong with the judgment of this court. I am willing to recognize this sin and there is nothing unfair. The fairness is already here, there is nothing to be called back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said to the Elf Saint: "Have you heard, because the master's sentence The elves lived at least a few thousand people! But if you bring the master, you should have expected the situation. My master is at least not wandering around, and can go to Heim to take the lead."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually..." The Elves of the Elf hesitated, or said: "The original one also included a hand, I removed this punishment, and did not execute."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it’s good to go so that I can use cloning to fix it, and then justify it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "God does not directly participate in mortal things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't lie to me with this sentence. You are sitting in front of me, still saying no Directly involved?” Siegel said to the Elves of the Elves: “I am different from you. I can bring all the power of the fire to this world, and even bring down the kingdom of God. The barrier to the wall is too late to stop. On the contrary, You can only send the saints at most. If there is a conflict, your best ending is to be driven. Go out of this world. Your temples, pastors, and believers have nothing to lose. Tell your master, and other gods, the times have changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This doesn't match..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words haven't finished yet, and Siegel flicks his fingers and sends the Elf Saints out of Heim's collar. He said to the wizard master: "Actually, I know that he is kind. I have helped me a lot before. But now I need to show a certain attitude, otherwise I will have more trouble later." Sigton took a moment and scratched his head. Said: "I am sorry to let you fall into these things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The war is over, I think so, so I will help you. As for Before that, it was your means to be more sophisticated. For some elves, the end of the war is slower." Leah leaned back and lay lazy on the chair. "Actually, I want to go to Sir Bill. Do you know what he is doing now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is married in the starry kingdom and currently manages an earl "Siegel is a bit strange: "Don't you know his news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has always only sent letters to Irene, now it is possible to add The last one, I will only be told at most.” Elf Lia looked so excited that she was not very tall. She stood up and shook her head and said to Siegel: “Can you prepare a room for me? I will stay first and think about it. Don't go find him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
