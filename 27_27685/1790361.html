			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanin’s black figure emerged from the air, his hands crossed and he looked at Evan with great interest. "I found that you didn't lie. You really believe that you are Evan. Stars, the king of mankind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a fact, not related to believing or not." Evan said: "I believe that I am more valuable than others, you let them leave, let's have a good fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem Suddenly laughing, the wild laughter echoed in the passage. "You are too high to look at yourself, the king of mankind. The kingdom of stars is just a small corner of mankind. You are just a king in the mouse hole. But you are right, you are indeed more than the other four people. More valuable, but why should I listen to you? Do you think that I am a fool without a brain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are four people, your strength Greatly affected, so I don't have to ease the burden for you. On the contrary, my servants are coming here, you have no way to escape. But because you are a king, I will give you a preferential treatment, that is, I will Defeat yourself personally and won't let you be captured by ordinary mortals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will make the church of the murder god illegal, let mortal without you Believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, laughing at me." Chanem laughed. "The royal family has always been my biggest believer, your murder... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels a cold neck, then his eyes are off the body Come farther. Evan rushed up as he raised his head and laughed, and a sword smashed Chanem's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are most proficient in murder. This is true." Evan spoke and used a bonfire to cut Chann’s body into a cut. He tried to find the internal organs like the heart, but there was only black clay in the body of Chanem, and there was no organ. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he was broken into pieces, he was still squirming. Evan thought he would regroup and spell the new Chanem, but was surprised to find that each piece is proliferating. "This... Is this going to become the rhythm of dozens of Chennam?" He hurriedly pulled up Ai Meng and pulled her forward: "Run, we don't have much time!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of people were distorted to grow up, and then the first Chennam was born again. Looked at the direction of Evan's escape with an appreciative look. The other twisted figures suddenly smashed and turned into clay flowing on the ground. Chanem picked up two daggers from the clay and hid them in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meng and Yao En have only one leg to work hard, plus Arnold's eyes can't see. Greatly slowed down the speed. They only ran for a few tens of meters, and Arnold yelled: "He is coming again, just behind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan does not care for the jade, Abandoning the love directly, and turned back to fight. He only saw a burst of white light shining. Stung to the chest. With a long sword, it was too late to block. He used his left arm as a long sword and greeted him with a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem only felt that there was a strange force entangled in his own weapons, and the body was taken involuntarily. For the first time, he was thrown out of the shadows during the attack, and most of his body was exposed to the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire penetrated his body and stirred hard, and Evan used all his strength. He knows that he has done what he has done unintentionally in order to get this rare opportunity. Regardless of how the bonfire is waving, Chanem is no longer bleeding, and even the expression of pain is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have any meaning at all." Chanem said: "Although this consumes divine power, it should also let you know what is futile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murder god, and the power of the sacred god, is showing that Chanem is no longer the key, and there is no such thing as a shape. The concepts of the skull, limbs, and body have become meaningless. It changes into a black gel that begins to stick to the body of Evan. The clay cuts Avon's armor, leaving a lot of wounds on the flesh and infiltrating the acid. Evan’s body became very weak, and even the station stood unsteadily, shaking and screaming on the ground. On the shores of the Tears of God, Evan was once embarrassed by this trick. There is no good way to deal with it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will die in my body, the king will kneel down, and then become my beautiful amber collection." Chanem's voice is fluttering, black The clay has climbed Evan's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black clay was ignited by fire, and it was like being splashed with strong acid. It struggled to escape under the radiance of Mother Earth and quickly fell from Evan's body. As soon as he hid in the shadows, he re-condensed into the form of Chanem and then walked out. It seems that there is more resistance when it comes to complete human form. Therefore, the radiance shining on him will only form a rising blue smoke, which is already within his acceptable range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a devout believer, but here is my temple." Chanem opened his fingers and slammed on the wall. The golden runes cover the entire wall and are spread over the floor and ceiling, full of gimmicks. The brilliance that Anomen called for was immediately weakened, leaving only the brightness of the torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can a little priest understand the rules between God?" Chanem said: "This is my field, all power is in me." Under the control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dense footstep in the passage, accompanied by the swaying of the torch. Naria and others held hands by the wall and knew that the last moment had arrived. Imon sat on the ground and put his face on Evan's back. Then he said, "You are the only one who can escape. Let's go, we don't blame you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far, I have already thought of a way to deal with him, you must not be discouraged." Evan cross sword stood in front of everyone, the body covered with wounds covered with blood. There is a faint yellow color in his blood, just like gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps are getting closer and closer, and Chanem is also carrying the dagger to get ready for the final harvest. At this moment, a wolf in the form of a fire element rushed out of the passage, followed by a flame wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original footsteps and the light of the torch are what they caused! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolves rushed to Chanem and tried to bite his body. The black assassin's god evaded around, but he was not hit at all. There are more and more wolves, surrounded by them, and even stacked to form the wall of the flame wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chennam knows that all the flame wolves come from the same spell with just one touch, and can’t help but be surprised: “This is the elemental creature who summoned, how There are so many?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was gradually surrounded by wolves, and there was no gap in getting out. These wolves also have a tendency to merge, and all the flames are connected to each other to form an impenetrable fire wall. Siegel flew in the direction of the corner of the passage and kept his focus on the spell. Under the control of the flame wolves became a super-large fire element, covering the whole of Chanem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the direction of the flame whirlwind, Siegel squeezed his fist. The flame immediately gathered in the middle, igniting the central black figure. A scream came and was covered by the burning flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel ran to Evan and threw a space bag to Naria. "Fast, the medicine will continue to be hydrated. Now the time is not saving money, the enemy has not disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naria knows that it is not tangled with Siegel. Why did it appear, and when it was the same as Jay, since the king has already appeared, it is not surprising to have another lord. She rushed out of the treatment agent and gave it to her companions, and checked other things in the space bag, hoping to have treasures that could be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel found a bottle of red healing agent from his pocket to Evan’s hand: “Come on, this is the best treatment at my hand. You need to regain strength as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you simply send us away?" Evan took the potion and unscrewed the stopper. Asked: "At least they should all be taken out of danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't do it alone. You don't think about that good thing." Siegel handed the obsidian dagger to him and said, "Hold, this thing can deal with the Holy One of the murder god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? "Evan is happy." He had long wanted to use a magical obsidian to decapitate, and naturally laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire line burned, but Siegel knew that there was no trace of the sacred murder inside. It is impossible to rely on summoning creatures to deal with a saint. There is only one chance for such a sneak attack. So he dissipated the flame, leaving only enough illumination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
