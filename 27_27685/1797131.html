Evan’s words established the latter’s talks. Keynote: "The Star Kingdom decided to participate in the occupation of the Earth, provided that we can prepare for the war with the help of various races. The dwarves provide weapons, the elves provide magic, and humans only need to send troops to the battlefield to die. Things are definitely not possible. If you still have such an idea, I can help you to contact the orcs in the north."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The orcs can't be an alliance, this is all of us. Consensus." Elf King first shook his head. First, the saints were run away by Siegel's words, and then Evan snatched the leading position of the meeting. For a whole week, humans have reached a truce with the sand people and the fishermen. Evan’s ass has not yet taken the throne of Wangcheng, and he has made the frontiers of the starry kingdom more peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf squinted at the Queen of the Wings. Although she tried to hide it, the scarred wings and the broken left arm still made her look very uncoordinated. The winged people are widely distributed, and they also have a large part of the branch in the starry kingdom. Because living in the mountains, it is not suitable for farming, so the Wings are often like orcs, living a life of looting. Orc invasions sometimes have seasonal regularity, while winged people are more likely to look at moods and opportunities. The knights riding on horsebacks are hard to catch the winged people flying around, so the wingers have long been a frequent visitor to the starry kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan took the initiative to find the Queen of the Wings, hoping that they would join the Star Kingdom and become subjects. The Queen laughed loudly and thought that he had told a big joke and stunned the human king. Evan is not angry, and challenges her in the way of the winged people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means not using magic, only fighting with teeth, claws and wings - but Evan has only teeth, no claws and wings. "I want to use a long sword, any sword can be, even can be provided by you." Evan said: "The winner is king, it is as simple as that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to show fairness. Evan agrees that the Winged Queen also carries weapons. "The female birdman used a longbow." Evan said easily with Siegel, "This is also what I expected, nothing. When she shot the arrow and had to use her claws. That face The expression on the face can be fun! She rushed down twice and was beaten twice by me. Then she thought that flying in the sky would make me unable to fight? Hehe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The process of this duel is confidential, and only two parties know the process, but everyone knows the outcome. The Queen of the Wings is unhappy. However, there is no objection to the outcome of the duel. Although this does not mean that the winged people will become the people of the starry kingdom, it is expected that their actions of looting will be moderated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf King’s mouth is bitter, and he and the Dwarf King look at each other and see the latter is also very helpless expression. If the throne is not handed over, the star king or Aaron, his health is not enough to hold on to a long meeting, everything will be much easier than it is now. It must be said that Evan's energy and ability played a very important role in this occasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the human king can take time, the Elf King does not want to waste time, and has the idea of ​​ending the meeting as soon as possible. This idea coincides with the Dwarf King. Siegel can finally end his hardship here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very complex agreement has been reached between the various ethnic groups that will join hands in the battle against the goblin to concentrate wisdom and strength. How effective can it be? This is a very questionable question, and it is only time to verify it. According to Evan's words: "First establish a preliminary mutual trust and say it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For humans, the real gain is an armistice with many races. . The Wings finally decided to join the kingdom of the stars, live as the Duke, and bind the people while pledge allegiance, obeying the laws of the kingdom of stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you find a duke to get out?" Siegel said very curious. According to the general calculation, the duke collars occupy at least two hundred kilometers of the local circle, and there is no such large area of ​​landless land in the kingdom of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wing people like to live in the mountains. So you can find a mountain." Evan smiled and spread his hand and said: "Although there was no double king in the end." The battle, but after all, are there two factions? I just want to scare and scare in the name of liquidation, and it is not a big problem to put a part of the mountain area. It is not good to compensate from other places afterwards."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan grinned. In the past, he will definitely fight back "I have always been a king." Now he has not said so. Maybe when he consciously surpassed Aaron in all aspects. He will start to say this again. "Siegel, what do you call me on the deck? The agreement has been signed, the Royal Fleet is ready to return, and what do you mean by me to call the Winged Women Grand Duke together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the engineering miracle of our Masters Federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the direction of Siegel's fingers, Evan The winged man’s grandmother squinted his eyes, but he could not see anything. Siegel took out his wand and waved in the air. Use your magical charm to launch into the sky with illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just behind the side of the stone boat, the Federation’s magical spacecraft suddenly appeared. The spacecraft is more than 500 meters long, nearly 400 meters wide and 50 meters high. It adopts a four-layer structure, each with its own platform and window. It doesn't look like a streamlined bird or a fish, but like a flying gyro, completely using brute force to overcome all resistance. The Mire Nuclear provides sufficient power for it, and its core mana pool and deformable array on the outer surface of the spacecraft offer a variety of spell protection options. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modular array design concept brings this deformable array, which is a great extension of the construction period. By replacing the parts, the magic spacecraft can achieve stealth, shadow, thundercloud storm, force field barrier, squatting and other functions, greatly enriching the means of defense and offensive. Siegel originally suggested using the tranquility of the Knox Association on the magic spacecraft, but the Federation rejected the proposal with a slight advantage in the voting. I am afraid that many people are still in the shadow of the fear of thinking control, and have not recovered yet. This is the reason why the proposal was rejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of the spacecraft is a mage tower that works primarily as a speller's booster. The Federation’s mana pool has not yet been completed, and it is still secretly constructed inside the Fatah – it is certainly not visible from the outside. With the power of the Ural nuclear power, the main attack method of the spacecraft was set as a magic missile. Although this spell is the most basic attack in the spell, its range and inevitable hit characteristics make it a powerful deterrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two magic missiles, even an ordinary civilian can bear, but if it is a thousand? Simply unreasonable! Just like the shape of a magical spaceship, the new federation concept that stands up from the ruins is very simple: the reasoning has fallen. It’s time to stand up unreasonably! There is no beauty, only the purest brute force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real reason for not being beautiful is actually because the construction period is too tight, and there is no time to design so delicate...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The dwarf's non-sinking stone boat immediately sounded an alarm, and the horns and ringing bells came one after another. When the Golden Dragon arrived, the sieges and trebuchets that were put out were re-emerged. The loyal dwarf guards began to assemble and set their sights on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear to everyone that if it is in actual combat, the dwarf has already suffered at least 20 rounds of blows. A strong man with a strong attack is not terrible. What is terrible is that he has the thief-like stealth ability. The Federation’s magical spacecraft can be quietly approached. Cast a lot of spells in an instant, and then you can leave with ease. There is no way to deal with it except for diving into the seabed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the mind to move, someone shot a dark clay pot from the upper platform of the magic spacecraft to the sky. Then I heard only a huge "beep" sound, at least two hundred magic missiles were launched from the core tower, like a glowing bee colony, and the former servant accurately hit the clay pot. Except for those who exercise their minds, no one knows what is in the jar, because the jar is blown into dust by the volley, and nothing is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf’s horn stopped and the alarm bell shut up. They have begun to think about whether they are going to sneak away. But the dwarf soon wanted to understand, if this is an enemy, it has already been played. So they keep alert and wait and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the first magical spaceship of the Federation, currently serving as the headquarters." Siegel said: "With the help of the power of the secret nuclear power In about a week, it will be able to fly from Heim to the iron port of the East Continent. But we have not tested its carrying capacity, but there are certainly no problems with the armed soldiers of around 2,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of the Winged Man has been trembling, and she hastened to kneel behind Evan. Everyone knows that the Earl of Heim and the King have a good personal relationship, so what is the problem with the use of the magical spaceship of the Federation for the use of the Star Kingdom? The winged people rely on their ability to fly to avoid the threat of the ground. The mountain in which they live has added countless difficulties to the cofferdam, so they can sit back and relax. But now everything has changed. The magic spacecraft can give the starry kingdom absolute air control. Fortunately, I have decided to join the kingdom of stars before, otherwise... the consequences are unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
