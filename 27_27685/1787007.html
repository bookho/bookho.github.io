			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the demon ghost continues to burn until it becomes a pile of black pieces. Siegel took out the dust of the stars and kicked the shards with his feet. A green and plum-sized heart is curling up in the debris, shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second heart of the demon ghost, and she can defend against a magical attack when she is dying to save it. After a while, it will become like a rotting core, unremarkable. It will enter the soil with the rain, and then slowly accumulate the power of resurrection. Some careless adventurers will miss this thing and let the ghosts escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If other ghosts discover this heart, they will not hesitate to eat, and then gain stronger spell power. Some wizards also collect this heart to study or cast spell immunity spells. This thing is not available at all in the common spell material market, it is only secretly circulating between the casters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel doesn't want this kind of thing, so it erodes it with acid. A black smoke emerged from the dry heart, marking a demon ghost completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust of the star is burned by the flame, so Siegel directly withdraws it from the scabbard. He slowly walked down the hill and re-held the defensive staff in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of the demon and the werewolf howling in the mountains, the herd began to question their actions. They stopped and sniffed around, wondering why they left the territory. Surrounded by unfriendly predators, they threatened and deterred each other. They used their claws, their voices, their body odors, and their lack of patience to fight. In short, the pressure of Evan and Emmon A lot less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil turned into a human appearance, it seems to be only in his twenties, an ordinary farmer or a groom, the most inconspicuous guy thrown into the village . He is still standing still under the influence of the spell. Try to think about how to get rid of the threat of "black flame". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smashed his head with an obsidian dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support of the deformed spells has been lost, and the human head has changed back to the demon, the fierce face with fangs covered with black hair. Siegel summoned the invisible servant to hold this head. Then came to the werewolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolf is a veterinary disease, like a tiger, a bear or a fox. However, werewolves like teamwork. Therefore, it is possible to form a certain social system, so it is more united and powerful than other people with veterinary diseases. They systematically lurk into the ordinary human society, carefully avoiding the pastor, acquiring - or plundering - various resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of pastors in the New World is too small, so it has become a paradise for many beasts. It is even possible that the beastized people of the Old World have come to settle here. Siegel even had a guess that the unnamed villages they used to live in might be inhabited by the beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the beast is passing in front of him, with the sensitivity to magic and elements, Siegel will not miss it. But he has not seen everyone in the village, this ability can not rule out all suspects. When looking for eggs, Siegel had a weird feeling that something was wrong in the village. Looking back now, he found that there was no dog in the village! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is not appropriate, pastors, mages, and dogs can identify the beast. Now Siegel can only hope that the three people in the village have enough power to defend themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe don't worry, Siegel thinks, after all, Naria is also a mage. From her attire and dress up, she should be an intern at the Masters Union. Because of the various incidents of the Elven War and the Federation, she has reached the standard of the official mage. But it is very likely that there has been no promotion title, so she did not have her seat at the federation meeting. From the perspective of magical fluctuations, Naria should be able to display fireballs and lightning. Both of them can form enough damage to the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to torture some information from the werewolf? Siegel thought about it and vetoed the plan. He re-harvested a life with an obsidian dagger, then cleaned the scene, reclaimed the elemental rune core, and removed the traces of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the clay golem, there is nothing too good to deal with. The effect that can be obtained by using the spell is very small, and the risk of playing with the weapon and it is too high. Fortunately, after the ghost is dead, it can not receive new orders, and can only stand in the same place. Like a statue. Even though Siegel removed the illusion, it remained motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the head of the demon and the werewolf, lit the shoulders, and continued to run to Evan and Ai Meng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few more than fifty wolves, and some of the werewolves' bodies, like the sea fish that were brought to the sky by a tornado and then fell, scattered on both sides of the avenue. At the scene, a "wolf" borrowed, and the black blood stuck to the ground like glue, and it made a loud noise no matter where it was stepped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Diamond" is all blood, but except for the short tail, there are no more obstacles on the butt. Ai Meng’s arm was injured and Evan was carefully bandaging her. Both of them were bloody, and the white gas from the mouth mixed together and was blown away by the cold wind of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is like a walking lighthouse, walking from the avenue. The two men saw him from afar and laughed at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is ridiculous?" Siegel extinguished the light of the shoulders and stood opposite the two bloody guys. "What trouble did you cause, attracting the devil and the werewolf attack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We saw the werewolf, where did the devil?" I took out a clean handkerchief in my sleeve and wiped my face. After I paused, I handed it to Emmon. The latter said a thank you, took it, and rubbed it on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel showed the dog’s head and said, “I saw them calling the herd on the hillside, so they slaughtered them first.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder you just slammed, the wolves began to retire." Evan carefully looked at the head of the dog and reached out in front of Siegel. Come, "What weapons do you use, cut very neat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel hit his palm and said: "Okay, hurry up the road. Yao En, they are still waiting in the village."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small ghosts!" Evan said with a smile, then patted the horse's neck: "Get up the diamond Come to my shoulder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diamond turned over and the three legs stood firmly on the ground, turning two steps to indicate that they could go. Siegel said to him: "Not necessarily someone will take you away in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown horse stopped and looked with anticipation Evan. "King of the King" laughed and put his two front legs on his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meng stopped two people: "You just left this way? There are a lot of wolves here, you can sell a lot of money, you So don't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't worry about Naria? The three most likely people are outside, and the three of them are still in the village, looks like Only Arnold's martial arts are good.” Siegel said: “And they are still worried about us, so go back early.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the right thing to say," Ai Meng grinned: "I just feel a little pity. Forget it, the stone bomb is not awkward, go to the big town and buy some more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she put the stick behind her body and walked to the front of the three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield of smashing and killing, all other places are safe. There was a lost black bear and they met unexpectedly, but they only smelled the smell and fled. "Naria will not let me hug." Ai Meng said somewhat sadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't mind." Evan replied with a smile, then took a stick on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they returned to the village, they saw three other people waiting at the entrance to the village, but did not see any fortifications. This village, which has no fences, is so swaying on the side of the road that it does not guard against the dangers of the outside world. Arnold is also very surprised by this situation, especially when they wake the villagers and tell the herd that there is a possibility of attack, everyone looks at them with an expression of idiot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can only pile up some obstacles near the firewood house, which can reduce the risk of being besieged, better than nothing." The gnome pushed the glasses and stared at the sig The head hanging on the belt: "Jie, is this the demon and the big werewolf you killed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. And I think the beastly werewolf More than this one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
