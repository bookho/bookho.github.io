			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the goblin is coming. After the nuclear bomb attacked the starry kingdom, the action against the goblin accelerated the speed. Judging from the news from the palace director Sokol, His Majesty has already set off for the Crystal Wall Passage, and he will preside over the opening ceremony of the Faction. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation is also acting, they are strengthening the environment around the wall channel in anticipation of surviving nuclear bomb attacks. Most of the goblin weapons are aimed at cities where population is concentrated and important strategic locations. The northern snow-covered forests that are inaccessible should not be directly hit. But even this can't be taken lightly. At that time, the dust pollution caused by the sky and the meteorological disaster caused by many explosions will not be divided into many people, and it will definitely spread all over the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, the writer’s refuge mode is still the safest, and the underground is always less threatening than the ground. The Federation bought a team of earth element rune guards and stepped up the time to start the project. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel used the old method to display the astral projection with the star number and re-enter the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xingsuo, I don’t know how the goblins happened after we left last time. Did they miss the Zenith?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think so," Xingsuo thought for a while before answering. "Master, what are we going to do this time? The Masters Association will not destroy the goblins, are we not going to shoot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, there is no need to mess them up." Siegel said: "I am only interested in their statute. I got the news that it is a legendary squad, what exactly would it look like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be very difficult." Stars said without hesitation. Xingsuo has been working hard to learn magic. She has learned to burn hands and magical alarms, but other low-level spells have not progressed. Based on the obstacles she encountered while learning the spell, Siegel constantly adjusted the function settings of the parasitic brain on the magic spacecraft, trying to improve her elemental affinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are learning hypnosis and charming humans, I think this is too difficult for you. It is better to work on elemental spells. Now you have The burning hand of the fire element, the electric claw technique used to protect the outer armor, and the wind-making technique to a certain extent, it is better to learn the strong acid arrow directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Xingsuo has no objections, and Siegel said what she would listen to. Two people talked about the spell principle and spell structure of the strong acid arrow. All the way to the direction of the legendary circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative position of several crystal wall passages in the continental wall of the mine wall is regular. Siegel knows the location of the dwarf's exit of the wall channel, as well as the entrance to the wall of the Federation and the Masters Association. After the calculation, the exit of the Masters Association can be roughly determined. According to the map of the goblin, there is just a vast expanse of jungle. It is one of the few places on the planet that is covered by a lot of vegetation. The goblins are cutting down trees on the periphery, but they don't really care what happens in the depths of the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the goblin satellites are constantly patrolling the sky, the Masters Association must find a way to cover up before starting any work. The first thing that Siegel thinks of is the thick fog of the big group. Just find this and it is almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon came to the world of Goblin. It is such a thick fog that comes into view. The seven legendary mages of the Masters Association, corresponding to the seven factions of the spell, plus the enchantment of the enchantment (mind control), accompanied the Majesty the King to visit the magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire tower looks down from the sky into a regular pentagon, and the smooth and smooth gray stone wall has no special features. The entire tower has no other outward openings except for five pale yellow glass windows on each floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But inside the magic tower is another look. The statues of angels, demons and dragons are divided into three groups and they are confronted with each other. Of course, these statues are not for aesthetic purposes, but to carry magical arrays in a three-dimensional structure. The wizards of the association deliberately used the fine gold, silver smelting and cold iron to make magical lines and use gemstones as nodes. Plus the magical device on the wall. Form a complete legendary squad: the sigh of the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The King's Majesty, the core of the entire squad is here." Lear stood on the side of Evan, extending his slender fingers to indicate to him. Evan looked down and his eyes immediately slammed. He saw a black diamond statue with a dagger in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also clearly remembers the role of his beheading: the ability to close the power of the gods has a strong killing effect on the saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This dagger looks amazing, why should I put it here?" Evan pretended not to understand. Asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, this dagger was discovered when the ** division excavated the monuments, and it has the power to ban certain rules. We guess that it is a masterpiece of a god, A rare artifact.” Lear smiled and explained: “The whole magical array is to enlarge its power. Let the goblin gunpowder-based weapons all fail. The simple statement is that we have to plug in the chest of this world. A knife, so that it can no longer be embarrassed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Masters gave a slight laugh and was heard by Evan. They also think that when I am a child, I am here to speak in a way that tells fairy tales. These people of the Masters Association, except Lil, did not know one. Lack of understanding between the royal family and the association. There is not enough open communication channel, which is what Siegel said is opaque. As long as it is opaque, there will be opportunities to distort and distort information. Those who occupy important positions in the channel have power through mastery of information. Evan looked at Lear and asked: "The gunpowder weapon is just a means of goblin. Their nuclear bombs have nothing to do with gunpowder. Similarly, they The machine uses oil. Do you have any way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Masters took a moment and they didn’t expect King’s Majesty’s technology for Goblin to have such research. . Lear hurriedly said: "Please don't worry if you are kneeling. We have experimented with the use of a blockade to respond to a goblin. They can ignite torches, but they can't burn machines and fire. As for their nuclear weapons, because of their nuclear weapons, The propulsion and flight methods have been blocked by us and cannot be launched at all. Without a trebuchet, the hard stone ball will not pose a threat to the city wall, which will guarantee our safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Evan nodded and said in an admirable tone: "I believe that the thoughts of the wise men of the Masters Association will not cause any loopholes. Are we starting the squad now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, before letting the goblin self-destruction. We must protect ourselves from accidental injury to goblin weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * The teachers recited the spells in turn, and resonated their magic with the law. The gems on the statue illuminate one by one, and the lines of the array radiate a faint glow. Lear is about to recite the spell that belongs to him. But the brow was wrinkled and the sleeves were awkward. The other mages also stopped and looked at him with inquiries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't stop, I just arrived. I missed the start, but I don't have to bother with the crowd and demonstrate it again from the beginning." Siegel from the highest The layer's window flew in and floated down the bottom of the tower. He smiled at the association's mages, and then saluted Evan with aristocratic etiquette: "His Majesty, please forgive me for my sudden arrival. I am really curious about the magical achievements of the association mages, so come and observe. I took the secret If you can check it out, you should save some effort when you cast your spells. Of course, if there is anything I can do to help, I will be willing to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, you are staying by my side. Don't mess around." Evan pointed to his side, and a guardian took a step back and gave Siegel a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long time no see, Marquis of Siegel, your magical ability is refined." Lear smiled and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the Master of the Association, please don't call me the Marquis, just call me the sorcerer. My title is the kingdom of the stars, the association... ..."" Siegel smiled and shifted the topic: "Not long ago, there was a lich who was instructed by people. It was a big trouble for the Federation and the city of Mire. I managed to settle him. Can this not be exercised? Everyone If you know that the lich is in a hurry, you can continue to resurrect. So I also deliberately went to a paradise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the association’s mages nodded, Hum, said: "Go to the paradise is a safe way, the crazy lich can cause a lot of damage, can not simply kill it. If the Siegel sergeant then contact the morning temple and association, of course There are also ways to completely eliminate the hidden dangers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I naturally think that way too. But the help of the morning temple is too late, so I have to go to the paradise. Through the blazing god Help, the vines and the melons also destroyed the life, but I don’t know why this position is It was in the Tongtian Tower. The lich shouted a person’s name before dying, let me avenge him.” Siegel’s words turned and looked directly at Lear: “Why did Lion King Alexander call you? Name, let me find you revenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
