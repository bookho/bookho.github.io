			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as it is an entity, it is impossible to survive with only one point. Siegel oscillates the space and applies the power to the extreme, which achieves this effect in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The force field quickly rebounded and suddenly became a huge ball with a radius of ten meters. Siegel had been prepared to use the elf's pace to accelerate back and forth, and this was not knocked over. Inside the ball, Chanem became a group of black muddy water, which was constantly creeping and recovering. He slowly formed like a clay monster, growing his limbs and his head from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the force field was restored to its original size, Chanem returned to normal, watching Siegel with an appreciative look: "You have taken your position." The indication is very clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discover the power of the enemy’s whereabouts, the power of imprisonment, the power to destroy and the power to keep the captivity, they can be combined without stopping Kill Chanem until he has no ability to recover. Siegel used this method to conduct demonstrations so that Chanem could understand his situation. At this point, the sacred person who is well versed in planning will understand it when he thinks about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have an advantage now," Siegel said. "I hope you remember this and consider the risks of breaching the promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, I am not stupid." Chanem shrugged his shoulders and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel released the prison of force and liberated the Holy One of the murder god. Chanem moved his limbs and let the bones scream. He looked at the spherical crater that was detected around him, and the terrible process of compressing the space to the extreme made him feel a guilty conscience. With magic, the Master can do too many things that ordinary people can't reach, and sometimes even God will have a hint of envy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like the god of magic and prophecy. Among all the gods is the least believer. Even the wizard who uses magic spells rarely believes in him. I will thank this god. But with two powerful priesthoods of magic and prophecy, he ranks among the best in all gods. Even the genius of the god of murder, the success of the layout, the success rate will be greatly discounted because of the other's prophecy. The other party does not need to sort out the ideas of the plan, and only needs to respond to the results and will not fail. Therefore, the god of murder needs to predict the ministry most, or at least to destroy this priesthood. To ensure that your strength is not targeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods have their own fields, and they always do their best in their own fields. In addition to planning, Chanem also has shadows, hides, assassinations, and clay monsters, since he perceives the moment of murder of the Lord God. I started my own project. "I first found the cave and the god of clay, killing the guy who didn't have a brain. I found that until the end it didn't figure out what happened, I thought it was a normal splitting." Chanem to Sieg Er said: "It is not easy to absorb the power of the gods. You must have at least the potential to conform to the rules. I want to absorb the cave priesthood. After all, this can continue to enhance my latent ability. But I did not expect it to be a clay monster. The priesthood is on me. So, the power of the god of magic needs my help, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve the original purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I What I am thinking now is how to find the power of the god of magic, and then I will consider how to do it.” Siegel looked at Chanem and kept taking care of this travel companion. It’s dangerous to walk with a killer. Now it’s the god of killer. How can it be careless? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the gods of magic and prophecy have given up their priesthood, and when the god of mortal world comes to the world, all other gods are full of **, but who I can't find where it is." Chanem walked side by side with Siegel. Just as close as a comrade, but also maintain the right distance like a competitor. He now uses the image of an adventurer with a double sword, and the blue-violet leather armor is simple and capable. Although the murder god has the best recognized planning ability, it is absolutely unusual for Chanem to speak with Siegel in a very direct form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are speculations about these gods that it is impossible to find his power from outside the crystal wall." Chanem said: " The magic and the god of prophecy are stronger, and it is only one aspect. It is impossible to do everything. And often it is not to see what the realm of God is, but the strength of the god itself. Several ethnic gods, and the earth. The mother of the mother and the Lord of the morning. They have many believers and their strength is far stronger than the magic and the god of prophecy. It is unreasonable. We know that the only thing that can affect the divine power is the crystal wall.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We firmly believe that the magical power of the magic god is somewhere in the world, so everyone will drop the saints to find." Channham paused and looked at Siegel: "If it is not for this, who will be forever The end of the world is wasting your own power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there still a scorpion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Chanem’s footsteps paused and he was one step behind. He looked at Siegel's figure and then quickly caught up and said: "Do you know the scorpion? Then you have more than 60% of the scorpion's holder. Don't worry, I am not interested in the scorpion. The power of the creation god does not have much effect on me. If it is the god of destruction, I will raise interest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel does not like the god of murder But I have to admit that his sentence makes sense. According to legend, the power of the murder god came from the ancient god of death, and later split into disputes, murders, and the gods of the dead, respectively governing the causes of mutual killing such as hatred and strife, the way of death, and the country of the deceased. To put it bluntly, it is the cause, the process and the ending. The murderer masters the process, which is the most dynamic stage. It is also the most active of the three gods of death, and the one who is most likely to continue to upgrade himself and become a higher god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of them are completely incompatible with the creation of the world: creating a world that only kills, equals nothing, and the gods will not do this kind of effort. of. Moreover, studying the scorpion has never been the strength of the murder god. How to protect it afterwards is not what he is good at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, all gods have chased the blind, not to mention that you have not done it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I don't deny that I chased my nephew, but my purpose is to kill a few more gods in the process of chasing, or to push them to kill each other. The result is that a mortal seizes the opportunity and is controlled by the balance of the vows. The development of the situation led to my failure." Chanem said: "But now, the more important thing has emerged, that is, to find the power of God, to seize the time to become the god of murder, and to be anti-customer."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard enough about your plan, now let me talk about what to do." Siegel stopped and said to Chanem: "You took me along the way, it is For what, can you say now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To get to an inaccessible place, let you cast magic." Chanem swayed at Siegel , signaled him to keep up. "I have hidden in my cleric ability, you can find me, indicating that you are very talented in finding things. I will give you a little power, from the power of the clay geek, let you use as a casting material. I believe there is With such things, you can position the god of magic and knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this method works?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is based on my speculation, with a success rate of more than 80%." Chanem said: "Only using magic to find, only divine power can be found. So the two restrictions are in the crystal The best choice for hiding things inside the wall. The crystal wall will limit the power, and he used to be a magical god. He has an absolute advantage in this field. The two constraints are converging, and even the magic master like the Elven Saint is helpless. This is already the most likely inference I have made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at Chanem and has a new understanding of his reasoning ability. . If there is no danger of being shackled at any time, Chanem is definitely a good partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have noticed Siegel’s thoughts, Chanem said: “Don’t worry too much, this will affect your state. You will treat me as a The demon summoned, signed a contract with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, there is no contract."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Power is," said Chennam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the limitations of the rule of the crystal wall, if you bring the power directly to your body, you will be greatly oppressed, and one-tenth of the total strength can be achieved. It is. Only the stupid god of clay likes to devour things and does not know how to give up, which causes the power to receive compression, which is then exploited by Chanem. After killing the god of clay, Chanem stored its power in a canyon and concealed it with his hidden priesthood. In fact, this is what Siegel used to detect with the Lord of the Rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The canyon stretches in front of them until the lingering east, seemingly a peaceful and quiet country, with fertile black soil outside, a wide and soothing river, and There are lakes that are bright and mirrored in the sun. Barley, wheat and corn are fruitful in the fields, and the hard-working farmers are happily working in the fields. The saints of the murder god walked by them, and these hospitable people also greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
