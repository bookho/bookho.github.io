			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the four riders of the Black Blood Castle left, the Prince did not appear. The city wall suddenly dropped the snow, and at first it was only a small and cool little snow spot, which slowly turned into a snow film that was disturbed. Looking out from the camp, everything is lost in the sky. The banquet should be over at this time, and there are only three or four drunken drunks in the snow to sleep in the snow - they missed the whole show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd sneered at the actions of the Schlint family and said that they were “uncultivated country aristocrats who had lost basic courtesy under the influence of the orcs” . Mercenaries are not as serious as politeness, they are more concerned about the threat of the orc vanguard. They dare not directly face the question of Count Todd, they can only whisper behind the back, and convey plausible messages to each other. But the next day there was an order from the prince's camp: everyone packed up and began to descend after the day after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some mercenaries think that time is still early, still boring around the camp. However, there have been a few savvy hired knights who began to pack their clothes in silence. They put the weapons on the outside, brought more food, and took out the long-lasting armor and cleaned them, then put them under the coat. Soon, everyone has the same kind of learning, and the camp is busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd is discussing military affairs with Baron Bill and several other aristocrats. The gates of the camp have been closed and no one can get close. Siegel is not in the invitation of this meeting, he is also happy to be clean. Because of the existence of the key space, Siegel can carry far more than others' supplies. The premise is that he has to sort out the debris in the space, especially Evan later threw in some messy things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called Janet, pulled the tent up and opened the key space in a hidden place. The first is a few books, this is the best sorting, there are spell books and test notes, which record the knowledge of the blood magician. This is the most valuable treasure for Siegel, but it takes time to study it and it can only be put aside. Some bottles and cans are scattered in the space, containing unknown chemicals and powder. These things seem to be full of danger, or wait until you find an alchemist to study. There are no gold coins in the blood magician's possessions. There are only five silver ingots of length and length – both as wealth and as a material for making magical arrays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, several reels and two spell wands are probably the biggest gains. Unlike the wand, the spell wand is used to store magical energy. There is a magical array formed. The user only needs to use the last part of the spell to trigger the energy inside and display the specific spell. Although the wizard will use magic when using magic spells, the magic effect will be different, but the spell stick will mostly abandon the personality, choose to use the simplest and most effective magic array to release the spell. In this way, the wizard can understand the function and trigger of the spell wand as soon as he gets started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flash burst and dispel magic, a good spell." Siegel carried the spell wand with him. He looked at Janet and suddenly had an idea. As a person who is bleeding from the blood of the demon, will there be enough magical affinity to use the spell wand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet, I teach you how to read the last trigger spell, you can try to use the flash burst." Siegel handed the spell stick to her And then carefully teach her the gesture of aiming. Janet was very nervous, holding the handcuffs of the curse stick as if it were a dangerous thing. "I am not a mage, or do not learn. I heard that the things that tamper with the mage will be cursed and become ugly monsters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You rest assured, No. I am next to you, there is no danger.” Siegel comforted her and said: “Don’t forget to close your eyes after the release. This is a glare spell.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet swallowed and pointed the spell stick to the unmanned place as directed by Siegel. When doing spies, Janet also drank magical potions, such as light medicines and invisible potions. Compared with the use of a spell wand, the potion only needs to endure the weird taste and then swallow it, it will not make her feel so nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wright...Blas?" The voice of her spell was a little trembling, but the pronunciation was correct. In the area where the curse rod is aimed, there is a dust appearing out of thin air, shining with a beautiful silver light. Siegel shouted "Close your eyes!" Then the dust burned fiercely, like the midday sun suddenly appeared in the tent. In an instant, all the shadows are dispelled, and even if you close your eyes, you can feel white outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flash is fierce and disappears quickly, and after a few seconds the light returns to its previous level. "Really good, Janet, you can really evoke the energy of the spell wand." Siegel was very happy, because it means that the kitten has a certain defense. The flash burst has no lethality, but it can make the enemy blind, which is a very good auxiliary spell. After Siegel learned to make a spell wand, he will definitely prepare a set of protective spells for Janet. The city wall mountains will soon become a battlefield with the orcs, and more means are always good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you don't put it in an isolated space, the spell wand can slowly recover energy. The upper limit is three times in a row, but it can be used once in seven or eight hours." Siegel picks up the magic spell wand, this one I will not hand it to Janet. "I can use this spell twice a day. As long as you know the spell type of the opponent, you can try to offset or suppress the effect. This requires the corresponding magic knowledge, I will not give you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be yours, I am not a mage." Janet replied: "You see my hand is still shaking now, how is it getting colder and colder? Can you prepare some hot things for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel reached out and touched Janet's forehead, only feeling like ice and snow. "Are you sick, I went to Dr. Rees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't go, I just feel very weak." Janet put the spell stick away, Siegel’s help was done, and a thick cloak was put on it. "I feel empty and need to eat something. It's really cool at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I will prepare for you right away." I was very worried. He quickly raised the bonfire and then asked the person responsible for preparing the supplies for the nobles to have a small can of good wine and pour it into the pot. He then placed the kettle on the fire and inserted a few potatoes next to the fire. "I saw that they still have honey, wait for me to get it. You look at the wine, don't let it be boiled, just heat it up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he finished, he left the tent and went straight to Dr. Rees. He left the demon Raven to the door, so that he could always know Janet's situation. There was a rare busy scene in the camp. Many people gathered at the supply officer to ask for supplies and disputed a blanket or pockets. Siegel squeezed through among these people, only to find that the doctor's tent was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person he passed by: "Do you know where the doctor is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I saw him go to Evan-Golden after the party.” The man then asked: “Do you have any extra warm shoes?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. If you don't, you can make a pair with thick fur." ​​Siegel opened him and went to the place where Avon lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Siegel found Evan, he was igniting the stew. While stirring the pot with a long wooden spoon, he whispered and said: "I want to say that it is best to eat when the snow is flying. I say it must be a hot stew. Physician, if you don't eat more, Downhill will soon have no strength. Besides, there may be orcs in the mountains, and the tribes on the Great Plains must have hid. It is difficult to eat real food. The food in the basket is delicious. But there is always a strange feeling when you eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When do you have a strange feeling?" asked Reese, with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just two days. Maybe it’s too many times I have eaten the basket.” Avon saw Siegel coming and his face was exposed. Smiling, while welcoming him, he gave him a bowl of stew. The physician lowered his head and squinted at Evan – he had to judge whether the blood transfusion was completely successful. The fate of the true king is a powerful force among the mortal, and no one can see it except some powerful gods. However, the blood can be investigated and mastered. It is a feasible means to influence the line of destiny through this means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan, wait and eat again. I came to the doctor." Siegel did not hesitate. After he came in, he said, "Janet, that is Another person who was drawn blood, her body became very weak, cold, as if she was frozen from the inside out. Do you have any means?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Before waiting for the doctor to answer, Evan said: "This is the same as after I have finished the operation. Physician, the kind of medicine you gave me is very useful. After drinking, my spirit has recovered a lot, even feeling It’s stronger than before.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course, that is the medicine used to stabilize and strengthen the blood, it will naturally work. Dr. Reese thought, ‘The stupid blood mage Meg is only trying to capture the blood. Only the blood-enhancing agent he created is a real good thing. It is just right to warm the blood of the king. What is Janet? The mistress of the little baron. The aftermath of the blood-scraping magic can kill her in two days, and it’s a hundred. 'Think of this, he said: "I need to be ready for the pharmacy, I need to wait for my day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, give her whatever medicine to deal with. Just fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
