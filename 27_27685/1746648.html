			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents of Heim’s collar learned the news of the victory and experienced a state of error, surprise and surprise. Being able to continue to be calm and undisturbed is the hope of every civilian. A war with the great lords of the South began silently and then quickly ended. In addition to letting the drinks in the pub sell better, the villagers had more talks. The biggest advantage was that the humans and the half-orcs became More harmonious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the half-orcs in the stone village, Siegel did not sign the militia. He knew that if the plan he and Janet jointly decided did not succeed, then the militia would not have much effect. Although military service to the lord is an obligation for every civilian, if you can avoid the battlefield and switch to safer labor, no one will feel bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flight is not enough to support Siegel back to the castle, so when he returns to the ground, he summons the phantom. The soldiers led by Herod have all passed the rope bridge. They will return to the southern home through the Ore Avenue under the supervision of the soldiers led by Mana and Zuck. Only a dozen villagers in the Rift Valley were cleaning the battlefield. They harvested thousands of weapons, more than forty horses and various armor. In addition to some well-made weapons, Siegel will collect it and wait for their knights to pay for the redemption. Other things will be awarded to everyone who participated in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the captive cavalry of the captives, they are worth a lot of money, and they can exchange a large ransom from the Viscounts of Dray. But the money is not in the pocket of Siegel. He also has an invisible ally who needs to thank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wahan County has helped a lot this time." Siegel said to Janet: "And it's all that you worked hard to make, it's really amazing." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet smiles, she is more dazzling after marriage, always filled with happy expressions. Her dream finally became a reality, a stable home, a husband who cares for herself, a heroic knight and a courteous gentleman. This is the sweetest dream in the world, so any threat that might destroy this beauty will be eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Uther family is powerful, but they are not without enemies. Even if you can't find an enemy, you can make one for them. Janet thought of a family of Baron Oles Hugel, who had been obscured in Vaughan County. Although they mainly planted barley and sugar beets, they have been whispering in the southern aristocracy, but it does not mean that they have no ambitions. If the Uther family occupied the Heim collar, then Vaughan County was completely sandwiched. There is never a day to go. Janet thought of this, so he pulled the baron Hugel and asked him to give the prince Uther a scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan, planned by Janet, Fazak's plan has achieved miraculous effects, so Siegel has long known the route in the Rift Valley. Know that Hilo leads the army's most vulnerable position. He only needs to make sure that the Viscount is on the hook, and then wait for the opportunity to ambush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The things in Warne County still need to be kept secret, Baron Oles hopes to pass any rumors." Janet said with a smile: "He is very careful." Such a partner is worth training."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cultivate?" Siegel also smiled: "You think our Heim collar is strong enough to Are you training other territories?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sooner or later." Janet blinked, carrying a skirt and leaping away from the front of Siegel. "After the fight, do you still have strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After seeing the blood, I really need a woman."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This event, which was called a "day war" by the troubadour, was widely circulated in the South and was also written into poetry. In it. Lord Siegel appeared in both battlefields at the same time, commanding the Orcs and the human mana to defeat the enemies who came to attack. However, it is very clear to everyone that the Drey Uther family in the southern aristocracy is still not contemptible, so they changed the reason for the end of the war: because the heroic of the Siegel Baron moved the Viscount, the two sides carried out like aristocrats. Conversation, and finally decided to stop the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dramatic process adds a lot of good passages to poetry, but in order to find the right rhyme, it also breaks the minds of the poets - but this is just life An episode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim’s collar finally has a chance to breathe and develop, and the fame gained in the “Day of the Day” has also brought many knights here. After seeing the beautiful city of Miele, many knights found Siegel and wanted to swear allegiance to him. Siegel took in their knights as territories. But the Guard and the militia were not handed over to them. Zucker and Mana are still his most trusted people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Guardian Cavaliers are an honor." The kitten said: "They don't want anything more, just this one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being good is a Siegel Advantages - although Sir Bill will have some objections to this. But he is not around now. After leaving the Cavaliers, there were also many craftsmen, businessmen and honest farmers. They thought that Heim would take the opportunity to see if he could find a good life. The population of Heim’s collar began to rise, and the manpower and production capacity of the gold mines also increased, which also greatly promoted business and consumption within the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stable development of the territory means that Siegel’s life has become very regular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor has completed the most basic combat training, and its endurance, strength and swordsmanship have a certain foundation, so Siegel began to find him and teach him Martial arts. Perhaps it is the life of the Master who has exercised Siegel's mind and computing power, and in the battle he becomes more efficient and harder to hit. On the contrary, Moore is stiff and sore every day, and sleeps with bruises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such training has benefited young attendants, he quickly improved, and soon he can learn more with the new knight. Fitzak saw this in his eyes and knew that there was finally a hope for the Cavaliers at home, and the work was even harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stewards of the Territory have not been there, but Janet took the matter up and Fazak finally got a lot easier. He came to Sigel today to report a covert investigation arranged a while ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Siegel Baron, New World In the past decade, there have been three places where earthquakes have occurred frequently. Apart from the Rift Valley near us, the Northern Wilderness Earthquakes often occur in the Remnant Hills and Elven Forests. But these two places are only recorded because they are inhabited, and it is difficult to say whether there is an earthquake in the wilderness of no one."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and explained a few words about the territory, letting Fazak leave. He does not want anyone to see his worries. After the warrior's widow was shipped back, Siegel quickly began research on it driven by interest. There is nothing special about itself. It is made only from the most common human corpses. All its power comes from the pattern on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new kind of power system, there is no way to start, the use of parsing spells, deciphering ciphers and other spells have no effect. Siegel also brought the cockroach to the front of the Capricorn, but the dragon girl just shook his head and could not do anything about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time passed, the pattern on the cockroach began to melt, like a rusty iron, and the bones followed. The erosion of the four elements of the ground, the wind and the fire, shows the power, and it is believed that this cockroach will become dust and disappear into the world in the near future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing Siegel can do is to carefully record the pattern of the whole body and leave it for further study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Siegel lived a life of exercise, learning, applying spells to build castles and adjudicating territorial disputes, temporarily putting those disturbing outside the territory. Things are left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When using the long sword, he is a good warrior, and many are not his opponents. However, Siegel knows that because he is the lord, many knights will not really use their full strength. Only the half-orc, Keke, would not be merciless. He broke Siegel's nose several times and left a big and small bruise on him - but he couldn't go anywhere, and his face was as miserable. Only from the wilderness of the north, people who struggle for survival all day will be so straightforward. So Siegel said to the knights: "I am a mage, but if your swordsmanship is not as good as me, how can you be called a real knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Then he will leave the training ground and return to the huge body of the city. After a few months of hard work, in the autumn, all the outer walls of the castle were finally built, the room was divided, and the rest of the work was basically inside. The Dwarf Runners use the rigorous runes throughout their enthusiasm to make every place resistant to the trebuchet. Fortunately, the gold mine of the Zebra Mountain can support the cost of the castle, and Siegel also learns the knowledge of the runes from the dwarf. Now inside the castle, there are shadows of the dwarfs moving around. The Capricorn is in a hurry. After the exterior wall is repaired, it flies back to St. Joseph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows how to get her back, just make a large collection of elements to do. In the corner of the castle, in a Siegel study, a large rune-magic array is being designed. This is the crystallization of his magical learning in recent times, and he is also preparing for his own construction of the magic tower. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
