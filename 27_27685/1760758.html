			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The konjac comes from the mechanical plane of absolute order. He may run away because he is bored with monotonous work, but he will never lie. Especially when they are very certain about one thing, be sure to keep it in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel came to the library, and the left-handed mage looked up at him and he was free. The books kept here are not the basic mantras of the general mages, but the deeper, more isolated and precious knowledge. Siegel found several books that recorded information about the devil, and began reading with the brilliance of the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil lives in the nine layers of hell, living in the pyramid-like rigorous structure of hundreds of millions of devils. From the lowest inferior demon - no brain, can only accept the slavery of other people's soul command - to the powerful deep prison refining, a powerful, proficient invisible and fireball, can freely summon the devil and call other devils Assisted in purgatory command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this ruling chain, the bones are in the middle, often playing the role of a police or spy. They are proficient in the use of illusions, and invisibility is a good show. When necessary, the Bone Demon can cast a fear aura and inject a toxin into the enemy with a scorpion-like tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this book called "Infernal Devil's Detailed Explanation", Siegel found a portrait of the bone demon. The author paints the appearance of this monster with a vivid and flexible stroke. He also stated below the portrait: The bone devil is very hateful to the living things, and once it is encountered, it will launch a ruthless attack, not a good summoning object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel does not want to summon a devil at the moment, his eyes are fixed on the picture. Janet will be this kind of thing on the image? He can't believe it, and he doesn't want to believe it. There must be something wrong, Siegel thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully recalled what happened in the past, the bones of the devil seemed to have seen him from somewhere. I remember coming out of the Prison Dragon Valley. Her body had changed since the ischemia was very weak. At that time, the hands were like the claws of the bones! After that? There seems to be another time, Siegel also saw a similar scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage closed the book and opened the next one, looking for a spell about discovering the devil and controlling the devil. Usually he always has a strong sense of closeness to the spell. Never think that learning magic will make him tired. But today he couldn't stand it anymore. The spell in front of him was like a viper, vomiting his tongue and not wanting him to come close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is bored. How can I read the book again? Siegel left the library angrily, returned to the castle, and met the Capricorn in the middle of the road. The dragon girl is holding a new long dress in her hand and is curiously looking at the glittering decoration. The skirt is very obvious in the southern style, and it may be that Fazak picked out the spoils. Siegel didn't think about why some people in the army still carry women's clothing. He just wants to know the situation of Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of Capricorn, and took the dragon girl’s gaze away from the skirt, then softly asked: “You have been with Janet. "Yes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, isn't this what you told me?" Capricorn had some doubts. Siegel is very close to her, she can clearly feel the power of the Master. In addition to the elemental magical fluctuations, it seems that there is still a strong electric energy from his body. This is very strange, only the blue dragon with lightning protection has this feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jinette...Is she still okay during my absence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes good, Sometimes it's not very good." Capricorn shook his head, his hair swayed gently: "I told her. Your strange raven didn't die, it means you have nothing, but she still sighs. Sometimes Not much to eat, sleep less. In addition, it is the pain caused by your child. I want to say, it is convenient to lay eggs, at least not in the stomach."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s lips twitched slightly, seemingly hesitant, but he still asked: “You have the keenness of the dragon, please tell me. Have you found out in Janet? "The devil's breath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Always there." Capricorn shrugged her shoulders: "She is a demon, it will be deformed, sometimes it will Showing the smell of the devil. Especially once, she seems to be unable to control the deformation. Both hands and feet become skinny, the tail grows out and becomes a little ..? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp does not look good for which I also used the spell, her nerves I performed good bar "<br <br /> & nbsp />;The dragon girl thought that there was something wrong with Siegel and waited for a while. The mage stood a little bit opposite her. There is no opening in the half ring. Capricorn felt bored, spit his tongue out, holding a long skirt, bending his body and slipping away from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am too big, Siegel is very upset about myself, I should have noticed Janet’s situation. The blood magician's spell is not so easy to remove, Janet must have been cursed. He has twenty scorpions, and he can become a sly look. Blood magic has little effect on him. But Janet is a demon, and she has the blood of the devil in her body, causing subsequent reactions. She was able to transform, indicating that her physical condition was originally unstable. Everyone is used to maintaining human appearance for a long time, but she was originally a magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought of the deformed mage who had just defeated. In Felton’s strong body, he was actually a thin, dry, malnourished person. Janet has been suffering this kind of torture, but I have no concern. This is my territory, my site! There are half-orcs, gnomes, dwarves, elves, and gossips that go back and forth. Even elemental creatures can move freely. Why not let her restore the true body of the demon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet is the lord's wife, what about her being a demon? The Mage Federation, other lords, including local residents, what can their views be? Why haven't you thought of this for a long time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel recalls Janet’s past and thinks about the kitten’s greatest wish: she wants a safe, warm home. But one still needs to hang up the disguise, even the home that the real body can't show, how safe and warm? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of everything is in the blood magician, his spells have induced this, but Siegel thinks that he can't take responsibility. He clenched his fists hard and knocked his forehead heavily. She still has children! Siegel's annoyed thoughts were as weak as when he had just escaped from the blood magician. The burden of pregnancy would further consume her physical strength, as well as the work of the territory, so there would be no control. Siegel felt that the blood vessels were beating on his forehead, and he understood that he had neglected the feelings of the people around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maid ran down the stairs and looked flustered. what is her name? Siegel found that he did not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Lord Lord, the wife is born! The maid hurriedly raised her head to answer. But the steps didn't stop: "I am going to find a midwife, and my wife is going to find a magic statue like Rhett. Lord Lord, you can go over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Geer stumbled into the bedroom, what the elf pace. Any arbitrary door, all left behind. Janet was lying on the bed, the maid took the pillow pad behind her, and tried to clean the sheets that were wet with amniotic fluid. When I saw Siegel, Janet smiled happily: "You come so fast. I thought you were in the study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to his study! Siegel blurted out: "I am not a mage now, not a lord, just your husband."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitten laughed happily: "After a while, you will When the father is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet, I know that having a child is a very dangerous thing, I will not treat the magic, I can't help. I I hope that you can take care of yourself. Don't use the deformability anymore, use your true body to get through this difficulty. It is also necessary to know that maintaining deformation will consume energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Janet uses his eyes to indicate the maids around him, and the meaning is very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel showed her a smile and said: "This is our home, what do you do with others. I only hope that you can be good." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet has a red face. Siegel said with a hand: "Okay! I know. I am very comfortable now, don't worry about it. You look here, these servants will be nervous, hands and feet are not flexible. You hurry to go out Let's leave these women here, don't bother us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can't help, can only move the chair, sit Anxiously waiting in the corridor. He couldn't help but take out the pipe, and then found that there was no mood. The only thing around him that could attract him was the movement on the other side of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels like a idle person, everyone else is busy. Only when you need to boil water or take something. He is only useful, he can use magic to complete tasks quickly. At this moment, he felt a wave of magic and immediately alerted him. No one can disturb Janet at this time! Siegel pulled out his wand. The spell of the attack is on the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
