"Things are on the matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it important?" Janet worried about hiding and smiled and asked Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not." Siegel took Janet’s hand and kissed her fingertips, then said, “Is this research life-and-death? I don't think so. I found a new direction for magic and magic creation. I expected it to open a whole new world to me. I really want to know what is behind the charged metal door. Now I am inspired. The situation is very good, but I don't know how long it will last."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held his wife in his arms and comforted her: "I know that after I enter focus, I will What it is like, everything around it seems to be thrown to the end of the world, far away from me. But you can rest assured that with you and Isaac, I will always find a way back to reality. I need to temporarily throw away other things. Focus on the research at hand. I want to help you with this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet kisses his mouth and then pinches his hand The meat on the cheeks of Siegel screamed hard: "Ah, I understand, you It will be easy to hide. Remember, this is why you throw us both and go to the magic play! Pay such a big price, don't come back empty-handed! Our mother needs compensation when they arrive."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and nodded: "The things in the Territory are handed over to you, let Isaac as the lord, and you and Mana will pick things up. Raven Barron Beside Isaac, you can use it to contact me, but it is not very important to try not to use the soul connection of the magic pet. Barron can handle the operations related to the territory and the magic of the castle, I have printed knowledge on its brain. Go inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can, it will still come out one month. The knights of the Territory and the wizards of the Federation will see you really." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK, I remember as much as possible." Siegel thought for a moment, and finally replied: "Unless the Mora will be the big temple of their dwarfs." The priest or Elinette sent to Heim, otherwise there is only one sentence for them: I am in the retreat Research, wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The development of the territory is booming, the knights have great confidence. The merchants are seeking to cooperate with us, you can rest assured "The practicer." Janet supported him as before: "You are more important than everything you do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no Heim collar Siegel simply did not have enough funds to support him in magic research; but if there is no Janet. It is also impossible for him to draw his energy into the research. Accelerating the metal with continuous lightning, this phenomenon caught the attention of Siegel. He knows that lightning can bring light and heat, but brings the ability to move objects? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters focus on the effects of the force field, from the simplest of the wizard's hand to move the light and small objects, to the telecontrol, mind and mind. In fact, they are all within the scope of the use of force field spells. In terms of attacking spells, all kinds of force field punches, bodyguards, and the most powerful, pink palms that can fall from the sky are the development of force field spells. Lightning, flames, acid and ice have been used by the Master to attack directly, using their most direct manifestations. Since goblins can use fire-related explosive capabilities to create "guns", Siegel can use a certain ability of lightning to accelerate objects, so is acid and ice also undiscovered? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea was recorded by him as a future research direction, and now he is also focusing on the current to drive the warhead. The accelerating ability of the rotating current is named by him - this is purely a coincidence of the translation of various languages ​​in the multiverse - a diffuse variant of a directional force field. He has not yet pondered the relationship between this and the characteristics of the compass, but strives to accelerate the limits of the same items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the absence of explosives at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater the power of lightning, the tighter the rotation. The better the acceleration effect. But powerful and dense lightning brings more unstable light and heat. The substances that can guide the current, iron, copper, gold, and silver, although they last for a long time, will eventually be melted, without exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only fine gold persists. Siegel believes that although the fine gold is called indestructible, it still has a critical point of destruction. But this critical point is still safe now, and the Master's use of lightning power has not touched this critical point. Siegel uses fine gold as an electrical conductor, sequesters it with a sturdy insulating glue, and uses the dwarf rune to shift the wear and tear of the item - if this thing consumes fine gold, its cost will make it lose its actual value - Use the Mire nuclear to provide energy for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is this the end point? Siegel thinks this is just getting started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed, he pursues the fastest, at least to achieve his own extreme. The first spell used above is shadowing, a way for the caster to move faster by moving to the shadow world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there is a shadow, there is a shadow, which is closely related to the main material world, but the world is lighter and thinner. Just like the air to the water. The shadows and shadow jumps used by the assassins of the murder gods are all effected by the shadows. The shadows and shadow monsters that will be active are also the products of the film world. One feature of the film world is acceleration. With the power of normal walking, you can reach about ten times the speed in the shadow world, which may be applied to the current weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other spells, such as light spells, can reduce the weight of an object and increase speed, but don't know why antigravity spells don't have the same effect. Acceleration can't be used to display items, and its main purpose is to speed up the frequency of people's active actions. The warheads are not active, and the idea of ​​spells is incompatible. So Siegel abandoned the idea of ​​modifying acceleration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept that speed and space are always linked, and Siegel tries to use telemetry to distort the space so that the bullet hits the target at maximum speed as soon as the bullet accelerates. . This is not difficult to achieve, the transmission array of the secret city can be done. But the transmission is two-way, and it is not a good idea to get closer to the enemy, unless it is to strike a place where the line is not enough - this can be written for later use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullets he has studied so far are already too fast, and they are good in the force field. Once they are out of acceleration, the bullets collide with the gas elements, which will produce Huge heat, then melt yourself. Steel can last longer. If Kegel wants to push this weapon to the limit, he needs to find a solution to the problem of frictional resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of this step in research is not just as simple as making weapons. There are countless ways to kill Serge. He can use his Necromancer spells to take his life with one finger, and he can take away his soul by shouting, and even kill in a dream. Can you integrate what you have learned, whether you can push it to the limit, and whether you can make your ideas broader and more unrestricted. This is the purpose of Siegel now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the Array, he can take the air element inside the barrel. Using the mind to move can give the warhead a preliminary impetus to start the movement. Then Siegel uses the tactics to bring in the power of the shadows, giving the warhead a momentary acceleration, and then it will be taken over by the power of the electromagnetic circle and continue to push. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel tried again and again, but because it could not take over the flight process after the warhead was fired, the factors affecting speed and power were concentrated on the barrel and warhead. The shape and material. After numerous selections, the narrow needle structure with a narrow split at the end has become the best choice. Fine gold is still the most sturdy and stable material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't really use fine gold as a warhead, such a cost is terrible." Siegel directly hit the idea to the higher creations, after all, Many workshops in the territory have used this method to save costs. The more precious things last in the higher creations, the shorter the time, like the fine gold, according to the ability of Siegel, it will last for 1 minute and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far can you fly in a minute and a half? How far can this weapon be? In the next few months, Siegel created a big guy with a diameter of 1 meter in a very meticulous process, and then reduced its size with a constant effect of the shrinkage to achieve a higher disguise. Accuracy and increased density of fine gold coils – along with weight reduction. He envisioned an object that fired a temporary contraction, so that it would be emitted. After the maximum speed is obtained, the shrinkage disappears and the weight can be suddenly increased while retaining the speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would greatly increase the power, and it would be more terrible than using a mountain alone. But the contraction spell can't work on what the creation made, but it will directly dispel the spell. Therefore, the conventional weapon can only be a fine gold warhead of the original size. But he remembered this idea: using a shrinking warhead to launch, but precisely controlling the end time of the shrinkage effect is a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experiment did not alarm anyone, even Janet did not say. He chose a dark night with wind and rain. The rising water vapor is like a dense fog. If you don't use the vision, you can't see how far. There was no one on the streets of Heim’s collar, and only the patrols on duty had no choice but to perform their duties. No one will notice Siegel. Moreover, he walked in the shadows, leaving only a vague shadow in the drizzle of rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
