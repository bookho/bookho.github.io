These people arrived at dusk. At that time, there was no black. It is reasonable to say that they should continue to go to the next village and will not harass them. But these people stopped and knocked on the first house at the entrance to the village and asked to rent the yard and the firewood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is about 30 miles from Sol, and if he walks, he can catch up before midnight. But carrying a horse?" "Yao En pushed the glasses and looked at Siegel with a strange look: "Jie, are you not worried?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Immature martial arts And the immature mind, which one is more worrying?" Siegel patted his horse and let it go under the eaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yao En nodded and no longer persuaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never seen you two before, where did you make a living?" Ai Meng asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When training liàn, there are more time, less time to come out, and trouble for everyone." Siegel replied. "It will cool down tonight, there may be light rain, so give the horse a few eggs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My rucksack is gone, the rest A few broke in the afternoon. Jay, you have to go to the village to have a few."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and left the courtyard to four. Group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unnamed village has only seven huts, the kind of huts that are built on wood, tied up with hemp rope, and covered with thick mats. When the wind blows, it shakes, and when the rain drops, it plays. Siegel would rather sleep in the open air than stay overnight, and he always thought of the leaking ship that was about to sink in the raging waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so. The people here are still tightly blocking the door. I am afraid that a stranger with a martial arts will break into qù. Take away something they are looking for. Siegel turned around in the village and did not find the chicken house, so he could not buy eggs. However, he found that more than 20 sheep were circled in a wooden fence. An old man was at the door and watched Siegel with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing you want, go, stranger." An old man waved in the air with a walking stick and drove Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to find a few eggs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the sheepfold?" The old man said: "You are crazy than the witch. Go away, go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel grin, the knife on his face trembled, then hòu Turn around and leave. He couldn't take a long time around the village, and returned to the resting courtyard with empty hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You haven't found anything?" Ai Meng looked at him strangely, but hòu took a photo of Naria and said, "Come on, go. This is also a fool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naria smiled and sorted out the brown robes on her body, then hòu went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knife face. Learn how to get it. Naria must be able to come back with eggs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a magician, of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. She is just very attractive." Ai Meng replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Naria came back with a small bag containing a dozen eggs. After each horse eats one, the rest can be added to dinner. Naria is doing her work calmly. Imon is constantly squinting at Siegel. It seems to say, "Look, what am I saying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you find the egg?" Siegel asked her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and remembered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anomen prayed while maintaining the armor, Yao En was responsible for cooking, and loved to remove firewood from the horseback and take care of the fire. The bread was forked and grilled around the fire. A small pot of egg-filled soup rack was on the fire, and a lot of ale was added to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not venture out often? Just like your partner?" Yao En slowly stirred the soup and allowed it to heat up as quickly as possible. When I was intermittent, I asked Siegel, who was sitting on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have more time in the wilderness, and I rarely stay in a village without a hotel." Siegel replied: "I found myself not Na The charm of the ria."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people in the village can tell if you are a group of them, you obviously don't have that taste." Yao En said: "Sor is a man. He is very good. I can see that he is definitely a reliable guy in the battle. You are silent, but your heart is very firm. It seems that there is nothing to make you stunned. Can you tell me? What have you been doing before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I played three wars, two games with the orcs and one with the elves." Siegel said: "I have seen a lot of monsters, undead, beasts and dragons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon!" Ai Meng skipped, holding a long stick and squatting, with curiosity Eyes staring at Siegel: "Have you seen the dragon? Killed? Is there a treasure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only say "Silver survived." Siegel replied: "Rely on the strength of the army to barely win, and dare to go deep into the dragon's lair. Besides, the dragon is not a space bag that moves dòng, and does not have the habit of bringing treasure to the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that the dragon will become a rich man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"will die." Siegel persuaded her . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, I am not stupid!" Ai Meng snorted: "You are not worried about your companion at all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worried." Siegel said: "I am worried that he will not be able to arrive in time, and the latter will lack one person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Loved the screaming screaming gangster, frowning at Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be alive, he is joking for you." Naria microxia said: "The firewood is going out, everyone is going to eat." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner is a soup of smoked fish, scallops and turnips, plus warm bread and a few garlic. Naria opened the space bag, and each person divided a piece of oily bacon, which was bought on the day of departure with the money of "Sol". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a need to watch the night, I will be the first class." Arnold said: "I love you to accompany me. The second class is Yao En." And Jay. Naria needs more rest, and you can sleep well tonight.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No problem.” Siegel’s hand: “Yes Anything can wake me up at any time. I need less sleep time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rainbow Light and the Secret can be combined as a replacement, as a replacement He wore a life ring under the leather gloves. Every day he only needs two hours of rest to regain his spirit, and with meditation, this time can continue to shorten. In order not to attract attention, he wore a thick blanket and hid in a sheltered firewood house, closing his eyes and breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When awake people can use the brazier for warmth, drink a heated drink, such as ale or tea, which is one of the rare benefits of the night watchman. Arnold ended his whispering prayer and began telling Emmon about the story of Mother Earth. The half-elves are obviously absent-minded, always staring at the thick night outside and watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights in the cottage began to go out, which is earlier than the secret of any village in the city of Gore or Heim, as if late at night. Evan is definitely still on the road, but can he arrive in time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several wolves in the wilderness, but hòu is the song of the nightingale. "Occasionally, a few wolves can't be counted." Arnold's comforted her: "Saul's skill is better than you want to xiàng."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
