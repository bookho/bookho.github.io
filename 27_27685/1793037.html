			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of the Federation is passionate about the construction of the magic ship with a hundred times of enthusiasm. The secret nuclear core with the construction drawings will change the world. Siegel’s reputation was greatly enhanced in the Federation, and some even proposed to name the magic ship the Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an honor, but it sounds weird." Siegel replied: "I don't want to be stepped on by you all day, letting you in your stomach." Are you going to fly around with you? Even the dragons of the Magic Wars are not so bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal is gone, The name of the magic ship will be taken when it is completed. If the secret nuclear power is a great pioneering work in which the magical civilization develops to a certain extent, what happens to a civilization without developing magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel had asked himself this question a long time ago, and similar questions include "Where is the Heimer led by the secret nuclear core?" . Even with his intelligence, he can't get the answer that he is convinced. Until now, he finally got some answer to the first question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his plan, a caravan started from Heim, first went to the hub, then went to Deepwater, and finally After swaying on the site of the Jackdaw tribe, I finally sneaked into the top of Mora like a smuggler. He brought in things that the dwarves like, good leather straps (armor straps), tough tendons (strings of bows), some of the best quality coke (smelting and sucking impurities) and some fine wines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They spent some of their earned gold on the market in the Dwarf City, which made Mora’s saga more satisfying. The dwarf's armor and weapons are still the best on the mainland, but now there is a new trend: Heim's collar is grabbing the market at extremely low prices, and their iron seems to be much more expensive than the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravan shopped at the top of Mora, and then contacted the gem clan when the guards did not pay attention, and found the dwarf Elinte directly. Siegel wrote a letter to Irene, which did not mention the names of the two, but enough dwarves to be sure that the caravans in front could be trusted. The disguised smuggling team is now a real smuggling team, and the dwarves have never wanted to let other people know that they have been smuggled out of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s now in Siegel’s lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This absolutely requires confidentiality, and no one can bring these things out of the lab." Siegel said: "Although I don't understand Mora very much." Why do you want to keep these things secret, and I know that these secrets will last for up to half a year. It will become a well-known thing all over the continent - I just want to tell you that if you can't keep it secret, it may affect Elinte. The safety and reputation, I certainly will not allow that kind of thing to happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people nodded. Janet, Mana, Verwood, and Fitzak were the people Siegel invited, and they were curiously watching the big boxes on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These things are called 'just' by the goblin - very strange pronunciation, the dwarf called the gun - that is, it has caused a great loss to the dwarf. You I have seen the bodies that have floated down from the Shield River, and I know the experiments that the Knights of Heim took under the leadership of Mana. This is the reason.” Siegel took out a thick and long cylindrical thing. Comes with two spherical handles. This weapon has no sharp places and no solid structure. It is a strange creation made by tying iron pipes together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of thing is very similar to the bow, used to launch a hard metal warhead. The warhead is divided into two parts, most of which are powders similar to alchemy techniques. It can burn violently, and the other part is the arrow used to attack. I have tried it, and it does contain the ingredients of fine gold, but it is not as strong as the sword of our fine gold processing."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana frowned, and she spent a lot of time and energy researching the cause of the dwarf's death. The mystery is finally revealed. But she couldn't see how the tube in front could do anything. "The Lord Lord, can you demonstrate it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and picked up a "bullet" in his hand. "I found that the thickness of the warhead and the pipe should match. But the things I have on hand are not complete and can't be matched, so I will show you the other way. Weywood, trouble you to run the image to record the crystal ball, capture the action of the warhead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse nodded and took the image recording crystal from Siegel's shelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wywood, listen to my command. After a while, use the concentrated burning fire element to raise the temperature of the second half of the warhead to reach the level of melting lead - this thing needs to be triggered, but the temperature can achieve the same effect." When Geer finished, he picked up his wand and began to recite the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell is very complicated, even those who don't know magic can feel the power of those words. There were no fixed light and small items in the lab that began to tremble. The ink spilled out and left clutter on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock is generated, the space seems to be distorted, and the images passed into the eyes become incoherent, flickering. Verwood was so surprised that he opened his mouth. impossible! He thought: This is the power to distort time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elements, material, divine power, the three complement each other to form the world, forming a set of operational rules, the most complicated of which is the rules of time and space. The power gained from the elements can change the substance, the most basic performances such as burning, and the stronger ones such as the force field, these are magic. The magic throne, after the Master stepped on a step by step, got the power of time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point of time and space is the ** division, and Siegel is just getting started. His elemental energy is strong enough, but the control is not enough to command time to change. He can only use the means of compensation to make time turbulent, so that the speed of its passage is fast and slow, like creating waves in the calm sea. The master who really masters the power can directly let the sea disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel constantly creates shocks, and then narrows the scope of the shock to focus near the force field pipeline. "Get started, Wywood," he said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of fire gather together, drilled along the hole of the force field tube, and carefully avoided the other positions of the warhead, completely concentrated to the back. At the same time, time was suddenly slowed down, the light and heat emitted by the fire element suddenly decreased, and Wywood suddenly had a feeling of being caught in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Focus on attention, now the time flow rate is different from ours, just like making the trolls a mouse hole." Siegel adjusted the spell. While teaching Wywood: "To separate the focus on space, time and space are entangled ropes, using your feelings in transit, to build a new balance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Woodwood knows this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It allows him to experience the power of time and space, which is the area that the sergeant can reach. So instead of thinking about the goblin and the warhead, he simply focused his attention on the spell. The flaming element of the fire is his tentacle of perception, bringing him a new insight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of everyone, the metal in the second half of the warhead is heated. Then suddenly a flash of light! Siegel was prepared to further slow down the flow of time. Although the light becomes very dark, the bullets are ignited enough to make everyone see. They saw that the warhead and the shell were separated. They saw the impact of the explosion pushing the warhead. They understood that the force field's tube limited the direction of the flight and concentrated the power of the push. They saw the warheads after several collisions, finally spinning, and steadily moving forward in the force field pipeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, close your eyes, time will be restored." Siegel suddenly said: "Wywood. If you can hold on, then restore The process will be very inspiring to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, Lord Siegel," said Verwood: "I am ready." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and took back his palm. The spring of time slammed loosely, making up for the slowdown by Siegel at a very high speed. The repressed light instantly illuminates with a few hundred times of brightness, and disappears instantly. The warhead also hits the wall strengthened by the dwarf rune with an unstoppable impulse, and then goes with a stone brick. Villewood's sip, spurting blood. His heart is hit hard, and the speed of the pulsation is faster than the hummingbird's wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage is ready. Hand over a bottle of therapeutic agent. "Is this taste bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, if possible, I want to come again." Weywood's entire mouth is red, and the body is still licking. Similar jitter. It seems awkward. However, he smiled very easily, his eyes brightened, and it was obviously very rewarding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Step by step. If you have this experience, you can try to reproduce in meditation, I wish you an early ** division." Siegel Waved, the spell cleared the blood on the ground. Then ask other people: "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
