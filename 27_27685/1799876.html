			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has no choice, he has no time to block all spells, so he can only cast anti-magic force. This force field only lasts for a few seconds. As long as it can withstand the chain lightning and the flame storm, he plans to transform into a squat form at the same time. Shock can only work on living things that have body organs, and the nature of the undead and the nature of the elements make him immune to this state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn screams and instantly shows the original shape. She tried her best to cast Longwei and shrouded the entire flight. A burst of rainbow light flashed from her scales, and the power of the elements around the dawn angels was suppressed, and a dead magic zone appeared in an instant. The blade barrier and various gain-like spells disappeared, and the angel smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic dragon’s arm has been vacated, and the morning angels screamed at the wings, left and right, swaying and flicking out of the dead zone, and the mouth also issued Hey...hey?" Just as the dragon was about to hit the angel, another dragon wave came out of the castle. Siegel understood the meaning of this Longwei: cold, killing, never forgiveness and incomparable pride. The flying dragon girl has a body and stands in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black dragon with a wingspan of more than 100 meters flew out from behind the castle, the shadow shrouded the entire square, and the mouth still groaned: "Bastard Zelly, you are gone." The dragon ring does not forget to call me! If it weren’t for the poor part of Soka’s errands, I wouldn’t...” It suddenly widened his eyes and looked at the Capricorn covered in rainbow scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of Longwei has changed and turned into horror, thoughts and love. It seems that this is Capricorn's father, but how does this ancient-class black dragon give birth to the Platinum Dragon race? Siegel removed the anti-magic field and thought that it should not be played now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel also felt that something was wrong. The "color block" dragon opposite her suddenly did not murder and became sentimental. What is this change, really weird! Soka flew to the side and stared at the two "invaders" with the corner of his eye. It seems that the black dragon and the "color block" dragon know, then this matter is handed over to the black dragon to deal with it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Dragon carefully looked at the opposite of the Capricorn, observing the scales on her body. The magic dragon is actually the young body of the iridescent dragon, one of the strongest three dragons. The dragon that she exudes makes the Black Dragon very familiar. But my daughter is obviously a platinum dragon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only explanation is that someone has transformed her! That person must be the mage standing on the ground! The black dragon's eyes smashed, the teeth and claws began to elongate, the muscles of the whole body bulged, and the scales rubbed against each other and rustled. The mage is not a good thing. I want to play the dragon's idea one by one! As soon as he swooped, he flew down toward Siegel, enough to cover the entire square, and the face of the hood was pressed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fuck!" Siegel rarely sweared, and then was not soaked in the acid lake. The protective spell on his body resisted the damage of the acid, but the environment around him like a viscose made him slow. Haven't waited for Siegel to use the power of flying to get out, the dragon has already flashed into the acid. A hand grabbed Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defensive shield protects Siegel from being pinched directly, but there are limits to spells. The huge power of the Black Dragon constantly compresses the effect of the shield, and the sound of the broken field is constantly screaming around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel raised his hand to display the four-pulse arrows, and the explosion of unstable elements could not resist the dragon scales of the magic resistance. After the explosion, a wound of blood stasis appeared on the dragon's abdomen. The black dragon screamed, loosened his claws, and then slammed with a huge tail. Siegel flew out like a worm that was hit by a tempo, and slammed into the wall of the crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the flight, he saw a succubus screaming on the castle balcony, and a female dark elf came over. A heavy punch on her head. Who is living in this castle? One is more weird than one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to deal with the dragon is to bind the dragon curse, and this is no longer the wall of the continent, the agreement that limits the dragon and the wizard is invalid here. Siegel wiped the blood from his mouth and began to recite this spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, don't fight, you finally woke me up, all came down and talked." The acid on the flight fortress platform disappeared, one wearing The human man in the gray robe appears there. He waved to the distance and did not directly cast a spell to Siegel, but changed the spatial attributes outside the Siegel Magic Defense Shield. Take him directly to the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel put away the sword and lowered it. Six wings are combined in the back, and their size is getting smaller. Finally, they become the girl of fifteen years old. Divine power is restrained. There is no such aggressive force, but this is the hallmark of the maturity of higher angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black dragon slammed down a few times and then turned into a black-faced middle-aged man. Everyone looked up and left only the magic dragon. I didn't expect the Capricorn to wow out, and it became a human figure in the air, and it slammed into the embrace of the Black Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad! I finally found you!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Dragon touched her head. Still holding Siegel. However, he was very gentle on Capricorn's tone and comforted: "Do not worry, no matter what control spells you have, I can... I can unlock you, and you will be free in the future."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn screamed, but still barely said the sentence: "I have no control over the spell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel also hurriedly said: "I am here to help! The use of the dragon curse has not been used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You almost used it. Although it can be lifted, it is very troublesome." The Master said: "Know, my name is Lynch. Which world did you come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Lynch von De Chilan?" Siegel looked up and down. This wizard does not look like he is forty years old, and he does not feel any magical fluctuations from him. This person's left arm is fitted with a prosthetic limb, which is very extravagant for the whole fine gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this arm, there is no magic item on his body. Is this a sorcerer? Just as he had just raised the idea of ​​temptation, the blind man who knew the danger issued a warning. It showed Siegel the challenge of Lynch: In this half-plane, Lynch has an irresistible home court advantage, and he can use plastic rules for himself. There is only one result of the challenge, that is, the smoke is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... I’m glad to meet you, Mr. Lynch.” Siegel said: "I read your book, "The Study of Magical Decoration," I am from the wall of the thunder wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it turned out to be the world of the martial arts Regula. Are you specifically sending the Capricorn back?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really bothering you. This stupid dragon is too lazy to raise The child opened the gnome's world transmission array and sent the daughter away. Originally it was sent to the dragon god Bahamut. The result was not done well. I didn't know where to send the scorpion to the place. "He shot with both hands, it seems that he knows afterwards: "The wall of the mine is nowhere to be located! The storm of destruction blocks the effect of positioning spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey... can you ask how old are you now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this half-plane has no age-growth effect, so I have never changed Old." Lynch said "Although this means that you can't raise a big child, at least you don't have to think about whether it becomes a lich. If you have too many spells and too little life, you will have such troubles one day." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there have been thoughts in this area, but the scorpion’s ability to transform has partially solved this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, since you are a guest, I will introduce you to you: Black Dragon, you have already seen it, Angel Sister is called Soka, my wife is a dark elf, It’s called Zelly. A succubus maid, Erriy Jess, has her racial abilities. There is also a little golem at the heart of the castle, which is now upgrading to sleep, so it won’t come out.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel Squid, the sorcerer of the Thunder Wall World." Siegel said: "I came here on the one hand for the Capricorn, on the other hand for the higher magic. Spell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? You are very straightforward." Lynch said: "So younger as a young man, you are not bad. Is there a Masters Association in your world? I remember that their high spells are not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have established a federation, and the relationship with the Masters Association is not good now. At present, the Masters Association has taken a crush on us, so I don’t have a few high spells here.” Siegel tells the truth. "And now we are also facing the threat of another crystal wall, using technology instead of magic goblins are using a nuclear bomb bombardment crystal wall barrier." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
