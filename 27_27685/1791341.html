			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sits in the seat of the lord contemplating, a life and twenty pounds of geranium, and the familiar wound on the body. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please leave this to us," Mana whispered to the side. "The Lord Lord, I suggest to strengthen the patrol, and the Guard will investigate this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, I decided to have it." Siegel Terry said: "Your accusation against the Confed Master is because I have insufficient evidence, I can't make any judgment. I personally will issue the hardware coin as the funeral expenses of your companion, and order the guard to investigate this matter. The organizer will arrange it by Mana. If you need a mage to assist in the investigation, I can arrange it for you, but it is your responsibility. If you have solid evidence, then I will help you with justice."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Atley squatted on the floor, holding his hands up: "The Lord, I don't want hardware, I just want justice! I want to see the wizard of the federation being Sanctions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case now!" Mana stood up and found the guard: "Bring them down!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atley violently broke free of the guard’s hand and shouted: "French In the robbery! They took the grass and they took away the herbs to treat the plague! They are not fair and just!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyes glimpse, “ Wait a moment!" He called the guard and said to Atley: "Tell me, how can I use the geranium to treat the plague?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atley is open Mouth, for a long time, nothing could be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people who seem to teach you these words don't make all the details clear." Siegel snorted. "Grass has many uses, but the treatment of the plague is one of the least common uses. A grass called Australia, or a sword of the king, can dispel evil to eliminate curses and diseases, but is more commonly used in the folk. The method is to feed the pig. If someone steals your ragweed, then you call it 'the cure for a mortal disease'. Then put the murder on the thief, it is called unfair."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This makes me have to doubt your intentions." Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People who spread rumors!" Someone shouted: "Hang them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp It seems that more than one or two conspirators in the territory are trying to incite emotions. Siegel's gaze swept through the crowd, and most of the sights were ignorant and ignorant. They don't understand what happened and they don't want to think. But will be willing to follow the emotions of others. They are just ordinary peasants, artisans and businessmen. They have not received a complete education, let alone a teacher like the bachelor Faranis, so that they can think rationally and identify tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't hang you, but I will warn you. It is one thing to investigate the cause of death of your companions. The attempt to incite and affect the tranquility of my territory is another. One thing. Now you should leave, and I have other people to meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four soldiers are holding them in groups of two, and two others The soldiers lifted the body on the ground. Atley struggled. But this time the guard obviously will not lose face again, so he said that he is holding tightly. He shouted when he was about to be thrown out of the gate: "I can't find justice here! I want to go to God to find it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time No one answered, Siegel didn't even bother to look up at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will strengthen the patrol of the territory to avoid this happening." Mana approached Siegel, almost in his ear. She likes to be close to the Siegel exchange, which is a rare intimate time. However, Siegel just nodded and did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no surprises in the interviews and trials. The penalty is to cut off the fingers of several thieves, cut off the tongue of the prostitute, and deprive the knight of the oath of deprivation. ,deport. Mana has helped him investigate and deal with a lot of things. All he has to do is the final verification and judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the second time I have heard the word plague in these days, but from the mouth of an adventurer." Siegel leaned back on the chair At this time, the sunset is already red. The people have already left the scene. He waved his hand and let the bottle of red wine fly up, filling Mana. "A few moments ago, I asked Alfred to go to various temples to seek prophecy. There is only news of peace. It seems that no one except Redd has foreseen the disaster. I have a suspicion now, if the plague is going to happen Occasionally, it may not be a natural disaster, but *."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope so, I have some restlessness recently. It seems that something is going to happen." Siegel licked his forehead and said, "I can't explain this feeling, whether it is using reason or magic. You I know that the Federation does not have a very qualified prophet now. They are not as good at predicting spells and magic as they are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After all, you are *师Ah, and your teacher is not a master of prophecy?” Mana patted Siegel’s back and looked at him with his eyes shining. Then he said, “The Lord, I think you are too tired to use Mind, you should let it relax. Do you want to move your body first, sweat a little, then I will give you a massage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, thank you, need I will find you." Siegel's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone has resolved the lord’s embarrassment, even though he is the least likely to resolve this situation. Alfred hurriedly walked over and looked at Mana with a sorrowful eye, and then said to Siegel: "The lord of the lord, the zebra mountain...the exact is the shield river, something went wrong. There are always corpses from the shun. The river floated down, it was dwarf, and there were some things that had never been seen before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood up and immediately said, "Train the body, Issue a notice to ensure that no one drinks the water from the Shield River, and don't eat the fish in the river. Tell Rhett... No, I personally passed.” He looked at Mana: “Let the Guards move and prepare to deal with the bodies. This matter tells the temples and asks them to send the pastor with experience in this area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need to tell the federation?" Alfred Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel indulged, then nodded: "The federation should know about this, if you want to figure out what happened, there will be help to save it." A lot of strength. Now act, gather in front of the castle, follow me to see the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Reid seems ready, Siegel He was standing at the door when he came to the temple. "There are bad things happening, I think you need my help." The voice of the Golem is still snoring, and the sincerity that has been revealed has never changed. "I stayed in the temple, he can help prepare the purified water source."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Siegel said nothing, with magic Like the place to go to the season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last breath of the setting sun, Siegel saw the body floating on the shield river. As predicted, the black river smells stench and brings death to Heim's collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many bodies?" Siegel asked questions while using the elemental rune guards to summon the water elements. He ordered the water element to be salvaged, while allowing the soldiers to clear out an area and ignite the fire. "You can't let the body drift to the city of Mire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The singer has gone to the stone village to control the situation there and avoid problems in the half-orc village. It’s hard to say how many bodies there are. They are said to have been coming out of the mountains.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water element brings the body of a dwarf to the shore. Everyone is going to check it out. The dwarf died in battle, and there were many holes in his head and body, as if he had been pierced by a thin, sharp, short spear. Although the body has been swollen, from the tattoo on his arm, this is the dwarf of the hard-shelled tribe of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who have discovered other dwarves in the tribe, as well as a large number of unrecognizable dwarfs. They are basically naked*, with at most one or two close-fitting clothes, and obviously the outer armor and weapons have been cleaned up. The dwarves never let the bodies of their compatriots suffer such treatment, and the facts at hand can only show one thing: the dwarves are defeated, and they can't even clean the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The body is apparently coming out of the city wall mountain. The source of the shield river is in the mountain." This is a bit difficult to do, and it is almost necessary to trace the source. impossible. After Rhett reminded him that there might be an accident in the shield river, he did not think about going up against the river and going to the north of the wall to do some protective measures. The dwarf ban is still in effect, and the underground river is under its protection. When the transfer is affected, don't be involved in a place where you may collapse or squat at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dwarf really found a strong grave for himself, and it was difficult to get in." Siegel sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do these dwarven corpses be burned or buried?" Mana frowned. Only a few dozen bodies can be seen within her field of vision, who knows how much has drifted down. These dwarves are all strong and strong warriors, and now they are flowing down like dead fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
