			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had been influenced by the "Moss" Master, Wendy always had an inexplicable affection for Siegel Lord. WwW.XsHuoTXt.com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "celebrity" of the Masters Association, Siegel. The squid really admired the other federation mages. A fast-rising mage genius, one of the best lords in the New World, the close disciple of Dr. Faranis, the guardian of the Federation's knowledge. And in the middle of the Elf War, he was able to protect his territory and the castle without losing his life and protect the normal life of the people. This ability to protect is what the consuls of the Federation who have just suffered from the disaster are most in need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty is also a person with a sense of security, so he chose to specialize in the protection spell and become a protective guard. Together with the wizards of other federations, she has a house in the town outside the city of Mith, and lives there in addition to the time of research and work. This house is not far from the newly built magical array. If you climb the attic, you can see the elves at work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She often prepares the tea, then takes a book to the loft to relax. She only needs to turn her head to see the Siegel Lord who appeared in the magical array all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the distance, Wendy couldn’t see Siegel’s face and could only notice his gesture: walking, standing, and sitting and resting. There is a familiar feeling in her heart, and she always feels that Siegel's appearance is very similar to the "Moss" in memory. The figures of the two people gradually coincide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head and laughed at herself without confidence. Soth has always shouldered the heavy responsibility of finding out the secrets of the Knox Association, and probably has already paid a life in the contest with the bald sorcerer. I don't know if that night is the best memory of life for Sos? Every time she thinks back, her body can't stop shaking, and then she will cry. She still remembers the excitement of seeing the meal after getting up in the morning, and the endless embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the wife of Lord Siegel also died in the war, leaving only the lord and a one-year-old child. Lord Siegel has never believed in the death of his wife. Looking forward to saving her life with a magical array. In the spell of the Master, there is no ability to return to life. His efforts are destined to be in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just like yourself. Although in the middle of the heart, I hope that "Sos" can reappear and renew the front. But the sensible part reminds over and over again that it is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty touches his stomach, if it is enough to be pregnant that night, so that I can still have a thought, a sustenance, but unfortunately I always It is not satisfactory. When I was sighing, the sound of knocking on the door suddenly sounded downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will visit at this time? Wendy closed the book and hurried down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is the sergeant Siegel and his four guards. Before the threat of the black assassin was lifted, all important people in Heim’s collar must carry enough guards. Even Siegel has an absolute warning time of five seconds. He is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not wear a breastplate, but put on a shifting cloak outside the comfortable aristocratic costume. The real protection comes from the defensive staff and the rainbow light ball ring, as well as the magic enchantment on the body. He looked at the female mage with his black eyes and then asked friendlyly: "Mr. Wendy, good morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s an honor, you actually recognize me, Lord Lord." Master Wendy let the door open and made a gesture of advancing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and wiped his feet outside the door, just about to enter. Master Wendy did not know where the temper came from. Suddenly said: "Adult, your bodyguard is best left outside the door. I am small here, can't entertain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards look at Wendy's eyes It is hard to say that it is not a guard and an alert. Their hands slowly moved to the hilt, and the line of sight began to look around. But Siegel raised his hand and said to them: "Let's wait outside, it shouldn't take much time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took a nap, retired Going out, the two are at the door, and the other two are patrolling around the house. The thin wooden door separates the noisy street from the street, leaving only Master Wendy to face the sergeant Siegel alone. She suddenly became aware that she would be more passive. There are no knights to be witnesses, who knows what Siegel Lord will do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She watches the black eyes. I hope to be aware of the danger ahead of it. However, Wendy can only see a pool of calm water. There is no slight fluctuation in emotions, unlike Soths, which is totally different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel ignored her words and stabbed. "How does it feel to come to the city of Mire? Did Idis arrange any work for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"here Very good. Except for the magical array protection that is not as powerful as the Three Peaks Tower, everything is free here. There are no onlookers who regard the Master as a rarity, and they want to do everything freely. I think the residents here are watching all day. Go to the lord, so I have lost my curiosity to the Master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Mage Tower will also be built here, belonging to the Mage Tower of the Federation. I promised Bo Bachelor Français and Lion King Alexander." Siegel himself found the sofa and sat down, standing with his defensive staff. “I will create a comfortable living environment for everyone.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, is there a plan? When?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First of all, I want to get rid of the interference that the Master Association may cause." Siegel picked up the buckle in front of him, took a cookie from below, took a bite from himself, and then wrinkled it. A brow. "How long has this biscuit been put, is it broken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't eat your taste!" Wendy hurriedly buckled the plate. She wants to use the process of baking biscuits to practice her plastic energy spells, but the too cautious personality makes her always "insufficient firepower", doing unfamiliar things, and the taste is naturally bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I don't want it for cookies anyway." Siegel pulled a bundle of reels from his sleeve and placed it in front of Wendy. "That's how I ruled out the interference of the Masters Association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty sat across from Siegel and unrolled the scrolls on the table. The complex magic lines are painted on it, combined...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a magical array, but it is not complete." Wendy looked at her professional eyes. "There are a lot of elf styles inside, it should be based on some magical array of elves. But there are a lot of empty places, like here and here." She points her finger on the scroll with her white fingers, against Siegel Said: "This will form a broken circuit of magical energy, causing the entire magic array to fail. But I think you will not make this mistake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes These places will be filled with dwarf runes." Siegel said: "The dwarf runes are done by me, and there are other places that are not part of the general magical lines. I hope that the synagogue brothers and sisters of the federation can help me. Follow this pattern to help me build a magical array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this magic array used for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Please keep me confidential," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then don't look for me." Wendy squinted and leaned back on the couch. The long red hair flew over the shoulders and hangs behind the back. The legs in white boots are exposed from the mage. The white skin is as smooth as ivory and even brighter than the boots. Let your legs look incredibly long. At the same time, she used her hands to play the slender wand. The power of magic is looming and dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Idis Master is more proficient in the construction of the magical array and the magic tower, why not go to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "He is a member of the Masters Association, I am not at ease." Siegel moved his eyes from the bottom up to Wendy's eyes. "His age is also big, and he has been hurt some time ago - this reason is justified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have evidence?" Wendy frowned . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides Idis's separate conversation with me. I don't have any substantial evidence. I can only ask you to believe me." Siegel said: "He has no problem in protecting the books of the Federation. But this is the magical array that I have received from Heim. I don't want the Masters Association to participate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I don’t know why, Wendy believes in Siegel’s words on the one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the Masters Federation has lost its organizational form, I will still pay the cost of casting according to the standards of the Federation. I remember that the Magic Array is based on area and spells. The level is calculated, isn't it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wynti nodded and leaned forward, slender fingers crossed the scroll: “This is a few The effect of level spells?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
