			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are almost on the road day and night, and rarely rest at night. Siegel felt that the whole body was about to fall apart in the wobbler, so he even admired these forbearing dwarves. Fortunately, every time they pass a dwarf whistle, they can get supplies from here, such as food and water. But in the next few days, in addition to these, they also received the spit and curse of the dwarf sentinel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is these two guys sneak attacking the East Gate Post? It is more hateful than the Orc's locusts!" The dwarves were very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The matter is still inconclusive, please wait for the results of the investigation." Gerrard will come out to explain at this time, to appease the emotions of others: "The furnace hall will be The town of Rado is fair to hear the matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'So the town of Rado is where we are going. ‘Siegel remembered it. The team followed the Cape Avenue all the way west, and when they passed a small town, they stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s here, we arrived early." Gerard said loudly: "Let's park the car in the shade, I will inform the furnace hall." People."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Leah are all dressed up, so that the tired self can look more spiritual. These days, they have explained this with the dwarf guards many times, and they are not the so-called murderers. But these stubborn guys like stones don’t care about these rhetoric, just keep on the road. Now I have finally arrived at the destination, I hope there is an opportunity for explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three dwarves in gray robes and Gerard walked out of the town, and they looked serious and said nothing. Siegel saw the scene and almost laughed - it was too much like a hair ball with three bags of potatoes. He kept reminding himself that these guys who could determine their destiny, this forced to hold back the smile and sit in the prison car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three potato bags are wearing the emblem of the dwarf patron saint - a sign of a hammer on a stone slab. They stood in front of the van and carefully looked at the two suspects. They looked at the elves first, and said something to each other in dwarf language, and then they heard them declare: "This elf is innocent, release her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Gerard jumped into the car and pulled out the key to open the cage. And the three respectable robes dwarfs - Siegel no longer thought they were potato bags - came to another prisoner and then read the words. Siegel felt that a warm energy had swept away from him, feeling the same as his first encounter with the Knox Synagogue, so the guess was that the dwarf cast a spell. Then I heard one of the dwarves said: "The identity of this person is unknown, the suspect is serious, and immediately go to the dungeon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, why are you this potato bag? Don't let me go!" Siegel yelled: "We didn't attack the post!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Lia came to the dwarf to explain, but there was nothing Used, it attracted several dwarf warriors to separate her. Gerard told Leah that this is not the end result, just a screening, and an opportunity to defend. Then came four dwarves and took the cage directly, including the Siegel inside, and took it to a stone house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the house is closed, but the voice of the outside Leah is still heard. The stubborn dwarves are not so easy to be convinced, they are still rigidly executing every rule. Siegel had a clear conscience, but he was worried about the health of the Elf Master, and he was spared the training time he was wasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room has nothing but his cage and the straw in the corner. The only window that shines through the light, you can now hurry and read. Siegel picked up the password book and found that the book had changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cover of the original book is written in the common language "Jia Kun's daily notes", and now it becomes the Elven language "Dragon City". After opening, the messy lines and intricate imprints on the paper began to rearrange and became a map of the words: the mountains, the direction of the rivers and forests, the caves in brown, and the tunnels in light gray. The text next to it records the secret ciphers and passwords that Ja Kun had discovered during his expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was very surprised and quickly opened the second page. This time there is no map, but a spell is recorded. According to the above statement, this spell can open the secret lock that originally limited the blood; or "spoof" those items that can be used by bloody identification, so that they can be used by others. This spell is very complicated. In addition to spells and spellcasting, you also need to configure the pharmacy and prepare the ritual. Although Siegel is not a mage, he still looks at it with gusto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't read all the contents of this spell yet, all the text is shaking, and then I change back to the original lines and runes. Siegel doesn't understand why this is, only I think this book is amazing. He turned his head again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the previous things he has seen, even if the books are now only ciphertext, the ciphertext answers are still unconsciously appearing in Siegel’s mind. After a while, relying on extraordinary understanding, he has found the key to understanding the mystery, and the whole book has lost protection for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘This is definitely related to the spells cast by the potato bag. Have to say, magic is really convenient! ‘Siegel thought while reading a book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the book carefully, not for the content of the book, simply to enjoy the joy of solving the riddle. It's like a kid playing a puzzle, and a young man spinning a cube. It’s just that this kind of reading is very energy-intensive. He didn’t wait until the dinner was delivered and slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day Gerard sent the meal and the news of the elf. According to the dwarf, the furnace hall has basically recognized the elf's description of the sentinel incident, and only needs to wait until the formalities are completed to cast him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is three days, and Siegel feels that he is about to rust in the cage. He finally unveiled the secrets in the book, and he was already bored to recite several books over and over again. Because of this, he has nothing to do, only to be in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening is a full moon and the night sky is bright. Siegel was sleepless by the moon, so he woke up in the middle of the night. He felt the coolness of the wind coming in from the window, which was hard to come by in the summer, and it was suitable for fantasy. "If I can cast spells, it would be fine." He said to himself: "Reading a spell lock is open, and many interesting things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I With the talent to cast spells, this thought first appeared in Siegel’s mind. He didn't pay much attention to it before, or he was too focused on the training of martial arts, and now he will remember some details. If the light ball floating on the seized stick does not indicate that he has magical skills, then the small flame that killed the trolls should be persuasive, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wants to try and concentrate on whether or not he can use spells. Magic is not so simple, Siegel is still a long way from mastering the trick. In addition, he is also worried that if the lock of this cage is destroyed, will it become a prisoner, from innocent to criminal? Under such fears, Siegel re-doed it, temporarily suppressing the idea of ​​casting magic, lying down and continuing to try to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the magic quickly found him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a layer of writhing shadows flowing under the door of the house, slowly crawling into the straw pile at the corner of the cell. These grass stalks were given life, entwined with each other, and slowly stood up. It has limbs and heads, no eyes but can see things, no ears but can hear, no mouth but can swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The straw monster looked at the sleeping Siegel, raised an "arm" and pointed him at the grass stem. A blue-green light plunged into Siegel's body and instantly took away his vitality—the heartbeat and the breath disappeared, and there was no last struggle in dying. Then the Scarecrow walked over to the cage and reached out and took a few books out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Siegel’s "corpse" moved, and he opened his eyes violently, yelling at his mouth, and his body trembled like a cockroach. Then a black skull-shaped smoke came out of his heart, his eyes were empty and his mouth opened and closed. Siegel vomited foam, and one hand grabbed the railing of the cage, and one hand struggled, just holding the Scarecrow. The black hoe immediately shifted to the position, vented from Siegel, and suddenly got into the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scarecrow is only a fake life controlled by a spell, and it is carried out in full accordance with the will of the caster. So the curse and necromancer spells cast on the Scarecrow will directly affect the operator. The taste of being hurt by his own spells was extremely painful, so the man hidden in the town made a shout of screaming and waking up all the sleeping residents around. The scarecrow next to the cell also had the same kind of learning, and at the same time issued a sharp point. Siegel escaped from the death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden spellcaster struggles to concentrate, and finally resists the power of the dead spell. He did not dare to delay the time, and quickly ordered the Scarecrow to take the books and get out. The grass man is agile and not afraid of any knocking damage. Even though it is made of straw, he still uses the power of black fog to make the two dwarves at the door guard and die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
