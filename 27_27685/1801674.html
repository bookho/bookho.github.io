			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two months later, the Xingsuo officially appeared at Heim. At that time, she had put on a light blue and silver-white outer armor, and the dwarf rune array of fine gold and gold was inlaid for reinforcement. The electromagnetic spider killer is hidden in the mezzanine inside the battleship. It is mainly used as a defense and can be directly put in wartime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ship is bigger than the ship of the Federation, looks more beautiful and powerful, and immediately became a talk of residents of Heim. However, the greater role of the Xingsuo is to become a playground for Isaac, whether it is to practice riding on an open deck platform, or let the star cable take him to the sky, the "two little guys" play Happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later this game added the Raven Baron. Isaac took his mother with one hand every morning, grabbed the raven with one hand, and boarded the spaceship early. They will patrol at Heim, and throw stones, archery, etc. by the way. The star can launch a magical missile in the sky, never failing in shooting. But if you really want to shoot the target, the magic missile can't be so precise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a way to play like this every day," Siegel cares about Isaac’s education, so he brings his wife to the knight and the lord to fight, let them Playing on the boat. Two artificial intelligences, Raven Barron and Xingsuo always lost at first, but they may not be as fast as Isaac in tactical learning, so they provoked their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another benefit of this activity is also reflected. After starting to play chess, Xingsuo does not have to fly around with other people, most of the time she Quietly docked next to the balcony of the castle of Mier. She doesn't have to rest, so she can read the various books and materials of Siegel's study on the hands of the doctor and the whole field. This kind of eagerness also influenced Isaac. He didn't want to be dull and monotonous when he was telling the story, so he began to read a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Siegel, he has packed his mind and started a "big project." He kept secret about this matter, not only did Janet not tell, but even the absolutely loyal Raven Barron and Xingsuo did not know. Siegel had a lot of books from the federation, most of which were found by the syndicate mages from the goblin world, and recorded a variety of knowledge. For these books. The federation used them most as a reference for inspiring thinking, and no one would really study it seriously like Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Masters also advised Siegel not to waste time in this area, but no one can really stop Siegel’s determination. In addition to meeting with his family, he spent almost all his time in the lab. A lot of magical experimental materials were shipped in. Then it is consumed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet has always disliked the atmosphere of the Magic Lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was an elite spy for the thieves’ guild and went deep into various places to steal intelligence. In all environments, the most dangerous is the mage's laboratory. It is always full of mysterious and weird traps. Monsters from different worlds are struggling in the cage, and the dead spirits and living creatures are mixed together. The smell of their body made her scalp numb. Those seemingly motionless tables and chairs are likely to be constructed creatures. When they approach, they suddenly move and are scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Jay can be contacted by Raven Baron, Janet hopes to see him directly. The magical defense array and the patrolling lights in the castle knew her, so she would close the potentially deadly magic trap for her until she came to the metal gate of the magic lab. After that is the exclusive field of Siegel, where the magic is not the light god can intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet patted the door hard and shouted the name of Siegel, and the door automatically opened. Every time this time, Janet has a very strange feeling. Because she didn't know that it was Siegel who heard the call and opened the door remotely, or some sort of trigger mechanism. She skillfully took a permanent candle from the wall and walked in through the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strong bloody smell in the room, and a cold atmosphere belonging to the morgue filled the room. On the experimental bench, various broken plants and animals were piled up in a mess, and the servant Golem was holding a large trash can to keep cleaning up. If you are not very familiar with the environment, Janet will think that he has entered a slaughterhouse. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that Siegel’s fat ears are big, and with a big arm and a big knife to kill pigs and slaughter sheep, Janet is funny. This diluted the tension that the room gave her to a certain extent. She heard the voice of Siegel from the lab: "Janet, are you here? Is there anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cloth covered in the corner of the room. It looks like a sarcophagus from the outline, but Janet prefers not to think in that direction. She has seen all the things in the lab, only this is always covered by a thick cloth. The curiosity of being a spy made her want to find out, but now it is the hostess of Heim and the wife of Siegel who really dominate her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel recites a spell that releases a constant temperature array on the flask to maintain the stability of the refining agent. Then look up. A cushioned three-legged chair walked over to Janet, and the cup containing the warming tea also flew into her hands. The mage stretched out and said: "Janet, is there anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is something I need to tell you personally." Janet waved her hand and left the chair. She didn't sit in the chair. "Today we received news from the East China, the Countess Ferrara was divorced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Siegel stunned, then 瞪Big eyes: "You mean Countess Ferran Bill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She changed her motherhood, now called Ferralan Oliver. But you That's right, Viscount Tiger Bill has now regained his celibacy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, Master Bill lost his territory?" Siegel immediately thought of this. Point, then frowned. This is a bit unusual. Tiger's ability is outstanding, and he has won the baron. Later, because of the transfer of the throne of Aaron and Evan, the title was obtained. But he has never had his own territory, not a real aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, he is very feminine, took off the flower of the Earl of the Starry Kingdom, and became the master of Nautai and the administrator of the Earl. Since the territory has been actually managed, and the countess has no children before, the territory will eventually be handed over to Bill's children, so he will not be divided into territories. It is said that the two have a very happy life after marriage and already have a son and a daughter. What happened to this sudden divorce? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Sir Bill did not like Janet very much, he did not deliberately bully her and sent her a gift after she married Siegel. As a guide for Siegel to embark on the New World, he is also his first personal tutor, and even a father's role, Janet knows what Bill means to his husband. As she expected, Siegel never seemed so confused and anxious, his eyebrows were quickly twisted into shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Bill..." He said, "Is this news true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Our own caravan came back, and the fangs Jennis wrote it, and there is his seal on it. He said that he has heard the news from several different channels, although the reasons for divorce are not the same, but this should be the same. There will be no leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the jazz now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most What is worrying about. Janis didn't hear about Sir Bill. After leaving the letter, he had already gone to Nautai for investigation. Considering that Nautai Fortress is inland, communication is inconvenient, I am afraid to wait for new news. "For a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about jazz kids?" Siegel asked. "Is there any news for them?"<br /><br />&nbsp Janet shook his head. "There is no mention in the letter. I don't know if there is no news or other things. Let's not guess." She reached out and pressed Siegel's eyebrows gently. Rub, let him stretch his brow again. "The East China is not like we have a transmission line, so the news will be very slow. I believe that Sir Bill will be fine, let us pray for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nodded, in this case can only count on subsequent news. But he has a feeling that things will not be that simple. Although nothing is still clear now, Keigel thinks that the school city must not be in a relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, shocking news came from the East. A knight organization called the "Orthodox Church" conspired to rob the Aaron, who was convalescent, and tried to subvert Avon's rule with Aaron as the core. The conspiracy was perceived by the king and repressed with decisive and decisive judgment. Several of the leaders of the organization were all in the same way. After the dagger, the head was inserted with a long pole, which was already standing on the wall of the Star City. The pursuit of the flee has begun, and it is said that a list of members has fallen into the hands of King Avon, and there is considerable evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two letters were sent, one was written by King Evan of the King and the other was the Royal Palace general manager Salk. In the King's letter, Evan said there is evidence that Tiger Biel is also a member of the Orthodox Church and is one of the senior members closer to the core. Although there is all kinds of evidence, he himself does not believe this statement, he will certainly find out the facts and will not let innocent people suffer wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
