			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel does not know whether the wizard refers to the person who eats the horse or eats the person, but he can feel that the mount is very calm and not nervous at all. It is said that the feeling of war horse is more sensitive than people, and many times it can predict the danger approaching. Treknerma is one of the best, so Siegel immediately went down and threw the reins, then took Janet's hand and walked along with Kerry. The troubadour poets followed behind them and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the tree hole is very narrow, and a large cauldron lacking the mouth squeezes most of the space in the middle of the room. The yellow flame burned slowly under the pot, but everyone did not see any fuel, and it was magical not to smoke. The pot is half filled with yellow-green viscous liquid, and you can see leaves, dead branches, animal fur, and broken metal pieces. Under the cooking of the fire, the soup is boiling and boiling. The sorcerer threw the bag with the heart of the green-footed snake and the venom gland. Everyone could see that the bag floated on the surface of the "sweet soup" and was shaken left and right under the push of the bubble, then swallowed quickly by the soup and disappeared into the cauldron. A strong scent emanates from the inside of the pot, and the wizard sucks and sucks, and the screams in his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tama!" Kerry suddenly snorted and rushed to the wizard, arms wide open to grasp. Everyone did not understand what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hungry, always eat too much." The wizard glanced at everyone, his eyes stopped on Siegel. He suddenly asked: "Kerry, is this the tribute you brought to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is a spirit, like a poisoned snake The mouse, the whole body is erect, and a great sense of crisis goes straight to the top of the head. He touched the handle with the fastest speed, and the other hand also lifted his wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are still faster ones. The walls of the tree hole stretched out hundreds of vines, the finest as silk, the thickest as the arm, swooped up, wrapped around the limbs and waist of the pedestrian, and pulled them to the wall to fix. Siegel's scimitar only had half of it, and the wand couldn't point to the target. His mouth was caught by a thick vine, and his teeth were hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A mage! A hateful mage! Hahaha, my lucky day!" The wizard raised his hands and danced a weird dance around the cauldron. "cooked? raw? dry or sliced? Ah, ah! It's hard to decide!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people struggled, but the vines are very strong Strong and resilient. Only Kerry's brute force can make these trees and vines loose, but it is also limited to swaying and can't be separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard went to Siegel, stretched out the yellow and dirty hands and grabbed his neck. Siegel only felt that his claws were cold and sharp, and the place he felt was frozen. Siegel was so hard that the blood vessels on his neck were bulging and clearly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard suddenly found the necklace on Siegel’s neck and was very curious to pull it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘You don’t want to get anything! Siegel shouted loudly, but he could only make a squeaky voice in his mouth. He turned to the depths of his soul for help, and prayed to the "Squid Saint", but as in the past, he did not receive any response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twenty-faced scorpion and the space key next to it were slowly drawn out and immediately exposed to the wizard. But this time the second side of the scorpion lit up. When the necklace was completely taken out, nothing was seen hanging on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Master always carries a sling, and can hang at any time..." The wizard loosened the chain and reached for Siegel's wand. The mage meditation on "Dummark", so the wand disappeared and disappeared into a wrist under the sleeve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hide and seek, hide and seek, one catches a Tibetan..." The wizard began to dance again, circled around the cauldron, and returned with a hard palm. Beat the face of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet began to cry, tears drop by drop, causing the attention of the wizard. He walked over to the girl, looked at it with his eyes, smelled it with his nose, and rubbed her head with his fingers. Then he twisted and walked back, almost kneeling on Siegel's face, licking the bloody big eyes, his nose with his nose, and a poisonous smell of bad breath, whispering: "A demon Although rare, it is not as good as you, but not as good as you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted loudly: "Oh! Unique! Unique!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry shouted "The Spirit of Winter!" and then tore open the tree vines that tied him, like a giant bear rushing through the bushes, slamming into the wizard. The wizard twisted and the body exploded and deformed. A black gorilla with four arms and Kerry were equally tall, and the two slammed together. The orangutan grabbed the giant's wrist with both hands and the other two slammed his ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of frost covered Kerry's body, the air temperature dropped rapidly, and it was able to breathe out air from the mouth. The four-armed orangutan's hair is condensed with hoarfrost, and the eyelids are also frozen by the cold. Kerry’s brute force was even better, pushing the orangutan forward until he turned him over the cauldron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soup sprinkled on the ground, and the hot orangutan screamed on the ground. The yellow flame ignited its fur and made him straight. It rolled over the ground and broke chairs, boxes and bottles and cans. After a scream, he changed back to the shape of the wizard. However, the wizard did not see any scars, but the leaves and nets broke even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" The shaper climbed up from the ground and stared at Kerry in anger, shouting: "You are this barbarian! Why did you knock me over?" Pot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are hungry!" Kerry had no good temper, and the two fists squeaked against each other. "You almost bit my friend!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Is it?" The wizard shook his head and seemed to be awake: "It seems like this." He waved his hand and freed everyone from the bondage. Siegel took out his weapon, dagger and scimitar, and watched the wizard on alert. Janet hid behind Siegel, holding a flying knife in her hand. The wound caused by Yaril was not good enough by lightning, and it was broken again, so he fell to the ground, and everyone did not pay attention, trying to creep down to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry stood between the wizard and the crowd, and explained it in a half-baked idiom. "Witches are deformed, sometimes they are controlled by hunger and make animal-like moves. But he has never eaten people, but he has bitten people several times. Blood will make him wake up, then he will give people The wound is cured to prevent the infection from being mad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel still has a lingering fear that he is unresisting in front of this powerful deformer and wizard . He saw his sincerity and sincerity in the eyes of the strong man, and believed his explanation, but he was careful to guard against it, in case the wizard was crazy again - after all, he did not eat now, and he would be hungry at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are going, I have to hurry to eat something, I haven’t fainted yet." The wizard pointed to the tree hole exit, and then quite Looking at the cauldron with annoyance: "It’s spilled again. I won’t let anyone come in next time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you haven’t told me where my brother is. Kerry was quite helpless and asked quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am hungry to eat people, how can I help you divination?" The wizard shouted and began to dance again. Janet grabbed Siegel's clothes with her hand and only showed her big eyes. Siegel is also alert, like a cheetah with a tight muscle. However, the wizard did not go crazy this time. He just said: "Wait for tomorrow, take some millet by the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he drove the people away and closed. Tree hole. The esoteric picks up the wreckage from the pot, stuffs it into the mouth, and then sits on the side of the ground and chews. When he is crazy, his whole body will become more like an animal, and it is a mixture of countless kinds of animals, which makes his various senses reach the extreme. So he can distinguish Janet's demon blood, and he can also find the speciality of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is that person, one of the four, this is definitely not wrong." The wizard muttered, and there was a flame in his eyes, he said. "The Spirit of the Storm said, it won't deceive me, but what should I do? What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many voices in his mind There are constant reverberations, there are wolves, hawks, and sheep. They make all kinds of tweets, and they are constantly disturbing. Some say "kill", some say "put", and some shout "raise!". The wizard can understand the language of all animals, he can let them shut up and calm down. But he didn't, he could only cry while he let the voice in his mind drown himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few people who left the litter nest just wanted to pull away the distance as soon as possible, and the dense fog seemed to understand their thoughts, separating them from the middle and giving them a path. Kerry walked to the back and guarded several people stumbled back to the grasslands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He doesn't always do that." Kerry explained: "As long as he is not mad, he is a very good person and willing to help us. He is the most I will take a small bite and he will be cured for you, so don’t worry about it.” He said, pointing to his arm and showing it to everyone: “Have been bitten three times here, but now you even see the scars. Don't come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
