			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nightmare, Siegel thought in a confused way, but if it is a dream, why is there such a severe pain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fall never ends, the sound of the snow is still in the ear, and it seems that Siegel’s vision has returned to the sight, and the kitten on the cliff is crying. Eyes. This is not your fault, Siegel wants to tell her, but my luck is not good, don't cry anymore. He opened his mouth, but there was more wind poured in, and nothing could be said. The cliff disappeared in a blink of an eye, and the surrounding became a darkness. He feels that the whole world is wet, and the snow-formed water flows down the nose and ears, and only the mouth is thirsty. He is very thirsty, cold and tired and doesn't want to move. Between the hustle and bustle, he saw the snow in front of him, and wanted to reach out and grab a hand in his mouth. He could find that his wrist was tied by a rope, and the rope was frozen by ice, as strong as iron casting. Siegel can't break free no matter how he twists. He didn't know who tied himself up and didn't know why. There are always some shadows walking around, sometimes screaming, sometimes like thunder, but I can't hear what they say. A skin pouch was delivered to the mouth, and Siegel wrapped it like a baby, sucking hard into his mouth. The liquid is very awkward, but the body feels much better after drinking. Siegel also wanted that the skin was taken rudely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels hurt all over the body, but the pain is a good thing, proving that he is still alive. He tried to recover and see who the shadows around him were, but they were all in vain. He felt like a bag of potatoes, was thrown and thrown away, moving his position every day. Sometimes Siegel feels that he is on the back of the animal, face down, and watch the ground move backwards. Sometimes he felt himself being on his shoulders, and a disgusting body odor came in from his nose. He knew that there must be some broken bones in his body, because every time he bumped his chest, he felt like a heavy blow, and his arm seemed to be beaten by a stick. "Sir Bill? Janet?" He always talks vaguely, trying to catch the attention of the shadows. However, his voice is too light to hear clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, everything finally calmed down and no longer moved around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dreamed again, this time dreaming that he was above the sea, the lucky Sos is still a new ship, is about to carry out his maiden voyage. Captain Siegel-Marin was upright, and his beard was still white. He was yelling and letting the porters of the pier hurry to ship. Siegel is like a bird, floating in midair, looking down on everything. He heard a dignified voice in his ear saying, "Look!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stopped being a bird, but became one of the cabins A mouse is squatting in the corner to avoid the sailor's gaze. He is now looking out through the eyes of the mouse. Siegel remembered that a cat named Jerry had been raised on the ship until the boy was abandoned. When he was ten years old, the cat abandoned the big ship and ran off when he was in port. I don't know if Jerry is not here at this time, it is a good mousetrap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light footstep walked in front of the mouse, white silk robes with bare feet, looking like a woman. Then there was a pair of heavy iron boots and a brown cloak. The mice never look up, and Siegel can't see them. The two men walked to the door of a warehouse, and the wooden gates were automatically opened for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a place for catches, which is now full of seawater smell and the unique smell of squid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see! Let me see!" Siegel struggled in the dream, but the mouse has been cringing in the corner, its eyes are always staring A small piece of bread crumbs falling under the table. "Let me see who the two guys are, I swear to give you a whole piece of bread!" Siegel roared in his mind. Somehow, the mouse began to move, left the corner and went to the aisle. Although still hiding, Siegel finally saw the pair of men and women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was wearing a full body armor, a slashing sword, and a brown cloak was dragged to the ground. He turned his back to Siegel, wearing a helmet, but the hair from the edge of the helmet was black. The woman in a white robe covered her face with a hood, and there was a plaque made of linen in her arms. Siegel remembered the hands—the skin was smooth and white, and the fingers were thin and long. It must be the hand of a noble lady who lives in superiority. There is a beautiful tattoo on the back of the hand, three rings that are nested together, and decorated with endless stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockroach lifted up and stayed on the woman's lips for a while, then was gently placed in the squid compartment. The woman slowly closed the door, then she was soft and stumbled on the wall. The man held her and took her away half-baked. Siegel asked the mouse to rush up. He heard a faint voice and said to him: "Add another piece of meat." At this time, no matter what Siegel would agree, the mouse rushed up and slammed into the woman's foot. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in his dreams, he can still feel the pain of his neck being cut off and taste the death. He struggled in the body of the mouse and finally returned to his own shell - there was only pain in the chest and arms, and the neck did not feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a rare opportunity to wake up, he opened his eyes to see the surroundings. He was thrown naked in a stone room, and a strong iron cage door separated him from freedom. There is a small window on the stone wall, and snowflakes and faint sunlight flow in from there. The ground was damp and cold, and there was a small puddle not far from his mouth - he was still thirsty. Although his wrist hurts, Siegel struggled to climb into the puddle and tried to pick up some water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long hairy foot ruined his efforts and slammed the water in the pit. Siegel looked up and saw a fierce face with his forehead leaning, his jaw protruding, his teeth exposed and his skin rough. The only thing that can be said is that he has strong muscles, thick and strong wrists and ankles, and is a qualified half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jack, Mike." He had a heavy nasal voice, but the sound sounded short and powerful. After speaking these words, he sat back to the corner of the room. Siegel looked at him and tried to get up. With the faint light here, he saw a few traces of bruising on his chest, and the ribs must have broken a few. His wrists were worn by the ropes, and the wounds were deepened in the snow and ice, and the ulcers had formed. Fortunately, his hands and feet can still move, the scorpion and keys on his neck are still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a lot of effort to sit up straight, his two knees were very red and swollen, affecting the movement of the legs, but this injury should be able to be a few days restore. Siegel carefully touched the wound on his chest with his hand. The broken bones have been docked and only need time and influence to recover, which he is not worried about. The wound on the wrist will only get worse and worse, unless you can get the medicine in the key space. As long as the key and the scorpion are together, they are not afraid of others discovering it, but opening the space will definitely attract attention. Siegel couldn't believe the half-orc, so he could only wait until he slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the current situation, he has nothing to do except to continue to rely on the wall. No wand, no casting materials, no armor, no weapons, no idea where you are. Opposite the Orc's eyes glowed green in the dark, like the wolf's eyes, hoping that his hearing and smell should not be like a wolf, or the risk of opening the space is even higher. Siegel concentrated his spirit and contacted his own magical pet, and found that the raven was parked in a pine forest under the mountain, and looked up to the end of the sky where there were endless needles and spread from the foot. After the sun in the sky hides in the thick clouds, there is no way to tell the direction and not know the location. Borrowing the eyes of the raven, Siegel could not find traces of any man-made buildings around him, nor did it resemble the stone mountain on the outer wall of the cell. The magic pet can't help for a while, so Siegel regained his attention from the magic pet and closed his eyes to restore his spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Siegel can see the glowing green eyes of the Orcs every time he opens his eyes, with one exception. The wound on his hand and chest hurts more, so he asks: "What is this going to do, put me here and wait to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼克, 哼克.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you a guard?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”哼克,哼克. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you only say gram?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sighed helplessly and straightened his leg. There must be some way to get out of here, maybe the key is in this "small beast". This half-orc seems to be very self-contained, and there is no other hostile move except that he always keeps his eyes open and does not sleep. Although the Orcs will timidly succumb to the threat of a sword, when the opponent has no weapons, they will show the other side of their character: violent, irritable. Siegel suddenly became interested in this half-orc and wanted to know the meaning behind all his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This needs to start with getting his language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel continuously asked him a lot of questions, including "Can you understand me? Is there something to eat here? How long have you been here?" Gradually discovered the law of this half-orc. When he wants to answer "yes", it is "哼克"; "not" is "哼克,哼克". On this basis, Siegel gradually asked some information and was very helpful in understanding his situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
