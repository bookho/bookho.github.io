			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A long time no see, Siegel Lord, I have important things to look for." Tall Ryder is wearing a cloak, the body below reflects The radiance of metal. Both he and Erdu accepted the transformation of Siegel's Golem. The original soft clay is now being replaced by the body of steel and eucalyptus, which is more suitable for daily activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it is not a long time no see, after all, there is only one family in the castle, you can see it every time you look out the window. You still can't Determine which god is providing you with divine power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one really revealed this my mystery to me, but I can feel it does not care about identity It's just pure kindness and guardianship, but I have more important things when I come here.” Reid glanced at Isaac and closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you wait for me." Siegel called the servant, took the son away, and asked Rhett to go to his reception room. There is a huge chair with a special character that is very strong and can support the weight of the golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, my friend." There is nothing in the living room to enter Rhett, so Siegel will also eat and drink. Aside. The servants closed the door and several knights kept at the door. Their vows require that no one can be rumored to hear anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’ve been praying for the ability to remove pain and treat wounds, never thought about foreseeing the future. And you know, I’m a Golem, and There is no need to sleep, nor the ability to dream. But from a few days ago, there are strange things happening.” Rhett’s eyes sparkled like filled magical energy. However, Siegel can distinguish from the fluctuations of elements, those are divine power, very pure and powerful. He has never seen such a strong force in the general pastor, only the Holy One can reach a similar level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My spirit left my body and even left the real world. I arrived at a strange place. I was surrounded by a mirror made of water. I can see different me and see many places I have never seen before. But the images inside are always flashing away. One of the mirrors is very attractive to me, and it is the only mirror that can be watched for a long time. Inside, I saw the river of the Shield River dyed black. Death came along with the plague, giving Heim a terrible disaster. I saw the volcano erupting from the ground bringing purple lava to the ground, and suffocating The poisonous gas is accompanied by the inhalation of poisonous skin, the decomposition of the limbs, the mutating, the painful death. I saw anger, hatred and grief, and I saw the New World bleak. This is what I want to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you see when these things happen?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golem shook his head and said that he was not clear. "Siegel, I don't know what human dreams are like. So I am not sure if this is a dream, but I always see the same illusion, and I think it needs to cause you. Note." He stood up and bowed to Siegel, then said: "I hope that the scene I see does not happen, everything can be peaceful and joyful forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Rhett, I will pay attention." Siegel sent the devil to leave, and then called Alfred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aide, there are several temples outside the town of Mire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't even think about it. Blurt out: "The mother of the earth, the temple of the morning god and the god of the warrior god, I also know the priest of the moon god, but did not set up the temple. Mainly because of the elf war. The temple of the mother of the earth began to sell treatment The syrup, including the removal of disease and detoxification; the morning temple has a blessing and multi-character spell sale, they all said that the tax will be paid in the way of ordinary businessmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is a rare thing. No one asked us to provide the tax part to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heim collar is special, your prestige makes them dare not make Time." Alfred paused and said: "And Rhett's temple is in the castle, it provides free magical service, and there is no tax, so other families are embarrassed to speak." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I really have to thank Ryder." Siegel then said: "You ask for it personally. Have the gods recently lowered the collar of Heim? Holy, or please predict In addition to the craftsmen began sinking shield away from the river, there are the earth element of this help should not be difficult "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;... & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Let the spotted mountains pay attention to the changes in the Shield River and tell the squad to let the Orc Cavalry patrol increase the ranks of the Shield River. I want to know the changes in the river."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, Lord Lord, I will draft a good command book and then come back immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfred hastily left, he walked on the carpet There is almost no sound on it. Although Heim’s territory is vast, there are not many daily affairs, and the lords of each divided castle are also very loyal. In particular, the original ghost fog swamp is now being reclaimed into a good field in a large area. In the past two years, the weather has been smooth and rainy, so the life of the residents has been happy and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this calm is not to be destroyed by prophecy. Siegel wanted to pray for his territory, but he knew that no god would respond to his request. Strange, why does Rhett bring prophecy, not some other god's pastor, or even the saint? Siegel speculated that all the gods on the mainland had reached an agreement to isolate the user of the scorpion from the influence of the divine power. Didn't the god that Reid believed in not join the agreement, or did he secretly circumvent the restrictions of the agreement? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, this matter must be taken seriously. Contaminated river water is easy to handle, even if there is a problem with drilling wells, Siegel has other solutions. It is a big deal to use the power of the secret nuclear force to forcibly transform the material and then transform it into water, and then construct it into pure drinking water, which should also be used for emergency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plague is a headache, but Heim’s collar is not two years ago. With the increase of temples, there have been dozens of The priest who can dispel the disease is stationed near the city of Mire. There are also travel priests among the adventurers. They are good at fighting and the plague is not too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has some headaches when he thinks of adventurers, not because of this group, but because of love. Evan patted the butt with his loyal minister to return to the starry kingdom, but failed to take Ai Meng. She said that her adventure life is not over yet, and she is not sure that she will follow Evan. The king who did not become a king was not calm enough, or did not expect his passion for a few nights to be so successful. Half a year after Shake’s manor’s affairs, Ai Meng’s belly was taken over by Yao En. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king’s illegitimate child is also a son. Since Siegel knows this, he can’t let Ai Meng continue to be crazy. There are a few people in the castle who have no influence on him. Just as Lily of Kaibu Town came to the city of Mire, she asked her to be a servant. This matter must tell Evan that Siegel needs to know what he said. However, before Aaron's abdication, it was difficult to contact Evan in the general way. The key is that Siegel is worried about the information leaking inside. So he sent the letter to Sir Bill and asked him to convey it on his behalf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that Evan, who is born with an illegitimate child, will not abandon Emmon and should be able to properly dispose of it. However, during the pregnancy, Ai Meng is obviously not good at serving, and the temper is more straightforward than before - or weird. Siegel still remembers seeing Naria at the party of the federation. The female wizard’s eyes are constantly coming to her, just as there is a responsibility for Siegel in the belly of Ai Meng. Now he just wants to take these white eyes back and let her come to listen to the noise from the castle downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troubles from women are not limited to this. Wendy also found Narya’s eyes in the federation. After a few days, she came to the castle and said that she was helping Naria to send something to love. As for her real purpose, Siegel knows it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Janet was there, he didn’t need to worry about things he was not good at. Now Alfred is a steward, and he is good at other places, that is, "excessive care" about the lord's companion problem. The castle in Mire City seems to be completely open to all kinds of young women. Siegel often finds strange and beautiful faces. The number of maids is constantly increasing. Letters from passionate noble ladies from all over the world will always be placed on the top of the desk. All kinds of fragrances are distributed throughout the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These aromas have even begun to interfere with Siegel’s sense of smell, which may have a bad influence on magic experiments. When he thought of it, he ended his rest today, avoiding the chilled servants in the hallway—not a simple weather reason—to the lab that would never be disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is making his own lamp god and is ready to use it as a second housekeeper to handle his daily affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this light god, he did not adopt the simplified production method of the new invention of the Federation, because it can only move within the scope of the secret energy core, and there is no casting method. The "light god" of ability is nothing more than an invisible servant of blue manifestation, not to mention intelligence. Siegel made the structure creature according to the "classic" method, and loaded the new things he had learned as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
