			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people have been walking down the spruce forest, and Jack can always find something to eat. He can pluck the dead spruce bark and find the worm hidden underneath. He can find the squirrel nest hidden behind the branches. Although the squirrel was not caught, the pine nuts contained in it were enough for two people to eat slowly on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel patiently observes Mike’s actions, learns his behavior, and tries to understand the elements of thinking in the wild. He can't just walk like this half-orc, taking this snowy pine forest as his own field, but now in his eyes, the wilderness is not as indifferent and dangerous as it used to be. There is hidden vitality everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the half-orc lowered his body and gestured to Siegel to do the same. He pointed to the front, and Siegel found a beautiful long-horned deer hiding behind the pine trees, slamming the branches on the ground and tearing the outer skin to eat the middle core. This deer is not big, but it can be considered a big meal for two people. I don't know why it is acting alone here. I can only think that this is a natural favor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc reached out and asked for the ice dagger in the hands of Siegel. When Siegel thought about it, he gave him the dagger. As a mage, he has enough physical strength and energy to use spells to summon ice and fire to attack enemies. So relatively speaking, daggers are not an important weapon. He wants to see how the half-orc will act after he has a weapon to judge whether he can trust him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he took the dagger, he took the weight and held it in his hand. He stuffed a handful of snow into his mouth to cover up the heat of breathing. The Orc quietly approaches the long-horned deer, avoiding the direction of the wind and avoiding the front of the deer's field of vision. He gradually approached and prepared for the charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the scene from a distance, but he was not idle. Using the pine nuts that Zucker found, he can use the power of the spell to strengthen the aroma of the pine nuts and attract the deer's attention. Siegel doesn't know if the long-horned deer will be interested in pine nuts, but he has only this kind of thing at hand. The long-horned deer swayed in the direction of Siegel while lifting his head with his hoof. The mage hid behind the snowdrift, the long-horned deer couldn't see him, but he was fascinated by the smell of the pine nuts, and he did not find the half-orcs who were close to the machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼克!" The Orc rushed up and hugged the deer's waist. The long-horned deer slammed hard, and the head slammed back, trying to hurt the attacker with a horn. Zucker was prepared, grabbed the deer's neck with his arms, and folded his body back in half. Only listening to the sound of a broken bone, the half-orc solved the battle with brute force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs recruited and let Siegel hurry. He used the ice scorpion to cut the blood vessels around the deer's neck and lowered his head to drink hard. The blood contains powerful power, which represents the power of life, and is a good food in this wilderness. The Orc drank two, took a long breath, and then gave the position to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel used to eat food made from animal blood, such as blood sausages and blood clots. He squatted down and began to drink, but unexpectedly felt uncomfortable. A sensation of convulsions came from his heart, causing his breathing to rush, his mind dizzy, and his eyes turned around. For a time, he felt that the blood was like a poison to him, and he could not swallow. Siegel hurriedly loosened the deer and lay down on the ground trying to calm down. This is not a convulsion caused by the stomach, it is more like a deeper resistance of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhu Ke thought that Siegel did not adapt to drinking deer blood, and this fell to the ground. He just shrugged his shoulders and bowed his head and drank himself. Food can't be wasted, especially in this snow and ice. The education that Zucker received from childhood said that any wasted food would attract bad luck, and the devil and evil spirits would stare at you and look for opportunities to kill and eat you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After blood clotting, the Orcs began to peel the buckskin with an ice blade. The skin of this deer must not be enough to make clothes for two people, but the four warm boots are absolutely more than enough. Siegel gradually recovered at this time, and he finally wondered what caused the convulsions just now: in the Prison Dragon Cave, when the blood magician tried to get into his body, when he poured blood into his nose and mouth, Siegel had twitched this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is wrong with it?" Siegel frowned and thought. Fortunately, in addition to not being able to eat blood, no other abnormalities have been found. And the strength, speed, endurance and ability to cast spells are still the same as before. Siegel keeps this in his heart and waits for the doctor to check it after he has the conditions. Dr. Reese seems to be very good at treating blood diseases, hoping to meet him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sitting up on the snow, Siegel focused on the survival plan. He folded the branches and found the fluffy yellow vines, which could be used as a material for the fire. As a mage, he naturally does not need to drill wood or hit a meteorite to get fire. He only needs to gather the fire elements in nature. In the snow-covered land, the air is actually very dry, and the fire is much simpler than in the rainforest. Siegel carefully held the fire and soon lit the pine branches. The flames burned cheerfully, and the pine oil dripped down and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buckskin has been stripped at this time, and Zucker laid it on the ground, with the hairy side up. So two people sat on a soft, sleek fur mat, and everyone held steaming venison in their hands. A big bite, the aroma is strong, only that every pore in the body has recovered its vitality, and all the pain has been driven away, which can boost morale than any panacea in the world. Siegel once had a dinner to entertain the prince, had a feast for the dwarves, and was a good food after becoming a nobleman, but they were not as good as half of what they ate today. They have large pieces of meat in their hands, some are still roasted on the fire, and many of the snow on the side are still unfinished - this "bumper" feels better than anything else. The venison in the snow quickly filled the hungry belly of two people and added confidence and vitality to their actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has been trying his best to escape from the various plans, nervous and physically exhausted. Constantly releasing the spell with inferior casting materials also consumes his energy and energy. In this snow and ice, he relies on the will to survive and constantly confronts nature, challenges the limits of the body, and strives to protect the burning of the fire of life and maintain its warmth. After a night of survival, only then can he stop to take a break and take a good look at this place. Few humans can reach the northern part of the city wall, and only a few of them can return, and they can tell their stories to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun rises from the east, although it can only bring a faint temperature, but the golden brilliance still makes people feel close. There are no clouds today, so there will be no snow. Looking around, there is a beautiful and clear sky above the head. Under the sky, the woodland in the north is endless, and the rolling hills are full of pines and spruces. The surroundings are very quiet, but if you listen carefully, you can still distinguish the sound of animal activities. Siegel's black eyes swept through the woods, and the keen Bo caught a small deer, two clouded leopards and squirrels jumping around on the branches. There is a very bright reflection at the foot of the distant mountain. Looking at it, it turns out to be a stream that has not yet frozen. Siegel is now resting on the warm buckskin, there is a fire around him to warm up, there is venison on the fire to eat, his body tells him that he only wants to stay here, and he is not willing to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after all, it can’t stay too long, the danger has not disappeared, and at the end of the volcanic eruption, the enemy will send a team to search – even they are already On the way. Perhaps the takin's footprints will confuse them. Perhaps this pine forest is the best cover. Perhaps relying on the power of magic, Siegel can kill all the soldiers, but he does not dare to gamble. The two were very extravagant for a quarter of an hour, then they were busy again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of learning with Sir Bill are reflected. Siegel has long been familiar with the simple combat equipment, and with the help of magic, it is even more powerful. The skin of the branches was peeled off as a rope, wrapped around the cut pieces of wood to form a binding point, and Siegel quickly made simple deerskin boots. Under the blessing of the spell, the ice dagger was very sharp, and the antlers were sharpened quickly, splitting into two halves from the middle, which could be used as a double-handed multi-fork. If you encounter an enemy or a predator, this weapon is much easier to use than a short dagger. They were stuffed with snow in the deer's bladder, heated by the deer's stomach, melting the snow, and then placed the warm bladder close to the body, so there was a water bladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They used the remaining buckskin as a pocket to pack the meat away as much as possible. With the deer's bones and the power of the flame, Siegel tried to summon the mount again, but the spell failed, and the uncontrolled magical energy ran across him. Before the quell, the chances of casting a spell are greatly increased, so Siegel no longer makes similar attempts. Two people leaned on the legs of their talents while squatting on the roasting internal organs while carrying the spoils to the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal is that the stream in the valley, moving in the direction of its flow, is much more likely to encounter a settlement. Even without a village, the stream can provide plenty of water, and maybe there are fish that can be eaten. Many animals will drink water by the stream, which can also increase the food source of two people. If you hit a predator, then the magic of the antlers and Siegel can be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went for a whole day, and they didn’t stop on the road. They ate the cooked venison that was placed close to the body—although it was not frozen, it was still cold. Hard. They walked through the three valleys and slowly walked out of the rolling mountains. In front of the two people is an open land, snow has spread to the horizon. There are only a few round and gentle hills, except for the cypresses, there are already some drought-tolerant deciduous trees. When pointing to the east, Zucker can see that many thin columns of smoke rise from behind the hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sucker!" He pointed to himself, "Mike!" He pointed to the column of smoke and then smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Siegel is not sure whether the half-orc is laughing, the ugly face with fangs and thick eyebrows is enough to make people laugh. However, Siegel can understand the meaning of the half-orc, the location of the few columns of smoke is their destination, the tribe of the gram. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
