			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Saint has finally completed his promised transfer magic array, will teach the method to use Siegel, and then prepare to leave the Heim collar. Www*xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Once there is a call, I hope that you can complete the promise." When the Elf Saints left, he said to Siegel: "Be careful with murder." God's followers, they can't be treated with common sense. Your newly created magical array is very interesting. Why don't you give me a complete drawing, let me study it well?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Siegel shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elves are a pity, but they are not reluctant. "I saw the spark of wisdom, but unfortunately not from the elves. They are only a little worse, only a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, the elf saint dissipated in the air out of thin air In the middle, even a trace of magical fluctuations has not been stimulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental rune array and the energy focus lens are unable to guard against this approach, but hope that the new magic array can reach Siegel's vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim’s collar is gradually on the right track. Siegel has divided nine lords according to his merits and abilities. He lives in nine different towns and dominates the territory. The basics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana, Zucker also hosted the territory to Siegel, still staying with him. One is responsible for the daily affairs of All Heim, and the other is still in the military camp. Their territory and the secret city of the same law, usually do not separate each other, but the tax of the territory will be the income of two people, Siegel no longer pay their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this does not give them the idea of ​​leaving the city of Gore to go to the territory for management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel. The Earl of Squid still likes the current situation in the depths of the heart, because with the pressure of the two of them, he can invest more in the field of magic. More energy. In particular, Fitzkal recommended Alfred Wolf to be the new head of the city, and Siegel was freed from the cumbersome daily affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfred is a young man with a golden back and looks more like a bodyguard than a servant. His father used to work for the Earl of Cecil, the famous honey lord of the Star Kingdom, and he was trained to take over his father's work. Later, because of a terrible plague. The family of Earl Cecil was not spared, and Alfred’s father was killed in the disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he came to the New World and joined the mercenary group. Because I can write and count on trivial matters. He soon became the deputy head of the Golden Beard Mercenary. When Fazak recruited the housekeeper, he found it a good opportunity. So he and the mercenary united to pay the honor, and came to the city of Miele to apply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he is wearing a light brown coat outside the white shirt, holding the letter just sent in the silver plate in his hand, standing quietly in front of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, let go, you can." Siegel finally finished the scroll in his hand and put the quill on the side, then raised his head and said to the butler. "Alfred, I often get mad at the time of studying magic. I don't need to waste time waiting for me at this time. If it's an emergency, go find the Raven Baron, use it to notify and wake me up. And you know how to Where is the crow, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Lord Lord, the Raven has been around Isaac." The housekeeper put the letter down, "Please call I can do it with Ed." When he finished, he was ready to quit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't go busy, wait for me to read these letters." Siegel stopped him and let him sit by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver plate is all letters from the various lords of the South, and no one is what Siegel wants to see. After the respectful greetings, there are carefully tempted and infatuated proposals. And Siegel needs to answer them in a polite way. After the war, Heim’s collar quickly opened the gap with other territories, using newly acquired land, population and convenient business resources. Constantly gathered wealth and strength. In another year or two, when Heim’s collar completes the transformation of the rich land of the ghosts and swamps, it will become the strongest force in the southern part of the New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the heart is very impatient, Siegel is still a letter to open the letter and read it carefully. Through letters, Siegel also asked the lords of the South to pay attention to the movements of the black people, and to guard against the emergence of believers of the murder god. "They tried to destroy the hard-won peace by means of assassination." Siegel explained this to the lords, hoping they could listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You used to live and study at the Earl of Cecil, tell me about it." Siegel responded by manipulating the spell. Talk to Alfred. "What is the aristocrat of the Starry Kingdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl of Cecil is not as busy as you, and there is only one estate and three farms in his territory. "Elfred's voice is flat and clear, and it doesn't look too slow. "In addition to the hazards of the hive, the Earl usually does not have much work. My father said that in the early years, the Earl's ancestral division was divided too much, and other families continued to erode the land through marriage, leading to the decline of the last family. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it comes to this question, you can help me to pay attention to Mana and Mike." Siegel said: "They have not yet become a family, are they not?" Is there such a risk?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Earl, I will pay attention." Alfred nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel continued to reply, and then thought of one thing: "Is the trophy shipped from the north already in stock, have you counted?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler nodded: "The current inventory value is about 300,000 gold coins, but this work has not been completed. What is your arrangement for these wealth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortune? Gold and silver only." Siegel pointed a finger from the bookshelf behind him, a book with a pale yellow cover, written in blue "Illustration of Common Alchemy Materials." “It’s the original federation’s acquisition of alchemy materials through various channels, which will keep it strong and take advantage of this opportunity to pick up the broken channels.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Earl of the Earl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every order goes on behalf of many people must work hard, so Siegel does not often directly assign tasks, smarter ways It is the use of a large number of mercenaries in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heim has played the mercenary power in several wars, and paid for it afterwards. This kind of behavior has gained a good reputation among mercenaries, and all adventurers know that Heim is a wealthy territory with gold mines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel set up an official bulletin board, which will post some bounty missions, most of which are from Siegel Lord himself. The tasks are not complicated, and they are mostly rewards for collecting magical materials and special animals and plants. Sometimes, the bad guys who become bandits in the war, or the property of a certain area are investigated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the task of collecting materials frequently appears on the notice, all the year round, the adventurers and mercenaries will come here after coming to the city of Mith. Over time, the caravans and the wealthy residents of Mier City have taken a fancy to this kind of convenience. Here, another bulletin board has been erected to issue a “civil” mission. The "unique" Kenji Baron, who was born by the mercenary, turned his brain and bought several houses next to the bulletin board. After the opening, he built a pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this famous Twilight tavern is still under construction, and Siegel is attracted by another thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A halfling from the starting point of the outpost, hiding himself in the jar of ale until the kitchen was discovered?" Siegel looked at Alf Reid, I think this is a bit too unbelievable. "I remember that the tunnels in the Walled Mountain Range have been inspected closely. How can such a thing happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The half body is small and good at hiding," the butler replied: "When she woke up, she said that there are important things to report to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you looking for me?" Siegel thought about it, the recent starting point of the outpost There are no new situations on the side, the transportation of goods has been very stable, and shouldn't something happen? But for the sake of safety, he still saw this half-body who was almost drowned. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This halfling was taken to Siegel’s study by the guards, and a faint scent of wine came from her. Even after taking a long bath, the taste of the ale seems to have penetrated into his skin and it is difficult to get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is only one meter tall, with curly algae green hair, and two large round ears from the hair. A petite face makes her look extra childish, just like a four- or five-year-old child. However, the halflings are the same when they were young. Unless the hair starts to whiten and the face crawls out of wrinkles, it is difficult to see their true age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
