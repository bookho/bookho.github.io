			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood in the cold dawn, looking at the macabu shackled by the dark clouds. He could see a few bodies sloping in the snow on the side of the road, and the wolf who had broken the chain was eating. A team of slaves who had just been escorted were huddled in a cold iron cage, and the scene of beasts was scared to move. The wolf's teeth cut open the belly, and the frozen intestines have long been frozen into a large piece of cockroaches, which only slowly softens when the hot air ejected from the wolf's mouth transpires. Every day, there are many residents in the city, and the number of slaves who can't support themselves is the most. This is a city that only belongs to young and old, and aging is only a dead end, and this death is definitely not the end of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he thought of death, the Master recalled the tragic situation seen in the town of bacon. The ground is full of broken bodies, the walls and trees are full of blood, and the whole city is the smell of smoke and blood. The riots created by the Knox Association destroyed the entire city, and on top of the bones, they got a smoldering crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stone contains the energy of flames, but it is not a fire element, which Siegel can feel. The normal fire element represents temperature and is the power of burning, and there is no emotional fluctuation. But the soul of the soul is full of roaring souls and crying in pain, above which is a burning red flame. After obtaining the jewel, Siegel tried to study its use and usage. At that time, it was conceived to use it as a casting material to enhance the activity of the fire element and achieve the purpose of destroying the dock. However, with the continuous experiment of Siegel, there is no fire power except the resentful grievances that are led out from the sacred soul crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lit the fire, the pipe was burning with the good tobacco leaves found from the Wushi Village witch festival, and of course the pipe was also the same place. The quality of the tobacco leaves is very good, and it can burn slowly without sucking, so Siegel simply puts the pipe in his hand and puts it on his chest to let the aromatic smoke help him to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalls and calculates every step of the Alchemist Eric's pharmacy. Since he has never revealed that he is a mage, he is able to watch the entire situation of the alchemist's work without doubt: how he prepares the materials, how to match, how to control the temperature, and how to pharmacy. Eric is equipped with a slow-acting magic effect inducer that works after a period of rest, releasing the energy from magical items and magical materials. This medicinal agent is often used in the analysis of ancient runes or magic arrays, allowing hidden magic to appear, playing a good role in catalysis and assistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use this medicinal agent to elicit the energy in the sacred crystal, thereby deceiving the magic detection enchantment and letting it think that there is an unauthorized casting In order to mobilize the city's guarding power, to cover the real action. There are few materials that can satisfy this condition, only some types of crystal stones and amber. But in Macabu, there are a lot of spoils from the south, and the gemstones that the orcs have plundered from the dwarf mines. The materials that meet the conditions can always be found. Why do you have to use the soul crystal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical question is, what is the relationship between Eric and Knox, and where did he get the inflammation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel only feels that the road ahead is confusing and there is no way to control it. He does not have a friend who can be trusted to be a staff member, not to mention a companion who can entrust his life. When there are dwarfs Elinette, Elf Leah and Plateau Dio, the feelings of adventure are completely different from the present. Even if you master more magic, the strength and skills are much better than that at that time, but you always have a hand and look forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Maxim and the Master are not at all right, it is difficult to fight alongside him; the female shooter Mana is like a response, what the count says when he says something, There is no opinion at all; Tim's guilty skill is much higher than the good deeds, and only the count's prestige can completely suppress him, so that he can barely make a scorpion when he executes the order; the gnome does not say a word after getting the pharmacy. Into the orc city, disappeared into the chaotic streets and alleys, to hide the fragments of the sorrow of the sights hidden in hidden places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Eric, Siegel’s most invisible is the alchemist Eric. From his alchemy techniques and techniques of pharmacy, Siegel must have been a spellcaster, not a pure alchemist who he claimed. If you shave his head, draw a vortex sign, and insert a wand into his hand, he is definitely a true union sorcerer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Masters Federation in Deepwater City. It is impossible to let the Knox Commonwealth Wizards participate in the action. Is this Eric an enemy or a friend? Judging from past experience, Siegel believes that he should be counted as an enemy, because the recent actions of the Knox Association are more like simply creating killings and chaos, rather than working for the victory of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Long Shiya met three sorcerers of the Commonwealth. For the first time, they knew that they had spells to modify their memories, to create swearing spells and to smash the shackles in the air. The cloud of grievances rising over the squad and bacon towns is the same, the only difference is the size of the gathering and the way it breaks out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knox Commonwealth is also killing the orcs, but Siegel and they are not all the way. Perhaps Eric's approach can perform as expected, completely destroying all the docks, but Siegel can't pin all his hopes on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Siegel had to give up the action in Macabu, only stumbled upon the true identity of Fazak, and let him stay again. But it made him into more trouble. Siegel feels like a sea boat falling into a whirlpool, and even if it is hard to work, it is difficult to overcome the attraction and break free. ‘What happened around me is not normal. ‘Siegel’s gaze flickered after the smog. He began to do things in tandem with the north. It felt like there was power to keep him from going south, so he must be brought to Macabu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you appear in a volcano prison, this thing is very strange. Siegel is self-sufficient in physical fitness and superb in magical talents, but through the dark river through the entire wall mountain range without death, this is beyond the reach of ordinary people. The prisoner in the cell has a strong wild survivability, allowing him to survive on the snowfield, and his village is just managed by humans and will not be sold as a slave again; when the bacon town is in danger There will be a "dead shadow" to guide him through the crisis, but also open up the new ability of the blind; relying on new capabilities, he entered the Macabu, and then fell into the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wants to be a hero. His favorite thing in Ximu Town is to listen to the stories of heroes. The sorcerer Ilming, the dragon knight Fedan, and the legendary monk Reggola, their stories are filled with the spirit of struggle, sacrifice and never give up, and of course the luck that ordinary people can hardly match. Whether it is the New World or the Old World, people believe that there is a god of destiny, responsible for writing the path of each person's life, using the trajectory of the stars to reveal the secrets of the future, the mortal heroes are his darlings. Once upon a time, Siegel had always envied those heroes who could play an important role in the continually legendary story, but never thought about how much hardship and pressure they had to face on becoming a hero. He also wants to let his name be passed down by the world and be remembered by future generations, such as the legendary wizard Siegel, or the hero knight Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it will never be a marionette Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of destiny in the dark makes him put him in danger again and again, and brings him to the present stage with miracles again and again, what kind of purpose? Can you afford the burden of fate, and can you break free of the default script? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked up at the Haiping line, and the sun finally rose from the dark clouds and made a ray of light. Even the evil and fallen orc city of Macabu, there will be bright and spectacular sunrises. He could hear the sound of getting upstairs, and the "Alchemist" began to dance with his bottles and cans. Mana and Tim were exercising, and the one-eyed Fitzak was giving breakfast to the count. According to their plan, after the night, the syrup will play its full role, and the whole city will fall into chaos. At that time, the alchemist can “catalyze the purgatory hyphae and let the fire element come to the shipyard”. Siegel doesn't believe his words at all. He only has one day to find out the truth and respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak sounded the door of the Siegel room, but the Master did not pay attention. He smashed the pipe, jumped from the second floor sill, and walked into the alleys of the city with a light pace. For a long time, the magic pet who had not flapped his wings followed, and after three rounds in the air, he stopped on the owner's shoulder and licked his head with his head. Siegel made it quiet because he needed quiet thinking. For the Master, the first thing is to understand what effect the inflammatory soul catalyzed by the magic effect inducer will have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walks in a corner that is not in the attention of the people, and recalls all the ingredients and production methods of the medicine. He took some of the material while he was giving the alchemist, and now he needs to find a secluded place to reconfigure the potion, but it will be a quick-release version. He has been thinking about where to make the emergence of magical fluctuations less conspicuous? Magic items sometimes appear on the auction floor, and the Witch Festival may pay little attention to the energy fluctuations that appear there, but the auction house is always bustling and there is no secluded place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly had a flash of light and thought of a place that might be safe. There is an arena in Macabu, where the orcs will let the slaves fight in the fight, fight each other, or fight with the beasts. Sometimes they will let the slaves drink violent potions and enhance the viewing of the battle, and these potions will radiate the energy of magical fluctuations, which can cover Siegel's magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
