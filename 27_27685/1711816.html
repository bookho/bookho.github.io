			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole town was covered with a layer of lead-colored fog, and countless faces emerged from it, with a big mouth mourning, but there was no sound coming out.Siegel saw the faces of human beings, the faces of half-orcs and the faces of more orcs. They all suffered the same pain and were trapped in the fog and could not be relieved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All faces are festering, from youth to aging to final decayWhen the face changes into a cockroach, it will retreat into the fog and give up the next face.The clouds are constantly rolling, and the faces come and go.They are all expressing an emotion: the pain that never endsThe cloud is filled with resentment and pain, the color is getting deeper and the volume is expanding.In the etheric vision, not only the town, but the range of more than 20 miles is covered by clouds.Through the etheric vision, this spell was also triggered in advance, and the grievance found the catharsis channel and began to affect the mage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has never seen such a terrible sight and was shocked to speak.He was swept by a pain, and a misty face was printed on his mind, and even the voice of mourning began to be clearly audible.Roaring and roaring: If all life is waiting for death, what is the meaning of life? Siegel knows badly, tries to find strength from the soul, explores and tries to recall the happy side of life, and dispels the anxiety caused by the grievances.But his body is shaking, his thoughts are jumping in confusion, and it is difficult to concentrate on memories.Siegel turned to magic again and wanted to get support from it.The spell jumped into his mind, but the spell disappeared before he had time to capture the text.He is helpless, and his mind is influenced by the spells here. Like the sailors who fall into the sea of ​​storms, they struggle in the waves and the wind, but they will exhaust their energy and be swallowed by death.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to get out of the state of etheric vision, but finds that he can’t control it, even he can’t even close his eyelids.A trace of mist rushed through his eyes, forcing the operation of the etheric visionSiegel’s headache is cracking, his eyeballs are rising, and he’s almost jumping out of his eyes.If he has a teacher's guidance, he will know the danger of etheric vision and the method of forced withdrawal.Like many unfamiliar newbies, Kesig rushed to use techniques that were not fully mastered, and just touched dangerous spell enchantments.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a panic, he grabbed the twenty-faced scorpion on his chest, hoping to resist the power of magic to save him.But since the fading of the number one, the effect of resisting magic has never appeared again.Siegel’s rapid breathing, feeling like he’s going to smash, blood flowing from his eyes and ears, the fire of life is gradually extinguishing<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being controlled by the spirit of the spirit, he couldn’t even call for help, even the painfulThe orc next to him looked at the mask witch festival and was constantly shaking, thinking that he was communicating with the gods, all quietly retreating, giving up a large open space.Siegel knows that he must find a way to save himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of etheric vision must end, otherwise it will be sucked up by the power of the spirits sooner or later, but the flesh and blood cannot block the etheric vision, so the eyes are blind without significanceSiegel has only one left hand to barely be able to move, and he has only one choice left - poke himself<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a difficult and helpless choiceSiegel loosened his throat with his left hand, like the old man with a trembling, shaking his fingers and extending his fingers to his eyes.He felt that after leaving the scorpion, his arms became stiffer and he was about to lose control like other parts of the body. He only tried to concentrate, lift his arms and raise them a little.This is a horrible and painful experience that requires great courage to withstandAs the finger gets bigger and bigger in the line of sight, you can quickly reach the eyelashes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third side of the scorpion lights up, then the etheric vision stops.There is no worries in Siegel’s field of vision. The sky is bright and sunny again. He gasps with a big mouth and feels that the air full of orc smells can be beautiful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a life saver? Siegel touched the number three with his fingers and quickly learned the role of this: etheric visionThe scorpion sealed Siegel’s etheric visual skills and became effective and closed according to his mind.As long as a mage who has received specialized skills training will have this ability, it can be said that Siegel will not - now he "finally" can do it through the scorpionSiegel has never understood the principle of Xunzi. He also tried to analyze the above mantra after he became a mage.But under the effect of the number two "hidden items", no spell can aim at the scorpion, including Siegel's analytical mantra.Although it has a physical body, it exists only in the vision of Siegel, and other people can't see it or touch it, so the spell can't work.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a number of three, getting a Siegel ability to learn by mastering, let him feel a little depressedBut when he thought of his own life, he was relieved.He has heard many stories about most of the self-taught wizards, how to become a master.Kesigge found that in addition to the incredible good fortune, those people have no place to learn.Siegel just tried the etheric vision and almost died. Those who summoned the creature under the guidance of no one, experimented with elemental magic under unprotected, and even tried to control the dead spirit themselves, all died.The piles of bones are piled up, enough to completely submerge the few masters who are "self-taught".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
