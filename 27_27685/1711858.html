			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord's Hall of Black Blood Castle also serves as a restaurant, conference room, and casino, but it is the first time as a ruling hall. There is also air-dried vomit on the ground of the stone. The dog's feces that are not cleaned up in the corner faintly stinks. As for the dark red mark under the window, I don't know which time the drink is left behind. In short, this place is more than enough for the arena, but it is too much play as a ruling court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Prince Aaron’s lower seat sat on the only high-back chair on the scene, and looked at the crowd without saying a word, so no one changed it. Local advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the paladins stood side by side on the sides of the wall, the pale golden cloak was as bright and bright as the sun, and the shield standing in front of it became a smudge of the corner. Things, this hall has finally looked like. The aristocrats who have been trapped here for a long time have been flustered and finally waited for this interesting thing. They whispered into the room, and the alcohol exhaled in their mouth was almost directly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Silence!" The voice of Count Todd echoed in the hall, and everyone else understood that he should shut up. As a result, in addition to the count, there are actually other voices. Evan is holding a jug and is helping his brother prepare drinks. The masters of the superb swordsmanship, actually shaken at this time, deliberately let the wine glass make a squeaky sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take a crime." The count said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet was sandwiched between two paladins, and her wrists and ankles had translucent chains that were held behind her. Paladin in the hands. There are countless mysterious runes on the chain that will allow evil creatures and demons to smash. But Janet only thinks it is an ordinary chain, even lighter than the average iron chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was arrested this afternoon, when the kitchen was preparing everyone’s dinner, and her task was to clean the dishes. After ambushing in the snow, she disguised herself with her ability to change her shape, mercenaries, soldiers, little horses feeding the horse, and then the cook. Even when the rescue of the morning church arrived, she did not come out to meet and continued to hide in the kitchen. This is her habit after training, and the previous identity can only be reused when it is absolutely safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one around makes her feel safe. Since Siegel was smashed by his own flash, and then the horse fell into the cliff, life became a permanent darkness. She is always in a state of paralysis and sleeps well every day. Have a nightmare all night. In her dreams, she became a giant who had been burning with flames. Her hair, skin and most of her flesh and blood were scorched and stripped in the flames. The original exquisite face became a sultry skull, leaving only a layer of broken dead skin wrap. The tail behind it is no longer smooth and round, but like a scorpion. The tip is also under the toxic droplets. The smell of sulfur is pungent, and a terrible rancid smell is added to the dream. This terrible monster keeps making ice walls, stacked on top of each other. When a figure approaches, the monster will push down the ice wall, shoot the figure below, mash it into a patties, and smash it into blood porridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is sometimes Janet, sometimes Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She woke up sweaty, sometimes found herself not in bed, but in the castle, and also showed the prototype of the demon . Sometimes there will be some wounds on her body. But it's not serious, like being scratched by sharp things like scissors, but she can't remember what happened. This kind of sleepwalking disease is getting more and more serious, but the paladin patrolling in the castle has never been noticed, so Janet also thinks that sleepwalking itself is dreaming. Everything seems illusory and unreal after Siegel disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is missing and will never die. She is deeply convinced of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now she doesn’t know what her crimes are, she is brought to the public. The atmosphere here seems to be a starry kingdom, and those who point to the aristocrats. The knights who are pretending to be there are high-ranking royals. The courage of her deep memory slowly came up, and the part of the spy "kitten" began to take over the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the prayer of the Cooper Bishop, who prayed to dispel the evil in the darkness and bring light and justice to the people on the earth. When he finished speaking. Prince Aaron went on to say: "This ruling will be presided over by Count Todd." Then he sipped a sip and placed the cup gently on the table at hand. Evan once again smashed the wine and expressed his dissatisfaction in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Janet, are you cursing to His Royal Highness Prince?" asked the count, who was approaching the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of the bishop frowned, and although he was unexpected, he still said without concealing: "The magic reveals that this statement is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is not the end, Mr. Earl should be relieved, why don't you go back to rest?" Evan grinned and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightest disregard of the behavior of the illegitimate child, "Do you deny that you are a devil?" asked the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I deny it." Janet said: "I am just a demon, not a devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pripher Cooper suddenly shouted: "Lie!" The sacred emblem in his hand gave off a dazzling golden glow, like a spear that pierced the dark light, and shot on Janet. The girl made a painful cry and screamed and made everyone lick their ears. She fell to the ground and twitched like a mouse under the cat's claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, a phantom appeared on Janet’s body, first standing still like a stone figure, and then there were numerous cracks on the surface. Below the crack is a red magma, and the huge heat drives the stone statue to stand up. The stone statue then had claws, teeth and wings. In the eyes of everyone, this is the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet also saw this scene, it was not her, not even her dreams. She tried to beg for mercy, but she couldn't say anything under the pressure of magic. There was a commotion in the hall, some people retreated in disgust, and others put their hands on the sword. Sir Bill frowned and looked at the sight in front of him. His fist clenched and loosened, hesitated for a few breaths, but finally stood up and bowed to Count Todd and asked to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop your spell, the bishop of the bishop, I think everyone can see it clearly." The count waved and saved Janet from the pain. When the phantom slowly disappeared and disappeared completely, the count said when comparing the prince: "Mr. Tiger Bill, what do you want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I want to hear the confession of this person." Sir Bill said: "She should have the opportunity to defend herself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to show His Royal Highness Fairness will naturally give this Miss Janet a chance to speak." The count turned to ask the pastor: "How, safe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured, The safety of the royal family members has always been our primary goal.” Pastor Cooper replied: “Even if she speaks, she will not reach the people around her, and I will personally guard my Highness, and it will be foolproof.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you can speak for yourself." Earl looked at Janet: "Let's say, you pretend to be a servant, what is your intention in the Black Blood Castle?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitten coughs hard, and the gods make her scorpion like a fire, one The black smoke burst out with the cough - this scene made everyone more worried. She barely propped up her hands and looked around at the crowd. No one will speak for her. There are only lively, ulterior motives, stubbornness and prejudice. Even Siegel’s master is using his words to describe himself. In your heart, I have been convicted, Janet thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I followed a good man to the Walled Mountains." Janet said slowly, the voice is not high, it seems to be speaking to myself. "He fell off the cliff in battle and lost his track. I was taken to the castle and I have been waiting for him here. I know that if he does not die, he will come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing this, several people familiar with Siegel thought of the young man who rescued the prince and then received the baron. It seems that the enactment ceremony in the snow is still vivid, but only the four people can still remember the appearance of the subject. Sir Bill is full of pain in his heart, and every time he mentions this, his heart seems to have been dug a knife. Afterwards, he inquired about several people about the battlefield, and the conclusions were basically the same: Janet's flashing spells made Siegel lose the battlefield vision before it led to the cliff event. Bilger is always looking for Janet, want to ask her the truth, to determine the responsibility of the whole thing. However, this demon has long been hidden and was discovered only today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Jazz is very contradictory. On the one hand, he wants to pay the price of the person responsible for the biggest drop in Siegel’s cliff. On the other hand, he feels that he is trying to interrogate a little girl. Very unfair. Almost all the people present were attracted by the priest's spells, and Janet has been treated as a devil. But is this spell really true? If it is true, then it is true that the girl said that she did not impose a curse on the prince. In fact, the purpose of the trial is not to find the reason why the prince's body cannot be recovered. As for the other, it is not important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
