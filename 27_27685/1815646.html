			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the clearing up, the time has passed for almost three hours. Siegel gently tapped his finger in the air, and the spell of the mind control immediately covered the entire rune wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf rune perceives the alien spell and immediately reacts to unite the rune of the entire wall. During the time, everyone saw a barrier that radiated bright light, and the dwarf text that was constantly moving formed a shield to resist the pull from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can cause a lot of trouble for ordinary military and even general mages, but it is very easy for the magic god to deal with. After all, the wall is dead, how it works, and what kind of loopholes are fixed. Siegel knows all about its design, and even the analysis is not expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the dwarf rune system is now under the control of magic - as a swap dwarf, you can also train the mage normally, not as lucky as it used to be. Appeared - the magic god can suppress the runes like a normal spell. These rune walls cost a lot of money when they were built, and almost hollowed out the old bottom of Heim. Siegel's memory is still fresh, so I won't waste the runes, and I will definitely apply them to the newly built temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall was dismantled and restored into pieces of masonry, and the growth team flew to the open space. Those things that were not thrown away in the city walls, such as sleeping covers and other debris, were all thrown away from the air. A few people who died and did not leave were also exclaimed, trying to grasp the rising stones. But the Rune City Wall itself is restrained to climb, so these people will eventually fall, life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few smart people rushed for mercy at the last minute: "God, I am wrong, please spare me!" These people are feathered Floating down, and finally landed safely on the ground. Seeing such a miracle, many people can't help but squat down and don't want to talk about it. Their eyes flashed with a fascinating look, full of desire for power. As for faith, it is something that will be produced after a slow training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching the temple, the magical spacecraft shook, then quickly lowered the altitude and speed, and finally stopped close to the ground. "What happened, can the spell and the secret nuclear fail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, everything works fine, but it doesn't fly." One mage said: "All flights are the same result, they can only move backwards and cannot fly forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too weird, report The leader of several factions, and then the magic spacecraft back. Is this the legendary spell no-flying array?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical spacecraft naturally escapes the West Geer's intuition, after all, is within his perception within a radius of thirteen miles. Even if he focuses on controlling spells and divine power, changes in the surrounding environment will not be ignored. After becoming a magical god, he can be distracted and useless. There seems to be no limit in perceiving this aspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see the inside of the Federation spacecraft, the chiefs of the factions gathered together, greeted each other and walked off the spaceship. He saw that Wendy was constantly casting various spells and trying to find out the scope of the ban. She is destined to be disappointed, because it is formed by divine power and is not entirely a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still the same, but she is more elegant and more and more silent. Even if the chiefs of other factions talked to her, she only responded with a nod and shook her head, and rarely said one or two words. Her ability to cast spells has declined somewhat, and now she is barely able to reach the level of the sergeant. What is causing this situation? Siegel can see at a glance that her physical condition is no problem, that is for psychological reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not be foolish in this matter, thinking that Wendy has nothing to do with himself. The deeper the entanglement, the more trouble he has. He has no other way than cold treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting the eyes, the base of the temple has been completed. Runestones are combined into a hard whole. There is no gap under the fusion of earth elemental forces. Only one layer of complex magical lines can leave traces on the stones. Siegel hides a sinister nuclear array in the base, usually closed, and does not output elements. If you are in danger, or there is no other elemental polymer core in this world, you can also turn on and reignite the hope of unlimited energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other runestones flew in and turned into stone pillars, stone walls and floors. Siegel built his own temple, a very simple style, but with profound connotations. He permanently imprinted all the tricks and representative low-level spells on the walls of the temple, and at the same time fully disclosed how to perceive the elements and how to simulate the spells with meditation. Some of the most basic truths, the requirements of the Master are also left on the wall. This area is open to everyone, whether it is a believer or not, no matter what the mother tongue, even if you don't recognize the word, you will realize the above things when you see the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret nuclear, advanced creation, and serial transmission arrays have completely changed the world system. Learning magic is no longer expensive and unacceptable. At least, becoming an apprentice is no problem for ordinary people. Once Sigel had to save enough of two thousand gold coins to have an opportunity to follow the salon, now that he can guarantee the work of the workshop for a period of time, he can get the apprentice training free of charge. Even so, apprentices are still in short supply and are gradually becoming the best way to read and read. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in response to this trend that Siegel placed the enlightenment materials in the temple. At the same time, he will stay in the temple in how to build this "spiritual communication" statute. Every high-level priest must learn to constantly promote the enlightenment. These enlightenments will help the temple to expand the influence of the magic god, leaving at least the traces of the vast majority of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Magic will be the step after the Enlightenment, where the official Master will be trained until they can be left alone. Masters are not required to be believers, but they need to know that the magical god is real, which is enough. Siegel will not respond to their prayers unless it is about new spells. On the one hand, he does not want to interfere with the mage's free thinking, on the other hand he is too lazy to manage so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, he is not Lear, but Siegel, the wizard who left Janet and his management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple continues to expand, and the Enlightenment Hall is followed by an area reserved for pastors who make magical potions and magical equipment and provide treatment for the caster. But most importantly, they have to supervise the operation of the magic spar, the secret energy core and the transmission array to ensure that they are not abused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a place where cloning is performed. Siegel decided to leave the right to use the cloning to the temple to make up for the inability to perform the resurrection. Masters have a strong power, and if they want to guide them, the temple must remain attractive enough. Siegel used cloning to disintegrate the knowledge blockade of the Masters Association and successfully plucked the gods with cloning, so he knew how important the influence of this spell was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If combined with the use of Gothic manufacturing techniques and the use of the secondary brain, cloning allows the wizard to "mirror" itself and exert double power over a certain period of time. This is the highest technology of the temple, and only the main temple of the city of Mith will be owned. As for how to decide who can use cloning, Siegel also decided to hand it over to future priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, who is his pastor? Siegel also felt a little curious. If he predicts that the priesthood is still there, he should have had an answer at this time, but this waiting with expectation is also very interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the priest service area was built, the entire temple was completed. As for where the pastors live, he doesn't want to worry about it. If the priests all live in the temple, like the magic tower's mage, will it be too far from the market? As a magical god, Siegel decided to keep the sex as much as possible, and his pastor should do the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last piece of work is to hang the holy emblem, marking the official completion of the temple. Siegel thought for a long time, decided to be lazy, slightly changed the banner of Heim's collar, made the squid flag with six tentacles representing the four elements and positive and negative energy, and let it hold the magic book and wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it, even if you only draw a triangle, it doesn't affect the use." Siegel looked at his temple with satisfaction, and smashed it. After the nose went in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked away and threw the magic array everywhere. After the construction is completed, the flight and transmission are allowed here, but the magical effect is not used. Malicious distortion, mind control, charm, and most spiritual illusions within the shrine are forbidden, and petrification, dissociation, curse, and large cracking spells are not allowed. The spells that attack the building all hit the anti-magic force field, and the general sword wants to destroy the runestone is also quite difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s enough to have such protection for most situations. After all, the main force here will be the priest and the mage, and a few hundred meters away is the city of Miele. City wall. The nine-claw flag of the squid family and the six-claw flag of the magic god will complement each other and will be the most stable alliance in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave the relationship of the temple, your descendants can sit back and relax, but what extent Isaac can develop without relying on the temple, but By Siegel's education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked into the temple, through the Enlightenment Hall, to the back of the pastor area. As soon as he raised his hand, he made a tension field for himself and then sat quietly on it. God can emanate from the body, and all the places with magic receive news. This is the privilege of each new god, and it can declare its existence by the power of the crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
