			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Evan returned to the camp, and naturally doctors bandaged them. In the basement of a manor outside the miles, in a small, tightly closed room, a half-elf woman with a bandage was waking up from a coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing another woman next to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should learn the lesson this time." The woman standing with a kind smile, but the person with the scars never thought so. She struggled to sit up, but was slap in the face, and suddenly she forced her to fall back on the slate bed, making a "beep" impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have much time, the weak number eighty." The standing woman licked her palm, and the slap in the face just shook herself. The old injury of the year, this should also continue to punish her. She raised her hand and slammed the abdomen on the "81", but she controlled her strength and would not let her vomit. The province would also clean it - if that, she would continue to punish eight. On the 11th, until I am satisfied again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a meal tonight, because I still have to continue training tomorrow, how can I make you hungry?" She squeezed the No. 81 On the cheeks, let the wound under the bandage re-crack, red stained into white. "Your eyes are very satisfying to me. This crystal tears delights me. So, I will not pour your meal on the ground." She screwed a heavy chest on the 81st, then left. room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet took away her tears, supported herself with her elbows, and slowly climbed up. She only remembers lying in the Elven Forest and preparing for the reincarnation ceremony. The ceremony took a long time and her soul fell into a strange place. In that illusory space, half of the heavens and the earth is a quiet and serene forest, and half of the heavens is a lava and sulfur-controlled hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has no exports, no other creatures, only her own loneliness wandering. Sometimes the world is not half and half, and there are more forests or more hells. Janet stayed on the forest side as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to calculate the passage of time in the world of the soul, so I don’t know how long it took, and the whole world suddenly began to shake. She saw that the sky was turned into pieces and collapsed. She saw the ground under her feet rupture and then fell into the endless void. In order to survive, she continually runs away from the broken land, and sometimes she will set foot on the hot hell. Eventually before this small world was completely destroyed. A light shrouded her and took her out of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Janet woke up, in this strange place full of strangers, the whole body was hurt. She knew that something must have changed, so she closed her mouth. Look, listen, speak less, move less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new body made her very uncomfortable, but finally there was no interference from the devil's blood. At the same time, she also lost the ability to transform the magical creatures, and there is no dark vision. But fortunately, in the past, they have been trained by spies, and they will not panic in this environment. She quickly disguised her own injuries, hiding herself in the crowd, and watching and learning as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found herself in the secret temple of a murderer, and she needed rehabilitative training while receiving treatment. She didn't know why she came back here, but she knew her only goal: to leave here and return to the city of Mire. Go back to the husband and the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She adapts quickly, reinventing those skills that have not been used for a long time, and combining them with the new body. However, she never shows it easily, unless it is at stake. Her body is a 17th-ranked killer. After the injury, there is only a low-key ranking of "Eight Eleven". As long as you don't fall to one hundred, there is no risk of being "eliminated" for the time being. She is a spy code-named kitten, receiving training in spying and disguise, but it is also clear what is called "elimination" in the Assassin organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard that there is a task that will allow assassins from the 75th to the 79th to participate. This is a great opportunity to leave the dark basement. She sat up. Adjust the tightness of the bandage so that you are not threatened and will not hinder your body's activity. A cane is a good camouflage, especially with sharp and sharp steel thorns inside. Her other hand is holding a rice bowl. If you put the porridge inside on your face, it can also be used as a good barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She limped in the hallway and when she came over, she quickly pretended to have recovered. This kind of behavior will bring a few sneers, accompanied by contempt, underestimation and relaxation. Her camouflage ability is much higher than the surrounding killers, which is the most favorable situation for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at it and there was no sign of poisoning. Anyway, I will go to the doctor here to change the bandage after a while, and let her continue to treat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a wish, his ranking has not risen to the seventy-eighth because of his actions, but directly to seventy-one. It is said that there are seven people in front of the task, and the result is that the whole army is destroyed. There is also a master ranked 11th. So there was no chance for her to go out this time. Janet could only continue to train here with the name of seventy-one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a disappointing expression on her face that made the surrounding people think she was an ambitious assassin. Janet carefully maintains a balance between "sharp" and "unobtrusive." Janet will shed tears when she is alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaac...Siegel... Janet silently repeated two names in her heart, but Isaac will appear more. Despite changing her body, the connection between her and her child is in the soul, and any magic is constant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the steel made a loud noise, and the sadistic voice that Janet hated was ringing again. How many times is she now? Janet thought about it and hurriedly wiped her tears. She has already touched the cold surface of the magic dagger. Whether she can promote one or not, she does not want to deal with this guy anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are more footsteps outside the corridor, and things may become uncontrollable. Janet hid the dagger, stepped back, curled up in the corner, and looked at the abuser with a frightened but stubborn look. By the way, she was originally on the 75th and was able to go out and let the wind out. Can it now become the 67th, or 68? There is no difference. The reason she used to beat others is never the ranking, but the tyranny in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the teachings of the murder god. Violence for the sake of emotions is useless, and the 67th will be eliminated sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience, she still learned something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet took tears and the hole in the tear lake was sealed. After Dior and Siegel discussed, they agreed to conceal the action of the assassin of the murder. Just secretly do a good job of prevention. "It can't make people feel guilty, but it will strengthen the power of the murder god." Siegel said: "The believers contribute to the devout faith, but the fear is more likely to cause people to fall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At present, the safest place is still the city of Mire, where there is a lot of magical array protection, and basically all the novel techniques, meaning that there is no ready-made experience to use. Even if Wendy, a wizard familiar with magical protection, takes a long time to crack, the assassins of the murder gods want to come in quietly, I am afraid it is not something that can be done in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contest was over and the engagement ceremony was completed. The formal wedding is going to take place at the starting point. Before departure, Siegel introduced Dior to Meet Fitzak and arranged everything between Moore and Nata. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natta is wearing a pure white wool coat with a shield embroidered with a crossed sword and belongs to her husband’s family emblem. She lowered her eyelids and performed so well and quietly that one of her hands was still squatted by Moore - this is very rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His younger brother and sister sneered at the side of the mouth, and if it was, Nata must have rushed up and slammed it. But today she restrained herself. Because she found that if she left, I am afraid that Moore could not support it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the outside, Moore is still a handsome young man. He didn't wear armor, but he had a brand new exquisite brown leather jacket. The neckline and cuffs exposed the white shirt inside. The gray breeches are lined with gold and red lines on both sides, and the copper buttons are polished. However, Moore’s heart is not as calm as it seems. When he sees the Earl of Heim and the chief of the bull rhinoceros hugs tightly together, like a brother and brother, how can you not know what happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder Siegel’s adults didn’t watch a game. It turned out that he had already arranged everything. Is this the skill of the Master Lord? When did he establish contact with the tribal chiefs on the side of the Walls? He felt dizzy and felt that the gap between himself and the lord was growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nata clenched his hand and a gentle touch from his fingertips. Moore glanced at his wife and then slowly relaxed. In any case, my feelings with Nata finally have a result, and the biggest goal of going deep into the grassland has already been achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
