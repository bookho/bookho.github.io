			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel put two gold coins in the hands of the gnome, and immediately Busy. There are hundreds of things here, most of which were destroyed in battle, and the surface was covered with traces of knives and swords. Many armor are still stained with blood, dark red, black, and even a few dark green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are mostly hyperthyroidisms with weak protection, and it is impossible to find a set of exquisite armor from here. For example, the knight's body armor, which are some custom-made luxury goods, a set needs 1,500 gold coins, the half body armor can be slightly cheaper, even the ordinary breastplate needs more than four hundred gold coins. This level of good things will not flow into the hands of the grocery store, and the adventurers who find them – no matter how they “discover” – will be careful to hand over the armor of the chest armor to the familiar good blacksmith. , bite your teeth, spend a lot of money, and change to the equipment you can use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel carefully observed the busy gnomes, pinched his chin, and thought about it for a while. Then he roughly rummaged through the current inventory and decided to target the chain shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called chain shirt is a protective garment composed of metal rings that are interlocked with each other, and can generally be worn between the layers of clothing or leather armor. In the face of a machete or a long sword, this armor provides a good protection for the wearer's upper body. However, this type of armor has three shortcomings: encountering a blunt weapon such as a warhammer will be less powerful, and it will make a sound when it is active, and rust-proof maintenance is also extremely troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of the chain armor is about 50 gold coins, which is equivalent to the price of the scales. In general, it is a higher grade than the leather armor and leather armor - after all Already a metal armor. And this thing has a benefit that can't be ignored: as long as the East removes the various metal rings and puts the chain together, it can be regarded as armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is much easier than retrofitting a leather armor like a tailor and a blacksmith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel found pliers, metal scissors and hammer, sitting next to the gnome, busy. He learned very quickly, his hands and feet were full, and he mastered the skills in a half-day. Later, he can close his eyes and distinguish whether the metal ring is made by humans or dwarves by knowing the hand; knowing which parts need to be replaced, those parts are the key to impact; he masters each ring should In order of order, the weight of the entire armor can be balanced. He spent his sleepless nights, and the lunch was omitted directly, staying by the armor pile. In the afternoon, he had already put all the body of the chain armor, including the pad and the cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work is coming to an end, and the ducks also took the opportunity to hand him a glass of water and let Siegel sip. "There is no smell in this water!" He was surprised: "Where is the good water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Distillation! A new technology, it feels good. "Gnomish machine sales: "I tried, this water can be preserved in the skin for two weeks, much better than non-bubble beer. Adventurers will pay for this safe water, as long as a silver coin can Filled with a large water bladder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish you a prosperous business." The squid returned the cup to the gnome. "You are better than the best springs in the town, and you can make money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is true." Singularly swaying Siegel's chain armor. "Very good armor, much better than I expected. Maybe you have the potential to be a good blacksmith," he concluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to thank you for telling me the secrets of the grocery store." Siegel said, "I really didn't think there was a big business to do. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do next, do you want to go to the weapons store?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, the Jazz adults will pick weapons. He said that he will find the right equipment according to my training situation. He is a powerful swordsman and his eyes are not wrong. So I have nothing to buy, I will stay in the sun before sunset. Here, take your armor and practice your hands, maybe you have time to fix a few sets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are so kind, then I am not making a big profit?! The gnome said happily, and got up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has been busy repairing armor before the sun sets. He is working faster and faster, and he is amazed by the skilled gnome mechanics. In the afternoon, he repaired two chain armor and helped organize a small pile of leather rivets. The mechanic at the grocery store taught him the secrets of disassembly and repair of the scales, and also helped install a heartguard in Siegel's chain shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Siegel has his own armor, and this armor can be slowly modified according to the growth of the body. He put the chain shirt under the jacket and proudly headed back to the hotel. Ming knows that no one can see that he has a chain armor inside, but Siegel still feels that he is invincible at the moment, like the king of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I returned to the hotel, it was already full of people, and many sailors gathered here and sang loudly. Because the owner Timothy was a sailor and was once a great mate, the sailors regarded it as their own site, a good ship that would not sink and be happy forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are hungry, eat meat; when you are thirsty, drink alcohol! When you are happy, eat meat; when you hurt The drinkers shouted loudly, and the short and powerful lyrics were more like battle numbers. They sang: "Hidden pirates, eat meat; meet the storm, drink alcohol! Brother, meat and wine; meet beautiful women, * get up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel through the crowd, constantly giving way to strong muscles or round Intestines. He noticed that the sailors here would look at him up and down, especially the black hair. Several sailors whispered: "Look, isn't that the child of the legendary squid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, sailor, here!" Look at the sound and find an acquaintance. Janis - "fangs", he used to work on the Soss for a while, and later changed jobs because of 'labor disputes'. Siegel remembers that Janis is a man of enthusiasm and enthusiasm. The two are of similar age and do the same work under the big deputy and familiar with each other. So he struggled and squeezed past, sitting next to his old friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years have not seen, the oral problem of "fangs" has become more serious, and now his two large front teeth have begun to change from rabbit to beaver. He sat down with two seafarers and friends, and the table was full of light chicken bones and a large bowl of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come and come, give the sailor a place." Janis pushed his partner. The drunken sailor fell down directly from the chair and slumbered on the messy floor. Others simply expressed contempt and did not care for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tooth decay, when did you land? How have you been recently?" Siegel sat down unceremoniously, nodding with Janis’ friend. Greetings. The amount of alcohol in the past was amazing, and his companion who could stay on the table was about to reach the limit, his head dangling in the wine bowl, and his eyes could not open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, it’s just arrived today, you don’t know, this trip is too thrilling.” The fangs were very excited when they spoke, it seemed to be an experience. Still have a lingering fear. After he had killed a bowl of wine, he slowly said: "We met orc pirates at sea. You also know that orcs can see the surroundings in completely dark places, so their choices follow us on a clouded night until dawn. After that, our watchmen discovered the orc's ship. At that time, there was only less than 2 miles left. We desperately fled and threw all the things that could be abandoned on the ship, and you can imagine how confused the situation is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this can be imagined. Siegel had seen the orc's pirate ship from afar, and the head of the dead on the ship's side made him creepy. I heard that the orcs would eat all the food after boarding the ship, snatch each item, and then eat the dead crew and the remaining living crew in turn, accompanied by abuse, rape and dismemberment. Thanks to the squid's good eyes, the orcs never had the chance to dive into the lucky Sos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The orc throws the anchor with the chain with a ripper, and there is a hook that hooks our rudder. We can't swim fast, the distance is coming. The closer, the captain told everyone to pick up the weapon, either hacking the enemy, or hacking himself, in short, not being abused. My task is to look at the female passengers on board and help them out when the situation is not good. You know A few women who didn’t understand the truth cried and asked me to let them jump, thinking that there would be a chance. They were the sharks and screams that had not seen the orc vessels.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A golden ship saved us." The fangs shouted "In order to Invincible big ship!", and drank a bowl. "I have been paying attention to the orc pirates behind, so I don't know when to drive a golden warship. The boat is very beautiful, there are five sails, and the speed is fast, like flying in the sea. The big ship leaned over. There were many armed fighters on the deck of the ship. The long guns were three meters long and looked like a forest. The orcs saw a better big ship, so they loosened the long chain and excitedly changed the target. We took the opportunity. Run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
