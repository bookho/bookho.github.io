			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This greedy, stubborn, dead-headed dwarf!" Lia yelled in an elf. Fortunately, only Siegel can understand this fast and fast Elf language, and did not cause more trouble. The two people are very helpless, they don't dare to spend the last money in this place, so they can only helplessly register and lead the cards to the end of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people have already caught the attention of the mercenaries in the past, so they have attracted more attention when they came back. "Hey, this beauty can't afford to cut the queue fee? Do you want to earn extra money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea knows the face of these idle mercenaries, the more Take care of them, they are excited. So the elves don't even look at them, they just put their hands on the handle, not like a good character. Siegel looks young and prone to provocation. So several mercenaries spoke excessive jokes and teased the relationship between Siegel and the elves. They think that Siegel's young and strong body is only useful in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are such a big finger, it's a rare gift!" They concluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel grew up among seafarers, and had seen a lot of miscellaneous things in his mouth, but also when he was insulted, but he never forgives Those who humiliate the people he loves, such as the old captain and the elf master. He learned some sultry passages from the seafarers, and he could have retorted his lips, but he did not want to spit in front of Liya, lest she leave a bad impression on her. So in Siegel's opinion, there is only one choice left to deal with this guy - he clenched his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liya took him and persuaded: "Don’t take care of the rubbish, lest you dirty your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we have to queue here for a long time, and will always be harassed by this group of people!" Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liya blinked, and Siegel’s words made sense. She then released her hand, untied the young man's backpack, and patted him on the shoulder to encourage him: "Play well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her hand light After a few shots, Leia secretly made a look and cast a natural blessing to make the power of Siegel grow. Siegel also found this and was more confident. He stood opposite the mercenaries, hooked his fingers, and provocatively said: "The most stinky one is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large group of people Come over, they consciously form a circle. The mercenaries are all human, they will not risk the injury just for the pleasure of the mouth - only gold coins and more gold coins can stimulate their mobility. So the whole thing is to open a gambling game. They can bet on winning or losing, betting time, betting on who's clothes are being smashed, and betting on everything that can be gambled. The winner is all-in-one, the loser loses all, the dealer draws water, and the boxer pays dividends – this is already a rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took off his shirt and showed refined muscles, which made his odds drop. The guy opposite him frowned, and he didn't seem to think that the young man was so good. He jumped into the circle and took a chance to talk about the two scenes, but he rushed straight to grab the first hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, damn! I haven’t finished the note yet!" someone shouted loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel had been wary of this trick, and he did not even hesitate to rush. Such an action was beyond the expectation of the man—not yet rushing to the envisioned attack position, and Siegel had already punched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This punch is in the middle of the nose, playing with blood spewing, Venus straight. The man's eyes were close to the middle, and the eyelids turned over and fell softly to the ground. The gamblers around them shouted loudly: "Where are the chickens coming from? Who will hire these parallel imports?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money of the bookmaker has not been registered yet, then it is divided Go on. If the eyes are the most profitable, the fastest hands and feet, it is actually these guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was still your export is not good, don't hide behind!" Siegel pointed to the next one and said: "Everyone is waiting!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the excitement also shouted in unison: "Wait!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea licked, she still The first time I watched such a gambling game myself, I only thought it was very enjoyable. In the past, she mainly served in the Elf patrol and rarely played among human mercenaries. And when a few times came out to take risks, it was also Mr. Bill who had everything. She just heard that the jazz often teaches the thieves who don't know what to do with the dwarves, and sometimes they go to the casino to fight. She thought, maybe the scene is like Siegel now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one thought of it, the black big one kicked and attacked and played fast and far. Siegel wanted to get close several times and was forced to open by long legs. The onlookers cheered loudly, especially those gamblers who had scored a high number of punches or a big blackout, and even shouted excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another leg flies, Siegel takes a breath, hits the body hard, and then quickly grabs the long legs with his arms. After he got a chance to get close to the enemy, he turned his muscles and slammed the man's abdomen. The fists strengthened by the elf masters are as powerful and powerful as the hammers, and the flesh and blood are unbearable. The black big man only shook a few times and shouted "surrender!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not let him go, and continued to threaten with his fist until he gave the elf Apologize. In this way, he won the second victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two guys whose mouths are not clean and have not been taught, and Siegel stares at them. These two people are not good at seeing the situation and do not want to play. In particular, the defeated boxers are completely undivided – unless the gamblers who win the money are expected to share some “comfort money” – in this case, they do not want to go to the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the two people are not leaving, the gamblers are not willing. They spit on the side and added the titles of 'the coward' and the 'soft egg' to try to inspire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this match is not played after all, two people want to understand their situation, and rushed out to apologize. The original gamblers also expected Siegel to continue to be young and prosperous, and continue to make trouble, so that they have the opportunity to force the masters of the two mercenary groups. However, Siegel handled things like a knight and ended up after accepting an apology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also successfully received a dividend of six gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, you did a good job." Lia praised: "In addition to martial arts, the way you behave is also learning from Bill. It will enable you to go further in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a carnival, the boring mercenaries have a new talk, and they can be honest for a while. Siegel slowly moved forward with the long team, and they were able to pass the gate five hours later. The two turned in the sign and rode the horse to the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's Donkey is the second highest mountain on the New World. It is said that it takes two days to fall to the ground if it falls from the summit. It took the dwarf a full hundred years to excavate the mountain roads and gates, and then used two hundred years to build the outer holes before the construction of the area began. It is said that the construction work of Mora's gang has never stopped, and even the dwarfs do not know how much the overall engineering volume is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning is a gentle slope, every time a distance will be buried a stone, which is flattened with soil, which is called the mountain trail. In addition, there is a steep stone ladder on the mountain. It is said that after the first dwarves came to the Mola, the gods lowered their strength and laid a stone ladder for the leaders of the seven clan to guide them to the foothills. Look ahead to the treasures that are hidden here. Only three leaders successfully climbed the ladder, and at the top of the mountain they were blessed by the gods of the dwarves, so they were called the three Deng clan. Then they came back and described to other dwarves the majesty and richness of this mountain, united the entire expedition team, and built the city of Mora. This stone ladder road is called the road to the sky. Only the most courageous dwarves can pass. Except for courage and **, no other force can take effect on the stone ladder. Later, many people tried to climb the stone ladder. There were some successful people in the dwarves, but there were only a handful of other races. After Siegel heard about it, he was eager to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Leah rode the horse, Siegel climbed up through the stone ladder. Passers-by in the past applauded the young man, boasting that he was as agile as a monkey. Several mercenaries also tried this exercise, but they quickly lost. They can surpass Siegel's speed for a while, but none of them can win in the endurance competition – the strong physical resilience of young people is gradually emerging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a full five days from the foot of the mountain to the entrance to the top of the mountain. It is simply divided into five sections, with a hotel in the middle, which can be slightly rested. There are not many beds in the hotel, the food is monotonous, and it is expensive. Experienced caravans will bring their own dry food, park their cars on the roadside, and simply gather to rest. On a clear night, when it is not too dark, some people will hold the torch and slowly move forward to the mountains. Siegel will meet with Leah at the end of each paragraph, and the elf will use his spells to heal the body. He took a good sleep and then continued to climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravan of the caravan can only reach the end of the second paragraph, and then it is not enough for the carriage to move forward. They will unload the goods here, transport them to the third section with a cart, and then switch to a pole to continue upwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
