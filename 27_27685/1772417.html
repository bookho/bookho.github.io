			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has not used martial arts to fight for a long time, so he needs more warm-up time. Super fast and stable update novel, this article by www. Lwχs520. Com started to use the pace of the elves, he constantly circled and seduce the giant to attack. Although the rifle has a large control range, its routine Siegel is also very familiar, so the scene is dangerous, but it does not hurt much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Kerry has always wanted to show his strength advantage, so he has strength in every attack. The ice and the gun are all in one, not only the point of the gun, but the entire gun is full of danger everywhere. As long as it is hit hard, it will be the result of fractures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Giant Kerry’s talented opponents, don’t expect to win in a short time. He can take more damage and can make a more violent attack. The only chance is to use more efficient martial arts and consume his energy in constant exercise. When Kerry’s power is not enough to make up for the flaws in his martial arts, there is a chance to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Siegel always remembers that the purpose of his battle is not to kill the opponent, but to let his ice ability maximize to the fullest May last longer. Only in this way will it be possible to force out the evil magic hidden in the giant's mind and let him recover again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry.chenko," Siegel slid to one side: "Is your ability degraded very badly?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fart!" Kerry snorted and the wind from the rifle was louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel twisted his body and avoided the long gun that was stabbed. First sway to the left, then suddenly back, avoiding the tip of the gun that is stabbed to the right of his body. The dust of the star hit the lance. After a loud bang, a severe earthquake trembled. Artifacts are truly famous, and they are as strong as the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The force of the ice was knocked aside during the impact. The chills and ice crystals emitted by the guns did not fall on Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a waste of this gun to fall into your hands." Siegel said: "Remember that I have used it before, and I have a battle with the Dragon Knight." Hundred rounds. The ice is flying and the wind is screaming, the scene is fierce and intense like the falling of the Milky Way. You play with a flower gun, what are these snow flakes? Newborn baby pee?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Too much!" Kerry jerked, and the spurs were connected with a spur, accompanied by sweeping and picking. Siegel left and right. On the one hand, you need to prevent the rifle from making a wound on yourself. Also pay attention to sweeping away the ice that gradually climbs up. In this cold winter day, the power of the ice-cold gun was greatly strengthened, and Siegel only felt that his physical strength was quickly lost, so he ran away in a crowded place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where to run?!" Kerry is chasing after him. He has a sensibility and speed that is not commensurate with his size, and he can turn with Serge's sudden disguise. In addition to the elf's pace, Siegel continued to throw back the debris around him to slow Kerry's speed of action. For a time, the lamb legs and the stools on the holy mountain were scattered, and the audience was constantly mourned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the opportunity to grab a bag of wine. I sighed and sipped, and I felt that my body was warmer. He had a sip in his mouth and slammed it into Kerry. When the wine didn't fall on his face, it turned into frost, and it didn't even block the line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two battled together again. Siegel seized the opportunity. All of a sudden rushed to the giant, the long sword blew a green mark on his chest. "My sword is not edged, or you have been killed by me." Siegel said to Kerry with a sneer, and said: "There are no two grasslands here, otherwise you can separate and rule." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your nonsense is so loud!" Kerry jerked forward, pushing Siegel with a crash and flying out. The latter turned a circle in the air and fell lightly on the ground. Then immediately dodge to the side, avoiding the pursuit of a long gun. Two weapons swayed in the air, and the striking Mars spilled on the snow. Kerry moved the real anger, and the power of the ice came out, putting a thick armor on him. The gun also received his heart, and every time it was handed over to the dust of the stars, it would be covered with a thin layer of ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the sword is getting more and more heavy, and it has not caught up with the speed of the long gun. On the contrary, with the help of ice and snow, the ice-cold guns are smoother and faster, and the guns that are hard and straight are as smart as snakes. This time the long gun crossed the chest of Siegel, cut a thick cotton coat, revealing the blood marks on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nonsense!" Kerry's arms were round and slammed down, and the rifle was turned into a light arc cut from the top of the wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel had long expected to know that Kerry liked this trick. He jumped to the side and left the dust of the stars within the attack range of the giant. Only heard a squeaky metal crash, the ice on the dust of the star was all smashed, and the sword was restored to lightness and immediately began to counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel continued to sway and slash and retreat, pulling the giant Kerry to pursue on the holy mountain. He made full use of the complex terrain around him, and used the tents to smash firearms and even the horses and horses to involve his opponent's energy, making him more and more eager to constantly increase the power of his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel never repeatedly stepped on the ground that was frozen by the ice-cream, lest his speed be affected. Once the sword hangs on the frost, he seduce Kerry and him hard to get rid of the frozen predicament. If it is other weapons, it has long been brittle during the freezing process, so that it can not withstand the next violent impact. However, the Stardust is said to be indestructible, but it has avoided this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been deadlocked for a long time, and no one can win the other. Both Siegel and Kerry began to fatigue, and the speed of the two gradually declined. But if you really think that this is the chance to end the battle, then most of them will die because of the enemy. Even with panting, Siegel did not forget to continue to pluck Kerry's temper. "Your father was burned to death by the dragon, and the master behind the scenes killed? Your brother was cut open, your enemies? You didn't even do these two things, why did you take them from them? The power of the chief of the jackdaw tribe, why did it become the king of the grassland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry did not respond. Biting his lip tightly. When the power of the ice was smashing, the spells set by Knox in his mind were constantly melted. Thought-minded spells are originally permanent effects. However, after being forced into a potion, it can only last for a week and cannot be repeated. The sorcerer of the Commonwealth had planned to lead him out of the Holy Land and then continue to control with other spells. As long as the nomadic tribes and the elves fight, it is difficult for anyone to let them take a truce. The Knox Association will also have sufficient preparation time to crack off the giant magic array set by the elves in the outer city of Deepwater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is constantly compressed by the ice abilities. Try to mobilize the magical elements around you to replenish yourself. But in the Holy Land. The suppression of the caster here is too strong, even if it is inward, it can only attract a little better than nothing. Therefore, the duration of the suggestive technique is shortened and the effect is gradually reduced, which may always refuse to disappear in Kerry's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It chooses to crouch, so that the giant’s sense of fighting is fully up. The ambivalence of the original vagueness was gone, and Kerry’s martial arts finally came into full play. The ice-cold gun matched his body shape and immediately controlled the area of ​​three meters radius under the operation of martial arts at home. Siegel tried to dodge, but found that he could not even exit this circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was hit again and again. Even if you avoid the key points every time, even without affecting the movement of the muscles, it still sheds blood. The most serious wound is on his left arm, and the power of the ice freezes Siegel's upper arms and shoulders. Maintaining physical balance has become difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With psionic vision, Siegel can see the aura of the spells that lurk in Kerry’s mind. The most annoying thing about mind control spells is that they are hard to eradicate. With a little seed, you can quickly grow into a towering tree. This is why trust is difficult to establish, but it is suspected that the spread is faster than light. Siegel can't give up his efforts, and now he only insists on his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to continuing to mock him in battle, Siegel is constantly accumulating strength. It is hopeful that you want to use plasma to transform a magic spell. But if you want to successfully influence Kerry, you must directly contact him. The wizard had only one chance, risking putting his hands on Kerry's head and then chanting the spell. This means that he will be unprotected and the giant can easily take his life. It’s nothing to risk the life of the brothers. When the key worry is hurt, you can’t control the display of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to hold on his teeth and looked around for an opportunity to turn things around. At this time, he saw Mana ran with a group of people, and Mesera was in it. The black wolf princess looked worried and held her son tightly in her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop, you stop!" Mesera cried and shouted: "Why are you killing each other?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry seems to be awake, and his movements are slow. But the spell in his mind immediately got a chance to breathe and began to grow again. This is endless, and Siegel thinks that the endurance of the flesh-and-blood person cannot last longer than the spell. This time, you must never let go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
