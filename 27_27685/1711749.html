			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp is close to the hiking trail, and three soldiers wearing scales are sitting around the campfire. They cook boiled sausages and potatoes in their pots, and put a lot of garlic, which smells from the downwind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel suddenly felt hungry and wanted to eat the spicy and delicious broth. But he was ashamed of this idea, swallowed a few mouthfuls of water and then endured the feeling of the lower abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight is the eclipse night, only stars in the sky are flashing, there will be no other light." The dwarf whispered: "I saw the entrance to the top of the mountain." The stone statues are still intact, and there are still bloodstains on the road to climb the mountain. The enemy has not yet broken the cave guards, and we can't let them succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw There are still shadows in the camp, there are about twenty." Elf Lia said: "The spearmen and archers can still deal with them, but the caster does not know what kind of ability will be used."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Turn their necks a turn and the caster will die!" Elinette replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your compatriots, guarding the watchtower's compatriots, are they good dwarves?" The elves waited for Elinte to answer, and then said: "They Being attacked will also fight heroically, but even the alarm and the wolf smoke will not come out. I know that you don't like the caster, but you should not belittle the power of your fellow citizens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf nodded and calmed down: "You are right, the elf. The battle is going to be played step by step, I am a little worried." Then he carefully observed the surrounding environment, recalling their last trip to Longshi Cliff Adventure. The details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a plan." The dwarf signaled everyone to listen carefully: "The group had a battle with the stone guards, let's assume they don't know the moonless night. The relationship with the cave. So our lowest goal is not to let them get the treasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agree!" The plateau man and the elf nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Leah is right, I don't know what the casters will do, maybe they have found the weakness of the stone guards. So we must be soldiers. I took a look at the cliff. I saw a place on the broken road that could jump to the intact mountain road. I remember that you have done this in Leah."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf nodded and admitted: "Yes, I used to skip each other on the two roads when I came last time. But Irene, I don't think you can jump over." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The three of us will stay and watch the enemy camp. If they come out at night, then we will start attacking and affect their actions. Leah, you enter Be careful after the cave, mainly to destroy the actions of those people, the treasure is not important, we can come back again after three years. At that time, I will come with an army!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The army may be on the road," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The dwarf nodded. "According to the footsteps of the messenger, he must have found the watchtower under the mountain of Mora, and sent out the gem family. The signal. My nephew Okas should have been in the army. It only takes another five days, they can definitely arrive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will look for opportunities Take some treasures out, everyone can't be alone." Leah smiled and said: "Maybe you just have fun outside, then I saw that I appeared, holding a bag of good things."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like this scene." Dio erected a thumbs up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go to the mountain road to scout, you three men are hiding here." Leah put the weapon away, with both hands empty: "I want to start Going hiking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she left the hidden rock lightly. The elf is like a flexible squirrel. After a few simple ups and downs, it climbs the broken mountain wall path and turns to the other side of the cliff, disappearing into the eyes of several people. Siegel cast his gaze on the camp on the other side, and there has been no change. The cremation pile is still burning, and the archers and spearmen are walking around, and the action is as accurate as a pendulum. Something is wrong, Siegel’s intuition tells him to urge him to observe carefully and observe with his heart. He crouched on the rock, held his breath, and did not dare to relax, sweeping from the side of the camp to the other side, and printing the details into his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vortex is slowly rotating, emitting a reddish line outward. In the eyes of Siegel, these lines pulsate like blood vessels, conveying mysterious power. The archers, the spearmen, and the soldiers who cook the garlic broth are connected to such a line, and some lines extend into the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of each banner, there is a black skull floating, opening a toothless mouth, greedily absorbing the smoke of the burning body. The red flame burned in the hollow of the hollow hole, spinning like a whirlpool. Every time I breathe a few times, my mouth will close, and then I will shoot a lot of red spears from my eyes and fly over the dragon lion's cliff. Most of the attacks stood on the stone statues of the cave, and some fell on the passage of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Irenet, Dio, have you seen it, the terrible noise floating on the camp?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Two people shook their heads. In their eyes, everything is normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not right, I need to go to Master Lia." Siegel hurriedly said: "I saw a strange sight, there is a smog that is going around. Shooting red spears. I don't think so, I have to go to the mountain road to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, let's go together." The dwarf whispered: "Let you In this way, I am not at ease. I hope that not the magicians will make a ghost in your mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people came to the broken mountain road carefully The enemy did not pay attention to it at all. They looked up and saw that Elf Lia was on the path. Her cloak gently swayed in the wind, so I couldn't see the area from the camp's point of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear shot from the eyelids draws an arc in the air, falling from time to time on the trail, and then being quietly absorbed by the mountain. Not to mention the solid rock, even the dust on the ground will not be provoked by the spear. But Siegel believes that these red rays are by no means a good thing, and Elf Lia should be hurt by these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't move, I will bring the master down," Siegel said. He held the wrist of the plateau barren and motioned him to calm down: "I can see the red spear flying in the sky, but you can't, believe me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Di Ou used his eyes to ask Elinte's opinion. When the dwarf nodded, he calmed down. He just said, "Be careful. If you are in danger, please call us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel unloaded the weight and took off his breastplate, wearing only close-fitting clothes. He counted the frequency of the attack, and used the residual light to observe the flying red spear, and quickly approached the elf by climbing the experience of the Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain road is narrow and the sideways are very difficult, let alone do the dodge action. Siegel loosened his hand several times and quickly fell a few steps with the attraction of the earth to avoid the red spear. Elinette and Dio were very worried about the following. Several times they thought that he had lost his hand and almost called out. Siegel sighed a few breaths on the steps. During this time, another red spear hit the elf, and Leah's body just shivered a few times, and there was no other reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, can't be delayed again!" Siegel thought, "I can't be like a mouse, shaking in front of the cat, nothing to do." No! I am already an adult, I have to fight together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you can’t see dangerous spears and steep mountain roads at the same time, then only concentrate Focus on one side. Siegel looked up and saw the road leading to the elf position again, trying to print it in his mind. Then, he put all his energy on the cockroach, predicting the direction of the red ray and starting the second round of climbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the body complete the movement naturally." Elf Lia taught him this way. This time, Siegel really showed the smoothness that only the elf warrior can achieve. The body is like the leaves in the wind, moving with the trend and doing it with the heart. The red ray swept his body, and Siegel didn't hesitate and hesitated—he knew that as long as he gently removed his hips and then moved up 10 cm, he could perfectly avoid the attack and it would not Affect the speed of climbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think Siegel moves like an elf?" The dwarf asked under the cliff: "Is it an illusion?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dio couldn’t answer this question, he clenched his fist and prayed for his companion: “May the gods bless...” In his prayers, Siegel caught the elf’s Ankles, knocked her down and squatted on her shoulders. The young man's body swayed, jumped down a few steps, and then stood still again, slipping down against the mountain wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
