			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has two aristocratic titles and a mage title. Since returning to Deepwater City, he has been at the focus of many forces. People have been talking about it, showing a strong interest in this newly emerged aristocrat. But at the same time they were careful and did not dare to come in contact. After all, the subsequent influence of the fainting of Prince Aaron at the celebration party is still there. The nobility, the knights, and the big merchants are watching the results of the game between the Supreme Council of the Sham Shui Po and the starry kingdom. They will not be impulsive and immediately choose the camp. They guessed what might happen later, and then they started worrying about the safety of the deep water city trade route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collaboration between the Mage Federation and the Starry Kingdom was originally in the honeymoon period, but it has turned cold since the prince returned. Unexplained people think that the Masters Federation is being implicated in Deepwater City, but in fact the Knox Association is the cause of all this. The Temple of Dawn has secretly started a comprehensive investigation of the Knox Association, and they can no longer threaten the royal family. At their suggestion, the transmission array originally in the Mage Federation could not be used now, and the Royal Navy's fleet was rapidly approaching Deepwater, ready to meet with the Golden Warship. The prince returned to the ship with the paladin and all the priests. The flag of the Starry Kingdom is flying high, and the guns and slingers on the battleship are aimed at Deepwater City. In the past, the merchant ships were horrified to avoid the golden battleships, and even the paddles did not dare to enlarge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the breath of arrogance, Siegel, as the focus, began to live a life of deep living. He did not appear in the sight of the nobility at all, and even the Masters Federation did not go. However, he arranged his "servant", the manager of the fangs Jennis, procured goods in Sham Shui Po, and sold goldsmiths to buy a blacksmith shop, ready to move it to the new territory. In addition, the mage also purchased storage-resistant bacon, dried fish and carrots, more than a dozen sacks of salt, dried kelp and other products. After all, the depths of Heimqi inland, the seaside specialty of Deepwater City is expensive and tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many goods definitely need a big fleet. There can be no less guards. For a time, Jenice had a lot more mercenaries to sell himself. After the war with the orcs, the generous Dingshui City lord paid the remuneration and began to systematically drive the mercenaries away from the city to avoid the turbulence caused by them. So these people are looking for a new job. But Jennis seems to have lost the oil and salt, leaving only the best mercenary, only seven people, but rejected everyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to get a job can also be robbed, many mercenaries are secretly planning this thing. Until they heard about hundreds of orcs living in the lion's Alexandria manor. All are the masters of the Master. Despite the fact that there are still young and old, it is easy to draw a team of 50 people. Coupled with the threat of the Master himself, the mercenaries succumbed and abandoned the secret plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel just arranged the approximate thing, putting almost all of his energy into the study of magic. The growth of knowledge and the improvement of the ability of spells can bring joy, but Siegel will still have a time of loss. Janet has seen many times that the young mage stood alone in front of the window of the study, staring at the darkened sky. She followed his gaze and the golden battleship in the eastern harbour was clearly visible. The afterglow of the setting sun dyes the entire surface of the sea into a bright red color. But they can't drive away the dark shadow behind the battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you thinking, Siegel." Janet said softly: "Give me a talk, maybe it will be better."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jazz is on that ship." Siegel’s voice was a little trembling, but he quickly managed and returned to normal. "Do you know that when Sir Bill came to the New World, he took my boat - the lucky Soss, and now he is leaving by boat. He took me on the road to adventure and growth, but I But he quarreled with him when he left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it because of my business?" Janet was the first to hear about it. Since the Black Blood Castle, Siegel began to learn to hide his feelings. In addition to happiness and calm, he rarely shows other expressions in front of outsiders. Janet carefully observed that with her ability to observe as a spy, she found that Siegel began to hide when she faced her. This made her a little sad. However, she believes that this is only a temporary situation and everything will be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Sir Bill did not mention your demon blood, we are for other things." Siegel clears his throat, with a clear and steady voice Said: "For me to accept the pioneering knight of Deepwater City, this thing makes him dissatisfied. From the legal point of view. I can not become two jazz singers at the same time, which will affect my loyalty goal. I explained to him, Sham Shui Po There is no lord in itself. There is only one aristocratic parliament. In fact, it is only an institution composed of merchants. Therefore, their knights are not recognized by others, so I have not been loyal to many times."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, he doesn't accept it." Siegel thought of the jazz's anger. The fist he waved in the air, the voice of sorghum echoed in the hall, as if the entire bureaucrat could hear it. As for the spit on the face and the pieces of the cup on his feet, Siegel chose not to take care of it. "Sir Bill thinks that I will bring great troubles in doing so. The entire aristocratic class will reject me. The original Master and the Jazz have already been very eye-catching. Now, in addition to obtaining the territory, there is actually another pioneering knight. The title. He said that if I am in the Old World, it is absolutely impossible to survive in the territory. The surrounding lords will surely make the accident of my death for the first time, annihilating the dangerous sprout."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The jazz is right." Jenny nodded: "The pioneering knight can put the land of the ownerless land under his name, as long as it does not exceed the size of the baron." When she got here, she suddenly thought of a key point, so she quickly asked: "You don't want to use a multi-rank to break through..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said nothing Wrong. Siegel smiled and nodded and acknowledged his plan: "The pioneering knights in Deepwater have an upper limit on territorial control, but the baron of the starry kingdom can increase the scope of the legal territory, and as a mage, I can also delimit a piece of land As a spy test site, as long as I redeem the owner of the original land through the Masters Federation, that is, every step is legal throughout the process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who told you this?" Janet asked. She understood that Siegel was only a sailor in the past, and it didn't take long for him to become a master. Especially the complicated human laws and regulations, he can not master so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan." Siegel replied: "There is a point that he said is right. Anyway, I can't get any help from the nobility, only You can't give up on your own hands, so you can't give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting the information of the Knights in Deepwater City. Evan took the initiative to find Siegel and said his own ideas. Jinkui hopes that the squid will be able to go further and smoother on the road of the lord and create a new family name. "If one day I can leave the starry kingdom to be a free swordsman, then I will come to you. You will have to entertain me when you arrive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Geer nodded and accepted the agreement happily. Although Evan always has a cheerful expression in front of it. But the Master can still feel the pain hidden in the heart of the illegitimate child. A free swordsman, a mercenary who sells for himself, cannot fulfill this wish. In this sense, Siegel thinks he is much happier than the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated for a long time, still made a choice, and finally told Evan about the scorpion. He just said that it was a mysterious treasure, carefully collected by Evan's father, placed in a heavy magical array. As for the source of intelligence, Siegel did not say it at all, but repeatedly warned Evan to pay attention to safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky outside the window is completely dark. The golden battleship was shrouded in dark shadows, and only a few windshields illuminated its blurred outline. Siegel turned his head and looked at Janet: "After Evan told me this trick, I measured this choice for a long time. Deepwater City is using me to test the kingdom of stars, those merchants are proficient in calculations, early I set a trap. Sir Bill is also good for me, I don't want to step on it. He yells at me too, so that I can quickly withdraw from the quagmire. Compared with the starry kingdom, the strength of Sham Shui Po is not enough."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you want to understand, and stick to this choice, you must be ready to climb out of the quagmire." Janet's eyes are a little bit starry. It is very exciting: "I have confidence in you, I will help you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." The Master said calmly: "I always know "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet saw that Siegel’s mood was still not high, and he thought about it with his eyes open. At this stage, there may be a lot of things that can make a mage worry. For example, territorial construction, residents, commodities, supplies, etc., but the only thing that will make him feel depressed is Sir Bill. I remember that when the Jazz organized the two men on the grounds of the descent lineage, they also tempered Siegel, but he was not as depressed as he is now, so there must be something that Janet did not know. She thought about it and asked tentatively: "Are you very noisy with Sir Bill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. We almost reached the level of turning our faces. Siegel replied: "I did it. After all, the Jazz will manage the territory under the rule of Count Todd. The kingdom of the stars will definitely influence him through him. I don't want him to be restrained, so he and him." There was a big quarrel." He sighed with a long sigh of relief and said: "Maybe what I said is too heavy. Sir Bill looks very sad. When we are separated, he seems to be a few years old."
