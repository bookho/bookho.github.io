			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After coming into space, Siegel first asked the star to begin checking the tightness of the spacecraft. By relying on the form of sputum, Siegel does not need to breathe, and the combination of the secret nuclear and the higher creations can also produce air continuously. But it's always a good thing to be able to find these gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patching work can only be done after returning to the ontology. Now it is just a projection, and it doesn't make sense. After the inspection, the Xingsuo was released from the invisible state and then quietly suspended in the orbit of the Earth's "Meteorite". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows that some goblins will use telescopes to observe space, they look for opportunities to deploy space weapons, and study the weaknesses of other goblin national satellites. Xingsuo also needs to observe and record the planet to lay the foundation for the subsequent transmission. The more familiar the place, the higher the success rate of transmission, and the mobility advantage that this goblin does not have is still to be mastered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After staying in the air for a whole day, Siegel began the next move. Through the casting of the core of the star, Siegel casts a "mirage" spell, forming a large sparkling goblin text in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, there are a lot of grammatical errors in the text you fired. Do you need me to correct it?" There seems to be a smile in the voice of Xingsuo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no, I deliberately." Siegel explained: "I will slowly modify it and make sure the goblin sees the process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel scratched his head and could only try to explain: "This way It seems that we are not very smart. The goblins are very good and very sensitive. If they feel that they are absolutely threatening, they will choose war. If you beat it, you will be very painful. I am trying my best to try. Can there be a way to avoid war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, are you afraid of war, just like I will fight?" Stars' problems one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Afraid is not afraid, just don't like it, just like you see the dirty air that destroys the living environment of animals." Siegel's patient education star Suo: "I would rather use war as a last resort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The images placed on the sky are quickly discovered by the goblin, and the grammatical errors make the goblin ridiculous. However, some time, some errors will be modified. It's like the spaceship in the air is learning. After about one day, all the grammar and words have been correct, and the meaning of the words is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are celestial stars, investigating and exploring the spaceship of the troops. It is great to see that there are other living beings in the universe. We are not malicious, we hope to be able to communicate Exchange and study. If you allow, please send a signal to arrange a landing site. I will be interviewing you. 2."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last number 2 Let the goblins be puzzling, if it is 23333 they can understand directly. Several high-minded countries with nuclear power launched an emergency consultation and decided to give the aliens a chance to let it land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look for a place without a goblin, point the bullet at him, point the shell and rocket at him, and point the nuclear warhead at him!" The goblin screamed loudly. And excited: "I can find an alien! Let him marry us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the reconnaissance ship of the advance fleet, and there may be a large force in the follow-up "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way, you believe this! If this is not the strongest spaceship of aliens, they will not be able to send out such missions! A dark brown skin goblin said loudly: "If you can get the technology of the Zenith Stars, then we can colonize the universe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bald goblin The yin test said: "So what about the attack on the purple crystal stone? Many nuclear warheads are used on it, is it a pause, lest the Zenith people know the secrets of our weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is possible to pause and drop it to one week. Maybe you can let Zhuofu think that you are If there is no strength, they will send people out to scout." The only female goblin present, and the fattest goblin, moved the body and screamed straight and thick tongue to make it clear: "Since the bombing of amethyst, there is no Zhuofu. What happened, what a big loss? I told you earlier that such a tactic has no meaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In favor, let him land on the narrow island, anyway, because of the earthquake for a while. There was a nuclear leak accident there, just emptying a large open space." The bald goblin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but it takes time to mobilize troops and warheads on the island. Only two countries can do this." The female goblin smiled and looked at the black. Brown Goblin and Silent Goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two goblins looked at each other and nodded tacitly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waits in space, by the way, teaches the stars to take some offensive and defensive stances. Use illusion to demonstrate how to evade and strike during flight, and how to use electromagnetic weapons for maximum efficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I don't guarantee that it will be correct, because I am a creature with two hands and two legs, and more when using swords and spells." Siegel said: "What kind of martial arts are suitable for your physical condition needs to be practiced slowly. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. You only need to constantly summarize the good experience and change the wrong place to make progress. I started learning with a long sword. At that time, I once slashed to the ground and then injured my wrist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner was once weak?" Xingsuo was very happy to ask Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know why Xingsuo is happy with this issue, I feel that she is very positive most of the time, which is a good phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whenever people are weak, everyone needs to grow, and you are the same." Siegel said: "Although you were born, you are a big man, although you The combat power and mobility are very strong, but you must remember that only continuous improvement and learning can realize the joy of life. Growth and change are the most important part of life, the strength of the body is the foundation, and then the soul is strong. Wisdom of wisdom. Remember, never be arrogant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I remember." Stars said hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way the goblin replies to the information is very interesting. They mobilized hundreds of large searchlights to form a light array. When the night is dark, they open and close regularly, forming one by one. The gnome symbol, shot into the air. Maybe they also use other means, such as wireless communication. Unfortunately, Siegel has not figured out how to make their communication tools. Although the books on electronics have been read a lot, there is still a long way to go to make products that can be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery of the goblin communication is a star, her global field of vision is much more powerful than Siegel. "Master, master, they want to go down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is an invitation or a request." Siegel put down the pen and paper, he is optimizing the star cable in the battle electromagnetic The fire sequence of the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid it is a request, I have not seen any polite words from inside." The sound of Xingsuo is somewhat unhappy: "Gnomes are so two polite words." Please, please, please don't use it this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is estimated that they have to waste this opportunity." Siegel scratched his head: "It doesn't matter, anyway This is all in my expectation. Send them a signal and say that they will land at noon tomorrow to their designated area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gave the goblins More than ten hours of preparation time, not just military and politicians, many goblin media broadcasting news also rushed to the scene to witness the "day of the miracle of the earth." They finally determined that there are planets that can live outside the earth, and the claws of the goblins will set foot on the stars and go to the infinite deep space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geochrome calendar December 12, 2008, the star number slowly landed on the designated open space of the island. There is no streamlined body, no propellers or jet equipment, and even no external power components. The huge spacecraft touches the ground like feathers. Anti-gravity arrays are techniques that goblins are hard to match and are like magic to them. Constantly changing the outer shell of brilliance (illusion) makes the goblins envious, and strong possessive desires spread in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, there is something like a gun on his outer shell, the long tube that is hidden." The heads of the goblin watched through the live broadcast, The goblin (researcher) constantly submits his own research report for the best goblin decision. “There is no transparent structure and no radar or similar detector structure, so it is not clear how the Zenithians detect the surrounding environment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, they may not be able to spy on our communication system?" Dark brown goblin asked: "Is the star network safe? If the Zenith star affects the star network, can we defend and counterattack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
