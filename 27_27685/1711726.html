			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill has obviously drunk a lot, his face is red and he is staggering, but he still accurately found Siegel in the corner of the courtyard. Evan took the opportunity to say goodbye and slipped through the shadow of the courtyard trees. He was agile and dexterous, but let the Jazz look at his back. Sir Bill and the followers found the same full-fledged horses, so the three souls embarked on the road of return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think of the party?" asked the jazz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They ate very well. I also met a friend, Evan. He is a very talkative person and feels good to get along."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan-Golden?" Sir Bill touched his chin. In the starry country, it is not surprising that the king has an illegitimate child, but it is extremely rare to bring the illegitimate child back to the court. Evan is such a "lucky". At that time, the Queen was not brought to Taiwan by this incident. The feelings of the two men almost broke down. The Queen’s family took the opportunity to attack. The courtiers were divided into two groups to fight each other. The whole kingdom was almost on the verge of the civil war. It was not until the king and the queen gave birth to a second son that the matter slowly subsided. Therefore, Evan-Golden is well known in the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Aaron is only one year older than Evan. Two people grew up together from urinary, which is extremely rare in the literary life of "the long river of history." Everyone said that the Prince has a tolerant and kind heart. He can be a brother to be kind to his illegitimate children, and he can treat future subjects with more tolerance. On the other hand, Evan never cares about politics and concentrates on practicing swordsmanship. It is said that he has been challenging the palace guards very early, and they can beat them when they are 14 years old. After that, he went to find the troubles of the morning guards. He unexpectedly won several victories and showed his extraordinary strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't leave Evan's business, I have a task to hand it over to you. I found a caravan that was going to the hub, transporting some saplings and Fertilizers in the past. Although the smell is not good, but relatively safe, take care of the tube. Prepare tomorrow, it will start at noon." The two men and one horse walked on the way back to the hotel by bright moonlight, Jazz vs. Siegel He said: "Although you don't worry about eating and drinking, you should be cautious. You have to walk for about a month on the road. You have to find some dried meat that can last longer, just in case. Take some arrows, There is probably no replenishment on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good adult, I will be ready to install."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Bill threw the reins to the entourage, and finished the whole body of clothes, and then said: "I am going to take the event, you take the horse back and take a rest. You don't have to look for me before noon."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the jazz turned a corner and pushed open an unlocked door. After entering, he turned back and plugged in. Latch, then thump thump thump on the second floor. In this small villa, there is a room that is always lit by candlelight, decorated with lace curtains that swing gently outside the open window, and a shadow of Qianli is projected onto the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse snorted and walked forward, then looked back at the stables. "Well, I didn't want to peek." Siegel rushed to the front in a few steps, and smashed the horse's mane. "I said dark horse, when did you let me ride once?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse shook his head and didn't seem to understand what the young man was saying. Siegel grabbed the reins and then turned to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kid." Someone called him, and Siegel looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Knox Association of Masters stood at the street, his shadow was black and long, and seemed to be able to twist himself. The bald head of the oily light reflects the silvery white moonlight, and the red vortex tattoo seems to be slowly spinning. Siegel blinked and determined that these were not hallucinations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man turned his back on the light, so he couldn’t see his face. He only knew that his hands were crossed with his fingers. His voice was slow and cold, and he asked, "Do you know where the groceries are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "I am not familiar here." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a pity. I have to ask other people." The man sighed and said: "Boy, then you know where Ximu Town can Buy the best gems?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man said as he pulled out a gold coin. The gold coin jumped between his fingers, slammed into the air, glided, and finally stopped in front of Siegel. This is a gold coin of the school, bigger and heavier, you can exchange two ordinary gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the squid spread his right hand and the gold coin fell steadily on his palm. He reached for his hand and put the gold coin into his pocket. When he looked up again, the man had already left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant voice faintly conveyed the sound of the music and the happy cry, even if the night half, the joy did not end. Siegel scratched his head and looked at the street in every direction through the moonlight. Only two stray dogs were chasing mice, and no other shadows were there. He wasn't sure if there was a Knox mage who had spoken to himself, just as he was not sure if the pleasant voices came from Elvis Manor or from the second-floor villa next door. Siegel’s pockets touched a distinctly large and heavy coin, which made him chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked two steps and took the horse back to the Storm Night Inn. The hotel is still lit, but there is nothing wrong with it. The enthusiastic sailor has already scored the victory on the wine table. The winner is now in the arms of the **, and the loser is still on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innkeepers found out the drunken money purse and made it clear when they were unable to resist. He never gets more money from the sailors - because doing so will provoke the curse of Poseidon - he will only take out the coins according to the numbers on the bill. Over time, the guests who come here know this and will not stop him from being stupid. Timothy did this only because there were too many sailors who woke up the next morning and found that their companions were drunk when they drunk and spent more than expected, so they would be angry with the bill. I am looking for various excuses to avoid paying my bills. Timothy understands this feeling, but he will not accept this loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, squid, play tonight?" The boss yawned at him and stood up straight and asked: "I It can be exhausted here, but there are still some stews and sour soup left. Would you like some more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I almost didn't die today- - I have eaten eight pig's trotters, and there are many other things." Siegel returned to the familiar environment, breathing the air full of alcohol and sea bream, and was warmed by the warm light of the stove. Much better, at least there are no sinister wizards and creepy voices here. "I am going to leave tomorrow. I will go to you in the morning to settle the money for these few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, are you on the road again? Would you like to give it to you? Prepare some cake dry food?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can do less with less, you should not use much." Siegel replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a drunken man turned over from his chair and suddenly waved his arm like a commander and shouted: "Ah! Gems! Go and grab me a jewel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of drunks are still dreaming of making a fortune!" The boss said with a smile: "Knox's mage wants to build a lighthouse and buy high-quality gems at high prices. Especially ruby, they are willing to buy one with 500 gold coins. The sailors may have some pearls, and the gems are rare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Thinking of the dark shadow under the moonlight, the cold atmosphere on the street reappeared, causing him to shake his bones. He had an ominous premonition. He seemed to have the shadow of the fishing net in the surrounding air. He was tightening the gap from a distance and cloaking the poor fish head. So he ran out of the hotel and slammed the door of the grocery store until the gnome, who was only wearing pajamas, jumped out of the open window. The scorpion duck held the oil lamp in one hand and the short stick in the other hand, yelling angrily: "Damn, who is not letting me sleep?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"陂鸭, What ruby ​​did I sell to you? Didn't you sell it to Knox's bald?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the familiar voice, the gnome really opened his eyes. He looked up at the moonlight and put the short stick behind the belt. He asked in confusion: "Hey? You said slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel deep sucks In one breath, I decided to tell my friends all the things and said his fears: "I don't know why Knox's mage will pay attention to rubies, but I intuitively have some connections. If I can, I want to redeem them. That gem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The redemption does not go back, no way." The duck said with a smile: "I have already grinded the gem into powder, as raw material. To make the dwarf's rune potion, it is impossible to change back. I invited a master craftsman and will come to me to make a runestone for the distilled water stove in a few days, so that you can save a lot of firewood. Don't worry, Ruby is no more expensive than my secret recipe! I will soon be able to make money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
