			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Siegel’s vision, Fitzkack does not have the ability to influence the Count of Maxim. When he was helped by Siegel, the same one-eyed face surprised everyone - maybe not including the alchemist, his face always had a very calm expression, but he could not have Expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two days of nursed back to health, the one-eyed dad has barely been able to stand still and carry a slow move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you injured?" asked Count Maxim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, adults, I am only poisoned." Fazak honestly replied, "It is a misunderstanding, the toxin used by Mr. Soths for self-defense." Make me look like this now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bald count turned to face Siegel, his stomach still faintly hurts. Now that he saw it, the man who punched him was just a young boy, and he was in his early 20s - he had added as many ages as possible - and he was just a fledgling guy. If he is a royal baron, it must have been inherited from his father. Earl Maxim does not believe that such a young person can rise to the baron's class with the merits of the war, and the royal contest has not been carried out for several years. The last champion is certainly not this kid. He found a reason to persuade himself not to pay attention to the words of "Sos" and decided to kick the undisputed young man out of the credits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fazak, that is to say, Sos is not a member of your secret agent?" The count asked casually, and picked up a glass of ale to drink. Live the expression of your own mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Fitzak hesitated. He can only tell the truth: "He is not a secret agent. But without the help of Soth, I have no way." It took too many adults to enter the city. The time was too hasty, and it was too late to get together two thousand gold coins. Fortunately, he helped him. If several adults were bought by the orcs..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Don't dare to buy the orc's neck, and then leave." The count swallowed the ale in his mouth and looked around: "You have nothing good here, no wonder that two thousand gold coins can't be found. Let's help outsiders. Let's talk about it, how much did it cost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two thousand and five hundred gold coins." Siegel embraced his arms and smashed his arms Say. Since the count wanted to treat him with this attitude, Siegel would not give him a good face. "If you can be as honest as an alchemist and a gnome, you don't have to spend that much money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The money won't miss you, the baron Mr. Maxim: "Sham Shui Po is happy to pay this little money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little money?" Siegel frowned. More than half a year ago, Siegel also lived a hard life with a few copper plates. He would not forget the ears of two silver coins, but at the time he was a knight from the "selling fee" but only five gold coins. "I don't know if there are dragon tooth daggers in Deepwater City, or do you have such treasures in your family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon teeth? Are you sure?" Knocking on the table, it is like this can be dug out of gold coins: "Deepwater City will pay for this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can be your arrogance and stupidity Paying bills, Siegel thought. He believes that the idea of ​​being a slave is not from the Count of Maxim. He is too proud to come up with such an approach. Only alchemists or gnomes, their brains may be smart enough to understand the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fazak, what do you eat here? Also, find us a set of weapons that can be used. There are orcs everywhere, no weapons. It can be unsafe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes adults, good adults." Fitzak squatted and slowly walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to be prepared?" Siegel glared at Maxim, his eyes stunned. The count also looked at him, and both of them felt dry eyes, but they did not look away. This will not help the task, Siegel thought. So he looked away and looked at the alchemist and asked, "Do you have a way to burn the dock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a way, but I need time to prepare, Some alchemical materials are also needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say more." The count whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Soth Baron, what do you mean?" Earl Maxim said with a smile: "Would you like to assist this glorious mission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Did I play in the city before?" Siegel waved his hand and decided not to have a general knowledge of this nasty count. The Bachelor of the Masters Association once commented that Maxim was cautious and persevering, but never mentioned that he was so proud that this pride would hurt people. The damage to self-esteem may heal in a few days, but if the shipyard of Macabu is allowed to escape the destruction, the damage may be the defeat of the entire battle. I don't know how many people will die. Siegel is deeply inhaled, and he always needs a rational person to choose to give in. He is unfortunately the rational person. "Well, I am willing to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the count, everyone else took a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemist spreads a long form on the table with more than a dozen different materials, mostly ore, others are various plants. s material. Siegel stood by and watched the form in his heart. Fitzak prepared a simple meal, mainly stewed fish, served with a root of turnip as a staple. Earl Maxim was not picky about eating, and walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time archer Mana dared to walk slowly and gave Siegel a deep sigh: "Thank you for saving me. At the time I was When the orc pulled away, he was almost scared to death, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No thanks, I just tried my best." Siegel waved his hand. , raised her. "After all, you have a task, it is my comrade-in-arms, I can't see you die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Women can't be afraid, I am just a mercenary." Na replied: "And it is the mercenary of the count's son. Please forgive the count's temper. He was not like this before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third son of the Earl is a mage apprentice, this time with us, he is my employer." Mana lowered her voice and said: "Results He had frostbite on the road and could only venture back to Deepwater City. The count became strange because he was worried about his child's life and death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is How do you get frostbite?” Siegel asked. “If he is a mage apprentice, you should know how to mix antifreeze grease. Even if he doesn’t, don’t you notice this? I think the count’s three sons. Even if there is no inheritance, it is very likely to get the castle territory. You can let him as his mercenary. ? Frostbite on this common disorder "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; at Siegel pressed, Mana lips trembling, eyes tear up. She wiped it with her hand and looked at her tears with great surprise. "Why am I crying? Knight just flew back to the South, and although it was difficult but not mortal, why should I cry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A red ring from The periphery of Mana's pupil flashed, causing Siegel's attention. He was about to look carefully, but the female shooter wiped the tears on his eyes and let the ring disappear completely. Siegel felt embarrassed and he was alert. In the face of Count Maxim, he had an unnatural feeling. Even if the count really has the pride of being more than ordinary people, his way of expression is too straightforward, not like an old aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana’s performance is also abnormal. When mentioning Piaget’s third son and frostbite, the inexplicable tears are clearly the result of true feelings. Siegel thinks about it and finds that there are many loopholes in the whole thing. The count is the leader of this mission. He should be very clear about its arduousness, but he still brings his own children. Is this brave or fearless? His child actually brought a mercenary, and the count can actually agree, which is obviously not in line with common sense. What kind of secrets are hidden in this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about this direction, Siegel recalls Tim’s throwing a half-orc with a wooden knife at the time of the auction. Young, impulsive may be a reasonable reason, but stupidity can't explain. This team seems to be not normal except for the alchemists and his silent gnomes. In this case, the most normal performance is more likely to be problematic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s thoughts are running fast, and he decides to succumb to the Piaget’s team and never reveal his real name and mage status. It happened that Fitzak didn't know the secrets either, and he was not afraid that he would accidentally leak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven Demon is still to be hidden. He is the eye in the dark and can help the Master to see the threat behind it. But the most important thing at the moment is that nothing is pretending to pretend. No, Siegel thinks about it carefully. It should be treated with doubts but not wanting to go deep into it. This can make nature look natural. Just like the elf martial arts, move with the wind and follow the trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
