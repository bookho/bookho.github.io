			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plasma was originally prepared to deal with the plant characteristics of war ancient trees, and a discount on the effect of the dragon. However, with the help of the volley of the pickpockets, the number of advantages, carefully prepared, has played a huge role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plasma brings a flame, burning in the depths of the flesh, and it hurts. The dragon made a scream of earth-shattering and rushed to the sky. The large piece of flesh was pulled off the body by the chain and fell to the ice. The blood mixed with acid splashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It finally got rid of the bondage and desperate to escape from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is ready for this situation. He has been standing on the tower to prevent the dragon from fleeing. Just like the dwarf's Tulong Valley, limiting the dragon's mobility is fundamental to the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard waved the staff with one hand and sprinkled gold powder and iron on the other hand. The power of magic is entangled in the iron piece, making it grow taller, and a swaying iron wall appears out of thin air. To say that it is a wall is actually more like a tempo. After all, its height is much larger than the width. The iron wall slammed into the ground and the entire tower was shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon left the ground while spraying the acid down. Kerry pulled out the ice gun and avoided it with his companions. Several warriors who had slowed down because of the injury screamed and melted in the acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second spell appeared in the palm of Siegel, "the mind is moving." The powerful power of thought bursts out in an instant, forming a fist like a real one, slamming into the iron wall. Segal headed out from the edge of the tower and watched the direction of the dragon taking off, making the final adjustment with the power of reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard! Go to hell! Go to hell! Go to hell!" The bloody dragon roared, turning pain into power and madly attacking the surrounding buildings. The acid got in through the shooting hole, and the picks rushed to avoid, but many people were still burned. However, in many windows, there are still arrows that are constantly coming in, and when they hit the black dragon scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another wave of plasma is about to attack, and Black Dragon knows that he is leaving. Only when flying out of a certain range, is it not afraid of being attacked by the mage who is hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge shadow on the head. The dragon looked up and then widened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mixed..." It only had time to make a scream and was hit by the fallen iron wall. The black dragon flipped over the body and tried to pull the heavy objects out. But he is not far enough from the ground, and he can't complete the whole action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle trembled and many people fell to the ground. Those who were hiding in the cave, the horse exclaimed, but did not order anyone to leave. The roar of the dragon outside is abruptly stopped. Is this good news? But why didn't you hear the cheers of the soldiers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust is flying. The gravel keeps falling. The tower that Segal stood was split in half, swaying but it was not collapsed. There should be no warrior tribe warriors in the courtyard, so there will be no accidental injuries. Only two elements have lost contact, I am afraid that there are many evils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; summoned a gust of wind to blow away the smoke, and the body of the dragon wall finally appeared. The dragon is still alive, and its constantly shaking body undoubtedly illustrates this. But it was clearly seriously injured, with broken wings, broken tails, and three distinct large holes in the outer skin. But the most serious wounds are small and dense, burning under the scales, with red flames and green electric flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry holds a cold ice gun. Firmly walked toward the Black Dragon. There were also a lot of wounds on his body, but fortunately they all pulled out and sealed the bleeding with ice. The dragon felt the arrival of the giant through the tremor of the ground, and tried to turn the eyeball and finally saw this big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It opened its mouth and tried to spit in Kerry, but the acid was only slender, and even the ice armor was not burnt. Then it shouted hard and tried to release Longwei, intending to stop the enemy. Kerry’s footsteps stopped. The sweat oozes out of the skin and is immediately frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are all at my feet, bugs!" Black Dragon saw the enemy standing still, thinking that he was controlled by Longwei. Then use the claws to push the iron wall pressed against the body. Gradually climbed out. It can be seen that it has a small hole in the body, and the smell of charcoal grilled meat and acid transpiration is mixed and continuously radiated outward. "Your death is today, today!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black dragon's body shook and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of cheers on the battlefield and they finally killed the dragon. There is no technology to fight, and there is a death knight that is almost intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knight in gold armor can dispel the power of the elements around him, causing great damage to Siegel's two elemental rune guards. Fortunately, the two of them were originally death squads, and there was no concept of sacrifice at all. When the wizard dispels the magic of the Black Dragon and does not spare the power to replenish the elements of the Rune Guardian, the destruction of them is only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the armor of the death knight makes it not afraid of any metal weapon attack, even the collapsed iron wall. In the eyes of the public, the iron is heated, burned red, and then turned into molten iron. The death knight stood up from the molten iron, holding a black giant mace in his hand, and his eyes glowed with green faint light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;弩矢射射射, some were melted in the air, and some were bounced off in armor, none of which could harm him. The death knight rushed to Kerry, and the giant with no weapons in his hand could only escape. The mace hammered with the wind, and the stones, the dragons, and the metal scattered on the ground all turned into powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knight is a little smaller than Kerry, but still two meters tall and burly. At the same time, he also has a high speed that is extremely incompatible with his body shape. Coupled with the length of the mace, his threat range quickly caught up with the opponent's tumbling speed. Kerry was forced to the corner and the mace was flying towards his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't hurt my king!" The warriors of several Jackdaw tribes rushed up and cuddled with flesh and blood, one by one hanging on the death knight. Body. The muscles are in the closest contact with the metal, and every joint of the death knight is in the **. A tribal warrior rushed to the black faucet, regardless of the acid corrosion of the body, grabbed the handle of the ice gun, and pulled out forcefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knight screamed, and the current on the gold armor was dense. The heat of the plasma of Nexus exerted its power, and the warrior hanging on him was not dead or injured. He can also wield a mace. And went to Kerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Khan, then!" The soldier threw the ice gun with his smoky hands, and the giant regained his weapon. The mace hammered heavily and hit the gun of the ice gun. The artifact was not damaged. However, the giant Kerry could not support the tremendous power uploaded by the mace, and was suddenly hit, flying through a stone wall and falling into the castle room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Da Wang!" "The leader!" The screams of various names are endless, and the warriors of the Jackdaw tribe are surrounded by bare hands. Even with both hands, you must remove this gold armor. Even those who suffer from electric shocks and are not even stable are still struggling to continue fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knight has another plan. He found that the Black Blood Castle was fully prepared and formed great restraint on the dragon. In this way, he did not expect the relatively weaker White Dragon to reverse the battle. Without the dragon, he lost his mobility. There is only one way to leave the ground - jumping. The walls are so high, the outside is the valley, and jumping out is likely to fall into pieces. He still has a heavy responsibility. To coordinate the command of the orc's army, you can't be enemies as a death squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the gap in the armor, he saw the direction of the gate. The fence and gate of the ordinary iron alloy can't stop him. After going out from there, you can go back to the valley and return to the orc army. There are no druids here, there will be no entangled plants and war trees, and those arrows and slings will not cause any harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he took a step in the direction of the city gate, but failed to continue the second step. He saw a mage wearing a red robe and a breast-covered armor standing in front of him, holding a pure white staff in one hand and a gray-white sword in one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil spirit stops." Siegel is procrastinating with words. Time to return to Kerry: "Nate from the void, this world does not welcome you, the creatures here don't welcome you, I don't welcome you. Go back to your void. Don't want to go back to the orcs and give orders. - Although they are evil, they are still the creatures of this world. They are not the masters, not the lonely, dead world. You don't want to cross my block!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The death knight stared at him, the golden armor gave off a shining light, and the body shape expanded again. Then the light disappears. It seems that the energy in his body is dissipating, but in reality the darkness is increasing. "What do you know, the human mage?" The death knight said in a hollow and echo-filled tone: "Do you really understand the power of emptiness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
