			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel secretly waited in the darkness, and only the corpses that could not die on the anatomical bed continued to emit weak **. He counted on the speed of his heartbeat and waited for half an hour before he tried to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the muscles of the neck, shoulders and waist, Siegel pulled the sharp obsidian dagger from the shoulder blade one inch and one inch. Fortunately, this dagger cuts muscles and bones almost like scissors, and does not require much effort. Siegel resisted the pain caused by the wound, sweat flowing into the eyes blurred the line of sight, the sound of broken body echoed in the ear, not thinking about the feeling of itching when the blood flowed down the thigh and the thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Obsidian Dagger left the bones, and now only the muscles sandwich it. The seal that banned elemental spelling is still working, but Siegel has a way to deal with it. He took a deep breath and turned his head to look behind him. He was hung on an iron shelf, a few inches behind him was a cold stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the black scorpion dagger falls directly on the ground, it may sound enough to wake up Reese, causing the escape action to fail completely, so he must slow down the drop. It is best not to have any sound. Siegel can only see the handle of the dagger with the light of the corner of his eye. He estimates the possible angles and postures when the weapon falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he turned himself into a shackle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an elemental spell, and Siegel has done this in more than one time in the field of banned magic. The Obsidian Dagger suddenly lost its support and fell from the air. Siegel swayed back and forth, hitting his dagger with his own pelvis and placing it on the wall behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a very subtle "啪" sound that should not disturb Reese's sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the flesh and blood disappearing, the shackles of Siegel are also loosened a lot. He put his fingers together, trying to shrink the size of the wrist and then pulling it out of the shackles. After he pulled out one hand, he grabbed the obsidian dagger behind the pelvis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he cut off the shackles and freed his hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handle of the Obsidian Dagger is still gleaming, and the upper lines depict complex patterns. This is what is activated, why does my own obsidian dagger have no such function? This problem just flashed in his mind. Just put it aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skeleton walked on the ground and made a sound, so Siegel changed back. The power of the element begins to get closer to him, and everything is like an arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His original plan was to destroy this and let the angry flame burn everything. The temple of the murder god was buried in the ashes. But he got the news from Rees, and the assassin who was injured in the Elven Forest attack was sent to the training ground and sanatorium, and Janet might be there, so he had to know the location of the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I get it out? From the magical design of the clay warrior, Rees knows Knox's mind control spells. Even his ability to use these spells may not be as good as Siegel. But there will definitely be corresponding defensive skills. It is too risky to directly control him, and it is difficult to get real intelligence. Siegel thought about it and gave up the plan to go directly to the Rees bedroom to control him, but to prepare in this lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are herbs and reagents here, and the casting materials are more readily available. Siegel first applied the Master's Chamber of Secrets to completely isolate the room from peeking from the outside to the inside. When the familiar elemental power flows through his body, Siegel's blood is boiling and the soul is singing cheerfully. He couldn't help but shed tears and was excited to be himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His state of mind also affects the control of magic. The spell works very smoothly under his control. Almost every syllable, cast posture, and elemental fluctuations work seamlessly together. Although he only lasted for a short time, he still realized the feeling of complete control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s choice of the sergeant’s path is elemental transformation and control, which is based on Knox’s plasma conversion technology, allowing four basics. Elements can be transformed into each other, uniting them in a single loop. Many plastic energy systems are also taking such a path. Fireballs are sour and even ice hockey is their masterpiece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters of the Masters also thought that Siegel took this path, but only he himself understood the difference. Elemental spelling has gone deep into the Master's thinking. The four elements are like a standard. Although it greatly simplifies the learning difficulty of the spell, it also impedes the development of the spell. There are no ready-made templates for advanced spells, and each wizard needs to re-understand and structure itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, things will come to fruition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be human understanding between life and death, and the same is true between gains and losses. Siegel experienced shock, anger, sadness, and joy, and then returned to rational and calm thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cast spells in the lab, placing it here at home, and then having time to look at things here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colloidal warrior's scroll may be the highest achievement of Rees. can not miss. With the cluster of elements, Siegel will naturally not choose a gel warrior with lower cost performance. And with the template constantly copied out, there is a feeling of evil - he just wants to learn the essence. The technique that Rees masters to transfer knowledge and create similar bodies is very good. It can be seen that the scroll is not complete and there is still a big piece missing. Siegel flipped through a few reels and recreated the whole process in his mind. "No, this spell has big problems!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is not enough time for him to enter meditation, so he can only use the slap technique to make a very similar pattern. Product, and then the real thing into the key space. The problem discovered this time can be told to Rees, it will definitely attract his attention, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be able to see in the mind, then Siegel goes Look at the anatomical bed to see the guy who is constantly **. His body was broken, except for the lungs, all organs were removed and replaced with gum. This is like a semi-finished product of a colloidal warrior, poor experimental material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has only one eye left, his eyes are white and he can’t see anything. But his instincts were not standing in front of Reese, so he tried to speak. But his tongue is gone, his throat is open, and he can't say anything at all. It is only from his mouth that he can easily distinguish three words: "kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has no priest's ability to perform somatic regeneration spells. . So death is the only relief for this person. Siegel points his finger to his bare brain and destroys his consciousness with swift lightning. He is finally dead and will not feel the pain anymore. The mage thought about it and cast a spell on the throat of the body. Constantly send out the same subtle ** to avoid being discovered by Rees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire laboratory is full of human organs, some of which are active under the influence of spells, and some must be taken from the **. For his spells, Rees didn't know how many lives were killed. Both men and women and age are just his experimental products. He certainly must not die, and Siegel made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battles that take place here are quick and quiet, and all the spell traps placed in the lab serve this purpose. Fighting here is much better than going to the Master's Lounge. Everyone knows that the Master will lay out the most complex defense system where he sleeps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost time, and Siegel is back on the shelf. He wraps the shackles, pretends to be still hoisted, and waits patiently with his head down - like a hunter waiting for the prey to enter the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed by, and the sound of the robes rubbing on the slate floor finally sounded outside the door. Master Reese pushed in and did not wait for him to look carefully at the surrounding environment, and Siegel’s voice rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Rees. Is this getting up? I have been waiting for you for a long time. Now come listen to my advice on your spell?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not in a hurry, we have time. My spells have been completed, and the rest is just improvement." Rees snapped a finger and let the candle in the room burn. He felt that the surrounding elements were a little weird and seemed to have some kind of interference. It may also be because the condition is not good just getting out of bed, which is not the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your spell? Complete?" Siegel made a loud sneer, looking at Rees's gaze without any respect, leaving only infinite contempt. "Glue warrior's spells can't be used at all. You can only use the power of the priest. Especially in the part of the gelatinous molding, the spell you set only plays a supporting role. It is not to promote the manufacture of colloidal warriors. The main reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sipped a spit on the ground and shook his head: "With a spell that you can't do and can't do, you still want Compared with Lear, Casper and Siegel, it’s a big deal. You have the ability to split a gummy monster. Then use your own spell to get it to life?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on Reese's face became very exciting, and the red and white constantly changed. His hands could not tremble, and apparently some lost control. "You... how did you see it? How is this possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
