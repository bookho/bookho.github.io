			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black figure is slowly approaching, and its form is gradually changing. A gray shadow stretched out from his hand and turned into a rusty sword. Following the hand holding the sword, the shadow is getting clearer and clearer, and the wristband on the arm can be seen, then the shoulder armor, breastplate, robe and helmet. In the gap of the helmet is a pair of ruthless eyes, under the armor is a gray body, the dry hand is holding a long sword eroded by blood. This form appeared for a few seconds, and it turned into a shadow of continuous advancement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Janet fled and the metal door screamed. Two people hurried to the ground, and then a fiery flame swept through the air, covering a hundred meters. This flame brings warmth, and the two people's frozen hands and feet regain strength. They use both hands and feet and move forward under the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow was ignited by the fire, twisted and fell down, and tumbling on the ground like boiling water. Siegel felt that the pressure on his heart was a lot smaller, and he took out his magic wand and cast a spell of energy missiles. The purple light ball flies toward the shadows, then runs through the ground and explodes on the ground. The excited airflow caused the black shadow to twist a few times without causing substantial damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Undead, shadow, troublesome opponent." Siegel bite his teeth and drag Janet to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the fire is on top of the entire 100-meter range, two people can only climb out of the head. When Siegel thought that he was going to leave the sea of ​​fire, the scenery around the blink of an eye changed. The ground of the stone turned into a wooden floor and swayed constantly. The dry hot flame air becomes salty and wet, and the taste of the sea. Siegel looked up and found himself on the deck of the Lucky Sos. He had no armor, just a broken little scorpion; there was no wand in his hand, only a dirty rag. The big ship is driving fast on the sea, the sails are bulging, and the sky is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Squid, what are you waiting for! Clean up the deck quickly!" The captain's voice was clear and bright, and Siegel left two lines of tears. "After cleaning up, go to the watchtower, don't want to be lazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel crouched down and wiped a black spot on the deck, but what? Can't wipe it off. He felt anxious and harder. "Watching the tower, watching the tower, I have to go to the lookout tower." He repeated this sentence in a crazy way, sweat dripping down his hair and moistening the rag. The black spot faded with the wipe, and the outline became clearer and clearer, as if it were Sir Bill's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was shocked and slammed straight. At this time, the sky was already dark, and the big waves hit, and the ship was shaking down. Next to the lucky Sos, a large ship with a large face leaned up. On the ship's side, a wooden stick was inserted into the head of the air-dried, and dozens of orcs armed with serrated knives shouted and were preparing to board the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why didn't you go to the lookout tower?" A broken arrow was inserted in the eye socket of the chief, and black blood was constantly flowing down from it. He grabbed Siegel's collar and said sadly: "Why didn't you see this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arrow came and inserted the first officer The temple, shot him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc throws a hook and binds the two boats together, then jumps on the lucky Soss, wields the weapon in his hand, and kills when he sees someone. Siegel fled and fled, looking for weapons and holding them all the way. But whenever he wants to pick up a sword or even pick up a stick, this weapon will be damaged in his hand - the sword breaks and the stick decays. He ran on the deck until he was stumped by a body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old captain had a flying axe in front of his chest and a knife was cut on his neck. He had the last breath left, his bloody mouth opened and closed, telling his last words: "I am so disappointed, I am so disappointed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Siegel licked the captain's face with his palm and put his eyes on him. He wiped his tears and stood up from the captain's body. The orc pirate rushed over and the serrated machete whistled in the air. But at this time, Siegel was not afraid at all. He had a wand in one hand and a machete in the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How does this orc's movement look like a goblin?" Siegel calmly replied. He raised his wand, and the dazzling light burst from the top, like a little sun. The orcs clung to their eyes and shouted in pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the light, the images of these orcs have disappeared, and a larger shadow has shrouded. Segel looked up and the red dragon killed in the jackdaw tribe camp was flapping his wings and slowly landed in front of him. The thick smell of sulfur rushed in the face, and the dragon's eyes contained an angry flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel laughed and said to the dragon: "Is this what is used to scare me, a dragon? If you are true, I admit that it is not your opponent, but I still kill your master, eat Your flesh and blood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master? Do you mean this?" The dragon grabbed an armor from the void, both like a death knight, and Like chasing the black shadow of Siegel. The dragon spurts the flame and burns the armor into molten iron. It swayed his head and shouted loudly: "The dragon has no master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned, feeling that this illusion was too real. From the aspects of sight, hearing, smell and touch, it is as true as reality. The strangest point is that even if he knows that he is in the illusion, he can try several methods and change several spells without getting out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon looks down on Siegel and laughs at him: "Oh, little magician, who will save you this time? Who will save them this time?" What?” A certain tent appeared at the foot of the dragon, a tall, pointed teepee. In the tent came the shouting of Mesera's childbirth, and then the cry of a baby. Janet screamed happily in the tent: "Born, finally born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame spurted out of the dragon's mouth, swallowed the tent and turned into a burning The fire. The huge claws were pressed, turning the fire into a piece of soot and turning it into fly ash. The dust is black, floating on Siegel's face, still hot and hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you know that this is a fake, it will still make Siegel feel bad after another experience. He felt that he couldn't breathe, and there seemed to be something blocked in his throat, and his stomach was constantly twitching. Tears seem to flow from the eyes, and his mind is constantly echoing Janet's last call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Little Master, what can you do with me?" The dragon bowed his head and stopped at a place very close to Siegel. There is still smoke in its nostrils, and the flames in the teeth are drilled. "What can you do with me? I am the great dragon Kagraqis, I am the master of the volcano of Situ, I am the shadow of the Red Rock Valley, I can torture you forever. Even if you are a sword I will also break you, smash you, erode you, and make you a muddy mud, no longer useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel from the face Take a piece of burnt debris, sniff it under your nose, and then lick your fingers to turn it into fly ash. He sighed and stepped forward, standing before the giant head skull. He has learned to calm down, restrains emotions, and balances reason and sensibility. Siegel smiled at the dragon and said: "The dragon, the master and the shadow, the great name. You can be born again in this illusion, so realistic, powerful, know why?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon does not say a word, but the eyes are focused, obviously paying attention to the answer to this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because I dissected you, then ate you, knowing every detail of you. But even if you are so realistic, I can detect the difference!" "Siegel's voice just fell, slamming the wand forward, with dazzling light. The scales of the dragons are turned into bubbles, and the surrounding scenes are broken into pieces. Siegel felt himself stabbing something, and a warm feeling flowed into his sleeve along his wand. A man with a dry face looked at the wand in his heart in amazement, and constantly pulled out the bloody foam from his mouth. He was wearing a khaki robes and raised his cognac hand. He seemed to release any spells, but without waiting for the spell to finish, he fell and the body fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel found himself still in the dwarf's cave, but here is a round room, the fire-breathing passage is outside the room. In the center of the room there is a platform above the ground, about the height of Siegel's chest, with a complete giant faucet bone on the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four bodies around the platform, which look like morning guards. They all came into a position: kneeling on the ground, pointing their fingers at the fascia, their wrists were cut open, and the blood had drained. In addition, Janet is lying on the ground, her body is twitching, just like an epileptic seizure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was busy walking up to Janet, gently placing her in her arms and gently chanting a spell in her ear. Janet’s jitter slowed down, and Siegel opened her eyelids. Her eyes kept turning irregularly, her eyes were full of bloodshot eyes, and the effect of illusion was still not over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel broke free from the spell and consumed a lot of physical strength, but he still kept chanting spells to help Janet regain his mind. But she didn't seem to be getting better, falling deeper and deeper in her dreams. Janet’s appearance began to change, first regaining the look of Xiao Yan, and then changed back to the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
