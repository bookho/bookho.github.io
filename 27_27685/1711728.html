			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Be calm! 'Siegel scorned and kept telling himself: "First kill the archery, first kill the archery!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arrow fly Come over, rubbing the accountant's hat on the board and shocked the guy. Siegel saw the direction of the arrow and sideways from the edge of the truck. In the light of the moonlight, the two goblins held a short bow and stood on the edge of the jungle in the direction of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judged the distance, Siegel raised a little bow and then fired. The pure iron made "Yong" quickly flew over the battlefield, pinned precisely in the archer's neck, and directly disappeared. The goblin fell down his neck and the short bow fell into the mud. Siegel made persistent efforts, taking advantage of another goblin shot, and once again shot the string and quickly killed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, a loud noise came from behind him. Turning around, it turned out that the huge wild boar slammed into the van and smashed the bag full of fat. The two-meter-high bear gnome jumped from the back of the pig to the roof of the car, holding a shield in one hand and a machete in the other, making a fierce cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coachmen were frightened and the wooden sticks in the hands of several people fell to the ground. The goblin smashed up from the other direction and rushed to the middle of the truck for walking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill tumbling out from under the truck, just next to the wild boar. He slashed with a long sword and penetrated from the wild boar's ear, directly letting this guy scream. He walked on this fat with half a ton of fat, just like stepping on the ladder and immediately killing back behind the bear goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sneak attacking chop!" The bear gnome turned around and the door-like shield flat fan came over. The jazz had nowhere to hide. He was smashed out and slammed on the ground before he stood up again. The bear goblin excitedly waved the machete and yelled out with a huge tongue. It rushed forward, the muscles of the whole body were shaking, and I don’t know how much strength there is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblin rushed up and Siegel threw away the short. He pulled out the scimitar at the waist and the other hand slammed the ropes that had been prepared on the truck. The rope tightened between the wheels, forming a criss-crossing block in the gaps of several compartments, just like the 绊马索. The goblin sprint had to slow down and look for the empty space in the middle of the rope. Siegel tightened the rope and took a knife to kill the nearest goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Slashing, slashing, kicking!" Siegel muttered and flipped the first goblin. He hadn't had time to make up a knife, and the other guy jumped from his height to his head. The squid hurried down and avoided the waving mace. Then he bounced hard. The training of these days played a role. A rushing punch hit the nose of the goblin and directly stunned him to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblin who fell on the ground wanted to get up, but he fell down in the air and tangled up in a hurry. Siegel hurriedly took a few knives, no matter whether it was the heart or the stomach, as long as the other person was mourning - he didn't have much time to aim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three drivers have been killed, and three have been flustered. The guys who run around attract the goblin to chase, but they won't last long before they die. Siegel couldn't save everyone, only to try to kill the birth path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bravely rushed up to the ground, first opened the attack of enemy weapons, and saw the chest of the goblin without defense. He swayed in front of the goblin with his empty hand, and it was attracted to the moment of attention, and the other hand smashed the scimitar into the neck of the goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stinky liquid squirted his face, and he couldn’t even wipe it, rushing to save the nearest driver. The record of cutting down three goblins finally caught the attention, and there were five guys who rushed up the queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, stinky!" Siegel smiled excitedly. He remembered the days of surfing on the sea and shouted: "Let the waves of the waves Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used a scimitar as a shield and slammed into the first goblin. The thick shoulders made a creaking sound, but still picked up the guy directly and rushed to the second. The goblin did not expect the young people on the opposite side to be so brave, actually can be anti-charged, and some are at a loss. The sound of the chaotic collision was smashed into pieces. The strings of the goblins were intertwined with each other's hands and feet. They could only scream, curse, hug, and then fall into a ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top goblin is also the first to be collided. He is still dizzy and his hands are swaying. Siegel took the weapon and lifted it with his hands, like a chopping wood, and knocked it down on the heads of the five goblins. With five sounds like a watermelon, the chaos quickly ended and the mace was broken into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between the jazz and the bear goblin has been ruined, and a war is superb and a force is endless. The shield made of door panels blocks most of the jazz's direction of attack, while the enemy's tall body has a wider attack range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz double-handed sword, put the hilt on the waist, the tip of the sword pointed upwards, and moved around the bear goblin with a T-step. In this position, he has left three wounds on the enemy's knife arm, and the blood is flowing down. Xiong Dijing was so angry that he did not dare to slash and slash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-black eyes turned and the bear goblin suddenly thought of a bad idea. He yelled and raised the machete again and took a big step forward. Then he suddenly threw the machete in his hand and hid behind the shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chopper swayed toward Sir Bill’s door and made a loud whistling sound. The jazz knows how strong the monster's strength is, and he uses his sword to fly the machete with his hands—this shocked his arm. When the shield is pressed like a wall, he can only roll on the side, avoiding the collision route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before he stood up, the bear goblin kicked his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Smelly things, wait for Grandpa to smash you!" The bear goblin shouted and lifted his iron shoes again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz squatted and tried to reach out and touch the boot. At this time, a burning torch came from the direction of the truck, slamming on the back of the bear's goblin, and the flame splashed. The rough-skinned monster just shouted and shook his body, and he was not hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This momentary delay is enough to change everything. The jazz machine took out the dagger hidden in the boot, flew into the eye socket of the monster, and inserted a joint behind the knee. Through the movement of the leg, he struggled to step on the knees of the bear goblin and slid a distance by the impulse. The jazz stood up and pulled out the short edge of the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel threw the torch and turned to kill the last few goblins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bear goblin station is not stable, can't see it, and it shakes. He pulled out the dagger in his eye socket with one hand, but could not cover the blood that was constantly pulled out. The bear goblin mourned in pain, and he knew that he could not escape death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill’s prestige stood in front of the bear goblin, and the long sword in his hand reflected the silvery brilliance in the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Atonement, evil creature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bear gnome tried to lift the shield to resist, but This time he was a step late, his head flew to the sky, and then fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fast escape!" shouted the goblins. They grabbed the things around them, either a blanket or a broken pot and ran towards the jungle. The goblin knows that human beings can't see it in the dark, so it will never catch up with the jungle. It is safe to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the bow and shot two arrows, only hitting one goblin. The bow was stained with mud and worked in a humid environment for a long time, causing the last arrow to lose its focus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining three goblins fled into the jungle, which could not be chased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accountant McKate was fainted by the arrows that flew after the battle began. As a result, all the goblins thought that it was the body and did not care for him. He was lucky. It became the lightest caravan member. Now he was forced to stand in the most conspicuous position beside the campfire, holding a long stick for the whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill gave a simple dressing to the wounded, Siegel studied at the side, and then helped. Ten drivers died five, and one ran into the woods and never came back. A serious injury could only lie in the car. The remaining three drivers are only slightly injured and can walk on their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After burying the dead and appeasing the living, everyone found that the truck with the fat soil was damaged: the wheel broke into three pieces, and the best carpenter The master can't fix it either. McCart promised that each driver would get two more gold coins, and the dead would have ten gold coins – nothing to escape. The driver's morale improved a bit, and then the accounting was very strange asking everyone to throw away a full car apple seedlings, and then the bag of fat soil was moved to the empty car, delaying a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
