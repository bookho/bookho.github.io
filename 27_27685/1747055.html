			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has gone through countless spring and autumn turns, but since the lord, Heimqiu is the first season to have a bumper harvest. Throughout the year, the farmland here was not destroyed by beasts, no looting by bandits, no wars, and hardworking people, and finally achieved a good harvest. The water mill built on the side of the Shield River is running all day, grinding the wheat that has piled up into mountains into flour. One tenth of them will belong to the lord as a cost of using the mill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the convention, when the harvest was good, the party organized a banquet for the hard-working villagers and thanked the mother of the earth who raised the world. Janet did not let her take it. She began to level the open space outside the castle and level it with gravel. After the banquet is held here, it will be used as a town square in the outer city, and the new house will be built around this center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the Territory’s affairs are handled by Janet and Fitzak, but it does not mean that Siegel can be free. The dwarven occupants who came from the top of Mora finally arrived, and more than twenty dwarfs who had experienced the wind and frost looked at the newly built castle with harsh eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the part of the rune, the rest is not awkward." A dwarf said: "I only need to give me twenty people, I can turn over the wall. Put the suspension bridge down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On your old bones, also turned over the wall?" Another person said: "Why don't you dig holes from the ground? In the past? Then I only need fifteen people. No one will notice it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All shut up, we are not coming to attack the castle. Think about how to defend." The words of the third dwarf caused a lot of people to resonate. "What if you run into the Shiling Giant? What about the Shadow Snake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;[################################################################################################## Elinte once said that these dwarves have formed a new group, which is incompatible with the environment of Mora, and it is difficult for them to get along with them even if they are dwarfs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Elinte also warned him not to try to get drunk in these dwarves, one reason is that this is too difficult, and they are more difficult to control when they are crazy. There has been a profound lesson in the Mora. If the high-ranking pastor of the Dwarf's Guardian Temple is just present and casts a spell of emotional stability, these Western Dwarfs have long since broken through the care and blockade and are exposed to the dwarf's vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel licked his chin. Since there is no way for them to listen to their own. Then actively merge into it. Later, he also joined the discussion, using the architectural layout seen in the cage valley to illustrate the plan against the dragon, which really worked. Because of the same dwarf's handwriting, many programs in the cage valley were quickly understood and accepted by the people on the scene. They asked Siegel to draw a pattern on the ground. There was a lively discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some schemes are despised by them, but there are merits in many places. Through their words, Siegel also understood some ingenious ideas in architectural design. From morning to evening, a man and more than twenty dwarves stood on the playground in the city of Mire, writing and painting on the sand, designing a city that does not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, just like the discussion, the dwarf's belly made a sizzle. At this moment, a dwarf with a dark yellow beard suddenly slammed his head and shouted: "Where is the lord who came to greet us? I am going to be hungry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Siegel raised his hand and said quickly: "I am here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarfs have come back and watched them rise above A human being. They whispered: "It's weird. Why do I feel that there are only dwarves around, no human smell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the topic deviate again, Siegel is busy Shouted: "Who wants to eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage was stared at by more than forty hungry eyes, and the scene was only seen in nightmares. He quickly led the dwarf to the restaurant and let the kitchen serve the food. In fact, these things are prepared in the morning, and the heating is repeated over the course of the day. It is not allowed to be idle in the morning. The end result is that the broth becomes more rich and soft. This dish allows the dwarves to praise: "There have been no such good things for hundreds of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess this is what the chef heard. Let him happily faint, but the dwarf then said, "As long as you eat such broth every day, you don't have to prepare anything else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elinte’s uncle. Locke. Diamond is the dwarf who is "too hungry". He has the characteristics of a distinct diamond family - thicker and shorter than the average dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel young man, you can climb the road to the road, it is a member of the dwarf. I will tell you straight." The dwarf said: " We are very clear that we are actually exiled, but we have not been disqualified from the family. When we chose to go west, we were prepared to withstand this situation. In fact, it is our ambition to live back. It has exceeded our expectations now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my opinion, you are great explorers." Siegel said: "I am west of the Walled Mountains." Very interested. Can you tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf shook his head. "The family council forbids us to tell the details, so you ask questions. Give us We are very grateful to you for finding a place to live near the Walled Mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a gold mine next to St. Joseph, where there is also a small The town can get supplies for daily life. It is a good addition to the half-orc residents. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Semi-orcs?" The dwarf's eyebrows picked and picked and snorted: "What are the half-orcs? They are already very good races, At least some of the honest guys who are able to abide by the promises. Just arrange the place for us around you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But don't be holy There is a dragon in it,” Siegel feared the dwarf to misunderstand, and then said: “The dragon and I are allies, not the enemy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the dragon, the dwarf's eyes showed an inexplicable sorrow: "They are all poor animals." The dwarf said, "But your territory is really unique, half-orcs, dragons plus our dwarves. If there is Gnomes and elves, the wisdom of the New World, you are almost complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a gnome here." Siegel thought of Ding Bao, "maybe There will be elves in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not." Locke shook his head, " "Terror!" ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a wise move to arrange this group of dwarves next to the “New Stone Village” because of their critical eye and the ability to do almost obsessive-compulsive disorder. It took only three days to get the original gold mine design out of the skin, and many places were demolished and rebuilt. Siegel resisted not telling the story that "this gold mine was built by the dwarfs," but he began to understand why the Dwarf Parliament of Mount Mora would rather bring them to Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The production capacity of gold mines continues to rise. Siegel understands that he will soon become the highest-paid human lord of the New World. The wealth of Deepwater City is amazing, but it is accumulated by many masked lords. Pure gold is of little significance to Siegel, and he needs to turn these precious metals into actual materials as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of orders were issued from the city of Mire, but most of them were disguised as the jewel family of Mora. Others purchase from the Federation on behalf of the Master. Perhaps it was these wealth that caught the attention of the Federation, and the team that built the magic test site was finally organized. Siegel entrusted Akzi to help rent a lot of magic books, and bought some books related to occultism, history, geography and magic array, just to let the wizard team come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some orders coming to the northern grasslands. Siegel bought more than 30 horses in the name of Heim's collar to equip his knights. Giant Kerry will not be a good brother. All that was sent to him was a good horse, which was rare in the whole south. Other territories require the Cavaliers to bring their own horses, but in Siegel's view, they cannot afford to own their horses unless they are part of the land. So nominally these horses are still the property of Siegel, but they are given to the employers by rent, and the rent is loyal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it costs money, Siegel still has a lot of gold coins. He decided to continue to purchase animal fur that can be made into leather, so that the Jackdaw Tribe first restored its status as a commercial center on the grassland. This order has left the Jackdaws tribe for a whole year without any trouble, and the Horde has never been as prosperous as it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then. Siegel began to acquire spell materials from the Jackdaw tribe. The Deepwater City Masters Federation regularly acquires plants and animals for formulating and conducting spell tests. However, the price they give is not high and is much lower than the actual value of these materials. Since the team that built the spell test site has begun to go south, in order to contain the forces of the Knox Association, Siegel is now preparing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
