			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gave the investigation of the Uther family to Janet, and he no longer worried about it. He also proposed his original plan to use the ability of earth elements to disrupt the production of iron ore and make the conflict between the Hera family and the Uther family bigger. However, Janet denied the plan and pointed out that the Herae family is actually a true hardcore ally of the Uther family. The so-called friction is just a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen this in the Starry Kingdom. When you want to deal with Uther and go to draw the Thunder, you will fall into it. Trap," Janet said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage smiled and handed the map to Janet, not wasting brain power on these things. Dealing with intricate interpersonal relationships is not his specialty. He can improve his magical ability in the same amount of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you find evidence and can determine who is instructing the assassination, be sure to tell me." Siegel said to Janet: "This is not the only thing." Forgive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the security of the territory, Siegel is prepared to make use of all available resources. After the equipment of Mora's scorpion is shipped, the training of the soldiers cannot be stopped. At present, only Mana is a commander, but she is from a mercenary group and can only cope with the work of the patrol. It is unrealistic to organize an army like that. But recruiting a qualified knight is not that simple. Heim has no manpower to take charge of the job. So Siegel put his gaze on the peak of St. Joseph. There is also a "nothing" dragon, maybe I can make some ideas from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with this plan." Janet said: "A dragon can make us invincible. But you are sure you can complete this task." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know if you don't try?" Siegel said: "I always visit this neighbor."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Siegel took a basket of gifts and climbed to St. Joseph alone. He did not bring a follower because he was not sure if the dragon would welcome visitors other than him. There is no steep mountain of St. Joseph, but there is no road to the mountains, no ladder to test the will of the people, only the most primitive rocks and fissures. If you are an average person, you must have excellent skills to advance on such terrain. For the Master, you only need a fluttering flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest of Platinum Dragon is invisible in the eyes of ordinary people. Siegel opened the sight to discover its entrance. The cave is 40 meters wide and ten meters high. It is very dry, with no vegetation or other animals, and a bare hall like a castle. Siegel found that the ground beneath his feet was a rock that had been burned by high temperatures. A glass-like substance formed after melting and coagulation over and over. This kind of stone is very hard, and it can't be traced with a common sword, but when it is stepped on, it gives a soft illusion, as if walking on a carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“At home?” Siegel shouted, only to hear the echo of “at home. at home”. According to the records of the Masters Association, it is impolite to ignite a torch in a dragon's cave. The dragon often uses a brighter flame, Longyan, to help the guests illuminate. Siegel casts a dark visual spell for himself, and everything around him becomes visible. He avoided the stones on the ground and walked slowly. Although the effect of the flight is still on his body, the use of natural legs is more respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is a sensitive animal after all, and their pride is reflected in all aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave extends a distance of one hundred feet, and then the ground suddenly rises to form a 30-foot drop. This is a take-off platform, and the dragon can jump from the high platform. Stretch your wings and slide forward, flying out gracefully from the hole. Segal used both hands and feet to climb the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squinted and looked carefully, and there were not many claw scratches on the edge of the platform, indicating that the dragon rarely left the cave. Even the hardest stones can't withstand the power of dragon claws, especially the adult dragons. The platform is the most vulnerable part of the dragon's hole and needs to be constantly reinforced with new rocks. Siegel noticed that there was no new work for at least a hundred years, and there were only a few scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell in the cave is very clean, and there is no smell of rot or scum. The hygienic situation of the beast's lair has been worrying, and many adventurous people need to overcome the heavy impact of the air on the nose. Siegel is glad that he does not have to endure such a test. However, this situation has not exceeded his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, the dragon does not need any food or water. You can survive by relying on the energy of the elements that wander in the air. Although this will lead to a decline in their melee ability and a thin body, they can still grow like this. Such dragons want to grow in shape very slowly, but they can more firmly consolidate magic and become masters of magic. Most of the dragons who made this choice are concentrated in the stage of the ancient dragon, and their bodies are already very large. If you continue to maintain the "eat, long body" cycle, even the dragon's bones are difficult to bear. Taikoo dragons generally choose to sleep and start their spiritual journey in their dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few young dragons do this. After all, the part of their body that belongs to the beast is active, and the desire for flesh and blood is hard to suppress. But in some of the Master's hypotheses, if a dragon chooses to sleep in a cave from an early age, thinking about swimming in the void, and the body is focused on condensing magical energy, how strong will it be? Most of humanity's current magic comes from stealing other races, and most of the races have traced the dragons. If you can push up the dragon's magical ability, it may provide new ideas for the wizard's spell research. This hypothesis has caused heated discussions among the mages. If it is not because of the covenant with the dragons, maybe such a test will really begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s mind is turning this way forward, while also being careful about the surrounding environment. He turned a corner on the high platform and saw the center of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge hollow burned with a flame, presented in front of Siegel like an inverted bowl. On the walls above and around the walls, some of the deliberately set aside rocks are immortalized with magical flames that provide constant illumination. The dragons don't need light to see everything around them, and the only purpose of these lights is to illuminate the treasures in the center of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire cave is three meters high, full of all kinds of gold and silver jewels, gold and gems that have not yet been cast, and finely crafted artwork. Many uniquely shaped instruments are scattered on the heap of treasures. The mess is like the grass on the sand. From these things, Siegel sees many armor, weapons and jewelry. There are also many strange patterns, and the treasures that can be imagined in the most absurd dreams are all smeared with a strange light under the illumination of the eternal flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit abnormal, Siegel thought. From the surrounding environment, Capricorn does not often go out to hunt, and she should be very concerned about these treasures, will not leave too far. St. Joseph is within the sight of the city of Mith, and it is impossible to notice if there is a dragon flying. Siegel circled around the treasure and sniffed his nose, and there was no shadow of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel suddenly understood the plan of the dragon. They had promised that in the absence of Capricorn, Siegel could not take away any of the same treasures, lest he "scratch the scales." So the dragon must have hidden in some way, secretly observing the action of the mage. I thought that Capricorn had suddenly emerged from the invisibility and shocked Siegel. Maybe the talent of this dragon is hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel laughed, put the basket on the ground, and then rushed to the treasure heap. He rolls, jumps, cheers, throws things everywhere, everywhere. The golden and silver can fall like raindrops, and the whole cave is full of squeaky sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he picked up his wand and used his mana to make the gems grow up and fly like a river in midair. While doing this, he muttered: "Oh...all mys..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he wouldn’t really take any belongings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After agreeing with the dragon, only when the dragon is destroyed, the covenant must not be actively destroyed. The Masters Association clearly stated the end of the breach of the contract: even the legendary strong, also fallen in the pursuit of the dragons never give up. This is a bloody warning, and Siegel will not be stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is just teasing the dragon out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treasure pile was turned upside down, and some of the items buried below were revealed. Siegel saw a strange gold coin, and he had never seen the pattern above. He believes in the gold coin of this human empire, otherwise the human side will not be engraved on it. But he thought about it carefully, and there is no language in the history similar to the above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he also found some unique scrolls, which are beautiful scrolls, and the style is different from any race in the old and new continents. But what surprised Siegel most was two spellbooks, one with a black cover and one with a blue cover, all decorated with silver spells. Siegel touched it with his hand, and the black-skinned spell book had a faint heat, just like it was alive; the blue-skinned spell book exudes a strong chill and stabbed his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
