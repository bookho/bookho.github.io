			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry and Siegel supported each other and walked out of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will the white dragon come?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "It shouldn't be, the death knight will command the orcs, and will not be in danger again. We have no chance to single-handedly." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and the defense scepter in the courtyard received the instruction and immediately flew into his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All warriors, organize defense!" His orders spread throughout the castle, including the soldiers who were hidden in advance. Then he said to Kerry: "Let's find a place to put me down, I am off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of a defensive staff, the death knight nails The impact of the hammer is still very strong. It can still persist when it is tight in the battle, but all the fatigue after the battle has come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel re-wears the hood and wraps himself, leaning against the fire. He grabbed the cup with his trembling hands and drank the "hot tea" brewed with therapeutic syrup and soothing herbs to try to restore his strength as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground floor of the courtyard is covered with a viscous liquid, which is a mixture of black dragon blood, acid and dissolved warrior bodies. Under the siege of hundreds of people, under the premise that Siegel made all kinds of targeted preparations, dozens of casualties were still paid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how many people will be killed in defending this black blood castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the scout's return information, the orc's army has at least 50,000. In fact, Siegel understands that there is no way to count the number of people in the investigation, and only guess according to the density and length of the team. In the past few years, the orcs have won in the war and returned to the north with a lot of spoils. Their living conditions have been greatly improved. Although the newly born orcs are not yet long enough to fight, the surplus food allows them to gain the loyalty of the giants of the hills, the ogre or other large creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this team there are some hill giants who can throw stones, power and human trebuchets are comparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Blood Castle can be placed on the wall at a time of about five hundred people, which can form a powerful blow to the orcs. Rotating soldiers need to be divided into five groups to cope with day and night fighting; the auxiliary soldiers and logisticians who wind the bow and add fuel to the brazier also need about 400. Together with the reserve forces, the entire castle needs 4,000 soldiers. Defensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current strength is sufficient. Weapons and defensive devices should also be adequately handled, and a black dragon and the dragon knight above are also killed, and the preparation in advance has been the best. Siegel calmly waited for the arrival of the enemy, and his heart was full of confidence to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a long time at Heim. Whether it is the Elves or the Knox Association, they attach great importance to him and regard him as an obstacle that must be overcome to conquer the southern part of the New World. But no one thought that Siegel had brought troops to the north of the city wall and arranged the front line to stop the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the soldiers of the Jackdaw Tribe, there are 7,000 people gathered near the Black Blood Castle. There are more than 10,000 jackdaw tribe cavalry at the foot of the mountain. The orcs can only walk through the road through the walled mountains, and they have no advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t need to be here, he doesn’t need to drain the last drop of blood, he can retreat at any time through the path of the castle defense chain. This is the biggest benefit of this battle. - Advance and retreat freely. Because of this, he can rest assured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel alone sits in the room of the tower, the only thing that moves here is the brazier burning in front of him. Standing outside the door stood two guards of Heim's collar, with a proud, proud look straight and chest, do a good job of guarding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, Mana and Zuck took the follow-up troops in place. They saw that the people of the Jackdaw tribe were cutting the black dragon's body and familiarizing themselves with it. Excited Kerry is going to have another banquet, but the black dragon's meat is all sour, and there is no way to eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the black dragon's skin can make armor, dragon claws and dragon teeth to make weapons. All dragon weapons are collected and ready to deal with the death knight. Metal weapons are said to be ineffective against the Hindu warriors wearing gold armor, but natural materials such as wood and teeth are not affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Void left, Siegel put a lot of precious parts and materials in the space bag, a lot of smoldering crystals, but without a mace, now I got one. Among everyone. Only he can exert the full power of this weapon. Siegel has the technology to extract energy from the soul soul crystal. With the plasma grain, you can activate the mace hammer and fly anything in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since others can't use it. He accepted it unceremoniously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the soldiers led by Heim are more familiar with the castle's defenses, they took over the walls of the entire Black Blood Castle. There are constant orders from the horsewoman, and the entire castle is running in an orderly manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Kerry took a bucket of wine and knocked on the door of the Siegel room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really comfortable to be hiding here." The giant said bluntly: "I don’t have a woman like Mana under my hand? I see Her arrangement for the castle is better than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She works hard, stronger than me." Siegel said: "Mana manages territory and army than me. Strong. The training soldiers are stronger than me. Fitzak handles the intelligence. The Janis management caravan, Janet is also able to cope with the intrigues between the nobles. If it were not for them, I would not be the lord."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you say this, I am a little unhappy. They are better than you, I am not as good as you, isn't it my fault?" Kerry sat down. Give Siegel a glass of red wine, then use the power of ice to cool down and hand it over. "Try it, good things from Deepwater City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fragrance of the fruit condenses in the wine, and the taste is all stimulated after chilling. "This is not the wine of the New World." Siegel said: "Although I don't like drinking too much, as a lord, I know everything about the production of the New World. This can only be from the starry kingdom through the sea, and it is worth a lot. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you grab it, you can drink it." Kerry said: "I still want to persuade you, don't stay here at the castle. The orcs are It’s not a good thing. The dragon and the death knight are the same, damn it. But this war has no oil and water, just like the dry grass roots. Deepwater City is the place where the rich oil is flowing, where the treasures are waiting for us to save. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know what you think, but I can't go to Deepwater with you, I am the baron and pioneer knight there." Siegel stares at the hand. In the cup, watching the red liquid spin and shake. “Deepwater City will issue many rewards every year to let mercenaries and adventurers 'control the number of people on the grassland. There is hatred between you. Since you are the king of the grasslands, there is an obligation to avenge them. It's understandable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will block the orcs here, so I can't take it to defend Deepwater City, I can only watch you leave." Siegel drinks Under the red wine. "The only thing I can do is to persuade you to grab more things, to kill more, and not to go to the Masters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. Kerry wanted to give him a cup, but Siegel refused. The giant scratched his hair. Then said: "According to what we discussed before..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Help me defend for five days, then leave." Siegel said: "But you want Remember, before the elves enter the city, no matter how good the opportunity is in front of you, it is the trap of the Knox Association. You must never enter the city. You must be the liberator of Deepwater City, the human hero who beats the elves, and The savior of the treasure appeared, did you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry laughed, "The liberator of Deepwater City? Hahahaha, I like this title." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼克 pushed the door open and sucked his nose and came over. "I said that there is a good wine here. They still don't believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All go, let me treat you." The giant Kerry said: "I am There is still a bucket under the mountain, and they will be sent in these two days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are all busy, come over and wake me up when the orc comes, now I "We have to rest." Siegel waved his hand and said to the two men: "The statistics of the death and injury are counted and handed over to Mana. She is now the lord of the lord, giving orders to me and organizing the defense of the castle."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you can rest assured that you are the Lord." Zucker said: "The morale of the soldiers that Heim is leading is high. The orcs will not take advantage of it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
