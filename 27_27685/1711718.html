			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kobold is a very wretched cold-blooded creature that bullies and fears hard and likes to abuse prey. They are short, only about 1 meter long, and very thin, with a sharp, long tail behind the body. It was only because of the wolf-dog-like face that had similar horns on the top of the head, so they were called kobolds by other races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, since these kobolds are already dead, can we go back and get the bounty?" Seeing the darkening darkness, dark red sunset It is about to disappear behind the mountains. After the killing, the sudden silence of the atmosphere continues to permeate in the forest. Siegel can't help but urge: "Maybe we can return to Oak Town before midnight to end this task and have a good night's sleep." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Afraid? This is just some kobolds." Tiger Biel said to his fighting: "We just just warmed up, you are no longer good." ", little scorpion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not!" Siegel pulled out the arrow inserted in the dog's eye socket, carefully observed it, dried it. Bloodstains will also be able to use the arrow to squat down and put it back into the pocket. As a battle follower who has just entered the line, it is his important duty to do the work of cleaning the battlefield and recovering weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just feel annoyed by an adult like you to do things like annihilating a Kobold robber. It’s too big to use." Young followers said to themselves. I did not pay attention to the adults behind him and pinched his fists. "Since the robbers here are dead, there is no need to waste more time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiger Biel stood in front of Siegel, just covering the last A touch of the sunset. He kicked a sneak peek at Siegel, watching him fall on the body of the kobold, and was splashed by the black blood that was about to solidify. "What do you know, little nephew! I let you be a follower, but let you be a jester! Manage your mouth and work hard! Otherwise, when I have castles and territories and lack clowns, I will be the first. Think of you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiger can clearly see the "small scorpion" tight lips, you can feel the "yes, the adult" sentence to answer the reluctance, As he did more than thirty years ago. It’s because of this familiar feeling that I took this young man off the boat and took it with me. He recalled himself, a young man who was stubborn, diligent, and trying to change the world. He continued to fight through battle. After 30 years of ups and downs, he only became a lonely "knight." From the bottom of his heart, he hopes that this equally stubborn young man will be able to embark on a different path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this thinking, Tiger will not reveal a mild look, still a severe and hurried reprimand: "The Cavaliers must learn to obey, say less, Do more. So the little scorpion, you quickly put away the arrows, and the sharks that are not rusted, bring back to the village to melt and save some iron."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the embarrassment that keeps ringing in the ear, Siegel always feels like he has returned to the sea, surrounded by the never-ending waves, and cannot be spared for a moment. These messy work, like the shackles on the deck, always comes back after you clean up, and there is absolutely no day to finish. If there is something wrong with it, how can a jazz adult not even forget the search for the kobold? I remember the first officer - I would never call him the captain - gave this big mouth 5 gold coins, did it cost it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at his employer in the gap between the trophy and the trophy. It is undeniable that Tiger Bill has a jazz style. He was thin, but full of strength, straightening his waist, and now he was turning over and riding the black horse that accompanied him on the boat, crossing the sea, condescending and elegant. There was a long sword hanging from his waist, a long bow on his back, and two daggers on his ankle. Black leather boots, black trousers, black rabbit leather gloves, black leather inlaid armor, black dome leather helmet. Several woven bags with loot are hung on the hooks behind the saddle, forming a balanced load on both sides of the horse, without affecting the battle or affecting income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill was born in a real aristocratic family, although the smallest of the five boys, originally had no qualification to inherit the title, but he was hard-working The swordsman won the championship at the contest and won the honorary jazz title. Unfortunately, since then, Sir Tiger Bill has been along with the bad luck, doing everything is not going well, he also offended his boss in a noble civil war, was deprived of the battlefield honor, lost the possibility of gaining territory as a knight. Later, he "had fallen from his own hands" and lived as a mercenary. He traveled between the "New World" and the "Old World". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s undeniable that Sir Bill’s martial arts is superb, and he is very good at both bows and swords. Since following him ashore, Siegel has been learning the habits of life on land since he was a child, learning the skills that a warrior should master. Unlike the sea, you should be careful in the adventures of the New World. Any leaks in the links can cause bad results. Siegel has made rapid progress and has been able to win the job of any knight. He just doesn't like being called a "little scorpion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
