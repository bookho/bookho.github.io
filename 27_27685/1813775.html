			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to throw a fireball on Chanel’s smiling face. Unfortunately, on the one hand, he has returned to the room, and on the other hand, the Holy Spirit has begun to function, and Siegel has taken care of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time Siegel has been transformed, he seems to have been familiar with it. (?) As the only black-and-black guy in the world, he doesn't know if he is a human. Perhaps from the beginning, he was some kind of intelligent body like a lamp god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a two-faced existence with the scorpion, he has experienced the transformation of the sturdy and the transformation of elemental aggregates, with creatures, undead monsters and elemental bodies. Characteristics. Now there is another kind of energy. The power of the saints from the orc god is constantly improving his physical fitness and moving forward toward a higher, stronger and stronger road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you continue this way, it is estimated that the claws and cavities will grow. Siegel himself couldn't move at all, but he could order the elements to throw themselves into the room. When the closed door covered everyone's sight, he turned himself into a beggar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the transformation of elemental aggregates, his current form of sputum is not a complete undead, at least when Siegel is willing, the slightest negative energy is exposed. come out. The process of sanctification is in trouble, and the energy of this embarrassment suddenly does not know how it should be. There is no flesh and blood for it to strengthen, so everything works on Siegel's bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually the third external force on the bones, the plasma rune network, the elemental aggregate runes, and the Holy Power. Siegel's bones are like being scribbled many times, and now there is no regular pattern at all. The green light of the orc saint climbed over the skeleton of his body, like a layer of green paint on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process lasted for more than half an hour, and Siegel was refreshed and worried. Sanctification is a reward. There is naturally no pain in this process. But how do you deal with the fourth layer of the Magic Tower? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a good thing to contaminate the Holy Power, at least until you see the magical fire of the magic god. Do you know if there will be rejection, and there are multiple orc saints in your body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem claims that the power to Siegel is pure, but can the sacred sacred person believe? Siegel tried to stop the spread of the Holy Power. But it is just like controlling your own breathing to suffocate, it is almost impossible to achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need this extra power!" Siegel constantly uses elements to wash the Holy Power, but only elemental aggregates can produce certain effects. Many people pursue will than **, but most of the time this is just a slogan. Even Siegel uses the astral projection. Sending his will, but after all, he is going to return to his body - otherwise he will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the saint is not affected by longevity, does not age, and most diseases are difficult to affect it. For creatures, this is completely a dream, so all parts of the body are open to embrace it. Siegel was in vain for a period of resistance. Finally, I still lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the inhuman road, I don’t know if I can go back. The problem of becoming a state of undead has always been a warning to remind Siegel to keep mortals and stay awake. However, if the undead becomes a normal body, it will have no effect if it is not used normally. However, the body of the sage can't be shielded, and it will have a subtle influence on Siegel's character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another trouble is the fourth floor of the Magic Tower. Although the triggering conditions for the destruction of lightning attacks were not found in all the literature, the horrors of Chanem and the orc saint have already sounded the alarm for Siegel. He didn't want to try the law before he was sure. After all, he didn't know that his saint state could withstand several resurrections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloning may be a solution to get rid of the identity of the saint by changing the body. Siegel has always had a thought to linger, that is, once he is resurrected by cloning, what will happen to the stencil and the elemental polymer lines on his bones? According to common sense. These are the acquired abilities that are acquired, and have nothing to do with the original body, but from the current resurrection situation, some very characteristic things will still be reproduced on the clones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more representative is the spiritual link of the magic pet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master is to establish a stable, single spiritual link through the power of magic and the magic pet, which is formed by the day after tomorrow. When using cloning to treat Wendy and others, Siegel found that when they were resurrected, the magic pet link was already there, and no need to cast spells. Even as the creator of cloning, Siegel did not understand what the reason was, but gave him a new idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I grow my teeth, I have to crush Chanem into pieces!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His physical fitness has been improved, especially explosiveness, endurance and tenacity. Sex. Only need to be empty, Siegel can squeeze the steel helmet, even if there is a head inside can not stop. Ordinary weapons have been difficult to pierce his skin. The general flame can't even be felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that brought these changes was the energy of the orc holy people, most of which was absorbed by Chanem. Now I need to re-evaluate the power of Chanem. In what ways will he improve? The techniques of hiding, stealth and killing represent a kind of extreme. If not, the orc holy power he threw was not so high. Strength and endurance will definitely improve, then? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s guess may be resistance to magic, and if he is Chanem, he will choose. Spell resistance does not affect the effect of spellcasting, but it is a good solution to the threat of spells. The advantage in the environment of the School of Magic is very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guess is guessed, as long as Chanet does not say, Siegel can't confirm. After the death of the Half-orc Master, the School of Magic entered a new phase, which was smoother and more silent. The people consciously and unconsciously observed the faces of Siegel and Chanem, and carefully guarded and guarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The college had only six people in a few days, and then came a black-skinned male elf mage. The Dark Elves, or Zall, will survive in other worlds, but they have never seen them in the Wall of the Thunder. This made Siegel begin to ponder, in the end, where is the country of the gods, and what criteria are they based on? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel went to ask the Dark Elves, but only got a taunt. Perhaps turning into a dark elf woman in the past can avoid being hurt by inexplicable pride. The Dark Elf Master always uses the low-key and noble words over and over. It seems that the magic he uses is more powerful than others, and all this is because his skin is dark enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing about this mutual aid group organized by Siegel, he made it clear that he would not participate unless he was made a leader. “Leader?” Siegel shook his head. “Only the difference between the initiator and the participant is that everyone is better able to unite and gain greater benefits here.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is about interest, the Dark Elves will put the skin color in a higher position. They always feel that this skin is the root of the relationship between their race and other races, and they never thought that their behavior was fundamental. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day of his ridiculing Siegel, Chanem killed the Dark Elves, stripped his entire skin, and divided the body Two piles burned. "You persuaded him, I also advised him to persuade him, but he just didn't listen." Chanem said: "You will definitely say you can try again, but in my opinion, your time is precious, don't waste On the tongue. It is more efficient to kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too damn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do not forget, that is my essence, I am already patient." Chanem looked at the magic school, his eyes swept through the door of everyone's room. "I think it's enough to have you here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice made Siegel shudder and hurriedly said "Roll!" This conversation. At present, it seems that only speeding up the progress will be done, otherwise Chanem will find various reasons to clean up others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Chanem feels that he is unable to complete the study, he will not hesitate to kill. If it weren't for the orc saint who came before him, neither of them would have the confidence to kill each other, thus forming a weird balance, otherwise there would be other people's way of life in the Magic Academy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ones who can survive are strong, at least this is true. Even if it is a soft and soft female elf, is it really only the ability to identify lies? As the saint of the murder god, Chanem is a master of deception and misinformation. Real and false can be seen at a glance. Maybe the orc holy person needs Anna's ability to help, Chanem can never use her, but will be hindered by her ability, then why can Anna live for so long? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Anna seeks the protection of the orc saint, then this can explain the past. According to Siegel, Anna rarely approached him before the death of the Orc Master, let alone deal with it. The three people who live the longest have a certain distance from each other, just like the formation of three separate circles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
