Hey. ⊙ Now from now - point 515 fans festival to enjoy double monthly tickets, other activities have to send red envelopes can also see an ang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only eternal thing in the world is death, endless death." Lich Alexander's voice is mixed in the spell, echoing on the hillside with a strange squeak . "Siegel, join me in death, your soul will be the best sacrifice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice? Why does Alexander use this word? There are sacrifices that have the goal of sacrifice, so who is the one who receives the sacrifice? Siegel struggled to get up from the ground and pretend to be seriously injured. Although he still has the protection of high invisibility, he has no protection in front of various area-covering spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream suddenly screamed, and the sound almost pierced Siegel's eardrum. The illusion of countless dead souls is accompanied by screams flying out of the body of the lich. There are men and women, old and young, but their common features are the appearance of a decaying body. These ghosts rushed to all directions, and several of them sensed that Siegel’s body was alive, so they swooped over. Siegel's anti-death enchantment spells came into effect, turning them into a layer of bright white transparent shields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s fingertips swayed with a black flame, and even invisible forces could hardly block it. A group of flamingos flying from the flame, about the size of a hummingbird, can hover in the air, and the flexibility of moving forward and backward is even better than that of a hummingbird. This is an improved form of the summoning creature of fire, and Siegel transforms the spell by mimicking the shape of Baron. "Chong up, my friend!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black flame hummingbird rushes to the lich from all angles, and the lich decides to absorb the elements with the power of elemental protection spells. Injury, injury, injury, focus on the sky, the ghost of the sky rushed to Siegel. "This is not the banshee, the squid boy, this is a ghost natural disaster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander constantly emits negative energy, strengthening the power of the ghost in the sky. Obviously, their claws began to stain with gray fog. You can dig up a lot of elemental energy when you scratch the spell shield. The more the ghosts gather, the more their bodies move from invisible to physical, and the influence on the surrounding material is growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flamingo ignited the body of the lich and made his bones all round. Although Alexander made a painful roar. But the flame did not kill. Instead, Siegel's protective spells are stripped off layer by layer, and each of the ghost's claws has the effect of dispelling magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will definitely not work! Siegel saw the negative energy of Alexander's two bones gathering, knowing that the battle was at the most critical moment. He knows well, even if he summons the elemental legion. It will also be defeated by this group of ghosts because of the constant removal of magic. Only by virtue of their ability to control the elements, those spells close to themselves are more likely to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to deal with undead creatures is positive energy, the so-called healing power. A priest who believes in good gods can easily use positive energy, but it is more troublesome for the wizard. When Siegel invented cloning, he specialized in the transformation between life and death, so cloning is a Necrotic spell, but it has the ability to resurrect. As he once said to Necromancer Shelley, even negative energy can be converted into positive energy with healing power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The only thing in the world that is eternal is change. Even death is not constant!" Siegel raised his wand and put ice crystals with cursing and death. Use the power of the lion, which is condensed by the power of Lion King Alexander, as a fuel to cast a "killing the dead" spell. This spell is a very basic trick, as simple as a wizard and a wizard who opens the door, but it is a rare positive energy ray spell in the wizard's spell. Siegel once envisioned the transformation of this spell for use in the treatment of living things. Although it failed, it eventually changed into a positive energy enchantment that had great restraint on the necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a lighthouse, the white light swirls around, and the illuminated ghosts make a sharp shout, and the smoke-like body dissipates quickly. It's like a snow block thrown on a soldering iron. The darkness was dispelled, and the entire hillside was illuminated like the summer noon of the clear sky. All the living things were actually Siegel, who felt warm and energetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dawn Priest? When did you convert..." The lich looked at everything in front of him completely incomprehensible. How do you beat Siegel into a pastor who is a godsman? Although everything can be exchanged and transformed is the saying that the Master often hangs on the lips, but the wide range of positive energy magic has always been the patent of the priest of the gods. It is only possible for the Master to open the door of the outer boundary to connect to the place of Heaven Mountain. Produce a similar effect. Siegel’s actions have subverted Alexander’s philosophy and urged him to decide the outcome as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel's spells are unique and unique in the Wall of the Thunder, but not alone in the multiverse. On a road called Middle-earth, there is a white robe wizard who is skilled in swordsmanship and sticks. He is very good at all kinds of radiant and flaming spells. He used a similar spell to drive away the ghosts and their evil dragons. Mount. Siegel thought he had invented this spell, but in fact the twentieth scorpion captured the spark of wisdom and brought it to his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander forced the ghost to rush to Siegel, even if he died. For a time, the dark gray ghost group formed a fast-moving vortex, and behind the front cover, rushed to Siegel like a fire-flying moth. The young sergeant can only gather the light on the wand, and the sphere that spreads in all directions turns into a light beam, facing the ghost vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he was distracted and quietly applied high-level magic weapons on the dust of the stars. From the original flame burst, the bodyguard became a sacred and the enemy of the dead. Because there was a high-altitude weapon on the long sword, although it changed its effect after being used again, it could not be found if it was not noticed. Siegel knew that Alexander would have been able to recognize the effect of the spell before. If he did not observe the action of playing the higher magic weapon again, would he recognize it again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander did not pay attention, his gaze was attracted by positive energy. Did not see the display of high magic weapon spells. At the moment when Siegel raised his staff to fight the ghost, the lich moved. He used any door and instantly came to Sigel. Grab your hands to Siegel's chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to assimilate magical defenses is launched at the same time, so the protective spells on Siegel have no reaction to the claws of the Lich. The lich gave a triumphant laugh, and its claws had touched Siegel's clothes, and the negative energy and various curses were launched together! No living things can be spared under multiple curses and injuries, and even if they do not die immediately, they will be seriously injured. The ability to lose battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young sergeant seems to have no reaction at all, he has not even made any movements to squash and dodge. At the moment of negative energy bursts, Siegel turned himself into a form of embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sturdy scorpion with the energy of the elemental polymer is standing opposite the lich, and looking at the bare witch with a tattooed eyelid The demon skull and his azure soul fire. Siegel's embarrassing form used to rely on plasma energy. Now it relies on elemental polymers to maintain. Although it does not emit any negative energy, negative energy is still a therapeutic and reinforcing effect for him. As for those curses, how many of them can take effect on the Necromancer? It is meaningless to obstruct the body, destroy organs, influence the mind, and force change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a scepter that emits positive energy and the other hand holds the sword of the sacred and dead spirits. A full-fledged screaming force slams into the opposite lich. Masters have always guessed that Siegel has mastered a dead spirit transformation spell, but everyone believes that all spells will inevitably require mantras, gestures, and the most critical casting time. No one can imagine that he can change his form in an instant, and still use positive energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander has a lot of protective spells, but most of them are directed at elemental abilities. It is well known that Siegel is very powerful in the manipulation of elements, and his elemental corps is even more powerful. And in the city of Miele, in order to resist the attack of the fire rifle, Alexander changed most of the protection spells against the entity to specifically deal with long-range attacks. After all, this can improve the protection ability. Although Siegel has been carrying a long sword, the body structure of the lich has a natural resistance to the long sword. Alexander was so eager to fight. The sword was not considered a deadly threat at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred, long sword that smashed the enemy of the dead spirit hit the lich's shoulder under the attack of Siegel, cut the bones, directly Go deep into the ribs and get stuck there. Alexander wants to break free. Where will Siegel give him this opportunity! He turned the staff in the direction and concentrated the positive energy toward the lich. As for the ghosts in the sky, let them catch! Whether it's a negative energy claw strike or a disenchantment, relying on the squat form is low enough, and as long as the lich is wiped out, everything is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the radiance of positive energy rays, Alexander was assaulted with sulfuric acid. The bones become crisp and soft. Siegel made persistent efforts to pull the sword and draw the sword from the other side of the lich. Alexander's body turned into two quarters, and his head slammed into the ground and rolled three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich was lost, the ghost of heaven acted according to his own will, and began a crazy escape, away from the battlefield at the fastest speed. Siegel kicked the lower part of the lich to one side and shone with the light of the wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
