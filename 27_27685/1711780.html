			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A squid was exposed to the surface of the water, and the head with a beard swayed from side to side, trying to break the line in the mouth. It is nearly one meter long and is a strong guy. The black fish tail is struggling and squeaking, making the river splash. Jennifer was on the line and stood barefoot in the river flooding her knees. It is already autumn, and the river in the north is starting to get cold. However, Janet’s face is flushed and she is fighting hard and fighting with the big fish. The squid struggled hard, and the black fish back and white belly reappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kitten, be careful, don't be hurt by the fish line!" Siegel dropped the firewood, stepping on the slippery cobblestones, deep feet I walked over with a shallow foot. "Be careful," he said again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on and help, I caught a big fish." Janet was staggered by her shackles, and sometimes it was hard to tell who was Who is fishing? "It's a huge fish, the gods bless, we can have a meal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squid saw the shadow of the upstream, knowing that this is basically It is its last chance to escape. It sneaked into the water, stuck to the bottom of the river, and made an arc, trying to escape downstream. The tail rolled up the sediment at the bottom of the river, causing the line of sight to become cloudy, the line squeaking, and the blue smoke on the kitten's leather gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Help me pull, hurry up!" Janet shouted: "Siegel, your dragon leather gloves? Still not done?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, now is not the time to say this. The fishing line should be sent one by one, don't always slam it. Wait until the prey jumps out of the water, then "Strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand, understand. But I am worried that this line will break. This is my dragon skin, very strong."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It won't break, I am a good line of gnomes!" Siegel lowered his body and held Janet's arm, and the two worked together. The squid rushed for a while, rushing upwards, trying to observe the dynamics of the enemy. At this time, Siegel shouted: "Come on!" The two men worked together to get the line. The white water splashed in the sun, splashing on their faces, and it was cold and itchy. The squid was pulled out of the water, and the kitten hurried up and kicked the belly of the fish and kicked it on the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squid is still struggling, sweeping the pebbles everywhere. The kitten screamed and jumped over, picking up the stone and slamming it towards the fish. "How about a smoked squid? Unfortunately, there is no pot, or boiled fish soup will be better." Janet said with a big smile on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smoke is also very good." Siegel replied: "Oh, the weather is good today, the sky is clear, let's make some smoked fish fillets better. "When he finished, he took out his wand and read the spell. The firewood was immediately ignited and the flames burned. Then, under the influence of magic, several flat stones swayed from the soil, then floated over and circulated around the fire. The flames bake these small slate, and after a while they will become hot, smeared with some crushed coarse salt, as the bottom of the dried fish fillet, can also add the aroma of the grilled fish, can be described as two birds with one stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wild, smoked, salted meats are generally preserved for a long time and are the food that adventurers have. In places where hunting can be done, adventurers will work hard to make such a reserve grain for emergency use. Even though Siegel has the key space, the things inside do not deteriorate at all, but he and Janet still maintain such good habits as part of the self-discipline of adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, cooking things for me to do it is, you continue to view the book, try to master more spells." Janet two Hold the big fish in your hand and drag it back to the river. There, she cut the fish belly with a dragon tooth dagger, cleaned it with river water, and prepared for cooking. Siegel sat comfortably beside the campfire, opened the spell book, and studied while roasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming a magician is as hard as being a warrior. The spell is only part of the power of the wizard, just like the swordsmanship to the warrior, is the basic and the most important. In addition, biology is like shooting, pharmacy is riding, and monster control is like tactical command. These require a lot of time and effort to master, and there are basically no shortcuts. The superiority of Siegel’s superiority can only help him save a lot of effort in cursing and pharmacy, and other disciplines can only do watermilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So two people discussed along the way, Siegel should seize all the time to stop to learn, and then practice magic in the process of walking. So they left many traces of magical experiments along the way, ice, flame, acid erosion and sound waves exploding. Fortunately, the grasslands in the north have strong regenerative capacity, and when the pastures re-emerge next spring, everything will not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were all cautious along the way, so the speed of advancement was not fast. And they can look at the city wall mountains every day, it is difficult to detect the subtle changes every day, it is difficult to walk to judge the distance and distance. Before the departure, Siegel was still anxious about going to the northern fortress, but now he can sink his heart. After seeing the dragon and the death knight, he put away his pride and focused on improving his spell ability, and he was more cautious in making meritorious deeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke of the grilled fish rises, but it cannot leave the ground more than two meters. Siegel used magic to disturb the airflow, creating an extended fan that blows the smoke very much. This will ensure that they will not be discovered by distant enemies, and no matter how careful they are in the wild. After eating the fish today, they will also bury the fire and handle the wreckage. There are too many hunters on the prairie, and neither of them wants to be a prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck with them all along the way, travel to the north has become a bit like a spring tour. Janet is very happy every day, laughing and laughing. Even when Siegel was quietly sitting and reading a book, she would laugh out from time to time. Thanks to the blessing of this laughter, two people can find small animals along the way, such as stupid rabbits, lost goats and round voles. Janet doesn't know where to learn the craft, even in the absence of seasoning, every meal can still be done very delicious. Siegel only cooks seafood and is powerless for all kinds of beasts, so he enjoys food, enjoys leisure and enjoys the time in the grassland with great peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night alone is somewhat torturous. It's not that the temperature here will become chilly after the night, nor is it that the predators who are nocturnal are disturbing the dreams - these can be improved with magic. Only the same thing affected Siegel's sleep, that is Janet's body temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even through the sleeping bag, he can feel the breath from her, a mixture of grass, earth and free air, young atmosphere. Underneath, there is another kind of breath hidden, mixed with the faint smell of sulfur, roses and blood. Siegel understands that it is a temptation from the Janet magical lineage. As long as he closes his eyes, he can clearly depict her appearance: malt-colored skin, bright red full lips, burning like a flame. Short red hair, soft and creamy tail. This is not the appearance of Janet every day through her transformation into a look, but the appearance of her bloody soul. Siegel had only seen it once, but it was deeply imprinted in his mind and became more and more clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can even smell the scent from the red hair, and can touch her exquisite curve. Siegel understands that this is his illusion, the sensory illusion that his arrogant imagination brings to him, but he can't help but think about it. Even if the moonlight is clean and tidy, the vast and mysterious starry sky is completely and clearly presented in front of him. Even if the night wind is flowing and the water is flowing, the thick and solid land is infinitely extended underneath, whether beautiful or magnificent, no matter what. The scenery, but also can not cover her appearance in front of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people who see beauty will think that beauty is seduce him and tempted him. Siegel’s thoughts are straightforward. This is not a passive attraction, but a desire. ‘I want her,’ he said to himself, ‘just like hoping that food falls into the stomach sac, magic flows into the blood vessels, hoping she can enter her own soul – not to leave.’ It was difficult for Siegel to fall asleep in the evening, and it was necessary to count the number of Janet eyelashes by the fire before closing his eyes. Finally one night, he reached out and gently touched Janet’s sleeping face, slipping through the soft skin and furry hair. Her face was cold under the icy night, but his fingers were hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet blinked and looked at Siegel’s finger on his face and smiled slightly. "I want to hold you." Siegel decided to tell the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me think." Janet closed her eyes again. The long-term spying career has made her very careful, can not easily believe others, but also gave her another ability to judge whether others' words are sincere. Siegel is sincere, as he has always been, but can this make his arms safe and reliable? Janet is a little hesitant. She has always had a dream, a safe, warm and peaceful environment, where she can take off her mask and live simply. ‘I don’t like Siegel? Is he not a good person? If I am with him, will my dreams be realized? The idea that was raised at this time made Janet excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the dream is too long, it will be unreal, so Janet’s suspicious reason pulls her back. ‘Is it so simple? She ridiculed herself in inferiority. ‘Did you not see the girls who were deceived? Have you ever turned into a man to deceive and use them? What do you think of them compared to them, a demon? Before you are disheartened, how many injuries can you suffer, and how can your dreams withstand several times? ’<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
