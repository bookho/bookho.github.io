			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel had two days to "rest" before he officially attended the pre-war meeting with a military adviser, his first thing It was a trip back to the city of Miele. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not difficult to do. Using the high speed of the star number, he first came to Qiya City, and then used the trans-continental transmission array to return home. In fact, he can still do it faster, such as using the transmission array left by the Elven Saint, claiming that the world will return instantly. Of course, you can also use the plane projection to directly cast yourself near the city of Mier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After explaining what he was doing as a military general manager, he hurried back to the Star Fortress, which took less than a day. Such maneuvering shocked the world, and the lords of the kingdom of the stars understood the truth after receiving the line report: if the Marquis of Siegel wanted it, he could strike any lord in the starry kingdom within a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, His Majesty the King with a magical spaceship can do the same. Although the Royal Spacecraft never showed the same speed as the Heim's pilotship, everyone thought it was Evan's hidden power - no reason why the king was not as good as the lord. In fact, after hearing and hearing, Evan has been looking for Siegel to complain, forcing him to increase the speed of his spacecraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I spent 200 million gold coins." Siegel said: "When I was in the pre-meeting meeting, I asked the Minister of Finance, that is, the King can’t take it, don’t take it. Is money making people work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the topic is stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre-meeting meeting discussed other things, the big things in the whole kingdom, which is both familiar and unfamiliar to Siegel. In Heim's collar, he is the master of the territory. What he said is the final result. It is an order that must be executed. The entire territory is turning around his will. In the pre-meeting meeting, he was only a participant in the plan, and no one would move him because he was a sergeant or a marquis. In fact, Siegel is in trouble more than he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lords everywhere are still secretly armed with guns. The Merris family and the Legge family have already had two battles using muskets. I believe that soon There is a third.” The Duke of Carlyle stared at his beard and stared at Siegel with dissatisfied eyes. "Many lords have violated the restrictions on the king's guns, but they said that they learned from the royal marquis. Siegel, as a military adviser before the squad. Should you set an example and take the lead in strictly implementing the orders of the king? "No, that order is impossible to execute." Siegel’s cold and courteous answer: "According to the king’s order, as the Marquis, I can equip three." Hundreds of people's fire rifle. This number doesn't mean much to me. Heim's current number of soldiers equipped with the 56th submachine gun is about 7,000, and it is still increasing. I plan to replace all the soldiers with weapons. There will be about 20,000 firearms at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do! This is a blatant defense!" The Duke slammed the table, beard They are all upturned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved his hand. "My purpose is very simple. I want to know if I will give fire to all the soldiers of the lords under my hand. Rebellion and chaos." He looked at Evan's expression and knew that he had caused his thoughts, so he said: "If every knight has a gun, the situation and the situation of each knight are not big. It’s not power to have weapons. It’s the ability to make weapons. My Majesty’s advice is not to control any guns or guns. When only the royal family can have the power and power to make firearms, the lord only needs to buy it. Take the gold coins for exchange. The price does not need to be too high, so that the lords think it is convenient and cheaper to buy and research than the ones they spend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the Duke of Carlyle The anger came faster and disappeared faster, and he began to pinch his beard to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I commissioned the Federation to develop the structure of gunpowder and firearms, and made workshops with their own craftsmen. Your true key lies in these two points. Gunpowder The structure of the formula and the firearms, which are equivalent to the manufacture of bowstrings and arrows. I intend to give all these two techniques to my majesty, I wonder what kind of price you are willing to pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon sat up straight and helped the crown on his head. Then smiled and said to Siegel: "It seems that your treasure house is really empty, otherwise you will not hit the idea on my head. But, I am afraid you will not see the treasure of gold and silver, and you will be the name of the Duke. Not big. Why don't you tell me what you want, then let's talk about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Duke of Carlyle and Salk. Everyone else frowned slightly. Such a big thing that is related to national security is like doing business in the market. Can two people talk about it casually? They looked at the king and the Marquis and wondered what else they didn't know. Heim’s collar is alone, can have such a large autonomy, and how many unknown secret agreements? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why they think this is because they do not believe that there can be unreserved trust between the monarch and the minister. However, the two parties did not think about it. Siegel thinks that the autonomy of the lord is above all else. Evan thinks that Heim’s collar is entirely Siegel’s efforts, and even his father and ancestors have no strength, and they can’t get involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s plan is to permanently earn 10% of the profits from the net profit after giving the guns to the royal family. After being equipped with his own army, Heim’s flaming gun production capacity is seriously oversupplied, and only one or two workshops need to be reserved for upgrading. Singer couldn't do anything to blatantly sell weapons to other lords - secretly smuggling the plasma cross is another matter - so it is imperative to hand over the production line to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the young backbone craftsmen Siegel want to leave all, only older, hope to give the children a better birth by serving the royal family. Old craftsmen, if they want to leave, Siegel can let go. He still has a lot of projects to carry out. Without the support of artisans, it is not realistic to rely solely on the maker's golem. Moreover, the market facing the Stars and Royals is much larger than the Heim, and the net profit of 10% may be higher than all the benefits of the past. Not only is there no risk, but it can also enhance its reputation. The Minister of Finance, Samson, coughed and then whispered, "The Marquis of Siegel, let me take the liberty to ask, the whole workshop adds up. How much capacity can there be, and what is the cost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only answer your first question. If you take it over, it will be around 10,000 a year. However, there are a full set of recipes and drawings. You want to have a lot of production capacity, just need to expand. I don't know the cost. I don't have time to care about the specific figures. On the one hand, I am equipped myself. On the other hand, I have been making money. But I can be sure that it is cheaper than any version on the market."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I believe that Heim’s things are cheap. The use is famous throughout the country.” Architect Norris Barry always has eyes widened and has been angry, and he always speaks with a “hmm, oh,” throat sound, which is even more unfriendly: Many mines and workshops in the East Chinaland are cheaply produced by Heim. And the closure, the life of miners, porters and craftsmen has become unsettled. What do you think of this Marquis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan knocked the table with his fingers "Boss Norris, this is not something that should be discussed at the defensive meeting. The Heim lord is not responsible for what happened in another territory of another continent. This is a problem in the kingdom of the stars. What really should be solved is Me, so you should apologize to the Marquis of Siegel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Norris is also simply, immediately stood up and said "Marquis, sorry," Then sit down. Siegel smiled and counted the matter. In fact, he almost said "If the lords can't feed, Heim is willing to provide work." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes only a dozen seconds to think, and Siegel can understand that this sentence cannot be said. In Heim's collar, he can say this to the lords who swear allegiance to him, because they have a dominant relationship. But the king is still there, the king is still there, and it is more serious to open up things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly spit out a sigh of relief, reminding himself: In the pre-Olympic meeting, he is a military adviser, and it is best to do only this. What Heim is leading, the only thing he needs to report is the King’s Majesty. Others can’t influence themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a long history of how to deal with the firearms workshop, so I can handle it calmly, but I am not prepared for other things. This is not as good as magic, and sometimes you need to think more to answer. But do you really have to spend your time thinking like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former parliament has begun to discuss the situation of the royal family’s grain reserves this year, the trade with the elves and the harassment of the northern sea traffic lines by orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The orcs come year after year, especially at the beginning of the winter, there is nothing to discuss." Earl Todd said: "The navy is not vegetarian. What are you worried about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
