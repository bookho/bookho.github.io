			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the sea, Siegel has a familiar feeling. This swaying and swaying is the rhythm buried deep in his bones, and now re-interpreted into a movement. Unfortunately, the ocean of thought has no smell, and there are no marine fish under the waves of emotions, but this has already made Siegel feel relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea that has been condensed by past memories has now reached the deep waters. Looking down from the ship's side, the sea contains the power of magical fluctuations. If Siegel dares to dive from here, it is possible to find the spell that Wendy has learned to secret her unique technique. Her private alchemy formula has her spell chain structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are treasures in it, but there are also dangerous swirls and undercurrents. It takes a lot of effort to get deep dive. Siegel did not stop sailing, but continued to move deep into the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then came to the subconscious, considered by the Masters to be based on feelings rather than facts. The sea here constantly changes color, from deep black to completely transparent, and the cycle changes, like breathing like a pulse. This calm and waveless state is now based on Wendy's coma. If she is awake, then this area will be like a hot spring, the colors in the surge will stir together to form a colorful spectacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm formed by Knox spells is in this area, you can see a slender tornado whirlwind connecting up and down the sea and a red thunder cloud. The subconscious emotions were sucked up, slowly rising, and brought into the thunderclouds. The green plasma is smashing around, breaking down the sea water and igniting it. The red flame continued to rise and the thundercloud was enlarged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned, this red flame seemed to have known each other. Remember that in Kabuda, the ferocious gnome used a flame like a red lotus, which is the color. I have never thought about it before. The characteristics of everything as a fuel and the resistance energy conversion technology of the Buchs plasma are so similar. How could there be no connection between the two? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell can continually engulf the energy around and gradually grow in the loop. Only in the possessive space of thinking can the concept be transformed into a structured entity; at the same time, thanks to the fact that in a Master's mind, only the superb caster has enough knowledge to understand and reflect the secret of the spell. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the thunderstorm in front of you. Siegel also knows a type of spell that can circulate itself, which is the illusion of gnome. He took this opportunity to observe the similarities and differences between the two. The Knox Commonwealth spell has some characteristics of gnome illusion, but it is not obvious. However, the basis of the plasma technology of Nexus must be the illusion of the gnome. This point can be confirmed by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countless worlds and long periods of time, there will be countless times of starry sky, producing a breakthrough that far exceeds the skill level of the time. Whether the magic is powerful and whether the spell is advanced is whether it can gather and continue these wonderful moments of a flash of light. Except for the circular array. Nexus's magical array miniaturization technology also comes from a certain aura, and it is also extremely excellent. Siegel always wanted to find an opportunity to master it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Thunder was shot from the tornado and shot down next to the ship. Siegel retracted his thoughts, focused on it, and thought about solutions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red cloud formed by the "euthanasia" spell constantly releases a pleasant signal, so the sea around the tornado is extremely calm and can be called no waves. If this area continues to expand, the entire sea area will lose its vitality. People will die. So what emotions are opposite to happiness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked around and hoped to find clues and materials from Wendy’s mind. He saw a large smudge in the depths of the ocean, like a thick oil floating on the water. He drove the boat carefully and leaned over to see the terrible pictures of countless undead battles and twists and tears. Fortunately, Wendy is still in a coma, so it is very calm, the scene of the undead rushing to swallow the soul is still, and there is no scream of terrible mourning or pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be afraid of fear, people can live. Just as a person wants to judge whether they are in a dream or not, they all slap on their faces and must rely on the feeling of pain. It has never been related to whether it is happy or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel recited the spell and took the oil to the direction of the tornado. This requires great strength and is very consuming. He wants to focus his whole heart on the fear of the undead, and to attract it a little. To move it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feeling of comfort is coming from the feet, just like the whole sea is not the cold sea, but the warm flesh and blood. Siegel trembled all over, waking up from the dream of almost falling. Only a little bit will be assimilated here, deep into the soul and completely integrated into the sea, become an integral part of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s impossible to complete the work in the current state. Siegel concentrates and transforms himself into a form of shackles. His soul fragments also made the same change in Wendy's mind. For a time, the wind was rising and the waves were turbulent, and the rafts were up and down at the bottom of the wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black viscous oil is like a life, swooping toward Siegel, wanting to wrap him in the sea. In the hands of the mage, the magic wand is transformed, and the evil spell is protected, and the black fear consciousness is fixed. Then he began to sing the spell of Knox spells and continued to present the gnome's circulatory tactics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this meditation-like environment, the creation of magical items does not require physical materials, everything is between dreams and reality. As long as you can understand, the rest is the focus of the visionary, can you maintain your concentration before you finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Siegel is already familiar with the gnome runes, and the core of the element and the energy lens are made by him. Soon, the wind and waves gradually stopped, and a black tornado gradually formed. From the fear of the dead spirit, the purest will to survive is formed, forming a whirlwind opposite to the "euthanasia" spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel patiently adjusts the direction of the two spell whirlwinds and brings them closer. The two cyclones act similarly but in opposite nature, and they cancel each other out in Siegel's calculations. In order to complete his plan, Siegel could not let the two whirlwinds meet now. If there is no euthanasia, his hypnosis and the suggestion of establishing hypnosis are meaningless, so the offsetting process in Wendy's mind will take some time to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear is alive, and happiness makes people die. Siegel looks at the two whirlwinds in front of him, and he has a clear understanding in his heart. If it is not always in various dangerous situations, if it is not one after another to face the challenges of life and death, he will not be able to gain knowledge and experience, nor will he be able to achieve the current strength. He finally left a blessing in the depths of Wendy's sea of ​​consciousness, and then swung the raft back to the shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pinches the sand and builds a sand castle for the most gem. In this castle, the feeling of passion and pleasure is the most indulgent memory that has been exchanged for a whole night of exhaustion. Although it is fake, at least it can make Wendy happy in a dream time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the whirlwind of the "safe" in the depths of the ocean dissipates, the memory attached to the diamond will disappear. When Wendy tries to recall, she feels that everything is like a slapstick adventure, and it is also true. Perhaps after many years, there will be some good memory debris left here, but one day it will be flooded by the tidal water that has come up and turned into sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found his latest shell on the entire beach. It was a black one with a shell on the head. This is the shock of Wendy when Siegel turned. This is useless, and Siegel crushed it by hand and turned it into dust. The ocean of consciousness began to make a soft sound of the sea, indicating that it is now sleeping and not a coma, and the time to leave is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he crouched down and patted the beach here, then left a word with his fingers, "I hope you can find a beautiful diamond again." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he read the spell and left Wendy’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Wendy’s room, Siegel moved her to the bed and covered her with a quilt. He waved his wand and made the room messy, and everything was laid out indiscriminately. The quilt and sheets were torn off and the pieces were scattered. Then he took out the pastry and other food from the space bag and presented the red wine in the glass. He portrayed a simple thermostat on the table, the fire element slowly releasing heat, so that the food and red wine on the plate did not cool. Finally, he left a note with the words: "I am sorry to leave, I have a mission. Be careful, the wizards are not lacking in the strong." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed Wendy's room with a protective spell, and Siegel went straight to the top of the hub. Speaking the secret language, the door of the room is opened for him, and the control core of the entire Master Tower is inside the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel held his wand and carefully walked in. The hub room is only ten feet wide, hanging from the center of the ceiling with a hanging ball inlaid with crystal balls. Siegel presents a weird and ridiculous reflection on the crystal ball. The control lines of the magic array converge on the crystal ball, but the real core is hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
