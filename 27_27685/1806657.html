For the king to settle the rebel party is definitely the first priority, while at the same time to appease the mood of the lords and nobles, so as not to spread panic among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of fun in the recent days, and many lords came to Wang to ask for help from the king. They also sent the youngest sons in the family to the royal family as a waiter training, and also brought smaller children to the palace, hoping to become friends of the little prince. Evan is overwhelmed, but on the surface is still very pleased to accept all kinds of flattery and gifts, and then say a few words of encouragement. Siegel was also subjected to this kind of harassment, and the old aristocrats of the Eastern Continent also began to re-examine this rapidly rising upstart. Especially when I heard that the Marquis of Siegel established a forward base in the west of the Walled Mountain Range, facing the innocent land of the Lord, it is hoped that the second or third of his family will be able to get to the starting point for the purpose of obtaining The benefits of the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Shelley persuaded Siegel that he could no longer continue to expand the territory of the Territory within ten years, and that there would be no gains, and it would cause dissatisfaction of His Majesty the King. . For young people who think of the development of Heim, it is best to throw them all into the School of Magic. Heim is not short of the warrior, but there is always a lack of caster, and Siegel nods and agrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two weeks, the intelligence chief wiki came back. He didn’t wait for Siegel to find him. Instead, he first found Siegel. It can be seen from the frowning brow that he is full of doubts, which is rare for the intelligence chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Marquis, as the most trusted sergeant of His Majesty, what do you think of the end of the world and the wall of the storm?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few people can connect these two things together, and they are all aware of the world outside this wall. Although Siegel told Evan about the world of the goblin world, he never said that the wall of the storm is a harbinger of world destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King’s Majesty must not have the feeling of “ruling a country that is about to be destroyed”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the intelligence manager asked, it means that this event will eventually be reported to Evan. Siegel said a few words in a very brief way, and briefly saw the situation of the wall of the storm, and then saw that the face of the wiki is getting worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen a lot of lords recently, and some people are asking me about this." Wiki said: "They are strange, but the essence and you I haven’t heard much about it. I’m worried that someone is deliberately spreading the news.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Can you know where the news started?” Geer thought about it. Still decided to ask more specific: "Mage Association, Elf or Dwarf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wiki starts to squeeze the knuckles of your own knuckles. . "I am still checking, but in addition to the Masters Association and the Elf who will spread such news? The Kingdom's stargazing station has been useless for a long time. The dwarves have been underground like a mole, and only the wizard and the elf will look at the sky. He approached Siegel and lowered his voice and asked: "The Marquis, is this news true or false?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't find a rebuttal The reason, so..." Siegel nodded to the wiki: "Let's go and find the King's Majesty to report it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the King's Study On the road and waiting for the moment to meet. Siegel has been pondering the intention of the news. The wall of the storm is the wall of destruction. After expanding into the New World, it began to shrink and enter the process of destroying the world. Although there have been so many rumors so far, it is conceivable that there will be new news after the continuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wall of Storm has been around for so many years, and all the people before have been ignorant of this matter. On the one hand, no one cares and thinks. After all, all in one's eyes is his world. How can you see the difference and abnormality? After all, people who can travel to other worlds are only a few, and after they return, they choose not to mention for various reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is said, who can stop this thing? Master William once said this to Siegel, but his temperament would not save the world on his shoulders. Each god has a purpose to conceal this fact. Even to some extent help to cover this up. Siegel also heard from the Green Dragon that the god of magic and knowledge used his power to cover the world in order to better study the scorpion, thus obscuring and preventing the world's attention and research on the wall of the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them waited outside the meeting, and had their own servants to bring food and drinks. The wiki picked a few of the sausages into his mouth and swallowed twice as soon as he chewed it. This is a high-speed eating method, and it is not easy to make sounds and leak the taste when the mouth is closed. Professional spies will adopt this method when they need to lurk for a long time. The wiki has become a habit, even if it is usually eaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of porcelain smashed from the next door. There is still a noise in the vagueness. Siegel frowned, and he heard that it was the voice of love. What is wrong with this, why are the kings and couples quarreling? He turned his attention to the wiki and hoped to get an answer from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wiki’s eyes shunned Siegel’s gaze. But he found that Siegel had been staring at him, and he sighed and said: "The Marquis, you need to persuade your sister. After all, the King is a King, and there will naturally be a woman. In this respect, She should understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Siegel blinked. Ai Meng is not his real sister, he can't speak at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while. Evan's face came over gloomyly, and after seeing Siegel and the wiki, he licked his face, which was a little relieved. He complained to Siegel: "I didn't see her so much jealous before, but there was a woman who was arrogant and rushed to kiss, and nothing happened."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wiki lowered his head and pretended not to hear anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel screamed and screamed, he couldn’t say "how can an ordinary woman be able to slam in the hands of the king?" I hope this is a trivial matter that will soon pass and will not affect the lives of the king and queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the mood of His Majesty is very important, it is still necessary to report on the affairs of the Kingdom as soon as possible. The wiki has said the original situation, and the professional knowledge is supplemented by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the attitude of each temple?" Evan looked at the wiki and hoped he could give himself some good news. However, things have not yet developed to that point, and the temple has not commented on this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wikipedia: "Your Majesty, do you want to send people to stop the spread of this news? This kind of destructive prophecy is not from the poet, the merchant, the donkey The well-known farmer said it, and they can be arrested on the charge of spreading rumors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe in the power of the kingdom, but this can only be comfortable for a while. Then I will have more trouble.” Siegel shook his head and said what he thought: “The temple will definitely come out in the end. After all, the pastor needs to answer the doubts of the believers. Unless the royal family has the ability to order All temples lie, or at least keep silent. Otherwise, the news will spread. Even the best morning temple, because of the doctrine, can't help in covering up the news. Mother of the earth is more independent. It is not bad to stop the Temple of Death and the Temple of War. So blocking this thing will only damage the image of the royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is somewhat hesitant, "image? What is the use of the image? As long as people believe in the end of the world, then who will abide by the law? Not only will the desperate people get more, but the lords may have a heart. When the kingdom is chaotic, what is the use of the image?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When everything is confusing, only hope can reunite the people." Siegel scratched his head: "A good person can make people feel hope."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is not the theory of Siegel, but the big prophet of Lear. In Leer's view, the two forces of eternal interaction in the world are order and chaos. He also used chaos to destroy Siegel's plan for the goblin. After that, Siegel has been thinking about the lack of doing what he is doing, considering how to make a more comprehensive and fault-tolerant plan. As long as there is hope, people will not be completely crazy. This has more power than believing in order or goodness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more difficult and difficult the situation is, the greater the power of hope, because hopefully can take all the hard and difficult negative forces for their own use. After listening to Siegel's words, Evan immediately understood what he meant. In this respect, the starry royal family as the ruler, there is no shortage of precedents in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand, don't push for this news, but don't deliberately stop it." Evan pointed out to the wiki: "You can guide, say the end of the world." It was said by the Masters Association to avoid pointing the finger at the royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
