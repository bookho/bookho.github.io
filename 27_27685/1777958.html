			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the ** division (now the "Lemon **") Alexander said, don't move the Sanfeng Pagoda. But in any case, the entire deep-water city knows that Siegel has circled the entire New World, took the army to the deep water city, passed through the layers of barriers, and entered the Masters Federation. No one would think that he would return empty-handed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after thinking for a while, Siegel started a search in the Three Peaks Tower. The lion’s advice was just because he was jealous, and he didn’t want the “Mr. Union” to fall into the hands of others – Siegel thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power tower is the place where the lamp god manages, that is, the past magic goods store. Here are the most sturdy spell protection enchantments in the three magic towers that can be preserved under the impact of elemental surges. However, this does not mean that the magic items inside can have the same result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the scrolls are all fired, and the spell wand is close behind. They melt down in high concentrations of elemental energy without any sense of salvation. Magic weapons and armor are good things, but they are too big. According to the guidance of the spirit, Siegel selects the strongest pieces of the light, and tries to stuff it into the space bag, ready to be rewarded as a reward to the generals who have achieved great success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most valuable of all magical equipment is the magic ring, which is small and powerful. Siegel untied the remaining protective spells in the storeroom and found ten still intact rings. By detecting magic, he can only know that these magic rings have a strong aura, but the specific functions and usages can only be known using the identification item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most pity is actually the staff, they can be used to cast spells like the spell wand, so they are also affected by the surge of elements. All the staff were damaged and there was no way to restore it, but magic materials could also be recycled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took some small things, especially the various space bags, he didn’t have one, he took six and then straight The area of ​​alchemy and spell materials. Until this time, he had a feeling of enjoying victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he filled six space bags. Siegel noticed that Alexander was standing behind him and was looking at him with a "dead face." The Lich ** teacher said with a low voice and no emotion: "Is it enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost." Siegel looked at it. He then changed his mind: "Enough. The cost is recovered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Siegel was driven out of the Sanfeng Pagoda by Alexander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Siegel can be sure that Alexander is indeed a stingy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two major events of the Mage Federation and the Knox Association were temporarily forgotten, Siegel felt relaxed. Breathing the refreshing air of the morning and feeling the tranquil atmosphere around him, he walked slowly. It's like walking in your own garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heam’s soldiers have been on guard, which has left people around their focus on rebuilding their homes. Originally, some people who came to find ruins nearby yesterday could not see one today. The neighbors couldn’t move away. They looked up at the soldiers from time to time while they were working, seemingly fearing their swords and bows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation across the street is very different: as long as you can't see the soldiers led by Heim, the residents will reorganize from the ruins with an optimistic smile. home. There are sometimes pleasant songs coming from the broken wall, and there are children playing and playing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a city that just ended the war, this reaction was very weird, but fortunately, the soldiers in Heim did not have the same situation. Siegel estimates that this may be the power of the Knox Commonwealth's spell power, which remains in the city under the influence of the elf's elemental surge. Residents without magic resistance have been recruited. Then emotionally began to become weird. But this is all speculation, and not all mind spells are products of the Knox Association? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe go to the dock to see if the new ship will have the same problem. Thinking of this, Siegel left Mana in charge of the camp, and took eight guards to the dock area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port was anchored with more than a dozen ships, but Siegel saw at a glance that those were nothing but empty ships. They are shaking on the sea like drunken drunks, and no one wants to take care of them. Algae and shellfish have climbed up near the ship's waterline, only to show that the captains of these ships are negligent in management, and the sailors are lazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Segal stopped a young man passing by and asked him about the two ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult. This is the merchant ship of the Lesley family. They brought food, cattle and sheep from Tieshui Town, and sold them to everyone with cheap purchases. It’s a good heart.” The young man looked polite and obviously educated, but somehow he was wearing ragged clothes. The body is not clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there no other family fleet?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, I don't know. It is said that at the beginning of the war, many ships ran out, but most of them were sunk by the elves. The man said that the wizard's mage floated in the air and picked up huge waves to knock over the big ship. Many family fleets sank into the sea, and only a few lucky ones were able to escape. But for now, only a few of the Lesley family The ship came back from the old mainland, and the rest had no news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf can hide an army of war ancient trees in the ghost fog swamp, but it is impossible Changed to the battleship. They can only use the seafarer by the master, and this situation will certainly not last long. When the elves leave from Deepwater, the sea will become smooth and shipping will increase. However, before the defeat of the elves, Deepwater City will have a hard time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So how do you know the masked lords?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it all killed by the prairie savage?" The man replied: "The rich areas were looted, and the masked lords were missing. Now it is new autonomy." The council is managing the city much better than it used to be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really optimistic." Siegel exclaimed, then asked: "Where Can I find the person in charge of the Lesley family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can take you there." The man glanced at the bustling people on the dock looking for a job, then Said to Siegel: "But I hope that adults can see some rewards for my good service."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several silver coins are enough for him to bring Siegel came to the residence of the Lesley family. This is a beautiful and exquisite three-story building with no courtyard, no fountains, no fences and fences, only a red wooden door separating the inside and outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulling the brass bell next to the door, after the crisp ringing, there was a female voice inside: "Wait a minute, then come to open the door."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After opening the door, Siegel found that this was still a person he had seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Dana Lesley?" The Master found the name from his memory. "Is the boat of the Lesley family on the dock originally your home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Siegel Baron!" Dana blinked and frowned. The check was wrinkled. Then let the door open: "The Lord, please come in, I will call my husband."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is not large, the decoration is very simple. Just like the average small businessman's house. There are no gold-plated utensils, and there are no handicrafts. The wall decoration is only a few portrait oil paintings, and in the most prominent position is a large portrait of Dennis and his wife and children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people who have three merchant ships should not have such a wealth. It seems that Lesleys understand how to protect themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired Dennis walked down from the second floor and stretched out his hand to Siegel. He wore a pale yellow shirt and blue straight trousers. Looks confident and confident. There are two bodyguards behind him, only the simplest inlaid leather and long sword. However, Siegel had seen them wearing a full body armor against the trolls, and would not admit their mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dennis’s hand enthusiastically held the mage’s extended hand: “It’s a surprise to see you again. I didn’t thank you for your help last time. This time, I finally got a chance." He turned to his wife and said, "Dear, come out with good wine, I want to entertain you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The war has just ended "Everything is simple." Siegel said: "Is it better to taste what I bring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell?" Dennis said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be polite with me, I came in from outside the city with enough supplies. Instead, you have been trapped in the city for a long time?"
