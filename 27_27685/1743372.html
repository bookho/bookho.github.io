			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete with the castle foundation, and the spell: "Element Rune Guardian", this is its final name. In order to protect Siegel, the dwarves and gnomes concealed the contributions he made and then took over two jobs: the dwarves gained exclusive rights to make their core instruments, while the gnomes monopolized the sale and follow-up of the item. maintenance. This is two long-term gains, and Siegel can be divided into half of any part of the proceeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell is not perfect enough, and there are a number of shortcomings: when more than four elemental guards come together, they interfere with each other, causing extreme delays in action. There is not much difference between patients with sputum. These guards can't wear armor and pick up weapons, because the metal that is worn outside the body will affect its core work efficiency, causing it to shrink in size and reduce its power. And if the guards are still stationary, there is no loss, but after the fierce battle, each year they need to be supplemented with the same metal as the core of the instrument, which in turn creates a cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, only two people can use the element Rune Guardian: Master and Runner. But this last point has become the most advantageous advantage: they happen to be the richest two groups of people on the old and new continents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not difficult to disassemble this technology, but it is not so easy to imitate or continue research on this basis. It is necessary to have both the dwarf and the mages to test the updated version of this spell, otherwise all the research is just a guess, it is a castle that cannot be verified. Together with Ding Bao, Siegel and Ding Bao developed the "Imaginary Deception Version Element Rune Guardian" that can be used independently for the dwarf as a gift to work more closely with Mora. Elinte believes that this will make the three major families of the dwarf form a very good relationship with Siegel, and will also make the Dwarf Temple and the Runemasters Association make a good impression on Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without your help, it is difficult for us to continue to go from this spell." Taklin said very sincerely: "If one day you solve it." Don't forget the troubles of other major elements, don't forget our Morah's."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and their warm embrace, agree. But the dwarf Runchist whispered in his ear to remind: "The earth element guard is okay, if it is other elements of guard, it will make you a target here. You must be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at Taklin with some surprise, in fact he was telling his own concerns. Just as Siegel mines mines with earth elements, the shaped earth element guards can easily flatten the stone walls. The sturdy castle - as long as it has not been enchanted by magic or runes - is like a sand statue on the beach, just a toy that can easily be destroyed by the surge. Maybe the lords didn't think about this layer at first, just treating them as strong bodyguards. But one day, they will understand that water element guards can block the routes between the old and new continents. No ship can face such an enemy; it will understand that the fire element guard is the most terrible enemy, the flesh and blood, the wood cloth are only potential fuels; as for the gas element guard, both speed and mobility make them far The most dangerous assassin in the original - there is no place in the castle where you can sleep, there is no front or back line on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you let people know that Siegel might have such an army, out of fear. They will do everything in their power to kill the Heim collar and destroy the Master Lord. So this spell is called "Siegel's Rune Element Guard", but it does not reflect Siegel's name in the Dwarf's version, which is the greatest protection for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you research it, don't tell anyone." Taklin said: "Unless you have the confidence to defeat all enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you include the scorpion of Mora?" Siegel frowned and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the top of the Mora will never be your enemy." Taklin smiled and replied: "The world is very big, the city wall is just a small Small corner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does this mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a mage, not Taklin patted Siegel's shoulder. "Unlike us, it's just a miner in the cave. If you want to. The sky and the ocean are not your limits, right?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irenet came over and laughed and said, "What are you whispering? Let me listen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am blessing him from victory to victory." Taklin opened the subject and said: "Today is the official foundation for our Siegel's Secret City. This is an important moment, don't let We have delayed the time of the host."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a more special one. This is the first time a human to open a rune column. Even in the long history of the dwarves, this is extremely rare treatment. However, after experiencing the development cooperation of the Rune Element Guard, the Rune Masters believe that Siegel has this qualification and has the corresponding ability. They also just stole a lazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the dwarf can participate in the ceremony, even Janet is not allowed to come to the scene. Siegel talks to everyone in dwarf language and expresses his embarrassment and gratitude to the patron saint of the dwarf. Later, he triggered the power of Runezhu, and used the word "running the earth" as the core of the castle's spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irenet finished a eulogy and the ceremony ended. The dwarves clashed. Then start to build the main structure of the castle, and record the structural description of all runes on the rune pillar. Siegel is free and he has a lot to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, there are already three ransoms, or goods of comparable ransom value. Can you start to let go?" Fazak asked. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, we always have words and trust." Siegel replied: "You must ensure that the death of the caravan guards is paid in full and on time. Then, the payment is paid to Ding Bao. The rest of the money is put in the warehouse except for a part of the reward soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what happened to the Uther family?" Siegel asked. "Their children have died under our hands." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not yet heard." Fazak frowned. He also knows that this is something that is not normal. A nobleman should not react. Moreover, Siegel has written this letter to the Viscount Uther in the capacity of the lord, and he is sincere and asks for forgiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should I listen to Janet’s advice and use lie to ease the situation on both sides?" Siegel thought, still shook his head: "But I It is now impossible to accept a robber who is a knight who fought bravely with a bandit. Whether it is heroic or not, at least Mana is not a bandit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You are an upright person." Fitzk said: "I followed you for this reason. But the lord's wife said something. It is all for you, not a mistake."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that she is right, it is also good for me. But I..." Siegel scratched his hair: "Forget it, don't say this thing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a few good news. You will be happy with your mood." Fazak took a smile, but his yellow teeth destroyed the whole feel. “With the help of the dwarves, our mill was built and there is a new source of taxation from now on. By convention, one in ten of the things processed from the mill is turned over to the lord. This will greatly improve the castle. Food reserves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a practice on land?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, And one tenth is already the lowest standard among the various lords.” Fazak continued: “The two blacksmith shops brought from Deepwater City have been merged to provide armor and weapons for the Guard, as well as to repair the people’s Iron pots and farm tools, this is also a long-term income."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I value the gold mine more in terms of income. So without affecting the blacksmith, try to It is a welfare.” Siegel said: “I am a mage, you don’t have to build steel armor, you can save at least a lot of good iron, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. There is one more thing that will make you happy. Heim’s collar finally has a decent wine Using dwarf utensils and local oatmeal, I finally succeeded in brewing ale, and it was still a light brown top. At least I have tasted it after I tasted it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel can imagine that the dwarf will finally be able to enjoy his happiness after more than a month. He loves ale instead of red wine. The lord and the one-eyed old man marched side by side, slowly passing through the construction site and walking in the busy construction site of the city of Mier. It is always a vibrant look, even in the dark, it is still full of labor figures. Janet had just agreed with Ding Bao on the style of cloth and carpet. After seeing Siegel, he followed up and took his hand and marched forward together. After an initial busy and an easy victory, the local residents have a sense of trust in the Siegel Lord. The Orcs also began to integrate into the local life, and everything is moving in the right direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
