			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna, can you help me?" Siegel found the female elf after a course on the body of the avatar. "I can't go up to four layers now. Can you help me get a magic item: a light mirror."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it for?" Rubbing his eyes, asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A powerful crystal mirror that opens the door to the outside world, and can also be used as a flat crystal ball for communication." Siegel explained: "I think It can be used to connect five layers of predictive crystal balls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my points are not enough, temporarily less than four layers." Anna shook her head: "I They are used to learn spells and expand the knowledge of the plane. I am very embarrassed. You can find the gnome Keke to help you. I think he must have the qualification of the fourth floor. The fourth layer is very attractive to him. "No?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Also, he especially likes to make all kinds of magical equipment, and he must score four points on the score." Siegel and Anna say goodbye, then Go straight to find a gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mirror has spent more than 3,000 points on Siegel, and the Gnomes helped him bring things from the fourth floor. This is a very powerful magic item that can be explored across the plane, displaying the pattern in the mirror like a crystal ball, reading the characters in the pattern, showing the secrets of the people in the mirror once a week, and directly opening the difference. The door of the world goes to the mirror to reflect the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of local rules, the door to the outside world cannot be opened, but several other functions are not affected. After Siegel got the mirror, he immediately used it to contact the Elf Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Elven War, the two have not seen each other again. Siegel became his Marquis Marquis, and Leah continued to stay in the Elven Forest after several ups and downs, managing some of the Rangers. Because the entire mission of occupying Heim’s collar was not completed during the entire war, and even letting Siegel’s army go north, it affected the battle of Deepwater City, and the elf failed to occupy the city. Leah endured the blame of the Elf Prophet (that is, the ruling group), and did not get rid of the charges and accusations until the Elf Saint came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She no longer leaves the Elf Forest. Adventure life has already said goodbye to her. In addition to leading the Ranger patrol boundary and training the Elf recruits, she spent all her time praying and praying for the god who saved her elves. Get peace through piety. When Siegel contacted her with a light mirror, she was meditating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can see Leah, but her movements become very slow, and the voice is very low, like a meaningless whimper. Look at the confusing expression on the face of the elf. She doesn't seem to understand what Siegel is saying. The ** division immediately thought of his own time and space turbulence effect. It seems that the time flow rate of the Magic Academy is indeed different from the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no ability to oscillate time and space, Siegel can not normally contact the outside world. After pulling his time flow rate to be similar to Leah, Siegel was finally able to pass a message of a word. "Check the situation of the last elf prophecy teacher, birth and death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he closed the aura and started the shock Leave quickly before the rebound. There are too many doubts in Anna, and Siegel must confirm or completely deny his own guess before he can proceed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel needs to wait a while before he can contact Elijah, and this time the squad’s actions are stalled. Everyone already has the fourth floor of the right to pass. Then it was stuck on the fourth floor. Since Siegel has already told everyone about the dangers of the fifth-tier crystal ball, now those who can see the crystal ball have not dared to touch it. Perhaps over time, patience will gradually disappear, and the warning to Siegel will gradually become indifferent, and strong curiosity will eventually prevail. Siegel knows that day will come, just as all organizations will have a day of demise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem concentrates on viewing the map of the outer domain on the third floor, and the half dragon and dwarf tutor magic spells on the second floor. The mutual aid group now only has Siegel, Anna and Ke Ke often together to discuss how to break the spell in the lamp god. Siegel already knows the method, secretly, so he understands. The elves and gnomes are very close to the ultimate success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give, Siegel, what I gave you." One day, Elf Anna took a necklace. Put it in the hands of Siegel: "This is the talisman of the six-armed god god stealth. It should be able to help you on the fourth floor. I studied the sensory circle of the six-armed god and found a way of deception. I wear it. I tried it on the phone and it was completely inaudible to speak to the god of the lamp. Even a punch was all right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course I don't mind, you should be careful." Anna said with a smile: "Speaking of this, you haven't found out that the temper of the worm is not good yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He always does this, for a while, everyone is careful." Siegel made a gesture of spreading his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have the ability to defeat him?" Anna put away her smile, her eyes full of pitiful worries. "He is very cold-blooded, don't know when he will start killing. If that happens, will you protect me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I Will protect you." Siegel nodded and should bear the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that happens, perhaps the least protection is Anna. She has already survived the gap between the orc saints and the sacred sacred people, and has sufficient knowledge and full preparation for these two dangerous people, and does not need to use Siegel. But what can Siegel say at this time, is it that "I already doubt you, think that you are actually hiding the true strength, deceiving everyone with false faces, I will not protect you"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Anna has the ability to discern lies, Siegel can only promise to protect her in the manner and reason of the knightly spirit, just like protecting all women in danger Same as children. Anna frowned a little, but she still showed a happy smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To what extent is your current progress, can you solve the problem of the god of lights?" Anna asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is not easy to say, and Siegel is thinking about how to say it. At this moment, the gnome Ke Ke came in from the outside of the classroom and said with a snoring of a wheelchair: "I understand, I know how to solve the problem of the lamp god safely!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; His thoughts are slower, but they are correct. On the one hand, we must make full use of the self-recovery ability of the lamp god, on the other hand, we must isolate the communication between the lights gods during operation. The gnome lists a long list with detailed steps. The only problem that is more difficult to solve is the integration problem. Everyone needs to gather together and bring the lights god together. Try to find the way to operate the remaining six lights at the same time. This requires a huge amount of points, and everyone needs to do their best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel carefully examined the steps of the gnome, slammed the thigh and said: "Good thinking, this method is no problem, I can also operate it! And let I go back and estimate the time and cost points needed to avoid becoming a negative number as quickly as I did last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, OK, I finally saw it. "The gnome yawned a big yawn, with tears in his eyes: "Siegel, the things behind you are handed over to me, I have to go to rest first."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheelchair turned in the direction and Siegel raised his hand. He wants to keep the gnomes away, especially don't let Chanem know about it. Anna held down his arm. "This is really good news! No matter how many points you need, everyone will be willing to give it to you. I will inform them, don't use it!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, Siegel, it's up to you!" Both said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded with a smile and could only accept it, but the trouble was only known to him. At present, if you want to restore the situation of the fifth and sixth floors, you must rely on the help of the lamp god, but the lamp god is not so simple. Siegel found a hidden spell from the charm of the lamp god. As long as all the lights are back to normal, the School of Magic will inform the previous generation of magic gods, and the recruitment of new students has begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This function originally existed in the lamp god, is one of the most basic and core functions of the lamp god, is the purpose and foundation of his existence, can not be removed . Although I have accepted so many students, this feature has not been triggered. Lear is very clever, causing contradictory situations in the School of Magic: ordinary learning is fine, but if you want to go to the top of the magic tower, you need the help of the lamp god, you need to unlock the charm of the lamp god. Once the spell is unwrapped, it turns out that someone has the will and ability to find the fire, and Lear will get the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Lear can ensure the safety of the fire even if he does not manage the School of Magic. He is far more familiar with other people than here, and he is confident that he will gain an advantage in the battle for the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As early as Siegel learned that the time flow of the School of Magic was slower than the outside world, he already had this suspicion. He came in half a day later than Chanem, and it caused a seven-year time difference. If Lear got the news from some sort of way (at that time, he didn't start dismantling the lamp god), he would come over again and he would have to spend a long time. How does he guarantee the safety of magical power during this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
