			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southern Coalition forces set up a so-called wall on the outskirts of the siege camp, a pile of obstacles that are ten feet high and arranged in a crescent shape, composed of various sundries : Wicker boxes for woodworking tools, large drums for storing nails, stacked logs, sawn boards, and bark and sawdust that are packed up in large bundles of sacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A row of hardened tip piles form a simple fence, placed on the periphery of the barrier wall, better than nothing. They think that Heim will not leave the castle to fight, why should he spend too much effort to organize a solid position? In addition, the leadership of the coalition forces is very scattered, and there is no strong supervision. The action of the militia’s laziness is also closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original busy camp was cleared, and the unfinished trebuchets were removed, leaving a large open space. In the open space, Sir Brown is directing his "Seven Armies" to lay out the site of worship. They set up the table, put the marinated lamb, smoked chicken and cooked grains, put a few cans of vegetable oil under the table, and seal the mouth with a good wax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the presence of the god of warriors, don’t carry weapons easily, it’s best to put them on the ground and put them at your feet. This kind of rule is very strange, but it is not difficult for everyone to accept. It is said that the Leicester family has always done this, but everyone is seeing it for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" Sir Brown yelled at the table and yelled at the three helpers: "Take the brazier a little farther, don't get so close to the jar, what should I do with the rope? Enclose the trebuchet, don't let people get close. Yes! Just wrap the rope there, won't you hold the stick? It's stupid! Come on, you peasant peasant, hurry up!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tricks were originally great, and now the voice is much higher than when it was in the camp. In the wild, a big trick is very important. He needs to overwhelm the noise of the human beings, the noise of the sword, and the pain of the wounded soldiers. The lords use their lungs more to show the sense of existence, then the flag, and then their sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, they are busy setting up the scene. The onlookers were bored after watching it for a while, and they left. Especially when it is time to eat, I am afraid that there will be only porridge when I go late. The audience here is going all the way. The lords did not care more about the situation here, and the militia did not have the corresponding knowledge, so they did not find the abnormality of the entire camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sacred emblem of the god of warriors, let alone altars and statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prayer ceremony was originally fake. The Baron Brown naturally did not dare to set up the idol. The god of warriors likes heroic battles, conspiracy and betrayal are in the spirit of blasphemy. He tried to restrain himself from looking at the direction of the city of Mith, because he was afraid that his concerns about his brother would be revealed to his face. When Patrick presented this plan to him, the shock in his heart was indescribable. How could a steady and patient younger brother be so ambitious? But for the family. This idea is a wonderful opportunity, the timing is fleeting, he is too hesitant to allow him. So at a later meeting, he put forward his own views and took over the siege camp in the name of religious ceremonies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was originally the control area of ​​the Viscount of Felton, but after the prince burned to the ashes, most of the knights were indifferent. Their honours were basically lost by the master, and they stayed in the camp to make jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is in the legend that Felton is afraid to be killed for a long time, so these knights who have vowed to protect him are actually supposed to be revenge. The goal is to sell. The knights of other families will not mention this in person, but their gaze still makes the Felton family knight unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way. The siege camp was completely undefended under the arrangement of the Baron Brown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky gradually became dim, and the brazier was lit up on the battlefield. Although there are only a handful of seven or eight, it is a bit troublesome for the army going out of town. Sir Brown is somewhat worried. If there are no soldiers coming in the city of Mire, they can't expose themselves. They are the first to burn the siege equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, hundreds of spectators gathered at the scene to watch curiously, wanting to know the details of the ceremony of the Leicester family. So without the holy emblem, Sir Brown slyly fell to the table. Muttered in the mouth, waiting silently. The knight of his majesty also had a kind of learning, neatly arranged behind him, waiting quietly for orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time there has been no change. I can't see any scenes of spiritual manifestation. So dull and unpleasant, so everyone left. When the sky was completely dark, it was empty except for a few patrolling soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not expect a hand to stop on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't panic, I have arrived as scheduled." Siegel's figure gradually emerged. At first it seemed to be a twisted reflection in the ripples of the lake, and it gradually became clear. He wore Felton's armor outside the Master's robe and has activated the protection of ordinary weapons, protective arrows and shields. These spells give the armor a very faint glow, but there is not enough spell knowledge to tell the exact effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only you alone?" Sir Brown stood on his knees and tried to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Currently. I am alone enough to ignite these siege devices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is absolutely impossible." Brown said: "If only you are here, how can I play with the knights? Is it besieging you or going to the fire? If there is a force, the number does not need too much, we can Pretend to fight and expand the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand what you mean." Siegel interrupted his words: "My mission is to ignite the trebuchet, I The troops are of other use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There you quiet Look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stands on the edge of the open space, in front of the completed trebuchet. These huge guys, who are more than ten meters high, used a lot of wood, cowhide, polished bones and good steel nails. Their mission was to throw huge stones to the walls of the city. Although the dwarf runes are very strong, they can't defend all attacks without limit. Maybe a few days later, the wall will be damaged, causing a little disintegration - Felton thinks this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are about to turn into firewood, and there’s no one to fight for it anymore: Siegel’s arms are closed, and the eyes scream at the spell of the fire element. Feeling the power of magic in the chest is gradually surging. He then opened his eyes, waved his wand, and began to draw magic runes out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fireball can only cause an explosion and a small range of burning. If it is used to set fire, it is a better choice to display a fire wall. Siegel continues to gather elements of fire, and he feels that his body's affinity for this element is rising, and now it can be controlled with just one thought. The burning flame is like an extension of his body. He even has the confidence that he will not be injured when he enters the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark green ray came from the shelter and flew to Siegel. The mage is focusing on his own magic, so he just has a feeling of guilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of Serra’s mouth is a cruel smile. This scroll of death is very expensive. She spent a lot of effort to exchange it from other mages. . For a wizard with a relatively weak constitution. It's hard to survive the damage of this spell. As long as Siegel died, Heim’s collar did not pose much threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fancied that Siegel was hit by a spell, her body twitched to the ground, her urine was flowing, her dignity was dead, and her heart was full of excitement. The situation in the South has been greatly improved with the help of "Felton". The coalition has already formed, and it is not difficult to support a leader. And Serra thought, since Felton has died, credit can be his own. Take advantage of the wealth of the striped mountains. The construction of the red-red minaret will not be too difficult, and you will eventually be able to build up your skills in exchange for the opportunity to learn advanced spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green rays rushed to Siegel, but were blocked by a transparent barrier and failed to reach their destination. The air was twisted for a while, and a shield emblem with a complicated pattern appeared out of thin air. The green rays hit the shield, and the entangled petals entangled and quickly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the half-elf mage appeared in midair, and he stared coldly at the party. At the same time, the hand waved forward, and a bright flash broke out in the direction of his finger, only to hear behind the overlapping obstacles, and a scream was heard. "My eyes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disciples of Master Idis have also lifted the invisible state by casting spells, and they used any door to reach the location where the flash broke. . Four people cooperated with each other to block the spells she might use to escape. Regardless of the means of transmission, gasification, and migration, there are corresponding mages responsible for suppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the advent of several mages, Siegel’s army also showed its original form. It turned out that he had invited six mages to join forces and covered Mana's cavalry with a stealth array. Cover them out of the gate of the castle. The riders carefully circumvented the trenches and quietly avoided the guards. They continued to the siege camp and did not alarm anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
