			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights took Siegel from the north to leave the town, along the roadside fence wall, before a low wooden house. Www/xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtyard is slightly muddy, but this is to better grow a variety of flowers: for example, chrysanthemums, rose bushes, low raspberries And scorpion. A cottage full of morning glory vines is situated in the courtyard. Although there are no flowers open now, it still looks cute and delicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is cooking in the house, and a smoke rises from the simple wooden chimney. Siegel sniffed, seemingly a cake scent, or a certain faction. The owner of this place is obviously very particular about life, adding nectar to the food, there is a flavor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jie Daren, you wait a moment, I will go to see if my sister is convenient." Regis smiled and left Siegel outside the fence. Go over yourself. He went straight to the gate and opened the door directly like the owner here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of exclaiming female voice in the room, accompanied by the broken sound of the plate falling on the ground. After a while, Regis poked his head out. "Adult, no problem, come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel immediately after the boy entered the yard Set out to arrange a simple magic array. He threw two dwarf runesstones into the north and south corners of the house, and took out a crystal column and threw it on the roof. Time is in a hurry, it is too late to arrange a complete defensive array, but it can still be done by avoiding others' detection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Regis called him, Siegel had just used his feet to draw simple lines on the floor. He smiled into the room, a young girl in a denim apron stood on the sidelines. She has chestnut-yellow hair and a long pony tail behind her head. The bare arms were thin and weak, and the pair of cotton gloves used for heat insulation was exaggerated. It was very funny to wear on her hands. This is just a young girl in her teens who used to be too small for her servants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am willing to work for adults," the girl’s voice looked clear and sultry, "What do adults say?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am hungry, bring the food up first, then take some wine." Siegel pulled a chair and put the two swords on his back. Place it on the side of the table. "I will pay for food and accommodation, you don't have to worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s body shook and quickly glanced at Regis, the latter I gave her a look. Siegel pretended not to see. Send the girl to dinner. Regis was about to retire, but was stopped by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still early, I invite you to eat pie. It smells good, don’t you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, this is really my lucky day." Regis sat across from Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plate of apples came up. Siegel can cover it with a slap, apparently this is the food the little girl prepared for herself. She also took the spicy cheese and sour sauer on the shelf and poured a glass of rose petal with Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still have some food here, so I will prepare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel grabs Lived her and let her sit down. "Don't be busy, I don't come to eat, drink, sleep," Siegel said. "I just have something to ask Regis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy A glimpse, but pretending to be calm: "Adult, what do you want to know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What God do you believe?" Siegels Supporting the sword of the sword, rubbing back and forth: "I don't think it will be the god of murder. Are you an assassin or a spy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights The eyes kept looking at the epee, and the heavy weapon was wrapped in a thick scabbard and could not be pulled out quickly. After hearing the words of the murder god, he began to get up and tried to leave here before the Siegel epee was unsheathed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is miscalculated. Siegel's action on the hilt was only to attract his attention, to cover the other hand cast under the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of blue light flashed, Regis lost the ability to move the body, just left the stool of the butt and sat down again, making a bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't yell, sit quietly," Siegel said. "I have always been interested in the church of the murder god. I don't know how an organization that relies on horror and killing works. Kid, tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Regis wants to control his mouth, but it is useless. He kept talking, and even the most secret parts of his heart were also said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bring terror to the enemy and unite yourself with order." Siegel nodded. "It makes sense. Is this why you set up the Solidarity?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Righs nodded. This time is not the role of a spell. It is a sincere agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Using Solidarity to expand the size of believers, the temple of murder can be turned from underground to the ground, and it is a smart person who can come up with this idea." Siegel asked: "Where are the servants of the murder gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Living in Shaq Manor," Regis wants to use I took my tongue, but I couldn’t move it under my neck. He went on to say, “You want to enter Shaq Manor and only become the core of the Solidarity. After a while, you will come here and invite you to join the Solidarity. Yours So good, you will soon become the core."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned. Dorn will come? He went out for a walk and was a temporary one. Regis did not leave his sight except for entering the wooden house in advance. How did this guy named Dorn know that he was here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Tell me about this person called Dorn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is mine My brother-in-law, who has been taking care of my sister very carefully - another sister - even if she is too sick to work, she does not dislike her. Later, after my sister died, he was very depressed until he was heavy in the temple of the murder god. Faith, have the power of life. The Solidarity is the idea of ​​my brother-in-law, and the whole Kaibu town becomes a united whole, and everyone can live a happy life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Siegel turned his eyes to the little girl and asked her, "Are you happy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl bit her lower lip and barely clicked nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be afraid, let me prepare some food for me. After a while, when Dorn came over, there was only one small pie and a few cheeses that were too shabby." Siegel opened the space bag and took out a washed squid and half a ham. "I see you have some mushrooms and vegetables here, take it and do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl couldn’t help but leave and forcefully mention what Siegel had given her. Screaming and screaming to the kitchen on the other side of the house. Siegel made a snap and a little bit of glowing dust fell, leaving a brilliant trajectory in Regis's eyes. His eyes are blurred, and the pupils continue to zoom in and out. The line of sight has been chasing Siegel's fingertip movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another spells got into the mind of Regis, some of them immediately worked, and some lurked. Siegel thought for a moment and put a fist on his lips and said a word. Then cast a spell to pass this message to Yao En and Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan has changed, and Siegel will not put too much clue. A pastor of the murder god finally caught it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is busy in the kitchen, and Regis is still staring at the ceiling, and Siegel seizes this rare opportunity to continue to cast spells. Information, plans, instructions. One mantra flew out of the cabin and rushed to the key point he had previously buried. Like Heim’s flag, Siegel is a squid with nine tentacles. When he starts to be in the middle of dispatch, he can really play the full strength of Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Siegel received the defensive staff and the dust of the epee together in the key space, taking two spares from the space bag. arms. Things that are easy to reveal, such as obsidian daggers, wands, and various scrolls, are also hidden—he is now a magician with some spells. That's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible servant was summoned and quickly put away the runestone and crystal columns outside the house. Siegel took out a four-sided energy polymer—it had a full turn larger than it was when it was made—and then used a wand to light it. An elemental ripple spreads around, eliminating the traces left by casting spells around the entire log house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
