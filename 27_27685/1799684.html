			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When building the "Lucky Soss" according to his own vision, there is a book that gives Siegel a great help, that is "Magic Construction Research." The work that Siegel found in the Dragon Cave Fortress was read after he became a teacher, and new meanings and explanations were discovered. Some things that were thought to be delusional and ill-conceived now seem to be not impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book points out that letting the living creatures of the living creatures become independent individuals is something that only the gods can do. However, the book also mentions some experiments that enhance the construction of bio-intelligence and allow them to generate self-awareness. “Construction Consciousness” is the concept put forward in this book, and it also studies how to “unify thinking”. This method can solve the control problem of constructing biological clusters and make them work like bee colonies or ant colonies. It is no wonder that Knox will want this book together. If you apply the ideas inside to the peace scene, can you sleep and control a large population? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Goblin Network of the Goblin has the same effect, but it is not as obvious as the Trancy. If you can release the tranquillity array through the Star God network, then destroying the goblin is not difficult. Unfortunately, the difference between Goblin's technique and Siegel's magic is too serious. If you want to make the two systems compatible with each other, I am afraid that only the gods can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master is like this, whenever you come into contact with new knowledge, you will start an infinite association. This association gives the spell an infinite possibility, but it still needs to be down to earth in actual work. In order to be able to disguise his magical spaceship as an "outer planet visitor", at least not to let the goblin see the style of the wall of the thunder wall, Siegel himself "invented" a language, and even prepared a detailed history for it. , human and cultural background. The entire Soss is made in this new language and artistic style, and every detail is “exotic culture”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only used to deceive the goblin, but even to deceive the people of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this goal, the construction of the magic spacecraft was completely handed over to the maker's golem, and the federation did not participate in the assembly except for the parts. In the deep underground of Mire City, in the hollow excavated by the earth element rune guard, a spacecraft with a front tip and a back wide, whether from the front, the top or the side, is slowly forming. In this spaceship. Siegel loaded the Peruvian nuclear, energy focusing lens, elemental rune array, virtual electromagnetic gun, electromagnetic killer spider, and then he also installed the tranquillity and anger array of the Knox Association. As a warship, there is no plan to be merciful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t have the resources of the New World and the prosperity of Heim, don’t think about such a large-scale project. Originally thought that the production line of the magical workshop in the Rift Valley area has been very good. When it was time to make the "Sos", Siegel found all kinds of deficiencies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, this is not a struggle. King Avon fulfilled his commitment and did his best to support the development of the Federation. Especially after the establishment of the transcontinental transmission array, transportation became extremely simple. At the same time, there is also information transfer. What is missing from Siegel here, I can know it in three days. Moreover, in recent months, the kingdom of stars, mainly the Masters Association, has rapidly increased its possession of fine gold. There are rumors that the Association of Masters and the Elf are making a lot of fine gold golems. Although Evan did not say it clearly, he also handed over a large amount of fine gold to Siegel through the transmission array. Presumably, the royal family can also divide a large piece of cake in the Jingjin Golem project. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also caused the Federation’s response. After being stimulated by a large amount of fine gold, the Security Council met again to discuss whether to expand the size of the wall channel. In the Siegel report, the other end of the wall barrier is uninhabited ice and snow, and the probability of being discovered is very low. If the base can be established secretly, can the resources of the earth not be able to supplement the lack of the federation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, more than half of the members opposed the proposal. Siegel even vetoed it one vote. But this kind of sign has already come out, and it will be hard to say what it will develop in the future. At present, it is only fine gold, and no one knows what mineral resources will be discovered. The association has always been very secret, and the federation has almost no information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time goes by, everyone is trying to grow and strive to have more cards. On this day, the dragon girl, who had been away from Heim’s collar for a long time, finally came back. She pushed the door of the restaurant, and the smell of the table full of food did not make her crazy - in the past she never approached the kitchen and restaurant, lest her stomach become hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she left, she took the "Dragon Basket" prepared by Siegel, but when she came back, she was empty. "You have to help me. Siegel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isaac wants to rush to hug the dragon girl. However, his mother used his gaze to stop and continued to sit at the table to eat according to etiquette. “Why can Dad not finish eating the dishes?” The little guy felt unfair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this question Siegel also wants to know, but there is still a dragon girl waiting for him. Capricorn looks anxious, but not as anxious as it is dangerous. From the dragon in her body, a lot of emotional signals are emitted, they are mixed together, even Siegel can not be specifically distinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I returned to the Ring of Longshan. I used the dragon's meditation pool to recall the childhood. I..." Capricorn paused and seemed to be organizing the language: "I used to live with my father for a while when I was a child. It was about two years, or when I was born or a young dragon. If my magical ability is improved now, it is impossible to recall the ambiguity with the help of the meditation pool. Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any clue that can be used to locate your father's location?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes. My father lives with a sorcerer and lives in his castle. The name of the Master is Lynch von Dehran."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If you have a name, you can try to locate him. But the ** division will protect yourself with a mind shield. The success rate is not very high. Did you still remember your father's name this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no full name, otherwise I have already been positioned through the blood. Before I threw it into the world, my father washed away some of my memory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, you only remember the name Lynch?" After pondering, I suddenly thought of something. He took out the "Magic Decoration Research", the author's name is Lynch von De Chilan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Capricorn, what is the race of the mage who lives with your father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Human." When the Dragon Girl said it, she wanted to understand. The dragon girl is now nearly seven hundred years old, and humans have long since died. She fell to the ground at once. I burst into tears: "No wonder, no wonder those old dragons don't help me! I am stupid, I am stupid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longwei exudes in the invisible, even The elemental environment has changed. Siegel silently bound the dragon curse. Stolenly suppressed Long Wei. If he does not do this, he will not be in danger of himself. Half of the ordinary people in the entire castle will become fools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the binding spell does not mean a certain insurance, even if only the partial fragments inside are not used, the dragons are likely to find out. "Don't cry. You can't find it. At least with his full name, I still have his work here. I don't have to locate the mage himself. It is also good to locate him. For example, the castle is not Lynch." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss thought, this idea is not impossible. She renewed her spirits, detailed the description of the castle, and used the illusion to deliver images to deepen the impression of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all that can be said, Siegel began to prepare for positioning. He estimated the difficulty of this spell, so he applied to the federation to use the power of the mana pool. Looking for Lynch is not only for the Dragon Girl, but also for Siegel and the Federation. Capricorn is very sure that Lynch is a ** division. He has at least one book adapted to the rules of the thunder wall plane, but his name is no longer recorded by any mage organization. In other words, Lynch could not be a member of the Masters Association, and the Federation might find information on high-level spells from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing about this, the Federation not only opened the Magic Tower spaceship, but also sent the newly-built New Secret. In this way, Siegel can collectively mobilize the strength of Heim's collar, the Lucky Sos, the Federation's magical spaceship, and the spells in the mana pool as reserves. There may be countless defensive spells on the opposite side, and there may be targeted improvements based on the characteristics of this positioning, so you must do your best. Just when there is only one chance to cast a spell, it will be a success if it is unsuccessful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel uses the entire book "The Study of Magical Decoration" as a method of casting, and also to improve the success rate of the spell. For three days in a row, he meditated in the environment of Ning Shenxiang and adjusted his mental state to the best. Heim’s collar entered the alert early. No one is allowed to be close to the position of Siegel's caster. Only Siegel and the Dragon Girl will be present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn has contributed a liter of blood and is placed in the gold cup for blood vessel positioning. She also took out all the things she had collected and left her with her father. Capricorn did not mention too much tension, and the mouth had been biting the elemental lollipop, and one foot was on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
