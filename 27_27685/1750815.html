			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is also changing his face at this time, nodded hard. He swayed his fingers, untied his long rope, and then cast an attacking spell. The halo of the cockroaches covered the two people, and from a distance they became blurred and unreal. This spell does not have the same resistance to long-range attacks as the protective arrows, but the advantage is that it can be comprehensively faced with various situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two slowed down the horse and held the weapon in their hands. Leah took the bow and took it in her hand, then stood on the saddle. Despite the shaking of the horse, the elf is as erect as a javelin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be the taste from the northwest." Lia judged the wind, then looked up and looked in that direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is a branch road, the narrow road can only pass two rounds of braking, only the villagers and tourists will walk from such a road. Two people marched along the road and saw the red stone on the left side of the rock pile, sparsely scattered. The blood has not completely condensed, and the dots are connected into a long line, extending all the way to the forest by the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves have long since fallen, the blades of grass have withered in the winter, so there is not much shelter in the woods. However, these trees grow on the hills and are covered by the terrain. The other side of the hills is not within the horizon of the two. Siegel waved his wand, cast a spell, summoned two flamehounds, and ordered them to rush into the woods to find enemies. Elijah has always been paying attention to the direction in which the hound is heading, for fear that someone will lie behind the trunk and kill them by surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hound stepped through the hay, leaving a little burnt smoke. They enter the woods and jump between the trunks and the dry shrubs. There is no movement in the woods and it seems that there is no ambush. Leah gave Siegel a look, and the two went along the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they walked into the woods, the Fire Hound found the target. Next to a fallen tree, two corpses that were shackled and blossomed were lying there. The scene was bloody and tragic, and the thick bloody smell was emitted from here. A large block of dark red bloodstains soaked the surrounding ground, and the iron-clad shield with the nightingale and the double sword was shattered. The chief culprit of all this was an orc tomahawk. It is now inserted above the shield wreck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two bodies, one is a human warrior wearing a chain armor, because the head is smashed by the trunk, it has not been able to distinguish the appearance and age. He had two hands to seize the wide waist of another body - this is a troll. His upper body has been flattened by trees and lost his fighting ability. But the powerful regenerative physique left him still alive, the muscles squirming, trying to get out of the trunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf looked at Siegel and said, "This is for you. I don't have to work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel ordered the flame hound to go up and bite the trolline, where the fire was burned, the wound could not be regenerated. A flame hound rushed up, and the other suddenly sounded a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the direction of the hound, there was a scream of screaming and horses. It seems that the other side of the woods is still going on. Leaving the flame hound to clean up the body on the ground, the two walked forward quickly and quickly climbed to the top of the hill. Looking down from here, on the deserted open space of the forest, a melee is going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight men wearing brown-black half-length armor, or holding a giant sword. Or equipped with a chain and a shield, are surrounded by eight soldiers in the center. They were all wounded, and the white air exhaled by the exhaustion formed a white mist in the air. Behind the walls of their bodies, there is a pair of middle-aged men and women. The man's brown hair was cluttered to his face, and with the cover of blood stains, he could not see the look. His leg was hurt, the blood stained the blue pants, and the woman was tearing off her white dress to bandage him. The knights faced a very unfavorable situation, but they always shouldered their shoulders and concentrated on the enemy in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten cannibals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These trolls are fully armed. The black armor wraps the regenerative body, and the thick arm with the orc tomahawk can fully exploit the flaws and cruelty of this weapon. From time to time, they used this long-handled weapon to beat the giant sword of the opposite knight and made a sound of crisp sound. Also, by the way, the physical strength of the opponent is consumed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real attack is the trolls on the periphery. Its block head is obviously larger than the same type, so you can't find the right armor at all. You can only wear a chain armor as a scarf. The troll was not wielding an axe, but holding a pole with a hoe on top. He remembered the words, summoned a small hammer with a bloody glow on his head, and slammed into the besieged knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpses lying on the ground around the ground, there are trolls, but more belong to humans. They have several armor - brown-black half-body, but most of them are civilians in casual clothes. Siegel also saw three women's bodies wearing skirts. A few spoiled trolls around the ground, the hands and feet broke, and the blood flowed to the ground. But they are not completely dead, and the wounds on their bodies are constantly recovering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save people!" Lia and Siegel said in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wields his wand and uses the core of the Rune Elemental Guard to summon the energy of the Fire Element, and removes his anger and killings, condensing in the fire element Among them, make it more violent and dangerous. In this way, he can continue to think calmly and concentrate on preparing the next spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leah’s attack is much simpler and clearer, with a bow and archery, the target is the trolline with a scorpion rod. The sprite thorns into the waist where it has no chain protection. The blood is splashing, and the spells in the hands of the trolls fail. He looked at the hills wickedly and found the two men who came to the reinforcements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are reinforcements! Everyone insists!" The brown-haired man being bandaged shouted: "Don't give up, don't panic, victory belongs to us!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slayer of the slayer, the scepter swayed in the air, shouting and ordered the soldiers to rush forward. They would rather let the swordsman's weapon smash on the flesh and blood, and also change their lives to kill the enemy as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The besieged people suddenly became more pressured, and they did not dare to smear their weapons easily, lest the cards could not be pulled out in the trolls’ bones. Will lose the final defensive power. Therefore, the swordsmen try to use the method of blocking. Fight the enemy's weapons and then push the enemy constantly to prevent them from crossing the line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s fire elements rushed to the trolls, and the bright red light illumined the entire battlefield. Attracted the attention of the pastor. For the natural fear of the flame, let them drop the elemental guard as the most dangerous enemy. The priest called out the name of God and condensed the power of the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master heard his prayers, and it became known that the Tsinger’s priest believed in the murder god. This is a god condensed from cruelty, blood and conspiracy. The only purpose is to gain a sense of accomplishment from the destruction of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the murder god is one of the most terrible of all pastors. It is said that their hands can easily destroy the flame of life, and their breathing can engulf the soul of the living. In addition, they are also proficient in the control of the Necromancer, and even the undead made by the Masters are often taken away by them – just a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire element swooped over to the priest, and the curse of the troll was finished. A purple-red light shines from the top of the cane and hangs over the element of fire. Siegel feels that the core of the instrument is still attracting elements, but the function of condensing into elemental warriors is blocked. The fire element turned into a scattered flame, and it was only a few times in the air and was dispelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of the ruler of gold and gems falls on the stone floor, making a crisp sound. The slayer of the trolls is completely unmoved. His next spell is brewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lia bends the archery and goes straight to the priest to brow. The armored warrior, who had been prepared by the side, opened the arrow with an axe and roared at Siegel. But it has not been stunned, still clinging to the pastor, and watching the enemy against it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows that he has lost the advantage of the raid, then in the next battle, the confrontation will be very disadvantageous. However, as a mage, he has his own way. Put your hand on Elf's body and wave the wand with the other hand to mobilize the magical energy around. He said softly: "Relax. Don't try to resist magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cloud of fire in the air, which is the incineration summoned by the priest of the murder god. Inflammation. He sang praises for the beauty of killing, and excitedly sang the prestige of God. A bolt of lightning blew from the clouds of fire, and then it was a purple-red pillar of fire descending from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage smiled slightly. His spell is also finished. I saw that he and the elf's body exude a milky white glow, and suddenly disappeared out of thin air. The pillar of fire was hit hard, but it only burned a piece of burnt black on the open ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell is called an arbitrary gate and is a spell that transmits over a short range of sight. Siegel moved to the side of the battlefield with Elf Lia, hiding behind the trees. They regained their cover and once again had the advantage of a sneak attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
