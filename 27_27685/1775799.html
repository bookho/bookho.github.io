			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heam’s leading troops have already entered the Black Blood Castle and are ready to fight for the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I evacuated here was lightly on the road, a lot of materials were still in the warehouse, the grievances were not orcs, no interest in destruction, so they were all cheap. Heim collar. The soldiers cut off the iron locks on the door, moved out the boxes of arrows and spears, picked them up and put them on the wooden poles to become arrows and javelins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lack of maintenance, some of the metal has rusted, but it can be used to make other things after it has melted. They found a lot of molds in the blacksmith shop, they can make iron shovel, so they did not hesitate to start a large number of production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Blood Castle During the last orc war, in order to avoid exposing the whereabouts of Prince Aaron, he did not fully engage in the battle, so a lot of supplies remained. In Siegel's plan, the Black Blood Castle is too far away from Heim's collar. He won't occupy it here, and he has no idea of ​​moving things back and forth. So he was not at all polite and decided to use all the reserves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole castle is busy, no one can be idle. Affected by the Forbidden Array and the Wraith Cemetery, the Earth Element Guard can only work normally in the Black Blood Castle. Once you leave, you will soon lose power. After Siegel’s observation, it was discovered that the brick wall of the Black Blood Castle was reinforced by the dwarf runes, and the forbidden runes here left it empty, which is a rare magical place in the wall mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a great benefit for Siegel’s magical advantage, but the difficulty of building a mountain fortifications is even greater. Relying on manpower to move stones, it is very difficult to build a new wall. It is difficult to finish before the orcs arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oil, wood, fire." Siegel simply ordered the order: "casting the wall." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case, just in case, he sent a team of forty infantry to advance east along the old path that had been destroyed. The Black Blood Castle is the most east of the current castle defense chain, but there are no other castles and passages in the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc War has gone through again and again, and many castles have been destroyed or abandoned. Whenever such a thing happens, the dwarves and humans will block the passage with the collapsed mountains, making it harder for the orcs to climb over the walled mountains. This time, the army led by Heim came from the Mid-Levels Road and then proceeded along the defensive chain. At least you can be sure that there is no channel made by Wraith in the west of Black Blood Castle. According to the truth, this kind of road that relies on the cost of sacrifice will not create more than one, but it will not be wrong to explore eastward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc’s leading force is approaching, and the composition of its arms can be seen from the telescope. The wolf cavalry took the lead. As a pioneer and a scout, go ahead, then go on a faster goblin and a big goblin. They all went lightly, driving away the beasts and scattered villages on the wilderness, and used the fire to burn a road suitable for marching by large forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black smoke can be seen far away, it seems that these orcs have no intention of concealing their intentions. Think back and think about it. It is not very meaningful to hide the whereabouts on this wasteland: all the castles of the defensive chain are on the south side of the walled mountain range, and there is no detection method for the north side except for several lookouts. The purpose of the castle, including the Black Blood Castle, was to kill the enemies that crossed the mountains and prevent them from returning with the spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send a letter and tell the lords on the defensive chain." Siegel said to the commander: "The notice behind Mana and Mike, speed up, Come to the Black Blood Castle as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any friend who arrives faster than the orc. The army of the Jackdaw Tribe came to the foot of the mountain and took the camp. Their horses are useless in the walled mountains, but they can kill the fish that slipped through the mountains. The giant Kerry came to the Black Blood Castle with more than 300 of the most elite warriors who were good at bows and arrows, and carrying large and small boxes. Joined the team of the defending city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Kerry hugged each other and the two could finally fight side by side. The orcs are the common enemy of all races within the Walled Mountains. If they are allowed to enter the "Sheep", the casualties will be difficult to calculate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the Black Blood Castle." Siegel took a careful tour with Kerry: "Now there is no lord here, it is an empty city. You are cold. Are the crow tribes interested?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is a passage leading to the north of the Walled Mountain Range, and that is a vast grassland.” Siegel squeezed his chin and blinked his eyes: “Although not as good as the grassland within the mountains. But you can grow pasture and feed more. The only disadvantage is that there are orcs who breed very quickly and always cause trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The orcs are very annoying. The wolf knights also have some Tricky, but in front of the unified prairie people, it is not a trouble that cannot be solved.” Kerry looked at Siegel and patted him on the shoulder: “Messella said, I listen to you on the battlefield, but also Ask your plan. The land in the north is very good. But the jackdaw tribe has not yet fully controlled the grassland. What do you want a castle to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgot, you are the knight of the Star Kingdom." Siegel patted Kerry's chest and reminded him: "As long as you actually occupy the castle and have the power to stop the orcs, there is reason to let the kingdom of the stars It seals you as a territory, and there is no such good machine in the future. My Heim collar is too far away from here. It is impossible to have this place. Why don't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I listen to you anyway." Will not suffer." Kerry scratched his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't get cheap and sell it." Siegel said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf cavalry is getting closer, but they are not the first to come. One night, Siegel was still resting in the lord's room of the Black Blood Castle, and was awakened by the squeaking knock on the door. The voice was eager and scattered, and the people who knocked on the door were obviously very flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, an urgent report!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, the invisible servant opened The door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the messenger trembled because of fatigue, "Dragon!" He said: "The two dragons are flying here!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can there be a knight on the back of the dragon?" Siegel stood up and looked very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter nodded and pressed against the chest so that the heart of the wild jump could calm down. Siegel arranged twelve people to rotate every day at the highest point of the Wraith cemetery to investigate and use telescopes to understand the movements of the orc army. If you find that the enemy is about to arrive, you will immediately report it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time staying on the black channel formed by the grievances is a great burden on the body, not to mention the rushing down from the mountains. The messenger can now speak. The complete words are not easy. "Don't worry. I have to deal with it." Siegel comforted and handed him the elf biscuits and light-flavored ale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two or three swallows of food and ale, the messenger took a few breaths and slowly stated things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today morning, Kester was responsible for using the telescope to observe the situation in the distance and then found several black spots flying in the sky. By noon, it was already Can roughly distinguish between the wings and the tail. We found two dragons, one black and one white. The black one is bigger. And it flies faster. There is something on the back of the dragon, and no one can use the dragon. To ship the goods, so we think it must be a knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at the burning candles in the room, and nearly half of the thick wax oil length. "It took only half a day to rush down the mountain. You are a brave person. Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger did not expect to be thanked by the lord. I don’t know what face to use for a while, only the inner excitement. He did it according to the training requirements of the Orc, and sent the information as quickly as possible. Stepping on the muddy black channel along the way, the residual energy of the grievances makes his body not as obedient as usual, and his legs and feet will always be soft. So often it will roll over. Fortunately, this layer of clay is soft, so that it did not break the bone on the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So the dragon that first flew over is black?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Lord Lord." The messenger added after thinking about it: "If it is all the way, I think they will be able to reach the mountains tomorrow. We have agreed At least before the night, I will send another message, that is, arrive at dawn. There are no clouds during the day, and the moonlight is bright tonight. I think there may be two or three waves of messengers starting at night with more detailed information."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are doing very well, all of them are heroes!" Siegel said: "If there is nothing else, go to rest. Keep up the spirit and prepare to fight!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
