			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only after contact that the gray fog is not composed of magic, but divine power. This layer of power is simple and rude, and there is only one rule: it prohibits the transmission of links from foreign planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clash of spells unfolds in silence, with a few to dozens of spell exchanges between one thought. The Federation’s mana pool reserves have been rapidly reduced, and even the Peruvian nuclear core has begun to appear to be incapable. The distance from Siegel to the flight fortress is too far, and the plane rules greatly reduce the efficiency of the spell. It was like Siegel holding a 30-meter long pole and using it to clamp a line and trying to get into the pinhole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A majestic voice spans an endless distance and passes straight to the starting point of the spell. A kind of information mixed with countless languages, but it can be understood by the recipient without any difficulty: "Private territory, no entry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Cracks were formed on the standing ground, and the impact even echoed underground. "Whether it is a user of arcane or magic, or a communication between psionic and subspace, continuing to peek will bring you a catastrophe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The sound was also heard by Capricorn, and the power contained in it was stronger than Longwei, causing her to roll painfully on the ground. She shouted again, "Father! Father!" The tears of blood flowed out of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel went straight from the paradise of excitement, and the powerful magical energy slammed back and fixed him all. He became the focus of the entire spell, and all the pressure was on him. If it weren't for the tough bones of the sturdy, this energy had already squashed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I can’t hold it!" Siegel squeezed a word from his teeth: "The opposite is the power of the rule of the kingdom, that damn Lynch is probably a god!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Capricorn only hesitated for a second and began to recite curses. Her whole body glows with iridescence, and the brightness continues to increase, just like a small sun burning. In just two seconds, she turned herself into a pure energy body and suddenly got into the spell of Siegel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the special ability of the pure magic dragon: swim the magic network. She abandoned all flesh and blood foods that made her body grow up, and survived by absorbing elements, so every inch of her body can interact perfectly with the elements. At the same time, Capricorn is also learning magic, learning spells from Siegel. Also tap the potential from the blood of the dragon. In addition, she and Siegel lived together for a long time, and the characteristics of his spelling were very clear, so that they could be transformed into a spell creature by means of elemental resonance. Follow Siegel's spells toward the flight fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, Siegel can't interrupt the spell. Even with the warning that the gray fog is constantly emitting, and under tremendous pressure, he can't let go. Because once you give up the spell, you will be forced to show the original shape. Then fall to... who knows where she will go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the astral is okay, you are afraid to enter the phlegm sea between the walls, which will burn the smash into a dregs. When Siegel is riding a tiger, he can only hold on to it. There is a reluctant thought in his heart: they are all Masters, I don't believe that I can still consume you by relying on four secrets! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are not as simple as he imagined, because this is not a quantitative contest, but a qualitative difference. Lynch has mastered five mysterious scrolls, and the space secret scrolls from the big snakes form the story of the gray fog. Siegel's strength is stronger, but it can only be bombed like a goblin's nuclear bomb. Nothing can be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps after several years or even decades of effort, it is possible to cause damage by accumulating quantitative changes to the extent of qualitative change. But before that change, Siegel might have been exhausted. Although the elemental power of the secret nuclear can speed up the process, the spatial rules can also consume Siegel's efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also thought of this, his body began to bruise under the pressure of pressure, and soon he will be injured. "Damn, you have to change your strategy!" He listened to the constant warning from the opposite side, and he made a fuss in his heart, ordering the earth element rune guard to move out a virtual gun. "Work hard!" he ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronically accelerated projectiles are transmitted back to the starting point again and again. Repeat the process of accelerating. At the same time, using the spells in the Federation's mana pool, Siegel used one heart and two, positioning the fog that "continues to alert." Since it is not penetrating the fog, this time the positioning was successful. The fog exists in a void. Wrapped in the middle of the wall barrier, below is a half-plane. Siegel needed to maintain the spell. He couldn't take him over, so he threw the empty gun that had already started running on the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flash of light flashed, and the Void Gun attacked the fog with maximum force. The fog that did not change under the action of the Siegel spell finally met the enemy, and the space rule encountered a space collapse rule. The gray mist disappeared into the middle, and a road leading to the barrier of the crystal wall was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the attack was on the crystal wall shell, and the time and space lost meaning in a black vortex. The infinite lightning illuminates the entire void, and even the spells formed by Siegel using the elements of the tide are extremely unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hastened to concentrate, even if the pores of the body are bleeding. The elementary dragon girl screams in pain, and she feels like a leaf in the storm, unable to control her own destiny. "Stabilize! Must be stable!" This is the only thought of Siegel. His eyes fired lightning, his breath was full of flames, his torso was as strong as a rock, but his limbs were colder than the Millennium Glacier. The power of the four elements worked together on him, trying to tear Siegel into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the present, only elemental aggregates can form control, so Siegel does this. Just as he used his elemental aggregate to strengthen his magical pet, Baron, this time his goal was changed to himself. Fortunately, there is a pipeline of ability formed in his body, attached to the extremely strong bones. The energy of the plasma can be transformed into the power of the four elements, and Siegel only needs to replace the plasma with elemental aggregates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fluidized elemental aggregates are unstable, but can spread rapidly along the plasma network. This is a painful process, like breaking every bone and then slowly bonding it. The pain of the outside world is mixed with the inner pain, but there is a tremor of joy because of the flow of magic. Siegel doesn't know what kind of feeling he is. He is filled with joys, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows and sorrows, mixing together, mixing and blending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of elemental aggregation replaces the negative energy of Nexus, and Siegel transforms from undead to elemental. The skill and experience of Siegel's control elements is far greater than controlling the undead, so this process strengthens his mastery of himself. All the spells he releases are made up of four basic elements. After the replacement state of the elemental aggregate, his ability to control the magic is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The void gun finally broke through the wall, leaving a hole that was disappearing at a very fast speed, but it was enough to position the spell into it. Siegel immediately took the appropriate spell from the synagogue pool and threw himself away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental form of shackles allowed him and the Capricorn to penetrate the gray fog and rushed over the flight to the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a white castle floating in a light red translucent crystal wall shell with a diameter of only 30 miles. The power of the big elements cycles back and forth here. There is an arched device on the platform of the castle, like a bow bent to the ground. The dense pygmy text forms a complex pattern on the device, and the power of a space of magic pervades it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that I was sent from my father from here." Capricorn turned back to the human form and lifted Siegel from the ground. The Archmage's tenacity is much lower than that of the dragon's body. The first thing that Siegel stood up was to recite the spell and make sure that the magic was still working as usual and he was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden alarm in the castle, and Siegel felt the power of the demon from purgatory. The spells of the anti-evil tactics only shrouded the two in a flash, and they were all ready to meet the demon guards. What can happen later subverts his cognition: a six-winged morning angel with a sacred power radiating a long sword from the castle and throwing it down from the second floor of the castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Getting it right! Invaders!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Angels are the most difficult to deal with Celestial warriors, they can use their holy power to counteract the effects of damage and magic, and continue to heal and recover in battle. As the angel flies, she has begun casting spells toward Siegel. St. Light Strike and Iridescent Jets converge at the same time, while also using space to lock the movement of any transfer or any door. Siegel had to wave his wand and use four arrows to destroy her spell. After that, you can use the element shield to resist the remaining magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning angel snorted and smiled happily, just like the child encountered a toy. With a wave of her arms, a cluster of elements consisting of twenty large elements of gas appeared out of thin air and then slammed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
