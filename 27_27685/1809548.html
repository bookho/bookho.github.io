From now on - point 515 fans festival to enjoy double monthly tickets, other activities have to send red envelopes can also see a look! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not know that there was surveillance on the top of the head, so he rushed to the north as quickly as possible. Fortunately, influenced by his anxious mood, the magic spacecraft did not fly far and entered the line mode, disappearing directly from the observer's field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the watchers are not idle, but also cast shadows into the film world. However, the speed of the star is too fast, and he has not seen the shadow of the spacecraft. The monitor slammed the scalp in the direction of the former spacecraft, hoping to catch up with Siegel’s trail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo all the way forward, did not take long to come to the wall channel. It seems that it is still calm here, and the Master who stays on duty here is still in the original position. It seems that there is no problem. It didn't take long for Verwood to get here with a teleport and sent a message to Siegel before he let him down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am staying here, eating something to restore my body, you will still be the leader of Siegel, you need it more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Siegel also ordered the magic ship to turn around and return. This time, you don't have to hurry so hard, and Siegel can use this time to think about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the castle destroyed by the city of Syracuse, Siegel would like to stay and not return to the kingdom of the stars. There is a gap between him and Evan, and the goal of obtaining a high-level spell reel has been reached, and it is not impossible to return to Heim. The reputation of cloning has spread, and members of the Masters Association have accepted this spell. By relying on this bond, you can fight for a part of the Master. At least Leir will not be so smooth when it comes to action. Since Evan wants the Masters Association to help him deal with the Goblin, that is his choice, he has not been able to insert it. At present, the most important thing is to digest and absorb the progress obtained this time as soon as possible, and at the same time, to find the power left by the god of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, master. I found a strange shadow in the sky, just about 50 miles ahead." The sound of the star suddenly sounded, and Siegel Wake up from thinking. "There is nothing there, but there is a shadow. It's weird!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel casts spells to enhance their vision and look closely in the direction of the star I found something with ripples moving in the air. He knows that it is the effect of the shadowing technique. Sometimes people often use the afterglow of the corner of the eye to see the shadow fluctuating a few times, that is, something is moving in the shadow world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You keep the current course. Pretend not to see it, mobilize the electromagnetic spider to the deck, I enter the film world to catch him." Siegel alert Get up and cast your magic back to the world full of black and white and gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watcher was riding a giant eagle and was very disappointed to see the magical spaceship that was returning. He sighed and knew that he couldn't find the exact position of the crystal wall. Two days ago, Teacher Lear used his communication skills to order himself, asking to wait in the city of Mire, and follow Siegel's magic ship to find the wall channel. I thought this task was done very well, but the final result was still to disappoint the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ready to continue flying in the current direction, at least already knowing the direction of the wall channel. A careful search for traces along the way may yield something. He saw the magical spacecraft approaching, so let the giant eagle glides forward, minimizing the possibility of being discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel observed from the film world, and could not see what was there, immediately thought that the other party is likely to be invisible. So he used his real vision to make the illusion invisible, and he found the flying eagle. On a saddle designed specifically for flying mounts, a wizard wearing an association costume is looking around and scrutinizing the spaceship with a curious eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really thought he was not found! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly and invisibly flew out of the spaceship, and began to exert his power on the tens of meters away. The film world is absolutely silent. The sound could not be transmitted a few meters away, so the spell was not heard by him. When a silver-white translucent big hand grabbed him, he had no time to react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the field is enough to crush the general rock, so it is almost impossible to break free after being picked up. Giant Eagle received fright. Desperately flap the wings to speed up the flight. Siegel waved his wand and took the mage directly to himself with his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Sergeant, I am willing to surrender. As a prisoner of war, and also as a high-level official mage, I request to treat me according to the treatment of the Viscount. I can tell you the message I am willing to offer, please do not for me. Knowing the circumstances and tortured him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wise choice." Siegel nodded and took him out of the shadows to the deck of the Stars. on. Xingsu used high-level creation to make steel shackles and chains, and the prisoner of war was obedient and allowed Siegel to bind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, first introduce who you are, what are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lunde Bell, the official mage of the Masters Association, I came here to investigate the situation in the city of Mith, and analyze the defensive array." The prisoner of war did not hesitate to open his mouth and said: "I saw your magic ship appear. So I was very interested, so I followed it. Just because your speed is too fast, I lost it. It’s completely unexpected to see the spaceship later. I love the magic ship and I admire you very much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, all are truthful." Siegel reached this conclusion by observing subtle expression changes. "But you and I know that it's all true that it doesn't mean there is no reservation. I think you have more things to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, Sig Lord, I will continue." Barend swayed, and the chain slammed. "I am the apprentice of Lear Master. It is the weaker of his six apprentices. However, if I am stronger than other brothers and brothers, I am sent to Heim. Our master is very concerned. Your situation, I have assigned tasks to each disciple, and learn your strengths from many aspects, but I don't know the specific tasks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All still It is the truth. Siegel squeezed his chin and asked: "The giant eagle you just rode is raised by yourself? How big is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barend is not panic Busy, just like a friend chats: "Oh, not completely raised by myself, I bought a trained giant eagle from a businessman. I used it for myself. By now the giant eagle should be eight years old. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The eight-year-old giant eagle can have a wingspan of 36 meters, indicating that he is very strong and has fully entered adulthood." Siegel holding Wand, write with illusion lines. There are more and more numbers and calculations. Barend began with doubts and saw that the sweat had stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the moment I left Mystery, you followed closely. I entered the film, you came in, and flew forward without stopping. "Siegel looked at the results of the formula. Said to him: "You don't want to observe the spaceship, but follow me closely, want to know where I am going. You can't see the inside of the spacecraft, it looks meaningless, and it is far from being observed here. When I went to the Star Fort, the spacecraft had been parked there forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoner of war was barely smiling, but his lips were revealing his mood. Siegel continued: "I also noticed that when you saw my ship again, I didn't stop or turn around and go back, but continue along the previous route. Combine your identity. I already know your The purpose of the mission and Lear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, as long as it is not what I said, the teacher will not blame." Barend looked at the West. Geer said: "I have never understood why you want to be a lord? Let all kinds of trivial things bind you and influence yourself to play a bigger role. And Teacher Lear predicts that if you maintain the identity of the Master Lord It is bound to embark on the path of rebellion, and the end of the family will be broken. It will affect the Masters Association. Why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is the first time I heard this. Then he asked: "Is Lil saying this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the teacher is very respectful of you, but also worried about you, and told us not to happen with you. Conflict." Barend continued: "He hopes that you can take a pure road. The path of the Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have my responsibility." Geer said seriously to Barend: "The so-called pure master is only an ideal state. There is always a variety of identities and demands, and each identity has both a burden and a harvest. He sent you to monitor me, analyze my defensive circles, and track my whereabouts. These are all to make me become more mage and stronger. Is it true that Lear is a fool? Even this gibberish All the letters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his hand on Barend’s head and held his thumb firmly against his eyebrows. The prisoner of war shouted out loudly: "It is not allowed to spy on the thinking of other mages. It is not allowed! You should have treated me according to the standards of the Viscounts, and I have cooperated very well, you can't..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
