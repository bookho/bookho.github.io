			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two consecutive astral projections, Xingsuo and Siegel came to the north of the Walled Mountain Range, near the Crystal Wall Channel of the Union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the invisible array, the huge magical spacecraft stayed at high altitude, and no one could find it. Xingsuo waited for Siegel to recover from continuous casting, and he observed the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From birth, she (not "it") has only seen her own caves and astrology, no place like where she is now The same, full of colorful colors and colorful things. The soft white clouds slid over the steel body, and the cold water vapor condensed on the deck. A bald eagle flying at high altitude could not see the invisible hull, and one of the cockroaches slammed up and shocked the star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used the Master's hand to hold up the bald eagle, turning over and over. With one hundred and eight deputy brains, the Xingsuo has a global vision that is difficult for ordinary people to reach, and can observe everything around it with great care. This giant eagle apparently aroused her curiosity: a small thing that can fly, with feathers floating in the air, not fast, and the eyes are not good. What does it fly to so high? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go," said the star horn to remove the bald eagle out of the deck: "Don't hit it next time!" Then she let go, still The bald eagle in the coma whirls and falls in the direction of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have done something wrong! Stars looked at the bald eagle that was drifting away, and quickly called Siegel: "Master, master! I threw away a creature that I hit, but it doesn't seem to fly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel breaks away from the spell's focus, sighs and licks the forehead, then puts his hand on the core of the star, so that he can observe the surroundings through her senses. Case. He saw that the eagle that was falling was about to become a little black spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save it!" Siegel took the initiative: "Accelerate dive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverse The gravity method immediately reversed, and the star number rushed down with four times the falling acceleration. "Propeller, star cable." Siegel reminded: "I only ask not to hit anything, don't damage yourself, the other you look at yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm!" The star immediately flies with full force, jetting elemental torrents from all around the body. Speed ​​up again. Siegel was prepared to protect himself with feathers and gasification. When the first spacecraft of the Federation tried to sail, it accelerated too quickly, causing most of the Masters to be injured. The Star Soul is even stronger than the Confederation One. It is estimated that even the physique of the giant Kerry will be stunned...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An air wall appears in front of the star, the crackling sound It keeps ringing. The high temperature caused the metal at the head to heat up and some parts began to deform. Stars immediately applied defensive elemental damage and healing, and blocked them with a shield. She is constantly learning and adapting herself, which is a good phenomenon. Explain that the core of the lamp god has met the requirements of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this white-headed eagle is to be saved is for the same purpose. The Xingsuo is a warship. She was created for the Goblin strategy, but Siegel did not want her to become a simple killing weapon. So now it is important for her to learn goodwill and compassion, which is early education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s really a mission to rescue yourself. Siegel put his hand on the core and warned the star: "Can't accelerate any more, otherwise the oppressed air will directly break the birds into pieces. Learn to calculate and see your chasing time and ability to slow down. If you want to catch a bald eagle, how can you protect it from the dangers of squally winds, high temperatures and large speed differences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is for the newborn star The number is a daunting task, and the hull is trembling because of her nervousness. Siegel helped her to calm her emotions and teach her flying postures and tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stars extend the hand of the Master. Grabbed the giant eagle. Then she turned around in the air, using her huge steel body to block the wind, creating a calm area from which the giant eagle was placed into the cabin. The anti-gravity array once again changed direction, and the elemental torrents pushed the spacecraft forward. So the Xingsuo learned to draw an arc to slow down the descent, and then not straight up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, her computing power needs to be strengthened, especially for the estimated time of deceleration. She is still too close to the ground, and the gust of wind from the high speed uproots all the plants on a hill, and rolls it into the sky with rocks, gravel, and white snow. Fortunately, there are scarce animals in the frozen zone, and there is no "mass killing". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a big movement certainly aroused the cordon of the Mage Federation here. Siegel also observed the ability of the left-behind personnel. There is no such a stupid mage flying to the sky to investigate, after all, it is more important to hide the existence of the crystal wall channel than to find the enemy - which makes Siegel very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for flying here is to borrow the coordinates of the crystal wall channel. Although the astral projection can go straight from the astral to the earth, only Siegel has been to the earth, and the star has not been there. The mage is also not sure to go to the astral with such a huge thing as the star number, which is based on who will and knowledge. The star has a core and one hundred and eight secondary brains. What if he is cranky when he is projecting in the astral world, why can't he locate the earth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half journey to the astral world is no problem, from the astral to the thunder wall world, there will be no leakage, that is, the star to the earth is not allowed. After all, no one has ever done such a crazy thing... Surely, Siegel decided to use the door of the outer world to go to the earth's crystal wall. Although it was around a long way, it was at least safer. In order to better display the door of the outer boundary, the closer to the crystal wall channel, the more accurately grasp the coordinates of the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is busy recovering, and Xingsuo is playing with the restored giant eagle. Using the light and the master's hand, the star so that the giant eagle can not fly beyond their control. The bald eagle shouted loudly and apparently began to be afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage quietly watched and see how the star is handled. The emotion of the bald eagle made the star think of the feeling of trembling when he swooped. Fear is not a comfortable thing. She understood that she made the bald eagle uncomfortable, this is not right! So she let go of the spell and let the giant eagle fly away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then sneaked a distance behind the giant eagle, and then reluctantly re-raised to the heights and returned to her initial position. This is still a childlike move, and Siegel thinks that he wants to take him to the world of goblin, I am afraid that there will be a lot of blood and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xingsuo, the place we are going to is full of danger. You have to learn to protect yourself." Siegel said: "Many of the practices there are wrong. So ask me if I don't understand anything. I hope to create a balanced dialogue environment with the Goblin, but I don't know if they will accept such a proposal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Well, if you don't understand, ask the owner!" Stars are very likely to catch the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a bottom line that must be remembered: If I am not there. There is a goblin hurting you, don't keep your hand, give me a good fight." Geer said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the owner is there?" The light god's thinking requires a complete logical cycle, otherwise it is difficult to deal with the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will give you out when I am here!" Siegel patted the star crystal. Then he said, "Are you ready? Let's start the alien transfer. This is a very difficult spell. You have to trust me as completely as the astral projection, so that the power of magic is all over the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, the cooperation between Siegel and Xingsuo is definitely a percentage of Lily. With the power of the secret nuclear power, the door of the alien world became a huge red-red vortex in the air. The fluctuations in the elements of these scales immediately alerted a large number of casters, even those far from the Old World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star number immediately accelerated, and quickly passed through the door of the outside world, and Siegel also closed the transmission channel. The eyes of those who have not paid attention to it have not been able to pass through, they have already wiped their ass and slipped away, and wiped the traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same elemental fluctuations also occur on Earth. However, the goblins only detected huge interference and noise of the radio waves, and there was a short interruption in the wireless communication in the north. Their first reaction was that a goblin kingdom was experimenting with electromagnetic interference bombs, and they sent surveillance planes and spies. Of course, they will not find anything - obviously not a system, only to find ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the earth of the goblin, or the land covered with ice and snow, but there is no mountain." Xingsuo looked around. "There is no creature here, no Bald Eagle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, it’s a child." Siegel said: "That way, I will introduce you a friend after I go back. It is also very smart, and it will be like a fire." I don't know if the Raven Baron can play with the Xingsuo, but the size of their two... forget it. There is no way to make up for the difference in body size. Even if the dragon and the star are put together, it is like a child standing in front of the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
