			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the narrow streets, the Orc Guards stand on both sides. They use the spears to block the crowd, and they also use old punches and stinky feet as an aid. Siegel saw the team that came gradually. He didn't know these orcs, but they could still see some clues through their equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the forefront is the vanguard officer holding the flag, General Kaka’s flag is a heart with a knife inserted, the style is very abstract, West Gere saw it for a long time before he understood it. After the four centurions, riding on the gray wolf should be General Kaka, wearing a crown on his green head, bigger than his head, probably a giant or a troll The skull of a large creature. The crown of the skull is made of gold with a crown. It seems to indicate the identity of the skull, but it seems that the orc seems to have two heads of freaks. General Kaka wore a half body armor, which was fitted with iron armor on the outside of hard bones, hides and thick cotton. It seemed to be a good joint technique, which is very rare in the orc army. General Kaka twitched comfortably on the back of the wide wolf and spit in the crowd. He spits high and far, and every mouth will let his guards cheer in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two captains are riding behind him, chewing on the snacks mixed with dry meat and tobacco, and the long knife on his knees. Two pairs of bloodthirsty and cold eyes stared at the surroundings with vigilance, like a crocodile. After them, there was a long line of soldiers. The mixed soldiers of the orcs and the half-orcs escorted more than forty cars, some were loaded with slaves, crying for help in the iron cage, and at first glance, they did not recognize the new slaves. More cars are loaded with loot, food, various irons, fabrics and clothes, and some sealed boxes, which are probably gold and silver treasures. There are almost no weapons and armor, it should be the orc army that complements the front line. As for the cattle and sheep that were seized, it was difficult to tame them to look through the walled mountains, so most of them stayed for the army and did not bring them back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the guard’s spear, the dirty, ugly and ferocious orcs are looking at the triumphant soldiers with excitement and looking at the spoils with more enthusiasm. . They thought that the slaves in their hands were sold, replaced by weapons and armor, and they went to the front to kill and rob them; others wanted to kill and grab now, but they forgot to carry the knife and axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs and the slaves are far away, they belong to a lower level, and the results of the plunder are not related to them. When the orcs shouted the slogan "General Kaka triumphant! Peeling the clan invincible!", most of them remained silent - unless there were just the orc warriors looking over. Siegel would like to use the raven to display a phantom sound, and he shouted: "Everyone shares the treasure!" I don't know how it works. Maybe it will cause the orcs' greed and then cause confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so hard to suppress this idea, just because he felt that the orcs around him didn’t even have weapons, and they couldn’t threaten the guards. For the rebellious guy, the orc is not ruthless, and will lift the knife directly to the deadly place. Siegel’s thoughts caused the death of seven or eight orcs, and they would be suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team walked to the center of the street and saw an orc with one eye missing from the finish, followed by an old woman behind him. The orc, holding three human slaves with chains in his hand. The one-eyed orc squatted on the ground and shouted before the guards pulled him up: "The powerful Kaka General, let me join your army! I offer my only three slaves and pray for your consent!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picking Kaka stopped and waved his hand and let the guards let go of the orc. He said, "What do I want your slave to do? Dry and thin, what to do." I can't do it. I can't do it. I have a slave. There are more than one hundred who came back this time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orphans thought about it and stood up Going to his own slave, he said aloud: "Have you heard that you are useless things, which hurts my worth!" He suddenly pulled out the short knife guarding the guards, killing three slaves one by one, then Throw the knife on the ground, kneeling in the pool of blood, and shouting: "The powerful Kaka General, I will give you life and everything, just ask for a long knife, a battle in the front!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! I will accept you." General Kaka waved his hand, team  Keep going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel always felt that it was arranged as well as a poor drama performance. Whether it is an actor, a plot or a line, there is a deliberate taste. But the orcs are still very excited. I don't know how many people are motivated to kill and rush. Maybe the scale of Kaka's general team will continue to expand tomorrow - if they can live to that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
