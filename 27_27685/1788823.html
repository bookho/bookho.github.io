			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shak Manor is quiet, there is no figure on the entire lawn. The moon in the sky casts a bright light, but leaves a long, thick shadow behind Siegel and Dorn. Two people stepped on the stone ladder in front of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two statues of cheetahs in front of the door. When Siegel approaches, he turns his head, his eyes glow yellow, and his claws are constantly scratching on the ground. There are also some activated statues hidden under the flying rafts on each floor of the house, but there is no such thing as a cheetah, mainly taking the form of small birds and bats. This is the first line of defense for Shaq Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are layers of magic spells on the door that need to be completely unlocked by the priest's power of the murder god. The servant who wants to come here should have the key or secret word for entering or leaving, otherwise it will be too cumbersome to use in daily life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel glanced at his eyes and recognized three offensive spells: the flames from the sky, the force field punches and the stealth stealth. Flash dust. There are still three or four spells left, and Siegel has no way to stop and look closely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bright light in the house. Only a ten-meter-wide hallway ignites forty candles and six oil lamps. But in addition to the extravagant light, there are no other decorations here, but it seems empty. The ground is cold marble, but now there is no carpet in winter; the curtains are only a thin layer of linen, neither velvet nor a little lace to decorate; the walls are blank, there are no portraits or tapestries, no flags and no weapons. The whole room could not see the green, smelling the flowers, but it was so cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I began to doubt your ability to pay." Siegel looked around: "This place is dedicated to thieves, and it is bright and bright." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You laughed. Brightness makes us feel at ease, but excessive decoration can be distracting." Dorn pointed to the small door next to the stairs and said: "Please go here, Mr. Jie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you take me to visit this house?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You will stay here for a long time, some are opportunities to see." Dorn took the lead and walked forward and pushed open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dark staircase behind the door, and the spiral iron steps extend all the way down. There is no illumination inside, and it is extraordinarily dark next to the brightly lit hall. Fortunately, the wall of the stairwell was covered with a mosaic and it was very clean. So the light outside is scattered here, at least for people to see the road under their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorne took the lead and Siegel followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the outside is brightly lit, it is still a black lacquer." Siegel stroked the wall of the passage with his hand. Secretly left traces of magical energy on it. The spell he left will slowly gather the power of the earth element, and when it detects the magic spell, it will send a signal, so that others can easily find the passage here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have been misunderstood by the world, but with the expansion of the Solidarity, everything will slowly improve." Dorn has a well-thought-out. I don't mind Siegel's words at all. "Compared to other church organizations, our Solidarity is the most capable of uniting the people and the most vital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard many jokes, you are the most Interesting.” Siegel deliberately said this in order to provoke his emotions. It is very difficult to display a mind-controlling spell on a priest of a god, so he must first understand the shortcomings of charity and the rules of cognition in order to be targeted. Pride and anger are good brothers who are accompanied by each other. They are the entry point for many mind-controlling spells. So Siegel said: "Your delusion has no practical meaning. The living standard in Kaibu Town is still very poor. I did not see unity. What will be the effect. But everyone's title has improved a lot, but the Duke and the Earl can't even change a shit, let alone fill the stomach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your vision is too narrow," Dorn said. "I didn't see the whole picture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed the iron gate at the end of the spiral staircase and led Siegel Enter a huge cave. The entire cave is underground and extends over a distance of more than a thousand meters. There are only four pillars over 20 meters high, supporting the roof from the ground. The pillars are inlaid with some glowing sticks that are not extinguished by the flames, and some burning braziers provide illumination. In this cave, there are more than 400 full-body warriors. Half of them were training, and the other half made weapons and armor by the fire. The light of the brazier jumped on their bright armor. The entire space echoed the percussion of metal and the slogan of one after another, and the noise was abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the power of our Solidarity to ensure that our existence and our ideals are not violated by evil. The elves drive us out of our homes, and this will not happen again for the second time! We will smash those with invincible iron hooves. The head of the pointed ear. Pull them out of the tree nest and throw them into the concentration camp. Sing poetry? Only labor can make them understand the truth of life again, that is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Life? They are elves, and have a relationship with humans." Siegel deliberately interrupted him. "These armor will not be the kind of slimy gel underneath?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorn took a deep breath and instantly suppressed the excitement and brought a faint smile. He said: "Of course it is, these are our soldiers. The power of the gods is beyond your imagination, and the power of the world cannot be opposed to it. The town of Kaibu is only the first step, our soldiers can grow indefinitely, steel Are there any resistances under the torrent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These soldiers are not good." Siegel grinned: "Their armor is shoddy, scaring and scaring farmers." In the battlefield, even the arrows can't stop. As for the martial arts of these people, it is even worse to a certain extent - except for the shelf, I am afraid that even the chicken can not stab."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't say that he won't be able to run because a baby doesn't turn over." Dorn took Siegel down the steps and walked into Cave Square. He waved his hand and let the Tin Man clear out a field and then stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, play here?" Siegel’s activity wrist, said to Dorn: "It’s good to start early, this cold place makes me uncomfortable. And I started to miss my little Lily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not touch your hand with your hand." Dorn snorted: "Your first The opponent is our steel warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I came to the assassin who attacked the Elf Forest, not to find the wax oil dummy. These strange Things can't be changed for bounty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the site of the Solidarity, you must first teach you basic courtesy!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body A warrior screamed, and the flat-end sword rushed from behind Siegel. His footsteps were drowned in the middle of the cluttered noise, but the air disturbance still gave Siegel enough warning. He didn't look back at all. Suddenly stepping to the side, the other side changed the direction of the charge, but he immediately rebounded, using the elf pace to hide to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quick change made the whole body A warrior emptied. The long sword just hit the air. He stood in one step, his knees and his waist were forced, and he became a slash. The armored warrior had no time to form a second offensive, and Siegel’s movements were too fast. His arm was caught behind his head, and a light flashed from the white hair. Then the sword smashed down, just on the hands of the body warrior holding the sword. Only heard a bang, two broken hands and a long sword fell to the ground, making a few crisp sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not arrogant, with the power of the jaw to slightly squat down, and then force like a spring. The long sword stabbed in from the chest and abdomen of the thin leather armor and came straight to the opposite. Blood spewed out, then gradually lost color and gradually became transparent. Siegel took the sword back to the original position, and kicked the body of the broken iron man far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s no use to tell you that this thing is scary." Siegel’s scornful smile was deeply imprinted in Dorn’s eyes, his sleeves. The hand in the hand is tightly squeezed into a fist. When Regers reported to him, he said that this person is a good man, but he did not expect it to be much stronger than the first batch of soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorn knows his deficiencies, that is, he has too little knowledge in battle. He can propose the idea of ​​the Solidarity. He can plan some tricks, but he has not been trained by the Cavaliers or played on the battlefield after all, so he feels that all the techniques of using swords are similar, and there is no good or bad. The sacred sacred sacred man gave him the opportunity to train the rubber warrior, and he caught the old coach of the castle in Keb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first batch of gluers all used the most basic basic swordsmanship. There is no change in the eyes of the experts. It’s also spiritual, and it’s easy to predict their next move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t waste time and my patience, these tin guys haven’t been able to change my courtesy and character.” Siegel pointed at Donne with a long sword In the eyes, it is like emitting a flame: "Give me the heads. Or I will make these irons all become scrap iron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
