			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel climbed ashore, the sun had fallen and the temperature dropped. As soon as he left the Black River, he lost the blessing of the heart and the water, and the water on his clothes began to freeze quickly. In order to prevent freezing, Siegel hurriedly took off his clothes and screwed it in his hand while hiding into a fishing gear warehouse next to the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one here, even a layer of dust on the fishing nets and fish baskets. The beast will not go fishing, it should be a place for half-orcs or human slaves to store tools. Almost all of the labor now goes to the shipyard, so it is temporarily abandoned. Siegel didn't dare to make a fire. He found a few dry rags in the warehouse and wiped the body, at least the water vapor that was about to freeze. Then he hurriedly moved his limbs, doing squats, push-ups, and quick small jumps in place to warm up his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can use magic, there are many ways to avoid body frostbite. However, under the cover of detection enchantment, only the mercenary means of Professor Sir Bill can be used. When Siegel thought about sneaking into the plan, he decided to use the spell only at the most critical moment. At that time, it was either the eve of victory or the moment of escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he couldn’t dry his clothes, Siegel had to temporarily make a simple cover with the rags and nets in the hut, and put on his own makeup. Into a human slave, rags are the best camouflage. He used his dagger to cut his hair, and the beard he hadn't finished for half a month could cover his young face. But you can't dress up like a beggar, that would make the orc feel that this slave is useless, and may throw out the life of the knife. Siegel reveals his arms and shows his strong muscles, so that he can play a slave who can work hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple makeup technique is still learned by Janet, and the cutting and sewing of the clothes is taught by Sir Bill. The biggest advantage of Siegel is that he is willing to learn all the tools that can be used, and he will not pick and choose. He put on "new clothes", took the dust off, and then pushed open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the day of the full moon, and the whole city is shrouded in the bright moonlight. This is not good for hiding the figure, and the simple Siegel walks on the street. As long as they don't encounter the drunken orcs, others see that he thought it was a slave to a certain general and would not come up to harass. Segal left the river terminal and walked into the town. His goal was first to be the restaurant or hotel in the area. First, in order to solve the problem of eating and drinking and heating, the second is to inquire about the news. He didn't know much about Macabu, and he was all enemies around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully chose the target, but fortunately there are a lot of pubs here, the orcs like this entertainment most, and they are willing to spend the last big boy in the pocket. Anyway, the next day, I will find a way to rob. They drank poor ale and watched the funny performances of the gnome slaves, while the big hands swam back and forth around the female slaves. When the pub is full, the pub will immediately become a place of lasciviousness, and the scene will be very confusing. Siegel does not expect to hear from here, he has his own way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before coming to Macabu, Siegel made several plans, first of all to get a status that can withstand inspection before proceeding to the next step. Investigation. Every port, even the most powerful Ghost Harbor in the morning, will be engaged in the work of forging identity certificates. Siegel was once trained as the successor of the old captain Ma Lin, who knew about these things related to shipping. Fortunately, the Soss often carries some tax collectors who forget to label tobacco, red wine, and even unsuccessful white sugar and pepper. In fact, these are all smuggled items, and the captain needs to contact the shopkeepers who can sell them, so naturally a set of commercial order at sea is formed. Siegel is planning to use this system to help with his activities in Macabu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolerant temper, don’t want to pay more attention to the scent of barbecue from the pub, Siegel crossed the entire Macabu 哒, and walked from the river terminal to the outer sea Near the pier. He saw two drunks on the road, dragged them into the alley, took off their clothes and changed them to the body. The short shirt was fitted with half trousers, soft shark shoes, and a fur hat with a low brim. The appearance of a sailor. This kind of attire is very common in the offshore pier. After all, it is a place where seafarers, or pirates, are haunted, surrounded by the familiar smell of the sea, the smell of sea salt, and the aroma of rum. Siegel specializes here to find grocery stores, especially those that sell nautical items, because they are generally the place where smugglers handle goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the half-orc opened the grocery store is not safe, according to their nature will hack the human, and then use the head to receive the reward. Or, after finding out where Siegel’s goods are hidden, perform the beheading action. The shop of the Orcs is prepared for the Orcs, unless Siegel is fully armed and armed with several mercenaries to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pretended to be a drunkard hiding in the shadows, and the stolen clothes on his strewn enough stench to easily smear. Now is the time when various shops are fighting, and Siegel took the opportunity to pick the target. He saw a grocery store called "White Fish" with a cable and anchor on the signboard and an ugly flying fish skipping from the cable. The signboard is very old, but the copper piece on it is polished, but few people are here, and the location is very quiet. The most important thing is that the owner of the grocery store is a one-eyed old man who does not seem to be in good health. He observed it for a long time, and did not find other folks in the shop. Even the last proof was the one-eyed old man himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel circled the grocery store and found that every window had locks and iron bars for protection. A black dog in the backyard is not called in the shadow of the eaves, just waiting for Siegel to step into the territory and pounce on it. It was like a prison here. Siegel thought about it and decided to start from here, so he didn’t care whether he had already snored at night and knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three short three long and three short, belonging to the smugglers. The maritime knowledge that Siegel learned from the old captain knew that such a signal would open most of the grocery stores. It is impossible to make big money by selling marine products alone. Only smuggling can satisfy the greedy appetite of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning of the grocery store, there was no movement, and Siegel was not in a hurry, waiting patiently for a while. Then he knocked the opposite signal again, three long, three short and three long. At this time, a light was lit in the grocery store, and then the sound of unlocking was heard. After the door of the wood opened, the one-eyed human old man came out and looked at the face of Siegel with a lantern. It can be seen that the only remaining eye is already cloudy and whitish, so it is necessary to borrow light to see things in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" The one-eyed old man asked alertly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a parallel." Siegel replied: "How about changing the pepper with scallops?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The old man let the door open and closed after Siegel went in. He asked the guests to sit down and then went to the kitchen to cook food. This is the courtesy of the grocery store and the smugglers: the smugglers need to be alone in the space to take out the hidden things from the body. This is the secret of every smuggler and must be respected by the owner. Siegel took out a few dwarf city gems, a bottle of deep water city's fine wine. This is a good wine specially prepared to resist the cold of the north before departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the dinner came up. It was oatmeal stewed with clams and scallops, which was filled with a lot of garlic to cover up the smell. Siegel said nothing, he took the bowl and ate it. It didn't take long for a bowl of seafood porridge to be eaten with only the last bite, and then the bowl was put down. It was not until this time that the entire "ceremony" of the secret code was completed. Siegel used his actions to show that he was a real smuggler, not a pirate on the shore, only selling goods instead of trading. The one-eyed old man opened the bottle of wine on the table, poured it into the cup, looked at the crystal clear white wine, and sniffed the smell of the grainy food. He took a cautious taste. This is the taste of Deepwater City and it is a good spirit. The feeling of a hometown passed through the throat and poured into my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs love the taste of alcohol, but they don’t make good wines, and they can’t grow grapes in the north. Even the brewing slaves have no raw materials. Therefore, the good wine has been in a state of being in short supply, and it is one of the favorite goods of smugglers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good things, how many? I received a bottle of twelve gold coins." The one-eyed old man took another sip and carefully tasted it, then asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not much, only one case." Siegel replied. He now pretends to be a single smuggler, and naturally it is impossible to have bulk goods, which is not so real. "Selling goods is not my main business. I came to Macabu to buy things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You lied." One-eyed said: "And you lie The level is very poor. Now everything is very scarce, the three eyes are very tight on everything. You want to get something from under his nose, it is looking for death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing missing here, slave." Siegel said: "I am very interested in the slave business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Is there a problem with the brain, from the orc here to buy slaves, who do you want to sell to, humans or elves? You dare to take slaves into their territory, your head will be separated from the neck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am looking for a specific slave, his family will pay me." Siegel said with a smile: "I only know that the sea boat he was sitting on was captured and dragged to Macabu. Then he is likely to be here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
