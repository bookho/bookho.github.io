			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big step covered by gold armor came forward and rushed into the stunned ranks of soldiers. The fiery hammerhead waved, and with the thunderous crash, an irresistible force would be hit by the soldiers in midair and then fell heavily on the ground. In front of the mace, it seems that the weight has lost its meaning, and the heavily armed warrior is like a thin chicken. The mace hammer swept, and the armor, flesh and bones formed a piece of debris rain, and sprinkled on the faces of others around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some soldiers took up their weapons and screamed and rushed up. But their steel weapons hit the gold armor, like the glass met the rock, the egg hit the wall, and all turned into pieces. The attack of the mace is not to be profitable, and no shield and armor can withstand a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the heavy casualties, Viscount Drey yelled at Siegel: "You are a lie of lying! Actually lie to me!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out his son’s sword and rushed to Siegel. The young lord shouted: "Don't shoot an arrow!" His voice just fell, and a feather arrow smashed through the air, accurately hitting the Viscount's right leg on the back of the knee, without the protection of the leg armor. The sword-bearer screamed and fell to the ground, and his weapon was also blocked by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mana! Look at him!" Siegel left the viscount a distance, then took out his wand and recited the spell. The Energy Missile spell circumvents the soldiers led by Hilo and accurately hits the golden armor of the scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attack finally achieved its effect. The heavy body squatted to one side, stepped on the horse body on the ground, lost balance and fell to the ground. At this time, the long guns and the flying axe shot at the golden armor, but they all turned into transparent pieces like ice, scattered on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wooden rod was caught in the weapon and slammed into the sly face, causing a small dent. The mask of the original crying mask, the nose was slightly smashed, and it looked very funny. The stick fell to the ground and made a sound to help. The scene was quiet for a moment, then the soldiers shouted: "Use wood! This guy can't hold the wood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel's energy missiles hit again This time he has started using the spells on the reels. Every time I want to stand up. The energy missile will make him lose balance again. When the soldiers could not find a suitable wooden weapon for a time, they turned the spear back and used it as a stick. Although it can avoid becoming a fragment, it can also cause damage on the gold armor, but it is not known how much effect it has on the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about countermeasures. Siegel also explained to the Viscount Drey: "This is not my spell! I don't know where the monster came from."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to lie to me, the squid scorpion!" The Viscount Dray was pointed by Mana with a longbow. Although he could not fight back, he did not forgive his mouth: "Is there a kind of thing that does not have the guts to admit it?"<br /><希 />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and replied: "You want to irritate me. Let me fight with this gold armor and warrior to prove my innocence. I understand your pains, but in I don't know how to deal with the weakness of this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Drey didn't talk anymore, just spit on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;骷髅The golden armor exudes a burst of light, and some tattoo patterns similar to the skull appear on the armor surface. At this time, Siegel discovered that his energy missile effect was greatly weakened and could not cause any harm. So he summoned the wolf dogs, let them appear on the platform, and rushed to the warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge mace hammer swept over and knocked on the flame wolf dog. Siegel only felt his hands shaking. The condensed fire element lost control of the connection, and the wolf dog collapsed directly in midair, forming a round of brilliant fireworks. The warrior used a mace to hammer the ground and screamed. The wind blew across the body and swept around. Everyone was smashing and smashing into a piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first deserter appeared and spread. These people still don't know that Siegel has cut off their retreat, and the passage of the Rift Valley has become an isolated platform, so they are trying to escape from the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out another reel. Run the power of lightning between the palms and then push it out. The magical elements in the air leaped cheerfully and then launched out as the medium of the Master. This process brought great excitement to Siegel. The bright smashed above the gold armor. A brilliant glory broke out. There was a huge roar and it was suddenly flew out. It dances through the limbs in the air, constantly adjusting the posture of the body. Siegel thought that it would fall again, but did not expect that when he was close to the ground, his right leg squatted down, as if he had plunged into a pile on the ground and stood still. The armor hit by lightning melted the blockbuster. Even the newly formed "tattoos" are bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
