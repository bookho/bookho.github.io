			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time I have to go," Siegel said to Janet: "I can't entrust mercenaries to do things about spells, they don't Know what to look for, and don't know how to achieve it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet also wants to persuade that his body is now stable and has not been deformed for a long time. Maybe it will heal slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "I can't take this risk, it's better to solve it early. You are not only your own, but Isaac's."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held Janet in the chair of the study, the soft cushion itself felt, and immediately began to radiate comfortable heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has changed a lot since Siegel came back. On the dark red wooden bookcase, hundreds of books stand still, and Siegel spends a lot of time on them, each with a bookmark, and a collection of parchment abstracts scattered between pages. . The more you grow up in adventure, the more Siegel can discover his lack of knowledge, and the more he studies hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All books basically have the same appearance, with a black squid mark on the ocean blue book cover. Siegel continued to use writing techniques and frantically copied a large amount of information from the library to expand his library. Many of them are not spell books, but they are very helpful for Siegel to improve his knowledge, but also lay an important foundation for learning spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to reading, he used every opportunity to practice spells, so everything in the study became the goal of the Siegel experimental spell. A mat that emits temperature, a high-chair, a fireplace that only needs to be lapped, and a dusting dust. Siegel used a small rune array in the study, and then used the energy-focusing lens spell to dissipate the absorbed elemental power to power these small runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Janet can come in here, Capricorn can also be, but Siegel found that she always tried to take the study and move back to her own Go to the "nest". This is the nature of the dragon. Siegel is not surprised, but many things are still being tested. He does not want to reveal the secrets of such spells for the time being. He proposed to help the dragon girl to arrange the room, and Capricorn shook his head. Very flustered refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she did not go to the study to get things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s efforts are obvious, but even if you can’t find a solution to Janet’s problems here, you must continue to work hard. Taking the thoughts back from the surrounding items, Janet saw Siegel standing next to the fire. Use a long iron rod to move the fire. His voice slowly drifted over, and he could hear the helplessness contained in it. "What happens to you is very tricky. Finding this spell book is the only hope. Blood magic is not a whimsical result like a rune element array, but has evolved over hundreds of years. I I can't infer the solution in terms of time, no matter how much time or difficulty I can't afford. So I can only hope to find a spell book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put down the fire stick, sat on the sofa opposite Janet, leaned over to hold her hands and said: "I sent Moore a few days ago and went to the top of Mora for help. The Temple of the Dwarf There are several high-ranking priests who are said to be able to communicate with the gods. Maybe there is a way to cure you. But the golden gate of Mora's ruins is completely closed, and only one rune image is repeated with dwarf and lingua franca. I will not accept '. Master Lia goes to the Elven Forest. Her father is a great druid, communicating with nature. He also has the magic of healing. But after more than a month, there is no news."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel The skin begins to hot, like a fever the same. Janet wanted to pull her hand out and touched Siegel's forehead, but she was slammed by the wizard. "Don't worry, it's just the fluctuation of magic. Many times magic is like living, gradually changing everything around. I know this power, so I understand the existence of the devil that lurks in your body."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry about me, I'm tired." Janet tried to squeeze a smile, but her eyes were full of worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured. I have a measure." Siegel leaned back and put himself in a chair, saying to Janet in a trembling voice: "You I know, to the end. I found that I can only rely on myself. I can't watch you being controlled by the devil's blood. That kind of scene... You know, just yesterday, I successfully summoned a bone demon from purgatory." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stretched out a finger and placed it on Janet's lips. "I don't have any danger under the protection of a heavy spell. I saw the bone demon. It was an evil and terrible monster. He started the attack immediately after seeing me. There was no strategy, only crazy hatred, and no communication at all. I watched it slam in the spell enchantment until the spell was over and was sent back to purgatory. I can't let you become like that!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet wants to persuade, but she knows that Siegel will embark on the way forward anyway. The mage stepped forward, his speed so fast that everything around him seemed to pull him back, and he was one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel discovered the feelings in the eyes of the kitten, it was sadness and self-blame. "Janet, it's just a test for me, just like I just set foot on the New World, facing an unknown adventure. No one can always be smooth, and this time we are not desperate, so you have to Be happy. Take care of Isaac and raise him chubby, then I can rest assured outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny features nod, she also Have children, so I still have to continue. "This time who is going with you on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mor must take it, others can't help too much, I need to train him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet thought about it, there really isn’t much choice. Mana and Zucker also guarded the territory. In addition to teasing Isaac, the Capricorn was too lazy to go to the door of the room. The Elf was lost, and the dwarf Locke lived in the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Reid follow you well." Janet said: "He is too strong and can treat wounds. Isn't it the best travel companion? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He needs to take care of your body and prevent the situation from getting worse." Siegel said: "I thought about it, and we are both enough. Now the martial arts is already good, and then you can become a knight after honing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really want to go with you, just like in the northern wasteland The same." Janet smiled in her memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isac needs a mother, I think he will summon you soon." Siegel’s voice just fell, and the baby was coming from the next room. cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-enter the journey of going out, but it feels different from before. Even if you don't have to look back, Siegel can still portray in the mind the secret city of Mier City disappearing into the morning mist. He knows that he is very different from the past. This change has nothing to do with his magical power, just because he is a person with a family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long muddy road in front of you leads southeast, passes through Vane County, and continues to turn south. After a series of operations, Vaughan County has now been placed under the protection of Heim, pledge allegiance and become a subsidiary territory. However, the Hugel family still blessed a lot of autonomy, and the city of Vaughan, which avoided the damage of the war, is as calm as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm road is exactly what Siegel needs. Except for Janet, Fitzak and Mana, no one knows exactly where he left. Time and direction. He and Moore are also on the road, and the clothes and cloaks are the most common styles. The mounts are just ordinary horses. Although the phantom is easy to use, it is easy to expose his identity as a mage. In the South, there are only a handful of Masters, and he is easily targeted by someone with a heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to be recognized, he also made a changeable volume, changed the color of the black hair and black eyes, and made his own with a dark brown beard. The age is even bigger. Janet made a scar for Siegel, making a scar from his right eyebrow to the corner of his mouth. "It looks very mighty, maybe it will scare off many thieves," Janet said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under layers of camouflage, it is exceptionally well equipped. Siegel wears a breastplate, which is the trophy from Felton, and the ring of the rainbow light ball on his hand. Stardust's long sword and sharp front guards hang on one side of the waist, and the obsidian dagger is hidden in soft boots. The dwarf's belt is hung with a space bag, which is loaded with a large number of reels. In addition, he also carries a defensive wristband for long-range weapons such as arrows. Once a day, the talisman on the chest can summon two large elements as guards at any time. Once the horn on the waist blows, you can shock around the hundred. The enemies in the rice, let them lose balance and fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor's equipment is not bad, under the cover of a common chain armor, the leather armor made of red dragon skin can effectively defend against weapons and fire; The shield on his hand looks old, but it can float to resist the attack with a single command; as long as the longbow is in the hand, Moore can see the distance, even in the dark. Moore’s long sword looks ordinary. In fact, it is a magnet that has been modified. The slogan can be used to activate the rune above. This sword can attract enemy metal weapons and bring combat advantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
