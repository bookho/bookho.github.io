			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to build a mage tower." Siegel’s language is amazing: "My spell ability can only cast strong spells on it, protecting it from The damage of the elemental spell, but at least gives my people a place to hide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides, I want to go north to find a pastor If there is his assistance, maybe I can find a new idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Leah immediately said: "I am going with you!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, is this necessary? There are so many things to do in the Elf Forest, and then I am moving faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf shook his head and said to Siegel, "While you became a mage, you still haven’t grown up. You still don’t understand the importance of a team. You are with you again and again. The enemy is fighting, and fortunately there is only one opponent at a time, so it won’t be too busy. But will this continue? The two Knox Association mages appeared together. How do you cope and raise your hands and surrender?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know I will never surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When can you let go of your pride and trust your partner to understand true modesty and prudence?" Elijah said. "Since Bill is not in the New World, then I should continue to teach you. After all, you also call my master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should listen to your master in this matter. Druid Alamir said: "Although there are many ways for the Master, but in my opinion, the ability to adapt to the environment is still under our druids. We can incarnate thousands of animals, go into the sea, and at the same time Calling for the power of the element and the healing power of the element, but we are still not alone, do not think that we can solve all problems. You should learn this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Thinking about it, nodded, then stood up. "Elf Lia, I invite you to go north together and embark on the adventure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not omit the word of the master." Lia promised to come down, then Staring at my father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is puzzled and doesn't know what secrets there are between the two. In the end, Alamir sighed and said to her daughter: "Yes. I agree. You can take the wealth that the dwarves have brought, but only in serious places!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lia, like Elinette, has 22% of the Dragon Lion Cliff Treasure, and Siegel has only 14%. The elf is getting this huge sum. Purchased a large number of artworks and decorations, and added gorgeous clothing. In Alamir's view, only the magic longbow behind her and the elf quiver at the waist are useful things, and other man-made luxury goods are pure waste. So he forbade Leah to use the remaining gold coins unless she could find a reasonable use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father. This forest contains the hope of the elves, not to let the dead spirits and evil thoughts taint." Leah said: "Let this wealth play its due The role, I will give it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gold coin is not very useful for our druids." Alamir said: "All our wealth comes from nature, and only nature. For us, gold and silver are just underground buried stones, and there is not much difference with the soil. What is it to use? And what we use in our druids, It’s made by itself or exchanged with other fellow travelers, and it doesn’t need gold coins.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea sinks for a while and then says: “Father. I’m not thinking about it. If you can convince the Moon Temple or the Academy of Art, the money will be really useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do my best." Alamir said: "I can try." Persuading the pastor of the Temple of the Moon to ask for the gods, if the elf God descends on the will, the entire Elven Forest will enter the defense. State, that's the best result - but asking for gods is not easy, it takes a long time to prepare. For our elves, it takes a long time to be long."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the words are finished, he sweeps through Siegel with his eyes and then throws them into the infinite sea of ​​trees, through layers of foliage. As a druid. He knows more or less about the strategy of the elves, knowing that powerful forces are hidden deep in the woodlands shaded by trees. The Academy of Arts is ready, and the Temple of the Moon is ready. They know that the people of the New World are not prepared. I want to make them feel shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it here. He stood up. In the feeling of Siegel, the surrounding atmosphere became stagnant, and the light in the forest seemed to fade. Only the tall figure of Alamir exudes pale light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid said: "I will summon the meeting of the Druid, agree on this matter, and then go to the Temple of the Elves. You will also set off as soon as possible. Compared with the forest, your friend’s territory is even weaker.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he did not wait for farewell, he went to the French tree next to him. In Siegel's astonished gaze, the ripples of the bark sway like a ripple, and the broad body of Alamir blends with the tree through the ripples, like a pedestrian crossing a waterfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is their Druid's ability to walk through the trees." Leah said: "For the Druid, this forest is full of entrances and exits. Any place can come quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a magical power." Siegel said: "So, should we leave?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, there is no time to waste." Elf Lia said: "I always carry weapons with me, but I think you should bring enough supplies to you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. Sir Bill always said that he was prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Leah ride Got the war horse and headed north through the Elf Forest. Leah is a member of the sidewalker, with a wizard through a sentry. Along the way, there are tall, dense trees on both sides, black and dark shadows cover all sight, and the scenery quickly becomes monotonous. Siegel keeps his horse behind the elf, so he can continue to think about how to guard against Knox's synopsis. He designs magical arrays in his brain so that spells that prevent mind control can cover a large area, and it's best to persist. This new law matrix was born out of the idea of ​​elemental absorption of the rune matrix, but turned the summoning element into thought protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the change in the core spell on the circle is enormous, and Siegel faces many problems that need to be resolved. The mage's research is such a time-consuming, and will use a lot of wealth in time and again. Fortunately, the skill of Siegel's meditation has not been put down, he can at least use the time of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he felt the magical fluctuations from the depths of the Elf Forest. Siegel immediately used the vision, and the scene in front of him immediately became different. In his right front, the distance that the jungle blocks is like a small sun in the ocean of elements, and the infinite energy is mixed with the tsunami formed by the four elements to swept the elf forest. The leaves of the French tree are lit up in turn, from a little bit of stars to a sea of ​​light, surrounded by white. After a few breaths, the tsunami of energy was absorbed by the French leaves, the light gradually disappeared, and everything was restored to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All changes occur at the level that Spirituality can see. In normal vision, everything is as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is very curious about what the elves do in the depths of the jungle, but at this moment it is not his time. The magical energy fluctuations that just happened appear to be mediocre and full of vitality, and it is not an evil force. Perhaps a powerful wizard wizard is experimenting with his new spell, perhaps the priest of the Moon Temple praying to the elf patron. He only walked for a little while, and pulled his thoughts back and continued to think about his magical pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men purchased spare horses at the north exit of the Elf Forest, and in the space bag were loaded with some Elf side Ranger rations: a thin and Soft scones, a bit like waffles, but slightly harder, smelling no smell. However, when eating, the lips and teeth are swaying with the sweetness and fragrance. It is said to be made from the fruit essence collected by the Druid, which can both help the skin and help the wound recover. The Rangers heard that Leah was going to go out, and she handed out the elf biscuit from her body and handed it to her, and wished her a safe journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel used the activation rope to fix himself on the horse's back, and then handed the guiding directions to Master Lia. The elf is not annoyed. She knows how a caster is thinking when she is thinking. Her father sometimes hangs on a branch like a bat, and falls into meditation and thinking for several days in a row—all of which are already strange. It’s strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taste of being tied with a rope is not good. At the beginning, the flesh was hurt and the meditation often failed. Later, Siegel thought that he should be more convinced of the physical instinct than the rope. So he adjusts the state, let the muscles relax, and enters the feeling of flowing and free when used like a fairy. The vibrations from the saddle and the ankle naturally caused the body to shake. Although the muscles were relaxed, his body's reaction was still there and he made adjustments. In this way, Siegel gradually adapted to the movements on the horseback, at least to reduce the tension of the rope, and will not be pulled out of the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
