In addition to the gift bag, this time the "515 red envelopes mad" must be seen, red envelopes do not grab the truth, set the alarm clock ~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is stacked Less books, all related to magic. Siegel has a general look at everything from spell parsing, legal knowledge, alchemy formulas to magical items manufacturing guides. The only thing missing is a variety of knowledge books. Perhaps it is not to let everyone be divulged by their own history and knowledge of the plane, this aspect of things can not be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the room looks much larger than the outside, with small round windows in all directions, and the sun shining through the windows to illuminate the room . It is obviously unreasonable to find the sun from any window. Either this room applies a spell that can influence the rules of space, or it is a manifestation of the power of the kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a good thing to have light in places like living rooms and study rooms, but magic labs generally need to isolate light. The sun itself contains energy, and a god like the Lord of the Morning has its own power in the sun, which will affect some magic experiments. In particular, there are some experiments that need to observe what kind of phenomenon occurs in the process. Is there any amount of light, and the presence of sunlight will also interfere with such experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, everything in this place can satisfy Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of equipment and materials piled up in the lab. As soon as you take it off the shelf, there will be new supplements. It seems to be inexhaustible. Inexhaustible. Siegel summoned the lamp god and asked what kind of material needed to be exchanged for points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Any living thing, such as a live ant and a live horse, is 1 point." The lamp god said: "The other is made of living things." Materials such as the gland of a flash dog or the golden dragon's stomach pouch with a gemstone. These things are of high value and consume between one hundred and ten thousand points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Where can I get a high magic scroll?" Siegel is particularly concerned about this question: "Can these things be brought out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" These points can be redeemed. If you are the winner, everything is yours, it doesn't matter if you bring it out." The words of the lamp god caught the attention of Siegel: "If you fail, everyone else will be all Failed. Only the skills learned can be brought out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the words of the lamp god, the result of winning here is to obtain the magical priesthood. From the information obtained before, Shenhuo includes three aspects: magic, knowledge and prophecy. The entire magic school requires hiding the true identity and shielding the mutual detection of prophetic spells. It is precisely the ability to predict the priesthood, and the process of learning the spell is in the field of magic and knowledge. From this point of view, it is highly probable that Lear cannot control what is happening here, or that it cannot be completely controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Channem once said that the power of the gods may decline. The fire of God can be extinguished, but the ministry will not disappear. The priesthood is the concept of the formation of the crystal wall. It is determined from the beginning of a world's birth and will only die in the storm of extinction. Take the example of the murder god: If there is no murder of the priesthood, then there is no way to end life except disease and natural death. That not only means that no war can be carried out, and even hunting is impossible. Such a world is not indispensable, but it is very isolated and cannot produce intelligent creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only thinking about life and death, and trying to change and escape death. The spark of wisdom can be ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, once the priesthood exists, it cannot be vacant for a long time, or it will be a disaster. Since the concepts are not independent, the priesthood itself is not perfect, and some mistakes cannot be solved by themselves. Unmanned priesthood is like a sea boat that loses its sailors. Although it can continue to float on the water, it will eventually be damaged by the loss of maintenance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the priesthood will merge with each other, and those who are not managed will be the most dangerous. The Elf God has been using "art" to cover up his embarrassment of the "magic" priesthood. The so-called Elf Art Institute was established based on this strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has also heard of economic warfare, using the economy as a weapon to fight each other. Although this kind of tactic has not been practiced, it is hard to say that this is not the fusion of God of War to the god of business, or the god of business to God of War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These knowledge Chanem knows. Lear must be clearer. Chanem is nothing but the saint of the murder god. Lear is the god of magic, knowledge and prophecy. If you can see it, you can leave Chanem far behind. When he gave up the fire and the priesthood, he did not exist if he did not think about it, or if he foresees the situation today. Therefore, in the School of Magic, there must be a left hand left by Lear to avoid someone successfully acquiring the magical priesthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods are greedy, and the gods who can give up power must be more greedy. Lear will not sit and watch the magical powers being taken away. Maybe he plans to return to the body and return to the throne after studying the secrets of the power of the blind. In other words, there must be something hidden in the Magic Academy to ensure that Lear achieves his wish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if Lear does not set a backhand, it means that anyone can compete, and that is what Sigel can accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun moved to the afternoon very quickly, and you can see it from every window. The lamp god is not responsible for reminding the time of class, but will inform the answer when asked. “All the courses are on the first floor of the middle tower.” The lamp god replied: “There is a blank magic book on the shelf on the right side of the door that can be used for notes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel has never officially attended classes. His basic knowledge is obtained from apprentice salons and book management. Some of the questions are based on the explanations given by the intern. The only formal knowledge passed from the bachelor Faranis, which was a one-on-one teaching for five days and five nights. A classroom like the afternoon is really the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine individuals assigned nine tables, forming a semi-circular arc around the podium. Above them, there are immortal flames and dances responsible for lighting, and the entire classroom is brightly lit. When Siegel arrived, there was only one female elf mage earlier than him. She chose the middle seat and looked at Siegel with a white beard with curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you are called Oluin Cologne, I spent ten points knowing from the lamp god." The female elf speaks in the dragon language But her elf language is very heavy. The dragon language has become a bit weird. "Do you want to know my name? Your current points are negative, I will save you points. I am called Anna Srina Meilien, you can call me Anna, every province. The pronunciation is very long. It is a waste of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With Elvish, your dragon language is too awkward." Siegel switched to Elvish. His Elvish language was learned from sea-going passengers, and his accent was very messy. The habits of different elves were mixed together and he was secondarily processed by human travelers. There is no way to tell the origins. However, his grammar was absolutely correct after the training of Master Lia, so Elf Anna just stunned and changed to Elvish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel summoned the god of lights and asked about spending points to explore the classmates. Sure enough, the name is ten points, the race is thirty, and the source time and location are as high as five hundred. "Knowing your name is purely curious, and your skills are good, magical ability is also very characteristic, otherwise how can you solve the gnome so quickly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for complimenting, I am just self-defense." Siegel thought that the female elf had said that she was a negative score. That is to say, she asked about the rules of the light god attack and counterattack. "What do you know about this place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female elf laughed, her eyes bent like a crescent, and the eyelashes shook with laughter. "It seems that you are coming to be the master of the magic tower, then I have to be careful with you. Only people like you will be particularly concerned about the situation of others. I just want to study hard and learn more before I can be cleared." Although the winner is all-inclusive, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words have not finished yet, another person has come in. The strong half-orc looks like a warrior, but he also has a rune tattoo filled with magical aura. The Orc looked at the female elf and glanced at Siegel. The nose snorted. He found the seat on the far side, threw the notebook on the table and slammed it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female elf shrugged and spread her hands and said: "The message you want to know needs to be spent. I can't give it to you for free, let alone the half-orc. Hearing. He can't get rid of it. He has already cleaned out the three guys. You should be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean up? What does it mean? Siegel was convinced that he killed the gnome in the battle, but soon the gnome was reshaped and appeared again in front of everyone. under these circumstances. How can I clean people out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
