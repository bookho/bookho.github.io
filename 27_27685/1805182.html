			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is certainly not the normal Sir Bill, the kind of fierceness and excitement that comes out of his eyes, only in the Avengers and Mad Only the believers can see it. He shouted angrily: "Intruder! There are intruders, come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell on the ground exudes a strong magical light, some kind of blood magic seems to Was triggered. The "white bones" they are in are not the core of the spell, so Siegel can't tell the final effect of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir is handed over to me, you are going to deal with other people." Siegel worried that someone had accidentally caused an irreparable injury to the Jazz, so he decided to do it himself. "If you are in trouble, Master Shelley is responsible for carrying it away with everyone. You can't send a star with a space lock and you need to choose another destination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, but I don't think I have to think about it for a while. The helper came, I smelled the undead." Shelley Shelle snorted and pointed his finger on the ground. First, the anti-death enchantment was displayed. "It seems to be ghosts and shadows. You two will not cast me and leave me three steps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walks forward and faces Sir Bill directly . His hands hang down on both sides of his thigh, and his body exudes a strong breath. It is a powerful force that radiates from the inside out, enough to trigger fear of a natural disaster—storm, thunder, or fire. Because the two emotions of worry and anger are intertwined, Siegel licks his lips and says nothing, but it makes people feel that once he speaks, he will release a horrible and powerful spell, which is unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Siegel is observing the situation of Sir Bill. He is much older than the last time. The horns and eyebrows have appeared silver, and wrinkles are also appearing in the corners of his eyes. He looks very tired, just like he hasn't been able to rest well for a long time. But the excitement in his eyes is not adulterated, and it seems to be full of energy - this contradiction is also reflected in other aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By learning the knowledge of the Knox Association, Siegel can read some emotions from the human eye - as long as he is not deliberately hidden or specifically related Training. Sir Bill has familiarity and strangeness in his eyes. Both of these can be understood, but there is no warmth, only hatred. If this is not certain he is under the influence of some spell or magic effect. Then there is no more obvious evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Release him." Siegel said: "I will give you three seconds to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill has slammed the warhammer from his waist - he used this weapon very rarely in the past. The purple light shines on the hammer, and Siegel can judge the effect of the plastic energy field with a single glance. "The last chance, release him!" Siegel shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warhammer was lifted up and aimed at Siegel’s waist. It seems that he does not want to escape. Although Sir Bill's attack is fast, it is certainly not as fast as the language. Siegel spoke up with the words "Shock!" and he fixed the action of the Jazz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warhammer slipped from his hand, and when it fell to the ground, the purple light disappeared immediately. Sir Bill’s eyes turned and his body began to tremble slightly. Actually try to break away from the shocking state. Through this phenomenon, Siegel immediately understood the situation of the jazz: he was not controlled by thought, but was in a state of being possessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when there are two thoughts in one body, in the face of shocking truth, one of the foreign thoughts may be avoided. However, it needs to regain control of the host in order to restore the body's ability to act. It’s not so simple to crack the sorcerer's shocking truth, so Sir Bill is constantly twitching like a seizure, and this time he just regained control of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tiger Biel, listen to my voice." Siegel used Knox's spiritual spell to pass his call directly. "Your nature has been indulged in the darkness of sleep for too long, it is time to wake up! Let the ghosts steal your body, plunder your memory and do evil in your name!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill’s eyes shed tears. But the expression screamed at Siegel: "The plunderers are all plunderers! Correct! Need to correct!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to my voice, recall freedom and Happiness, then spit out the evil spirits that occupy the body! I will save you from its control." Siegel casts a spell of expulsion, letting the power of the elements sweep through the body of the jazz. From his ears and nostrils, there was a very faint black-violet smog, but Bill was still firmly controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell line on the ground became brighter and brighter, the skull of the wall root exploded and the debris splashed around the room. The ghost went straight through the wall to the room. The teeth rushed up and tried to vent their resentment towards the living and absorb the energy of life. Zucker pulled out the sword of Sun Yan and shouted: "Look at me!" The bright yellow light broke out, and the ghosts and ghosts screamed and flew like a sulfuric acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell of Master Shelley is also affected. However, she quickly made adjustments and maintained the stability of the spell. A few of the ghosts close to her were controlled in her muttering chanting and turned to the guards who tried to come to support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your territory?" Siegel said: "Leave from Bill's body, you are a settler! Or pump, or squeeze, or smash, or drive Departure - I will drive you out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage’s tall figure is constantly close to Sir Bill. He continually sang spells, commanding elemental energy, and manipulating the power of spells. The star rope began to fall, sending the elemental power of the secret energy core. But without the energy support of these elements, Siegel has enough power to cope with the situation at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A purple-black shadow was slowly pulled out and exposed to the light of the Japanese sword. Siegel recognized it at a glance, and it was actually a shadow! In addition to the fact that this thing can make people madly attack each other, it also has the ability to control thoughts for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knox Association is the most authoritative for the study of the shadows of the dead. In addition to being the core of the emotional control matrix, their crimson spires are also a magical device that attracts and limits the shadows of the souls and creates the soul. Since the possession of the Miereng nuclear, Siegel has long since did not need Yan Lingjing, but he has not forgotten the relevant spells and knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and grabbed the exposed spirits directly from the hands formed by the force field energy and then lifted them into the air. Sir Bill was soft and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you kill me, Bill will die too!" The shadow of the spirit is struggling wildly, but it can't get rid of Siegel's bondage. One by one, Siegel trapped it with a spell and took out a white crystal stone from the space bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Killing you? Not so easy." Siegel said: "Death is too cheap for you, and I have a lot of things to figure out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell that is tied to the spirit of the shadow becomes a chain, one end connected to the crystal stone, and then slowly tightened. "Curse you, the plunderer! Curse you! We will get everything back on track! We will be revenge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struggling and screaming helpless, the sorrowful shadow Imprisoned into the crystal, it became an activated inflammatory soul crystal. Siegel threw it back into the space bag and picked up Sir Bill from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He breathes smoothly, but the pulse is abnormally slow and weak. Under the closed eyelids, the two eyeballs are moving fast and seem to be stuck in some kind of nightmare. Siegel used a spell to appease his emotions and opened his mouth to fill some Ningshen tea. Sir Bill’s face was better, and he entered a normal and restful sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intelligence chief came to Siegel and blinked: "The root of everything is here, possessed by the evil soul, this can be His Majesty the King confessed. The Marquis, the next job is to give the hounds, or you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can help me all the way, I will naturally Help you.” Siegel shouted at the Orc and asked him to help Sir Bill. "Snow Shell Master, trouble you and Jack with the Jazz spacecraft. I have something to do here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow Shell has manipulated Five ghosts have just ended the confrontation between the ghosts. She laughed twice, and tried to stop the spell in her hand. "Well, ** division, here is what you play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wikis watched Siegel send three people back to the star number and then did A gesture of please. "If you can, the Marquis of Siegel, can you leave more live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is about to summon the elemental army to clean up the castle, hear this Stopped. "Let's stay in order to continue interrogation, then I can't influence their mental state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
