			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the change of the sun, the summer and the summer, and whether it is war or peace, the city walls always stand on the ground, and no one can ignore it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The erosion of wind and rain is difficult to make any changes in the mountains, but the power of human beings can create ladders and build plank roads. Even on the most gentle mountain roads of the fist peak, the road is still very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana and her ten knights are marching forward, and the steep steps make the tall mounts uncomfortable and make a scream of fear. The knights tried to appease their horses and prevent them from falling off the cliffs because of panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the front is the fist castle. After this, the castle chain of the Castle Wall Mountain Valley began to turn eastward and entered the front line against the orcs. And in the east of the fist castle, it is the Bird's Nest City, the territory of the White Bird family Baron Cecil. According to Siegel, it is the closest lord to the Jackdaw tribe, and it is closely related to the joint mining of silver mines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, as long as you persist and convince the lord of the fist, you can basically complete the task of Siegel. After more than three months of hard work, a supply road that belongs to the Heim collar can be completed in tandem with the entire city wall. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Mana never thought I could accomplish such a feat. She used to be a mercenary and was not taken seriously. Or people are more interested in her appearance and body than her archery. Even in the wildest dreams, she never thought that she would become a knight one day, even a lord and a territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the territory is now occupied by the elves, the good people there are transferred to the city of Mire, without damage. Mana believes that one day the territory will return to human control again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the legal point of view, each leader is mainly responsible for the life of the people in his territory, but her lord Siegel relies on a castle to feed the population of the four castles, Did not let several new lords increase the pressure. Under his plan, the city of Miele now has spare time to sell meat to the outside. At this point, Mana admire him very much. Although Siegel always said that he is not a qualified lord, there are few who can develop the territory into such a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stand up, there is a castle not far from the front." Mana patted her own pocket and let the gold coin scream. “There are roofs, stoves, straw beds and hot food waiting for us. Don’t you clench your teeth?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s eyes are full of sorrow, low voice, Hearing laughter. They will not forget some time ago because of the avalanche caused by the hustle and bustle in the mountains. The scene seems to be a snowy mountain directly smashed down. Earthshaking. Fortunately, the gods bless, the avalanche appeared behind the team and did not cover them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving Heim’s collar, it’s autumn, they’re wearing two layers of singles. But as the winter falls and gradually goes north, they just want to wrap things around as much as possible. It turns out that the cold that the half-orcs said is true. These southern knights finally understood what it meant to be "frozen ears." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shadow passed over them and the knights immediately became alert. They grabbed the horse, took the longbow from the saddle, and pressed the bowstring with the finger that was about to freeze. Two people took off the blindfolded black silk cloth and looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a cloud that is moving fast against the wind and is slowly falling. There are always some strange things happening in the city walls, but this is the first time I see it. Mana has encountered a large gray monster that can hide in the cracks of the stone. She can lock the throat of the prey with a barb and a whip. Fortunately, they had sharp swords and cut off the monster arm in time, which saved their companion life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also saw the boxes next to the road. A gold coin is on the dirt-covered ground next to the box. Mana was alert in her heart and thought that this might be a trap set by the robbers. As a result, the boxes survived and madly charged them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the horse’s hoof, the box blame was trampled to death. Everyone except the one gold coin on the ground did not find anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one experience of distress is happy, they met the Shantou on the hillside. This is a light brown bear with an owl head and an eagle's mouth and feathers on his shoulders. The guy is stocking up for the winter, and the patrols who saw the order were rushed up. Other companions who were not far behind were quickly rushed to kill him with bows and rifles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds are getting closer and closer. Then stretched out a hand, and then Siegel's face came out from behind the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Retracting the weapon is the lord of the Lord." Mana said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel let the element of gas put him down and waved his hand to dismiss it. The knights brushed his salute and he solemnly returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have worked hard." Siegel said: "I am thinking of the North to look at it, and by the way give you some supplies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the space bag. From the inside, take out a few small metal bottles with corks. "This is the elf's wine, the strongest and most fragrant one. Don't drink it now, everyone puts a bottle on the body. If it's cold, hunger or fear surrounding you, take a sip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a transparent large glass bottle with orange-red liquid inside. "This is called the tears of the elves, a very bitter but very mellow spirit, and everyone can take a bite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Lord, Heim leads everything Ok," Mana asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, everything is normal now." Siegel said: "Although the elves are still besieged, their strength is reduced, and many are transferred to the north. The city of Mire is also snowing, much smaller than the city walls. There is enough food, meat and firewood in the city, and it is perfectly fine to spend this winter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The knights breathed a sigh of relief when they heard the news. Most of them have family members in the city of Mire, and there are always a few people who care about them. After leaving the city of Mire for more than three months, I rarely heard the news from the rear. Although I did not say it, I actually kept my heart in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The road you got through has now come in handy. The first carriage caravan has been on the road. Although there are not many things, it is finally Pioneering achievements. As long as you run back and forth, there will be other businessmen joining in, and at that time you will be able to connect the power of this castle defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It is our pleasure to be able to work for the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved his hand and did not accept this statement. "It’s not easy for you to come out for three months. If you are honored, you can’t stand it. You are a knight with honor and responsibility. This is the source of your strength. I waved my hand and can summon the elements of the air. Flying over, you can only rely on your feet to measure step by step. The front is the fist fort, let me go with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana nodded and put herself The mounts are handed over to the companions, allowing them to do the work of investigating and exploring the road, and then walking with Siegel in the middle of the ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight is not stupid, she understands the style of her lord. If you simply send some supplies, you can let his element guards do it, and don't run it in person. Therefore, Siegel must have a mission to teach her this time, which is definitely a very important task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did these knights perform along the way?" Siegel said to Mana with a smile: "Can you take the heavy responsibility?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana nodded and said: "They are all partners that I can trust my life. After the test of blood and fire, there is no problem."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I made a thing that was designed for the ancient tree of the Elven War, but it has not been tested in practice." Siegel said: "I need you to kill a war tree. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guaranteed to complete the task!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For some reason, I can't let the wizard know This weapon is related to me - if the effect of this weapon reaches my expectations, it will change the situation of the war to some extent." Siegel said: "First of all, I can not shoot, so as not to leave traces of magic. The weapons I prepared were for ordinary warriors, and they didn’t need the ability to cast spells. The knights who did this were facing the test of life and death. There are any things that might reveal their identity, including the dwarf armor of our territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana frowned, but still nodded firmly: "This is not The problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope to find the old war tree of the order, but from the current situation, the war tree always has the Elf Ranger or the Druid. Siegel said to Mana: "No one can be captured or captured, so I must let everyone do something very unhonorable: you must swallow poison before entering the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
