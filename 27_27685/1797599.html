			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim Collar, Mire City, the season changes as usual, time is still flowing away. Www*xshuotxt/com The sun, rain and warm winds are as repetitive as the rules that have been set for thousands of years. They still don't know what is called change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the residents of Heim’s collar have already experienced the ever-changing changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rift Valley is now a monster that opens up the blood basin and devours the earth and ore, and then digests it in the stomach filled with flames and alchemicals. Produces countless metals and gems. With the help of the Mire Nuclear and the Advanced Creations, the workshops in the Rift Valley have already caught up with the smelting capacity of the Mola, and it is just around the corner. The dwarf's craftsmanship and product quality are still above Heim's collar, but they also rely on the help of a variety of auxiliary agents, and in the Rift Valley, the Advanced Creations Code smears almost all of the production costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The craftsmen feel the most direct about the creation of the law, everyone knows which workshop will not compete with the peers without this array. Although the method of manufacturing the tactics is in the hands of the Confed Masters, it is impossible to understand without much research. However, it is not so difficult to use the vertical tactics. It only needs to be higher than the apprentice's ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a year or two to fully develop your own apprentice apprenticeship, but what if you only learn how to craft a craftsman-like apprentice? At present, the fastest record of Heim's collar is three months - the premise is that it is possible to read and read words and do simple calculations - which is acceptable for each workshop. As a result, a large number of people enrolled in the hall of the School of Magic, "magic craftsman" became the most sought-after work of Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching specialized magic craftsmen does not require full training, and it is sufficient to use the knowledge of the trainee mage. So Siegel opened a special school outside the school of magic, using the night to teach. A qualified trainee mage can earn some tuition here, and the apprentices of the craftsmen will not delay the work during the day. Siegel said that he had drawn a piece of land and then provided the school with a simple food for the night and night, and he had harvested hundreds of loyal magic craftsmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of all the handicrafts manufactured by Heim is falling rapidly, but reselling these things can make a fortune elsewhere. The transmission array from the Rift Valley to the Port of Rabbit Ears is fixed daily. Who can seize this time to ship goods needs to bid. This transmission array has created a new industry: time auctions. The use of standardized containers and the use of special conveyor belts can greatly increase the efficiency of the portal. Then every half hour is a time period for a caravan to ship their goods. There are ten time periods each day leading to Rabbit Ear Harbor. Ten time periods return from Rabbit Ear Harbor. Every day is full of people, and those who have not won the auction can only accept a one-month land journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike living things or agricultural products, for a manual product, the one-month delay does not hurt much value, and there is no need to pay a high toll. But since the merchants are willing to bid and push up the price. It must have been calculated. After opening the two places with the help of the transmission array, there is no need to consider the carrying capacity of the carriage, and how many things can be carried in a period of time. A few hundred horse-drawn carriages can reach the destination directly in half an hour, and the savings can be made from a single cost. In order to make full use of the transmission array, the small caravans began to merge, and large-scale chambers of commerce began to appear one after another. The "fangs" Janis has formed a giant chamber of commerce to serve Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at Rabbit Ear Harbor, the products of Heim's collar will be transported to the ship, and then transported to the East China Day and Night. The fleet is always not busy. The merchants heard about the cross-sea transmission array and asked about its functions and charges. In order to protect the maritime industry, Siegel has set a very high cost for the transmission, but there are still businessmen who choose this way. With the transmission array, you are not afraid of bad weather, and you can avoid the threat of orc pirates. After the fall of Deepwater City, the increasingly rampant pirates severely affected the northern route. Now this influence is gradually going south, and the Ximu Town route is beginning to feel the pressure, but the rabbit ear port is more south, and the orcs rarely come to this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will come sooner or later." Siegel has a very clear understanding of this: "The route of Rabbit Ear Harbor accounts for about 70% of the traffic on the New World." And it is still growing. A voyage will make the orcs earn a lot of benefits, and they will realize this slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Do we still want to build a navy?” Janet is full of books in front of him, which is still the conclusion data that was made after the calculation and finishing of the lamp god three. Heim's collar is expanding, and one or two people are completely unable to grasp the vast amount of information. This puts higher demands on all aspects of territorial management. Janet looked for it and finally found out the balance of the territory's gold coins: "I am very happy to tell you that there is no problem in building a escort fleet. It is enough to buy a fleet directly, but where is it qualified? Sailors? If the adventurer is on board to fight against the orc pirates, or if we recruit some human pirates as escorts, the cost will be greatly increased."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Do you definitely want to make something?" Janet gently stroked Siegel's face and said: "Building a castle, building a tower, creating a nuclear power, making a transmission array are all your ideas. This time Can you listen to my opinion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's talk!" Siegel said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very envious of the Federation's magical spaceship, and Heim's collar also needs to build a kind of spaceship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This coincides with Siegel’s idea: “I think so too, we can’t give up the sky.” He said: “The Federation built the first spaceship and estimated that they would fly from the East. Come back, I will soon start to build a second ship for the starry kingdom. Their experience can avoid us going a lot of detours, from the beginning of designing the Shanghai M-neck spacecraft will be better than theirs. Plus I will not like them It’s so conservative, so you can look forward to the lucky Soss’ departure.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m already a good name, is the name of the ship you used to be?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't think of a better ship name." Siegel gently kissed his wife and said: "Or called the returning Janet, or charge." Isaac?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With you." Janet is only as long as Siegel can be around. Heart. "Right, there is something weird, you may need to pay attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heam’s collar is a very deformed development to a certain extent, it should have been condensed Multi-work industrial products have become extremely cheap. Everyone can enjoy it. But this does not change the speed at which Heim’s residents receive food from the fields. The large wasteland of the Ghost Fog and Swamp provided a lot of new farmland, which supported the food pressure brought by the increasing immigrant population. In the case of a bumper harvest, the food price of Heim’s collar is still rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not right. How much can a person eat?" Siegel scratched his head and looked at the market price report submitted by the lamp god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the one hand, active manufacturing and commerce make gold coins too much, so everything is going up. The Rift Valley workshop belongs to you. Industry, so how much to produce, how to sell can also be controlled. Farmland scattered in various villages. The knights responsible for managing the fiefdom have several understand the business? Once something rises, under the urging of money, the knight will Changing the planting strategy. This has caused some waste, and it is likely to become more and more powerful in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel understood immediately after listening. He can build weapon armor on the assembly line, and even temporary magic items that can only be operated within the scope of the secret energy can be manufactured directly, but he can't use the assembly line to produce food. There are always so many harvests in the fields. At the same time that a large amount of wealth enters Heim’s collar, there will be countless people staring at them, trying to make these gold coins back. In terms of planting, farming and fisheries, the development of Heim's collar can't keep up with its own magic industry. This will become a hidden danger in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They can't take our steel products, but we can't stop eating." Siegel thought about it and said later: "Although I don't really eat anything." However, excessive fluctuations in prices have never been a good thing. The land in the southern part of the Ghost Fog has not been separated yet? All of them have been preserved as the direct fields of the city of Mire. The people who have been in the wasteland have asked them, may Willing to work for me directly?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you want to hire someone to farm you like a workshop apprentice?” Janet shook her head, indicating Against: "If this practice is promoted, the landlord of the land will all collect the original peasants' land and then become an employment relationship. It will cause great trouble. Those who lose their land will be willing to plant it, go to the workshop. It’s not better to be a union. The land that is concentrated is not the more valuable phenomenon. You look at the price list. The sheep has already risen seven times more than in the past because of insufficient raw materials in the textile workshop. We will definitely go to raise sheep, which is much more profitable than farming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who lose land will also bring instability, but in the end What kind of reaction is triggered is not what Siegel can understand. It's like a normal-growing boy, suddenly his head and right arm start to grow wildly, how to keep other body parts up to date. It is not a simple matter to have problems without being deformed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term solution can’t be found, and the employment of farmers can be put aside, but the land in the southern part of the Ghost Fog is directly under the city of Mier, and is no longer included. Within the scope of land reclamation. At the same time, Siegel ordered the construction of granaries, and secretly used the trans-sea transmission array to transport easy-to-storage food from the East. He also submitted a new project to the federation: digging a warehouse deep in the ground, using the magical array of Miereng nuclear power supply to keep it under the freezing point, used to store r-type products - now the price is still No quick improvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
