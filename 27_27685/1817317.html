			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the fire is growing, and Siegel has always been vigilant and even more vigilant. Evan's counterexamples are in front of him, and the result of being influenced by the mind is terrible. He still cares about people, cares about things, and has no desire to finish. This is not the time to give himself to the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forced the obsidian dagger from the two ribs, and the wound could not stop bleeding. Even the body that is strengthened by the power can't recover the wound left by the obsidian dagger, and can only wait for healing like a normal person. All he can do is use the force field spell to stop the bleeding point, and then use the flesh removed from the clone to suture himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your wound is very similar to what I did when I used strength. I kept bleeding and couldn’t heal. But the wound I created will continue to expand, than you. It's even harder to resist." Mana determined that Siegel had returned to normal, so he let go of his heart. She then pointed to Evan, who was still in a daze: "There is a king there, how to deal with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want Mohr to be king?" Siegel asked her with a squint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! Resolutely not. Moore will go to sleep other women, raise other children, this is absolutely impossible." Nata shook her head and laughed. Said: "But I don't mind if you turn me into a king, I have been a fun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at her eyebrows, Siegel shakes helplessly Shake his head. He threw all the clones back into the country of God and then stood in front of Evan. "You lost, it is time to surrender and admit defeat." Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan looked up and his eyes finally got the focus. "I killed too many of you, is this true in front of me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Siegel said: "I am Ontology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Evan once again swayed the sword at this time, he could not hurt Siegel, who had already had a higher power. The gap between mortal and God is too obvious, and Evan is still skeptical about the ability to use the rules smoothly. After Siegel wanted to know that Evan’s consciousness could not be regained consciousness after he lost the fire, he hoped that the influence of the fire would not be permanent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan took the broken sword and looked at it. Then he said with self-deprecation: "This sword is a gift you gave me, but I used it." It hurts you and even kills you. I always wanted to compete with you. It is a wish of my young swordsman, but I will not use the weapons you created for me to deal with you, so I accepted the Temple of Dawn. Give me the morning light holy sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a holy force in it? Right?" Siegel gradually sorted out the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't push things to a weapon. You are right, my energy is not enough, Bialun is a lot worse, but not enough Shifting responsibility.” Evan threw the Devil Sword to Siegel and said, “This defeated me, I admit defeat. At the same time, I apologize for using the mean tricks in this fight. According to the honor of the Cavaliers. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to your knight honor, I am not a knight, you have not been." Siegel did not let Evan finish the words, deliberate Interrupt him. He wiped his hand on the sword and removed the ability to break the demon, and then attached an enchantment that prevented the influence of the mind. "If you break the demon and destroy the devil, you should not use this attribute for you. Isn't that just playing me as a magical god? Now it is good to be mentally tough, and it will be good for you in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan snorted and said with an incredible expression: "You forgive me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is two different things." Geer said: "Of course I can let this thing pass, but not now. In case you have caused any trouble, I can't end it. So I will temporarily isolate you and let Moore play outside. You can Communicate with his heart, know everything that happened, and arrange things to evacuate from the world of the thunder wall. Until the dust falls, I can't let you go back to the starry kingdom. You can rest assured that during this time, Moore not only arranges for evacuation, Nothing will be done - I will arrange for people to discipline him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Until the dust falls to the ground? It seems that the East Continent was abandoned, the kingdom of the stars Is it necessary for people to come to the New World?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, and You, thanks to the East China suffered a catastrophe, many areas have been destroyed. "Siegel Shenhuo then chop behind the portal out of control and lead to things outsider invasion, exactly to Evan said. He also showed the villages and castles that were directly destroyed by the power of the elements, not even the bones. "According to the current population, I don't know if I can get enough power to protect the transmission of the New World. Let's take a step and see if there is a good thing to pack tickets most of the time."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come with me." Siegel opened the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is placed in the magic tower of the Gnome World built by the Masters Association. The protective enchantment here ensures that he is not affected by the external environment and will not be easily disturbed. Siegel left enough supplies, and then the usage array closed the entire magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tenna's Turner blocked the devastating storm, and the octagonal scorpion merged with the New World. Even if the four scorpions were split into four obsidian daggers, they could still Help to suppress the goblin world.” Siegel took the last obsidian dagger from the magic tower, so he put all the pieces of the four-faced scorpion together. "Evan, what do you want to leave to the world as a hundred-faced scorpion? Isn't an invincible swordsman your ultimate pursuit? And the destructive power, maybe you are not as good as the twelve-faced Nata. Her power Use is not limited to the use of long swords, it is much more flexible than you. Think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will be able to communicate with Moore's runestone Give Evan, then take Nata away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of the Thunder Wall World is really a big deal, but all the painstaking efforts have finally come to fruition - the threat of destruction of the storm has finally disappeared from the crowd, big Some people - even the vast majority of the creatures - were able to take the lifeboat on the fifth side and continue to continue their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also twists and turns during the period. Fortunately, Lynch sent the entire continent from south to north, and finally encountered the shadows of the North. Space spells have destroyed the space folding and tranquility array in the north. The madness of the dead spirits smells the breath of the living and wants to rush into the semi-position. Siegel blocked the regular erosion of the crystal wall and could not extract it for interception. So he can only let Lynch end the space transfer as soon as possible, keeping these undead out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the merchant’s shot that stopped the undead, using another group of ghosts that are not inferior to them. To know that there are tens of millions of people who have lost their lives, the army that wants to stop them does not lose this amount. Taking advantage of the time that was not easy to win, Lynch terminated the transmission, leaving a small piece of land in the northern part of the New World, and letting them be the real graves of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this accident, everything went "unexpectedly" smoothly. In accordance with his promise, with the help of Nata's destruction, Siegel cut off the wall passage of the thunder wall world and the goblin world. This caused his fire to fall again, leaving only five forks. In the history of the entire multiverse, there is no such thing as a god—especially the god of the gods—the violent ups and downs of divine power. However, in the long run, the semi-planet has acquired a very broad world as a resource warehouse, or when the time is ripe, especially after the transformation of a livable environment, it is not impossible to re-migrate to the goblin wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes quite a long time, and it must be done after the refugees build their homes in the New World. The New World is a place of hope, and each race has maintained at least a multi-year collaboration. The dwarves make tools, the orcs wield weapons to open up the wilderness; the elves druids use magic to create fertile soil, but this time it is not just for planting trees, the halflings contribute the best seeds, and care for the food for all races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons continue to sleep because it saves the most food. This reason is sufficient enough that no one has expressed any objection. Every race has something that it is good at, and human expertise is good at everything. Under the leadership of the people of the Starry Kingdom, especially under the leadership of Heim, the new era of magic, musket, mechanics and electronics has begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starry kingdom is still there, but appears in the new form on the New World. Humans no longer have to work hard to build castles - unless it is for beauty and nostalgia - the walls can no longer bind the city, just like reading and learning with the help of the Temple of Magic has no threshold. Only the most dynamic races can stand out, and humans are like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long period of meditation, Evan finally reached the peak of the hundred-faced scorpion, lighting up the last number. However, he did not show anyone what the last move of the sword is like, but just said the "sword without sword" is the mysterious and mysterious truth. He sat back to the position of the king and determined to temporarily lay down the swordsman's dream in this life, first to complete the responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor and Nata continue to stay at the starting point of the castle, and together with the King of Isaac of Heim’s collar, they clamped the walled mountains and occupied the core of the starry kingdom. section. Later, Mol and Nata’s son, Sando, went through the hardships and married Siegel and Janet’s baby Megan. The Heim collar is still unbreakable and continues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
