			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gray-white shadow in front, Siegel continued to walk through the alleys of the bacon town, and he could clearly feel that the route they were walking was very regular, avoiding All the patrolling guards and hostile eyes. Now Siegel is dressed as a half-orc, but there is no sign of any tribe or legion - these things are picked up under the suggestion of the shadow. Siegel is equivalent to having no identity card, and if it encounters the orc of the snatching team - which is common in the tears of the wilderness - he is likely to reveal his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Linco has sold you out." The shadow said: "He leaked your whereabouts, and now there is a small group of orcs who are going to the accommodation area to try to arrest. You, soon the entire bacon town is closed, only allowed to enter. The reason given is to welcome the return of General Kaka."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you? Know?" Siegel had a hunch before, but still kept doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have been observing the whole town in heaven. Every conspiracy, every word is under our supervision." The shadow replied: "But you can rest assured We don't report to the sorcerer, he is our enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel's hand touched the dragon's dagger and then released. He has not yet mastered the spell of the spiritual weapons, and the dagger itself may not be able to kill the shadow. He also discovered along the way, the shadow is completely unreal. It can pass through the orcs, and things like walls, floors, etc. will have no effect on his actions. And apart from Siegel, no second person can detect the existence of this shadow. Many people can feel the undead creatures such as ghosts, and they will chill when they are close, and the hair will stand straight. But the shadow in front of Siegel does not cause this reaction at all, as if it existed only in the wizard's own world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can constantly monitor the villages and towns in the sky is the cloud of grievances, but the shadows in front of them have no negative emotions, and they do not feel the power of evil. Although not evil, it is also not good, because good people will make people feel close and gentle, which is not felt in the shadows. It is like a whitewashed canvas. All the pigments, whether it is emotions or sorrows, are faded in color, leaving only deep marks. "Why is the cloud on the top of the head with such a big hatred, but you don't?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A soul that can't rest will make the room cold, ten can't rest in peace The soul will make the village gloomy, and a hundred souls that cannot rest in peace will be helpless to your pastor, so one thousand, ten thousand, one hundred million?" With this words, the color of the shadow gradually deepens, the more The more it looks like lead. Siegel began to become nervous, and his mind meditation to dispel the evil spells, ready to inspire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow shook, a black smog floated from him, dissipated in the sky, and the shadow's figure returned to the original white. Siegel listened to him and said: "We have great hatred in our hearts, but we cannot resolve ourselves. The sorcerers use our own methods to help us to vent our resentment, but we do not fully agree with them."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Temple of the Dead can't help you? Death is responsible for managing all the ghosts and grievances. If they can't, the Lord of the Morning Dawn can purify the soul, even though that method is similar to annihilation. But it is also a way out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are not our gods." The shadow said: "Our god has been with us, and there is nothing to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel continues to ask, but the shadow no longer responds to him, just saying "not yet." When can it be "when is it"? Siegel has always disliked the mysterious way of this god. He likes to ask questions until he finds a solution to the question, so he prefers to be a mage instead of a pastor. Of course, he always prayed to the god of the storm and the squid, never got a response, and he never thought of becoming a pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if no orcs came up for questioning, Siegel felt that the tension in the town began to increase. In less than five minutes, he saw three fully armed orc patrols. They are driving the pedestrians on the street, especially the ragged slaves, and throwing them one by one into the quagmire on the street. The patrol shouted: "Get the road for General Kaka! The people are all gone!" Several orc guards looked in the direction of Siegel, but the eyes could only catch a small piece of robes that he had disappeared at the corner. Under the shadow of white, Siegel floated like a ghost like a town, and finally stopped in front of a ruin of a house burned by fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow walks into the broken wall of coke, pointing to a collapsed cabinet next to the foundation, saying: "This is a relatively fragile projection location for the spell, and below There is a cellar that can evade weapons. You have to hide inside until the first bunch of sunshine appears tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Lin Ke didn't sell you, then it's safe outside, because no orc will care about a lone half-orc." The shadow said: "But now, the orcs who have hunt you have already set off, they have wolves. On the snowfield. You can't run them, and your magic can cause fluctuations. There is only one fake witch festival in the town of bacon, but there are a few real ones outside. They will follow the fluctuation of the spell to find the place where you hide."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am not in the area where the spell works? I have not forgotten the grievances above my head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, all living things can't be safe under the erosion of grievances, but you are possible." The shadow pointed at Siegel's chest, exactly the position of the twenty-faced scorpion: "Through it, you It can be changed to become an undead creature, so that we won't affect you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What! Can you see this scorpion? What is it used for? Why? I am?" Siegel looked at the dice and found that the number 12 has Shiny, in a state that can be used. "Undead body", this is the role of the scorpion, can make Siegel become a scorpion or zombie, or as the power of the user increases, can become more kinds of undead. Siegel was shocked. He didn't know why this side would be activated. He had too many doubts in his heart. So he rushed forward and even reached out to catch the shadow, but he did not expect to catch an empty space. The shadow shook, and the voice was as calm as ever: "You are one of the four. The blind man is the key to communicating the lost and the unborn. When you know your real name, you can know everything."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow waved his finger, and the cabinet that fell to the ground slipped out, revealing the hidden door below. This ruin used to be a pub, and the wreckage of the tables and chairs and the fragments of the pottery plates are faintly visible. Below the door may be the cellar, maybe the secret road, this will go down to see. The shadow finally said to Siegel: "Hidden, Master, you are safe below."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what you said I don't understand, give I explained it in detail! What is the real name? I am called Siegel-Squid! What do you mean by one of the four, and who are the other three?" Siegel’s problems are one by one, but the shadows are never answered. After the display of the secret door, the shadow gradually became dim and fuzzy, such as the same burst of blue smoke, began to slowly dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least you have to tell me what your name is, I can't call you a grievance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Before the shadow disappeared, the last answer came: "We are the shadow of the dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps are not far away, and the weapons collide The sound of armor. Siegel knew that it was the noise of the orc patrol running, and it was as loud as a bell for slaves and apes – the same for a “fugitive”, Siegel thought. If Lin Ke goes to report, there is nothing wrong with it. After all, he is indeed a member of the Mage Federation, and he is a hostile camp with the orcs. But what would Lin Ke say? How did he explain why I was posing as a witch festival? If it were me, I would say that the teacher killed the witch festival and forced the people in the village to listen to him, otherwise he would cast evil spells. Perhaps it will also push the fact that no stone people have joined the army in the stone village, so that everything seems reasonable. Siegel did not know what kind of mood Lin Ke would have when reporting his human family to the orcs. Perhaps his face is still human, but the blood is not long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought, but his men did not stop at all. He opened the secret door and lit the finger-sized ball of light with the finest magical energy. It can illuminate the steps below the secret door. The bottom is really a wine cellar, well preserved in the fire, just a thick layer of charcoal. Siegel left the Raven Demon outside and hid it on the black beams of the ruins of the pub, covering the figure with shadows. He walked into the wine cellar and closed the secret door behind him. Then he casts a spell on the secret door through the eyes of the raven, re-covering the surrounding debris to the door, and eliminating a series of traces after he walked into the house. The footsteps of the Orc patrol approached the ruins, and a simple glance took nothing to discover. So they did not stop at all, and they disappeared into the distance. Siegel took a sigh of relief and began to look at the hiding place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the large and small jars filled with ale, there are two bags of turnip roots, a bag of barley flour, a small bag of dried apples and a few bunches. Smoked sausage. But there is nothing to ignite and illuminate here. Like the dwarves, the orcs also have dark vision, and the lights in the cellar are normal. Perhaps the pub's operators were buried in the sea of ​​fire, so no one came back to clean up these things, but cheaper Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved the bag into a seat and illuminated it with the light from the key space. Siegel had an idea. If you put your hand into the space and cast a spell, will the magical fluctuations come out? As long as it is not a spell associated with opening, folding, or expanding space, it should not cause a key space failure. He tried it, the spells still worked, but the fluctuations did not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
