			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current in the fine gold coil creaked, and the air was filled with a slight sour taste. Why does WwW.XsHuotXT.com have this taste, is there the power of earth elements doping it? Siegel feels that there are still too many unknown things. The so-called sorcerer now looks like a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is a myriad of worlds, and the mystery you see is just a new mystery. Siegel remembered this sentence, and a sergeant inspired future generations in his research work. He whispered the words and then started the weapon beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is 20 meters long, with a thirteen-ton behemoth, and a small nail-sized projectile is sent out. The projectile collides with the air, and the heat generated by the friction evaporates all the raindrops along the way. The continuous loud noise is like a series of stunned thunder, which is very far in the rainy night. Maybe the guards of the castle will be very strange, obviously there is no lightning, how come the thunder? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the magic-enhanced vision, Siegel faintly saw the bullet hit the wall mountains. Its power was still very concentrated after flying for more than a dozen kilometers. The rock was drilled directly into it, and there was no chance of exploding. This power is enough to satisfy Siegel, not to mention the city wall, even if it is a fine gold golem, it can not bear several impacts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tested a few more rounds, this time with experience, first use the silent runestone to place near the exit of the hair device to eliminate noise. The continuous flash made Siegel very excited. He knew that he had found a new form of power. The infinite potential of the Urgian nuclear finally had a method of directed use. Although the elemental tide is powerful, it is regional destruction. Power, easy to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Single shots work well and accuracy is good." Siegel squinted and observed: "The weapon is much better than the goblin. There is no anti-drug counter." Shock, in the use of silent arrays to weaken the vibration of the air, the singer will not shake, basically where to hit. Next, is continuous s."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The so-called continuous hair s is uninterrupted s. This device consumes a lot of energy regardless of whether it is s. It doesn't require an explosion like a dynamite weapon once and for all, as long as the projectile is released and the energy is continuously supplied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate decision on the power limit is the stability of the device and the speed of the energy of the Mirecore. Siegel opened the legal hierarchy of higher creations. Continuously produce a fine gold projectile that can only exist for about one minute. The spell has been subtly improved, and the fine gold projectile is basically in the shape of a fine needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the fine needle at the end of the split ends is better, there must be a way to distinguish between the "first" and the "tail", which will undoubtedly increase the complexity of the hair device. degree. Siegel wants to know the maximum speed. Naturally try to push to the limit as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous projectiles have exceeded the resolving power of the r-eye, even if the magic-enhanced vision does not see anything. The extremely high-speed continuous metal torrents all vent the air on the route to form a vacuum road. For a moment, the whole world was silent, and only a thick line wrapped by lightning sprang from the exit of the s. The hum of the coil suddenly became quiet. The secret nuclear nuclear also twitched in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy focusing lens reacts immediately, and Siegel orders it to speed up the handling of the elements. This phenomenon caught the attention of some people in the Masters Federation, but they knew that only Siegel could command the energy to focus the lens, and did not ask more. Maybe someone who is messing with the transmission is overwhelmed by the elements? This is not the first time, and the assassin of the murderer has not tried to enter the city of Miele with a shadow. For the Master, these guys are too ignorant, even if the space lock is nothing to understand, the trade rushed into the death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlimited energy is transformed into infinite power, and Siegel looks at everything that is happening in front of him with a shocked eye, and for a moment he doesn’t know what face to face. . The rocks of the mountain peaks are pierced by continuous impact. Some of the mountain's structure collapsed and large chunks of rock fell down. It can be melted directly as soon as it hits the torrent of the projectile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with describing this scene in terms of melting, the stones, the soil and the vegetation attached to it are like flammable grass paper, which is broken into pieces. Small pieces, then red light, turned into rising smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No spell can match this power, even elemental tides don't work. Siegel called it "firepower", while praising it and fearing it. If you are standing opposite, it is not a city wall. Instead, what kind of spell spell can you use to resist this attack? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stopped the creation of the law, then stopped to send s, quietly thinking, what is the essence of power. Simply increase the output level of the element. Constantly pursuing in a higher and stronger direction? From the use of fire to the use of explosives, goblin has taken an important step; Siegel has taken a step from the use of wind to the use of electricity. What is the earth element? What about water? (Uranium and heavy water, this is the story of the later) The four elements actually have hidden power, so elemental aggregates are only the first step in exploring the truth of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not help but think of the power above the four elements. Just like space locks and eternal static stagnation are the key to becoming a sergeant. The two forces of space and time are the manifestations of another stage of the element. In this case, can you apply them to the weapons in your hands? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is hesitant. The power of the things he created has surpassed his defensive ability. Does it make sense to continue pushing it up? He believes that as long as he can grasp the position and be able to aim, even the saints can't resist, maybe even God... He takes back his thoughts and concentrates on the things in front of him. This is for research, want to know where the limits of magical power are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s arrogant, the limit of magical power, how can there be such an idea?" Siegel laughed at himself and then exhaled. If you don't try it, I am afraid that it will be troubled by this matter for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method of experimentation is very simple, he has this idea very early. Although he can't pause time, he has been able to use spells to change the flow of local time, compressing or lengthening them like springs. When the projectile is flying in the squirrel, the longer it accelerates, the faster it will be. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Siegel can't make longer hair slings indefinitely, so you don't have to wait for weapons to be released, and only the manufacturing cost can beat everything. He decided to use the rebound effect after the delay time to concentrate more energy in a shorter period of time. To put it bluntly, it is to remove the east wall to make up the Western Wall, but the Western Wall is originally intact. This can produce greater acceleration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel chanting spells, using the power of the elements to distort the time and space, making the speed of the severer extremely slow. The snoring disappeared completely, and even the light became dim. Sending a device is like going out of the world right away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space and time are one. Siegel has never had such a clear feeling. He must add the power of the transfer and space locks to ensure that the device remains in his grasp. If there is no such means, where will it go? Is it a void? This is another new issue that belongs to the ** division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I must be crazy to do this!" Siegel tried to maintain the spell, because the distortion of time has intensified. It will be harder and harder to control the problem. It's like pouring gold coins into the open hands, although the longer the harvest, the more the gold coins are on the ground. Siegel constantly reminds himself that he can only use his own magical power and cannot call the secret nuclear. The secret nuclear power is extremely powerful, but after all, it is a foreign object, which will make the Master miscalculate the situation. Moreover, the secret nuclear can still be prepared to supplement the energy consumption in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweat ran down from the Siegel forehead and was evaporated before waiting for it to drip. If at this time someone uses a spell like magic. The strong aura of Siegel can directly look after his eyes. Powerful, ingenious and extremely fast change speed must be at the same time, it is like holding a strong man with a needle, let him flash in the air, can not pierce his skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the singer, as the power of the Siegel spell continues to push up, the entire valley is beginning to have problems. Some plants grow fast, like a sudden experiencing spring, summer, autumn and winter, while others turn back time and become seeds again. The rain in the sky slammed down for a while, and suddenly rose again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master himself is also affected. The robe began to slap his body and began to slowly break. This is a symbol of the limit of control. If you continue, the caster cannot guarantee safety. Entering space cracks is already a dangerous thing. Not to mention the end of the vortex inhalation. Siegel released the control, just like releasing the trigger of the sling, while at the same time he placed the fine gold projectile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent flash and strong impact are generated from around the severing device, the time volatility becomes a substantial whip, slamming on Siegel, immediately touched The defensive array on his body. The light flashes, the element is four s. Siegel's triggered transmission took out the dangerous area and flew straight to the sky. After a full 1,000 meters, the impact was safely removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
