			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will never sit still, and the future he saw in the moment gave him a big warning. Www/xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party can pierce layers of magic protection with a dagger, so using a defensive staff to add more spells will be guaranteed? This is not necessarily the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s natural to use transmission or any door to escape, but the warning is not always available. The next time the enemy’s attack is re-emerged, Siegel is still so good. Opportunity? He wants to know where this assassin comes from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Release the hand and let the defensive staff stand on their own, and Siegel reached out and touched the black mace. When the shadow began to distort and gradually formed a figure, the mace hammer had already brought thousands of powers to the place where the assassin was "destined" to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serpentine dagger shines in the cold and stabs Siegel’s throat. But a strong hand has long waited on the way, grasping the assassin's wrist. Siegel flipped his wrist and writhed the enemy's arm and slammed the mace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the siege hammer hits the chest front, the assassin's bones and internal organs are ejected from behind, like the house destroyed by the storm, the furniture and furnishings inside. Fly out of the broken wall and roll it into the sky. The scene was a mess, the ground was full of fragments of bones and internal organs, and blood was spilled over the entire lookout tower. The assassin's pair of gray-blue eyes looked at Siegel with amazement, and his body was soft and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dressed in black and is a soft, light-absorbing and very close-fitting fabric. Siegel pulled off his mask and saw a white face without human face. It is a pathological paleness that does not see the sun all the year round. Almost some translucent skin flows with dull blood. Siegel simply searched, and his body had nothing but a strange dagger and a bag of coins in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Lord, the elf is surrounded!" Kenny shouted under the watchtower: "The ancient trees of war have begun to burn and can be retreated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. The order to retreat was issued. He can use the transmission to go directly back to the city, but it is better to take the next break with the same. Riding across the phantom, Siegel puts the snake-shaped dagger and black fabric away. A human assassin was encountered in the elf camp. This thing seems not so simple. Is this the killer of the elf, or the assassin sent by others? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry team completed the third sneak attack that day. From the northern part of the Elf camp, take a circle and return to the city of Mire. Almost everyone has injuries, but everyone has a victory. The war ancient trees with more than 20 elves were ignited in the raid, and it was impossible for the elf camp outside the city to organize a frontal siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the lord Mana is waiting in the courtyard, Siegel stopped in front of her, jumped off the horse and asked: "Has the south team left? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Lord Lord. Taking advantage of the elf camp, Janis has already set off with the goods."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. I think this time the elf must be vigilant all day long." Siegel said with a smile: "Every two or three hours, let the cavalry out of the city once, harass, but don't really pick up If there is a daytime to prevent the elves from sending out patrols, then Janis can safely leave and find the way to Uther."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the goods, Siegel is also mixed with other things. He made a transmission marker as the team advanced. He was able to sense the track when he was performing the transfer and selected it as the destination, so he could use the transfer to go to places he had never been to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Lord, this time, there are three hundred boxes of batteries that have been transported in the past?" Mana asked with some concern: "Do we have any?" Inventory?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head. The pipeline can indeed increase the speed of production of magic weapons. However, it is impossible to carry out indefinitely. These three hundred boxes of plasma pulp are the current stocks of the current secret city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this raid on the dawn, the city of Mithra temporarily solved the threat posed by the ancient trees of war. It is also possible to expose the presence of a large amount of plasma. If you continue to store a lot of ammunition in the castle, it is hard to hide. Siegel simply sent all the plasma to the brain and handed it over to Uther and other southern lords to arm them. Originally it was just an "uprising" that made small noises, and now it can gradually become a battle for liberation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kentucky Knights came over. Salute to Siegel and Mana. Siegel patted his shoulder, unplugged the broken arrow inserted on the breastplate, and said, "You have to be ready to return to the cliff manor. Can those knights who originally worked for you find it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenke’s one-eyed eyes excitement and nodded hard. "They have been working for Heim, fighting on the front line. If they can retake the manor, they will be very heroic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will let Zucker leads the soldiers to assist you, but you have to prepare for the hard battle.” Siegel said: “After recapture the castle, I hope that you can defend flexibly, don’t care too much about the walls and territories, just drag the elves. If you don't get rid of it, it's victory. Don't move back to the peasants until all the dust settles. The food in the city of Mier is enough, you can rest assured that it will be good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Unlike other lords, I will help you rebuild the Enkat Cliffs Manor, no matter what it is ultimately destroyed.” Siegel said: “You have to lead your knights and soldiers to live, fight, live and fight, understand? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenji kneels on one knee, bottom down, with boxing chest. "For the victory and honor of the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I know your loyalty and ability." Siegel smiled and raised him, then said "Go to arrange the injured, then go to the lobby for breakfast. I heard that the kitchen has prepared hot broth and freshly baked bread, as well as soft-smelling roast chicken. But don't drink too much alcohol, the wine will affect Fighting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry cheered, even one or two "Long live the squid lord." Siegel smiled and walked into the castle with Mana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has a small meeting room next to his large study, protected by a constant "Mage Chamber" spell, which is very suitable for secret talks. A layer of light gray mist covers the room, and the light and sound inside will not be revealed. Detective techniques, sharp-eyed eagle ears, and other prophetic spells cannot peep inside from the outside, but the inside can perceive the outside world as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three people in the room. Mana, Fezak and Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sits in a high-backed chair and summons the invisible servant to pour the drink for others. He took the long sword off his waist and leaned against the wall with the staff. Then took off the head and armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, you must pay attention to your own safety. Can not easily go to the battlefield." Fazak persuaded: "It is better to call Moore back from the starting point, for You play on the battlefield. In addition to him, now all the knights of Heim have been on the battlefield, I want him to have this experience too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you, Fitzk, but I won't turn Morr back.” Siegel said: “The situation at the starting point is not simpler than that of the city. The barbarian and the wandering magic beast have tried several times. Moore Why didn't you participate in the battle? You can rest assured. I think that Moore is like a younger brother. I know his skills, so I let him be alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faza Ke quickly expressed his gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a snake-shaped dagger and a black piece of cloth from his pocket and placed it on the table in front of two people. "I met a strange warrior in the Elf camp. He could pull out from the shadows, even without the slightest magical fluctuations. I killed the Assassin and found him to be a personal class. These are the things on him. Have you seen it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana has been a mercenary for a long time, and Fazak is a well-informed spy. They took a closer look at these two things and took a look at each other. Then he shook his head and said: "The Lord Lord, there is no clue from the weapons, we have not heard of organizations with such characteristics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this The fabric is very interesting,” Fitzk said. “I saw almost all kinds of goods in the entire New World through the hands of the orcs in Makarbu, but I have never seen anyone who can produce this kind of fabric. Only once The smugglers from the Old World used to bring a few feet of this cloth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old World?" Siegel said: "I have there and there. What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may be just a hiring assassination. The source of the killer cannot explain anything. The employer may be the New World." Mana said: "I will order the soldiers." Strengthening the patrol of the castle does not allow the assassin to have an opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
