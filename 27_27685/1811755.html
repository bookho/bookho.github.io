			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can't say that he is a proficient person, but at least he learned some things on the battlefield. Through the analysis of the current situation, he can see that the entire battle situation has been difficult to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc has taken over the village outside the castle, dismantled the house, and cleared out enough blades to attack. The rivers and the sea are also ships of orcs, and humans are difficult to fly. Even with this advantage, the orcs are still building engineering equipment, and patrols are not relaxed. Just a few moments later, there were several detective spells that were swept away from the place where Siegel was hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can the Holy One directly participate in the war?" Siegel held his chin and thought for a while: "How have I not heard of such a war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our holy people will not be directly shot unless the temple is attacked, fighting another holy person, or being directly provocative." Chanem Explain: "This is just a tacit agreement and not a restrictive rule. Even if the orc saints kill the entire city, there will be no additional losses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You have an idea." Siegel held his arms and looked at Chanem: "As a saint of the murder god, if your layout ability can not solve the current predicament, then it is true. There is no good way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney smiled and shook his head: "There is no layout, this is a good solution. We can wait for it. After a few days, the orcs occupied the city, and the things on the battlefield will end. By that time you and I will be able to compare . Yung began to start looking for something "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" You will not do this way, "Siegel know Chaney Farm perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want me to solve the orc, right?" Chanem snorted. "In my opinion, it is a quicker way to solve the human defending. The castle in whose hands has nothing to do with me, has nothing to do with our purpose. Siegel, I advise you not to blend your feelings into This matter comes because it will harm my interests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is nothing wrong with Chanem’s words. In addition to being a human compassion, Siegel does not need to be responsible for the human inhabitants of Blackwater Bay. They are neither his people nor asking for help from him, and it is easy to attract Leer's attention here. Leading to a loss of mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the castle is surrounded by ordinary robbers, there are no orc priests and holy people, things are not so troublesome. However, the situation in front of us is not solved by one or two magics, and even full combat is not always possible. Siegel looked at the orc's barracks. There is a close defense, except for Chanem, who can't find enough talent to sneak into it. Once the magic is used, it will immediately attract the attention of the orc priest. Even if Siegel summons the meteor to go down, as long as there is someone on the opposite side who can cast an anti-magic force field. It's easy to offset the threat of attack spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not impossible to be quiet, it’s not impossible to arrange a Knox-style squad to make the orc army gradually lose its fighting ability. This is a bit more A sound method. However, this method is not without loopholes: the orc saints will not receive the influence of the mind, and the magic fluctuations emitted by the Knox Faction are too characteristic, so it is easy to reminiscent of the synagogue and the west of the federation. Geer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't save them unless you give up the covert action and lead the prophet Lear." Chanem said to Siegel: "You don't want too Being too confident and thinking that you can solve all the troubles. It is actually an unreasonable pride and a source of failure. It is not bad that you can do one thing at a time. It is impossible to have everything in one place. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sighed deeply, holding his head on the floor. He did not give up, but also wrote and painted on the ground, calculating the trend of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t waste your energy, your intelligence and computing power can't solve all problems, especially when it's related to the orcs. For the orc saints Guy, unless you hit a big fight and beat him, he will never give up the attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to help the people inside." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still want to be the god of murder, become God in God!" Chanem sneered: "Wake up! If your mind is not clear, it will affect I get the fire. Then I will stop you. At that time, you will not only face an enemy of the orc saint. If you lead Lear, the plan fails, then I will be very angry. I will kill the whole town to vent your anger. You are the most It’s good to measure the dangers of intervening in the battle, not to cause a bigger disaster because of the kindness of the moment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. There is still a possibility." Chanem said: "Maybe the magical fire of the god of magic and prophecy is not in the castle, or the battle of the castle has no effect on the search for the fire. If this is the case, the sooner the completion The more you have the chance, the more you will save the people in this city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a fact, or it may just be an excuse to comfort and deceive Siegel. As a mortal, how many choices can he have? After hesitating for a while, Siegel nodded. "There is hope only if you act. It doesn't make sense to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people started to battle around the battlefield Walking around, at some distance, Siegel will stop to cast the positioning spells. However, this method of casting is only to continue to deceive Chanem, the real role has always been the Lord of the Rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They move from one side of the coast to the other, and the direction of the Lord of the Rings is always within the castle. After confirming this, both Siegel and Chanem felt that things were weird. Whether it is from the topography, topography or strategic point of view, there is nothing special about Blackwater Bay. Why did the magic god choose this place as a place to hide the power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need you to take a trip to the orc camp to inquire about something." Siegel still does not give up the idea of ​​rescue the castle, but he also knows that must take A more sloppy way. "A small castle is not a commercial place. Why do the orcs have to use such great strength to attack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanem is not a fool, he is slightly Thinking will know that this problem will help the action, so it does not contradict. The two agreed on the location of the meeting, and Chanet was short-skinned and turned into a shadow, plundering the orc's camp. A group of orc soldiers were logging nearby, and they didn't feel that they had one more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will naturally not wait in the same place. He came to the back of a low hill, which just blocked the sight between him and the orc camp. The things he has to do are very complicated, but only through this complicated means can the goal be achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel dug a scorpion from the soil, put it aside, and wrapped a magic nucleus with the wet mud that had just been dug. Later, he placed the mud pill in the palm of his hand and recited the spell while he was swearing. Soon the mud pill became smaller and smaller, and the magic crystal nuclei inside were crushed and reassembled many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He casts a spell on the mud pill, making the magic crystal nucleus the carrier of the spell. Then he took the donkey, and the spell controlled his action, letting it swallow the mud pill that was not the size of the needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蚯蚓Feeling physical discomfort, it cannot digest the magic crystal nucleus. Since the magic crystal nucleus was originally grown in the brain of a rabbit, it can exist for a long time in the living body without being excreted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic nucleus became the first carrier to store a message spell, followed by 蚯蚓. Siegel's spells lead to a group of small birds that are cut into pieces and fed to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds flew into the sky, and they flew to the Star City with the information of the Federation. The Royal Master is on top of the magical spaceship. If the information can be passed to them, the battle will be reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is over there, someone is casting magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than ten The elite orc warrior walked in a messy pace, dusty, and ran to the hills where Siegel escaped. They carried a slashing machete in their hands, and the blood stains left by the slashing battles had already merged with the steel. Only a few warriors can deal with it, but there is also an orc priest to follow, which gives them a certain resistance to spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is the death of the truth or the death of the emblem, Siegel can settle these orc patrols, but then will cause a series of troubles. How did these orcs die, who can kill a team of fighters so quickly, who has such a superior ability to cast spells? This will inevitably bring interest to the orc saints, and sooner or later will entangle the wizard on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect to come so fast, why are the orcs nervous?" Siegel used the speed of the elves to move quickly and evacuated to a farther place to wait and see. "The war situation is full of advantages. Even if we are to guard against the reinforcements of human beings, the camps should not be so windy. Especially the orcs, where is such a good military discipline, even if there are orcs and priests, it should not be so strict. What are they guarding against?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
