			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a torture to bring a boat to the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I used a sea boat to return from the northern part of the Walled Mountains, the Orcs have been performing well and there have been no signs of seasickness. However, on the star number, he was dizzy and even spit. "It must be the reason for the height." Zucker argued. However, he has a room with no windows at all. He can't see the outside situation at all. How can he know the height? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to comfort him, the star number lowered the height, basically flying against the sea level, I did not expect that the gram is actually good. He regained his energy and even enjoyed the scenery on the deck, without any previous symptoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the so-called orc can't go to heaven?" Siegel couldn't quite understand what was going on, because there was more mystery than Mike's illness. Things need him to study:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo actually learned a magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows that she likes to read books - second only to flying in the sky, is her second hobby - but she did not expect her to learn magic. As a magical spaceship, Xingsuo is able to cast a fixed number of spells. This was planned by Siegel at the beginning of the design and construction, and was completely prepared for flight and combat. This function comes from the core of the lamp god, and the core of the lamp god was originally designed to perform magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different lights can perform different magic, which is related to the manufacturer. Some lights can also use magic items, such as a spell wand, but never heard that a lamp god can learn magic by himself. Although Xingsuo only learned the simplest and basic spell of "reading magic", it also marked her qualification to be a true caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel began to teach her the basics of the spell and lay a solid foundation for her. Also with the Xingsuo is the gram, and he will now have one or two simple spells. Because only the Siegel family and the Raven Baron knew that the spacecraft was intelligent, he did not know the existence of the star, and he thought that it was specially taught to him, so he listened very carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Stars can continue to learn spells, then she will become incredibly powerful. Unlike other casters, the secret nuclear is part of the body of the star and is her heart. Being able to provide elemental support for her without any stagnation, even a magic dragon can not match this efficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem that exists is the spellcasting gesture. The star has no hands, so there is a certain disadvantage when building magic spells. Causes the spell to be released slowly and is very easy to fail. No gestures are a special skill, and generally only begin to become a formal mage, and Xingsuo will exercise this ability from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Siegel discovered that the star has a unique advantage: using the core and the secondary brain to take turns to meditate. When the core is meditating, the entire spacecraft must be controlled by Siegel. Nothing can be done without order. However, more than seventy pairs of secondary brains can be called for coordination, and meditation can also be performed. At this time, the main brain of Xingsuo can still maintain stable flight by using the remaining off-brain, which is equivalent to the ability to use one heart and two minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, delays in progress due to no spellcasting were chased back with the help of the secondary brain meditation. She is learning at the same speed as an ordinary human mage apprentice. In this respect, she certainly can't compare with the "genius" of Siegel, but she has never been able to compete with her master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several sea vessels are constantly being flown, and the star cable is flying close to the surface, so these ships can be encountered all day long. Compared with the magic spaceship, the three- and four-turn cargo ships are like kittens. Can only obey the post on the side. The flag of the Marquis of Heim was flying high at the bow, and the captain who saw this scene rushed to pay tribute to the ship. When they saw the magical spaceship, they couldn't help but envy, and if they could own a spaceship one day, it would be a real style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you fly at full speed, the star can reach the speed of the sound, and the whole voyage can be completed within a day or two. If there is a siegel help, it will be more fast. But in order to allow travel time for Evan's letter, she had to push her foot. If Evan did not reply to the letter, Siegel rushed to the kingdom with a magical spaceship, which was called disrespect. It even counted as a rebellion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don’t have a trans-continental transmission array, communication will be slower. At this time, Siegel had some mobile phones that missed Goblin. The function of global direct calling is indeed powerful. However, he does not have time to do this work now, and his own energy is occupied by another research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffin made of crystal exudes a chill, with a "body" lying in it. Vaguely already has the look of Siegel. The reason why it is not called a corpse is because it is still alive. Although you don't have breathing, you don't need to eat, but its heart does beat every day. Siegel used a variety of alchemy agents to promote its growth, allowing him to gradually approach the state of adulthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is bred with a small piece of meat on his own buttocks, using a lot of knowledge of Necromancer spells. The dead spirit creates spells that can create ghosts, corpses, mummies, and the like. Siegel has his own elemental corps, which is better commanded than the Necromancer, so this spell is rarely used. He just learned the spell, but he has not studied it in depth. It’s just that recently, two things plus a technique caught his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf mage "traitor" Idis left him a bottle of "life potion" and told him that this is a special product of the Masters Association, only those who are loyal Members can only get. Siegel only used it as a precious alchemy product, using a variety of animals and plants to extract vitality agents that can prolong life. Later on Earth, he obtained a complete "youth agent" manufacturing method, only to find that there is a subtle connection between the two. There are many traces of the Necromancer, the spell system, and the change spells in the life remedy. The youth pharmacy is a complete vitality refinement. The latter needs ** to refine a non-renewable anti-aging component, and only the talents derived from intelligent life can act on intelligent life. Siegel will certainly not kill others and satisfy themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to make a life remedy for the Masters Association has been impossible to deduct, but the Goblin's youth pharmacy gave him great inspiration. In addition, the goblin has a technique that uses part of the flesh and blood to cultivate the whole body. Although it is still in the experimental stage, it can be realized in the hands of Siegel with the help of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel cultivated himself and called it "cloning" in the language of the goblin. Combined with the idea of ​​astral projection, if your own body dies unexpectedly, then the spirit and soul will come to the clone and stand up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultivation of clones takes two to four months and is expensive, but if the spells work, then everything is worth it. This is the second life. Even if you can afford the price and the time you can afford it, you can have a third or fourth life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the clones are not intelligent at first, you can use the youthful medicine extracted from non-intelligent life to keep it young. This is why the heartbeat speed of the clone can be very slow, and when Siegel hangs down, he is still young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time, longevity, has always been the most difficult problem for the Master, in this respect the Elf has a natural advantage. Masters of other races must make choices when life is nearing the end, whether it is the end of life or the way to deceive the god of death. Most of the abilities have the option to turn yourself into a lich, or go to an outer plane with sufficient positive energy to extend your life – which is still good, at least autonomy is still in the hands. There are also some mages who choose to sign a contract with the devil to exchange for a longer life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few masters earned in this process, and most of the rest lost their soul and free will. The mages have been warned in this regard, but in the face of life and death, warnings are not necessarily useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master's Life Pharmacy is also a way out, but it is also a means of control. It is hard to say that Idis's "betrayal" is not affected by life pharmacy. Perhaps from the beginning, Edith was a staunch supporter of the Masters Association, and even if the Federation would be good to him, it would not eliminate the embarrassment of the Masters Association brought to him by the life pharmacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation will change now. As long as the cloning of Siegel is successful, it should be possible to get a lot of Masters from the Masters Association to the Federation, or to Siegel. Compared with prolonging life and keeping youth for a lifetime, I believe that the Masters prefer the latter. The rest is to measure the cost of getting this benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a more influential spell invention than the Peruvian nuclear, even this spell will be named after Siegel. Called Siegel cloning? It's better to call it squid cloning, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question now is how to experiment with this spell. Only killing the ontology can really verify the effect of the spell. It’s hard for Siegel to go to himself. After all, if the spell fails, it really dies. There is no way to reverse death. For example, a high-ranking priest can perform resurrection. There is a price for resurrection, and it depends on whether the person trying to resurrect is a believer. Even if an elf priest is pious again, it is impossible to resurrect an orc dead. The race of the orcs and elves has never stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
