			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green thin line fills every bone in the body, forming a complex swirling pattern, like the plasma grain on the ground, also emitting fluorescing Green light. Siegel sat quietly on the throne and waited for the "ceremony" to be completed. He is now able to feel the energy of the surrounding electric field, which is constantly being transmitted to the body through these green tattoos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These energies continue to strengthen his bone strength, at least to the level of granite, not to be broken. I don't know if I will feel faint when I change my body. This is a direct depiction on the bones! Siegel decided not to think about this matter, knowing that there is no better choice at the moment, only one step at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony took half an hour, maybe longer or shorter - there was no timer in the throne room, and Siegel couldn’t grasp the passage of time. speed. The ceremony is finally over, the head on the wall no longer releases light, and the shadow of Monroe speaks again: "Complete, you are free to move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sig He stood up and twisted each joint and found that the bones no longer emit the sound of the previous "squeaky" and became round and free. He turned on the vision and found that the surface of the bone had an almost transparent force field that supported and protected his body. He quietly felt that the electric energy was running through the lines, trying to get control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like when magic is applied, the elemental energy passes through the body, and the electrical energy is continuously completed from chaos to orderly reorganization. Although it is still impossible to understand the "reason" of the grain, Siegel gradually learned the "application." After meditation for a while, he can already turn on and off the absorption of electrical energy through the idea, just like igniting and extinguishing the oil lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I were you, I would hide everything on my body." Monroe reminded him: "In addition to the long sword, I suggest you not to bring anything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does the long sword not expose me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The trophy is carried "Allowed," Monroe explained. "But wearing armor is a shame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen the Nethered Warrior wearing metal armor. What is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is just a device that provides energy for him. It has no more protective power than your body. Unless it is near a Void." Or the environment filled with plasma like this, the lines on your body will not be of much use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the shackles that were destroyed by him. Siguel nodded and sat down again. He tried to use the control elements to control the energy flowing in the body of God, starting with the application of "electric claws." The green plasma and the lightning power extracted from the gas elements are different. It looks more docile but more embarrassing. He experienced a lot of failures and gradually found tips for controlling strength and how to cast. Siegel's palms were covered in a group of green light, and the condensed lightning power was hidden in the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, Monroe." Siegel said: "In this time, tell me as much as I should pay attention to."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not too hard to mix into the sculpt. Especially after getting the same body as they are. Because they all concentrate their active consciousness—that is, the “dominant”—hidden in a safe place, the Nethered Warrior who is out of the activity does not have much intelligence. They have no intention of acting guilty and acting aggressively. This is the same as ordinary undead, but can make optimal choices based on changes in the surrounding situation. They act like the army and serve the common goal: constant plunder, pulling countless worlds into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you pay attention to the control of your body shape, other Nethered Warriors will never doubt. But if it comes to the sense of dominance, it is only an instant thing to be seen. Although Siegel can hide the flesh, he can't hide the soul fire in his head. Unlike other smashed soul fires. Siegel’s soul fire contains complete personal ideas and is his own “master”. As long as you pay attention to the state of the soul fire, it is easy to pick him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be hundreds of fighters ready to undergo physical reinforcement, and I am responsible for selecting stronger ones to go to the end of the temple and receive the advent of the dominant consciousness. They will Become the leader, general and vanguard of the team.” Monroe said: “I can’t take you back without the command of the lord; and you can’t go to see the lord, so we’ll separate before we go to the temple, you can only Look for the portal here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to finding the portal from the Void Ship, there is actually another way." Monroe said: "You learn to dominate, hide the soul in the soul of the soul, and leave the body to undergo further transformation. I just receive it back to you. The information of the world. Take you back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What if I was killed in the soul of the soul?" Siegel shook his head: " I am not really resistant, but I don't want to be a general of the invaders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth is, your transformation is very successful." Monroe Said: "I don't know why, your body is perfect to undergo the plasma transformation, there is no trace of mistakes in the process. How does your body exercise, why not be damaged by the plasma. Always remain stable?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows that this is the credit of the scorpion. Since Monroe does not know, then it should not see the scorpion, just like everyone else. Siegel naturally does not expose the existence of the scorpion, he can only ambiguously erase this problem. For the next period of time, Monroe taught Siegel some methods of applying force fields and electric fields, at least to the extent of general resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to his Master training, Siegel is quick to manipulate energy. Because there is only one source of energy, Nexus continues to specialize in research, and this aspect is very profound. Many ideas have greatly expanded Siegel's vision and ideas. Nexus believes that the world is not composed of four major elements, but has four basic forces. Electricity is one of them. They worked hard to establish the four basic forces of the unified theory, and the other three types of electricity. When they finished, Nexus had enough theoretical support to conquer the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This method of Nexus is very interesting, and it is definitely a genius to sum up." Siegel sincerely admired: "But for me, How to treat the world is not important, how to treat the world is the key."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is why I choose to help you," Monroe said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I want to protect my own world?" Siegel doesn't understand: "I think everyone will face the refusal when they are faced with So choose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menro shook his head, "not because of this." He did not explain in detail, but said: "I will achieve the goal soon. "You are ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel put all his clothes into the pocket, and it has not failed to hide inside the skull. , attached to the inside of the skull. He only carries his own long sword. Like a normal Nethered Warrior, put it behind the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, avoid the lord, watch the patrolling beetles. Don't be too strange, be patient with everything. Entering the portal is a very dangerous adventure. If there is no chance, I can wait for me to come back again. As long as you are alive, as long as there is trust, there is always hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the lord asks you, you will Say it out?” Siegel finally asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I can't fight against the master." Monroe nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your honesty." Siegel's fingers swayed and hesitated, but eventually did not touch the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monroe looked at him quietly, without saying a word. The entire hall began to tremble, the head on the wall swayed, and Siegel and Monroe did not shake at all, and the body stood still straight. The throne hall has entered the world of material existence from the void, and they are about to reach their destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood behind the throne, like a sentinel. This is the position that dominates the guard. It is the only place in the entire hall that is not obvious. He quietly thought about it and compiled all the information from beginning to end. Then he took out the space bag again and put the dust of the stars into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monroe stood opposite him without a word, watching his moves, and then the figure began to fade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It has begun to land, and the bronze gate will open in a minute." Monroe said calmly: "You will face this ridiculous world alone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An adventure I never planned, full of surprises." Siegel said: "In the world conquered by Niles, how many Can you have an opportunity to go deep into the enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
