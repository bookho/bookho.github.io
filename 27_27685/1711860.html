			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet thought that the door opener would be the executioner, or to torture her morning priest, or this is Siegel, but never thought it would be Evan. As the younger brother of His Royal Highness, Janet has never regarded him as a potential target for help. What is this trick? Janet couldn't help but doubt that Evan did not seem to have any benefit at all. "Why are you saving me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be so embarrassed, I just found the opportunity to slip out." Evan said: "I don't want to wait for Siegel. Come and ask me, 'When did you help her before Janet died?' There is nothing wrong with it. Also, I see Cooper, who is in the morning temple, not pleasing to the eye. Right, do you want to escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet reached out and Evan slashed his sword. The platinum chain is cut neatly into two segments like a soft loaf, with no sound. The swordsmanship of the illegitimate child is very superb, and it can be seen in this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am in front, if there is a guard, I will lead them away." Evan took off his headscarf and licked his hair and became like grass. same. He also took out a leather bag from the back, which seemed to be drunk. Jenny nodded and planned the steps to escape. Too far away from the castle is also to find death, after all, the war is not over. What can be done now is to change into a half-orc hiding in the mountains, or directly fleeing in the orcs and fleeing north. Waiting for everything to calm down and come back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk is still great, but it is a desperate approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan stumbled like a drunk, especially when he crashed into the wall guarding his arms, his body was thick and smelly. . Janet marched in the shadows, taking care to avoid the light of the moon. The corners of the castle and the shadow of the pillars are her helpers, and the long-term training allows her to walk on the snow without leaving footprints. I remember that there is a slope in the southwest of the Black Blood Castle, always covered with snow, and the slope is relatively flat. It is a delusion to want to climb the wall from there. But it is not difficult to slide down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan to escape was terminated ten meters away from the slope. A strong light was shining on her, and the two priests were surrounded by the side. Janet raised her hand and surrendered. The end of the escaping now is to burn the ash from the sky to the ash - but it is good. At least it’s better than the death of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t want to escape, devil." The young pastor said, "You can't escape our tracking."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet turned his eyes. The mind laughs at the intelligence of the pastor. If she is really a devil, she has long since left the castle, can she move forward as slowly as she does now? If she is really a devil, how can she get rid of it, can't she kill two people? If she is really a devil, how could she not know that the platinum chain on her wrist is just to hide the positioning spell? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was taken to the cell again, but this time a paladin and a pastor stood outside the prison. Of course, the serious knight is also acting as a jailer outside the door. They are the real guards, and the people in the morning temple are only assisting. This kind of trick Janet sees too much, and there is no new idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count came before dawn, and his servant did not dare to tell the jailbreak before he woke up, for which the count was furious. The old man only cares about one question: "Who can help you escape, is there still your devil gang?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can enter and exit even in the school city. Is there any difficulty in a black blood castle in the district?” Janet said to him with a smile: “My buddies are too many, especially a pair of dumb and careless brothers.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't think it's so simple to be confused. Tomorrow's torture will continue, and this time no one else will pray for you." The count said: "The pastor of the morning god is very kind. But they are never merciful to evil. Especially the devil who presupposes misconduct. Although I see that you will feel sad when you mourn under the spell, you will never feel sympathy or stop it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you don't know why I am next to Master Lear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Lear Master makes the count a tight heart. But he left the cell quietly. Janet can only do this, so much can be said. The rest of her can only pray, hope that Siegel can safely save her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day she was taken to the trial hall, none of the audience. In the empty room, there was only Count Todd, Bishop Cooper and another pastor. Under the oppression of the gods, she said over and over again that she is not the truth of the devil, saying that she has nothing to do with the deficiencies of the prince, but this can only be exchanged for more powerful spells. Simultaneously. She still has to find a way to delay, and she must never say anything about stealing intelligence from Master Lear. Otherwise it is likely to cause immediate death. She tried to persevere and insisted on a luxury at the bottom of her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is obviously not finished. But several people who have already led the courtroom looked up and looked at the gate. I saw a violent flash blasting from the door, and the pieces of wood turned into dust during the flight, and the loud noise was transmitted at this time. The entire hall was faltering in the explosion, and the black-blooded castle swayed, and the whole rumbling echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel angered at the gate, and there was lightning at the top of his wand. The magical energy of the cockroach spreads around him in all directions, and drives his cloak for the cold, and the flag flutters behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet, I am coming." Siegel’s voice was not loud, but it was accurately transmitted to the kitten’s ear with the help of a spell. Her body trembled and turned sharply. When she saw everything that happened at the door, her tears squinted. She tried to get up, but her body was soft and weak, and her head was dizzy. As soon as Janet relaxed, she fell to the ground and passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stepped forward and mocked and said: "The adults are well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"A Master?" Pastor Cooper said: "You are what they said about Siegel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master did not immediately take care of him, Instead, check Janet's situation first. According to Siegel's shallow body knowledge, Janet seems to have no physical problems, mental fatigue and then too excited to lead to coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are too ridiculous to do this." Count Todd said: "Who gives your rights to the courtroom and interferes with the trial?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Myself." Siegel asked: "Here is the trial court? Who is the judge, who is Janet's defense? What charges is she accused? Why don't I? Knowing that the Temple of the Morning Temple has re-established the Hall of Religious Judgment, is the King dead, and the Prince has succeeded and revised the law?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Earl Todd Say: "Janet knows important information about the city's great prophet, Lear. Baron Siegel, I hope that you can cooperate with our work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If I say no?" Siegel is still very tough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Young Master, Mr. Baron, your spell is very powerful, but it is still vulnerable under the power of the Lord of the Morning," said Pastor Cooper. "But you only have one person, but we have dozens. There is nothing good about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you finally say this sentence That's right.” Siegel said with a smile: “Guess, as a mage, what kind of hands and feet will be on the castle around the orc, dare to rush in alone?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count sipped a breath of air. They have been low-key in the castle to avoid the attention of the orcs. If Siegel, who is a mage, uses magical means to send messages and let the orcs know the changes in the Black Blood Castle, then staying in the city will become trapped in the city, even in the city. As long as His Royal Highness is still here, the count will be a rat. This is especially true of the Temple of Dawn, the Masters of the Masters in Deepwater City, who are doing everything possible to weaken the influence of the Temple of the Morning, and hope that something will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't forget that you are a booked royal baron!" said the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you are right. I am a royal baron, and only Prince Aaron can command me in the entire castle." Siegel took off his cloak. Enclose Janet's thin body and hold her in his arms. "I want to take her to rest. If you dare to start from behind me, it is better to be stronger and faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd clenched his fist, The fingers tried to touch the sword's hilt several times, but they loosened. Pastor Cooper is also paying attention to the action of the Earl, and if the count orders him he will use the spell to leave two. Whether it is causing shock, paralysis or paralysis, the Lord of the Morning has given the corresponding emblem of the gods, neither causing damage or defeating the enemy. The power of these gods is not as good as the elemental spell of the Master, but it is faster than speed. Often when the fireball has not been released, the blow of divine power has already come to the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, he doesn’t dare to get started. The Master is too good at post-production, and he can't guess what Siegel's counter-measures are. Compared to a demon—Coperper has confirmed that Janet’s true lineage is not the devil—the life safety of His Royal Highness is even more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
