"Get ready to drill into the top of the channel! Knock it out!" he ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kein wearing heavy armor, even if there is acceleration, can not move with Siegel speed, not to mention his anti-magic force field, only Play the power of the body. The whole body sends out heavy footsteps, trying to catch up in the back, but still can not be pulled down. This distance is enough for Siegel to pass through a corner and use the invisible force field wall to support the passage when he does not pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mage who works underground all the year round, knows how to support the mine from collapsing, and naturally understands how to create the landslide in the intended way. The earth element turns all the rocks that can support the structure into soft soil. The only thing that can ensure the safety of the passage is the force field wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest set in the anti-magic field is not dived, elemental magic and summoning can not hurt him, so the Master has no effect on many means of attack. However, the pastor is also trapped, and he is unable to cast spells and receive no blessings. Fortunately, this is not an anti-magic light armor priest who is proficient in bows and arrows, so Siegel will feel a headache. Heavy iron cans are not really a threat, and the wizards are also very tacit, never pass the method of dealing with anti-magic warriors, so as to maintain sufficient tactical advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s robes are in the mouth of the passage, and Ke’s speeds up and catches up. He was born strong and strong, and wearing a full body for a few minutes was not a big burden, so he did not hesitate. When he entered the center of the passage, he heard a sound like a broken glass on his head. The force field was dispelled by the anti-magic field. The channel lost its support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, hòu has collapsed. More than a dozen tons of rock and soil fell from the sky. Buried him all underneath. The darkness and suffocation immediately caught him. Although the whole body did not let him die in the first time, he could not move at all. Even if he dispelled the anti-magic force field, he could not pray for divine blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel summoned a few flying ball of light to fly to the landslide, the ball of light shook a few times, but steadily stopped on the ruins. This shows that the anti-magic force field is over, so Siegel ordered the earth element drill to enter the pastor's life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not stop to wave, but walked in the other direction. It is good to circumvent the area of ​​the landslide. As long as there is traces of acid corrosion on the ground, it means that the mixed elements have been cleaned up, which is basically safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth element quickly caught up, holding a heart in his hand, it must have been taken from the priest of the murder god. Siegel ordered the earth element to open the way and blocked the arrow that was shot with his hard body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow passage has little place to escape, and Siegel continues to use the fireball spell to clear the way forward. He doesn't care how long the channel can support. There are earth elements around him that are not afraid of sudden landslides, and he can leave it here at any time with teleportation or use force field techniques to protect himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time you walk a distance, Siegel will perform an item locator to determine the position of several people in Evan. This underground site, which is as complex as a spider web, greatly affects the distance of positioning. And I have to test the speed of the Evin they are constantly moving dòng. Siegel almost lost the other side of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spotlight displayed by the positioning technique is no longer moved dòng, and Siegel speeds up and flies in that direction along with the fire element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A low humming sound came from the passage. However, hòu is an almost solid evil. Siegel felt Longwei from it, but it was different from the real dragon. It was not pure enough and not strong enough. In this channel, creatures that are more than the ogre body can't move freely. What is terrible even if the enemy sends a dragon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel quickly found himself wrong. The narrow passage is the best place for a creature to play, and that is the glue monster. The god of murder, or the god of colloidal ghosts, has sent his most capable men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacral gums rolled over and smelled the smell of Siegel. He exclaimed excitedly, screaming like the intense squeeze of the air. Siegel raised his hand and it was a lightning strike, but the scorpion glue monster was unaware of it, just shaking it, still moving forward without urgency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved his arms and used the flames, acid and ice in turn, but for the sacral glue, it only slowed down. Siegel’s injection into the body of the sacral gel is accelerated and absorbed, which is why it is not afraid of magical energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many mana do you want to destroy this huge volume?" Siegel stepped back and said: "The earth element, make me a thing around the past." The passage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rumble of the rumble, a road leading to the side appeared, and Siegel looked at the idea and dismissed it. The speed at which the earth elements are excavated is not as fast as the progress of the sacral glue. The only result of entering the channel is that it is blocked inside. If you continue to move backwards, it will take a while to return to the place where the slain slain priests are killed. It is also a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can use the transfer to leave, but want to come back to take a big risk. Transmitting is error-prone, so it has been very risky to transmit to the underground channel. As long as you are one or two meters above the ground, you may hit a rock into the rock. As long as it is transmitted, it can only return to the ground of the Shale Manor and attack with the elf's army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, Siegel suddenly had an idea, and there was one in the entire stronghold that was enough for the transfer to land safely. The large cave space used for training liàn is a few hundred meters wide and spacious. Let this glue monster slowly climb, wise people will not be with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel puts up two rune element guards. Hit a finger to first use the transmission array of the Elf Saint. Go back to the city of Miele. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun in winter is slightly pale. But for Siegel who stayed underground for a few days, it was still a bit dazzling. Next to the transmission array, the wizards of the three federations are studying this array and want to learn and crack the knowledge of the elves for their own use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am honored to meet you, Lord Siegel Master." The Masters closed the notebook and saluted him. “Welcome to the city of Mire.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good day." Siegel said. Compared to the chaotic battle scenes in the murderous gods, the tranquility of the city of Mith is like a paradise. "Mr. Wywood is nearby? Can you help me find him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Master is sorry, he is not in Myrtle now, but through The portal went to Kaibu Town. It is said that there was a battle there." A mage asked with an unexpected expression: "Is your army not there too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh, I guess it was missed with them," Siegel said. It seems that I found Weywood and opened a stable portal. However, the plan to use the power of the Peruvian nuclear power can only be put on hold. Siegel re-chanted the spell and sent himself to the underground square of the murder god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mage can only be sent to the place he has been to, so Dorn has the hope of keeping the elves out of the door. Although the elf's offensive is very fierce, the spell and the sword are very clever, but it is impossible to develop due to the terrain. The former clay warrior is almost ready to seal the entrance with a solidified stone body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Try to get around here and make a new channel." Elf Commander. Ranger Oster said: "Go and ask Druid to help, summon the worm that will dig the ground. Dig down from the side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage Master said The ground near this area has been reinforced with magical techniques, and the summoning objects are immobile. They are trying to break this layer of protection, so the road ahead is the only way."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oster looked at the still-sacred Elf Saints, and he was very anxious. The Elven War did not reach the pre-purpose, it was a failure, and the elves in the forest felt pressure. Although the saints did not say anything after the advent, the entire Presbyterian Church knew that if they could not satisfy the saints, they would lose their dominant position. This pressure is transmitted to the Ranger Oster who led the team, knowing that he must not fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is impossible to have this road up and down, this spiral staircase can't even transport the goods." He said: "I will immediately surround the surrounding world, must Find the passage where the army can enter and exit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
