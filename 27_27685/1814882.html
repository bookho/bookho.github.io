			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a huge gap between mortal and God. The most fundamental of these is the difference in carrying capacity. You can't expect to fill a cup. The water of the whole sea!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Lear’s tone, but it’s very weird from a little girl who is less than ten years old. She is also a black velvet blouse with bare feet, the difference is that there is a sky blue crutches in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the human old man is the goblin, why do you adopt that form, will it be related to the destroyed goblin world?" Siegel looked at the little girl When my face changed, I knew I was right. By conquering the world of goblin, the reputation of the Masters Association has reached its highest level, and Lehr has no room for development in it. At this time, the goblins are at a low point, they need a savior, and someone needs to lead the revival. Perhaps on the "Earth", there is no safe environment for them to survive, but the Goblin is naturally adapted to the underground life, and they may be able to develop new wizards and embark on a new journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is difficult, but through him, Lear can get more believers, believers of the magic god. Even if he no longer has a fire, he still can't change this habit. Or is he prepared to be able to go further when he returns? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe that's why the magical gods are stronger than what Chanem expects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a mage who used his own spell to replace the identity of the magic god, and thus became a god. But he could not bear the knowledge and power of God, leading to the whole world. There was a problem with the magic. A powerful magical empire was destroyed, and all the wizards were killed and wounded. He used his life and the sacrifice of the magical god to learn a lesson. If you embrace the fire, it will be the same. Everything you love, Heim Collar, Janet, Isaac, and the Confederation, will turn into a very splendid fireworks, or become a meteor, and will fall after the last light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The story I have heard, the whole universe is circulating this story, everyone knows." Siegel said: "I only know that the Master succeeded, and died. The magic goddess is dead but also alive. This story is told by the living, and I don't believe in the version that the magic god passed down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Reach out and reach out to the cold blue crystal St. began wrapping his arm, like a gentle lover actions touch. "Do you know what human strength comes from? That is doubt and hope. We will doubt everything, including the experience and lessons of our predecessors; we will repeat our mistakes and hold this hope of success; we will not learn, And I learned everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said: "What do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The little girl screamed and rushed to the side of the crystal with any door, and the long stick swung to Siegel's forehead. "Wait for you!" Siegel shorted, shunned the blow, and then took out the obsidian dagger to stab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seal power: memory transfer!" The obsidian dagger was inserted in the belly of the little girl, revealing a sharp point from behind. "Leer" knows that everything is a gesture of Siegel. She constantly ejects flames or lightning from her palm, but she is blocked by Siegel's ability to control her elements. Although Lear has mastered many methods of assassin's close combat, he can't play it in the body of a little girl. He is restrained by the spirit of the elves and the dwarfs. Coupled with the infinite elemental energy provided by the secret nuclear, "adults" quickly gained the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood continually sheds from the abdomen's knife wound, and the ground is quickly dyed into a wet, dark red. The dust of the star was drawn from the scabbard and joined the battle group. The long sword waved and the staff crossed, and Siegel finally seized an opportunity to kick Lear's blue staff out. Among the swords and swords, Lear’s young woman was in a body, and then she fell down with a broken heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is full of blood, but it is from the opponent, he has almost no wounds. The stick hit only caused bruises and bruises, thanks to the use of the Holy Spirit of the Orcs, which allowed him to have such tough skin. The obsidian dagger shines with light, trapping a ghost like Leon in a little girl. It struggles, screams, wants to detach before the body is completely dead, just as the lich returns to life and then reborn. The obsidian dagger can hold it tightly on the ground and not give it this chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death is coming, taking away this memory belonging to Lear. Siegel took a sigh of relief, regardless of the mud on the ground, sat down and took out the condensed medicinal herbs into the scorpion. With the two more elf biscuits, this will make your body feel better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the voice of Chanem, and it seemed that he was still alive and passed the test of the wild beast. In fact, there is no test. After all, all animals rest during sleep or die during sleep. The things that he promised were also to be done, so Siegel transferred to Chanem's five thousand points through the lamp god and waited for him to come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really beautiful, beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows what Chanem said Not him, but the magic god behind him. If you look at the fire for a long time, he will be attracted to himself and will always be addicted to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Chanem is not the first time to see the fire, the former god of colloidal ghosts contributed his experience, so he will be a few minutes later Come back to God. "I didn't expect that you actually followed your promise and brought me up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like to do this." Siegel simply Smiled, "But I have a question. If I touch the fire, will it really die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not 100%, there is always hope. Of course, your former mortal body is completely impossible, but the current body of the saints can provide a chance." Chanem spread his hand and rarely told the truth: "I also accepted the ghost of the gods. Power, now it's okay? If you want to increase your chances of success, don't be too greedy. Instead of wasting your power, don't swallow it all. I taught you how to tear the fire and the priesthood, which is inherited from ancient death. What is down is a unique secret. Without this, you are indeed a 100% death ending."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leer is dead, my purpose has been reached, You want it, you want it." Siegel shook his head and endured himself. The **, biting his lip, said: "I don't have to take unnecessary risks, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually give up at this time? You are timid ?? Chanem is somewhat incredible: "That is not an ordinary treasure, it is a fire! The magical fire of God and the priesthood, one of the strongest forces of the multiverse! Are you giving up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no giving up, but it is not interested at the moment. It may be that the previous battle is too intense. Anyway, you will tear the fire, you play it yourself." Siegel from the ground Sit up and come to the little girl's body, pull out the obsidian dagger and take it back. "Right, let me give you the obsidian dagger on Lear. It was made from pieces of scorpion. I have to take it back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With you "Zanem waved his hand and stood in front of the crystal." The sacred force was entangled in him, and he got in from his nose and got in through his pores, giving him a feeling of comfort. "You give up is the greatest help to me, I thank you, Siegel, sincerely!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel cuts the space barrier and puts the human old man The black meteorite dagger from Lear took it and carefully inserted it into the scabbard at the waist. In this way he has two, the other one in the hands of Evan, one in the magic tower of the Goblin world. He heard Channham’s thanks and he paused for a moment and hesitated for a while and then said, “I think things should not be that simple.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney Mum trembled and a drop of sweat flowed down. He asked: "What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it is about to fail, Lear’s transformed girl really wants to touch the crystal, it seems Take the lead to gain divine power. But she obviously can go directly to the other side of the crystal, not to attack me. She knows that Shenhuo has a great influence on us. We can't be faster than her, but why bother to do two? Things? This is totally inefficient. So, I think Lear probably has a backhand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, you are joking, why do you say it now? "Chaney screamed: "I have put my hands up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not take the initiative, but was attracted by the power, I do not know I feel awkward. The fire in the blue crystal shines, and the bang breaks through the bondage, igniting Chanem’s hands and climbing up the arm. There is no more refreshing pleasure, the only thing is the pain caused by energy shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the fire, it is a layer of devastating lightning, exactly the same power as the four-layer six-armed god. Siegel carefully studied the six-armed god and found that the original design did not destroy the lightning, which was completely self-generated behind. The original design of the lamp god is to manage all magic items, even including other layers of prophetic crystal ball, Warcraft wilderness, big library and one layer of copying, Siegel believes that even the top layer is under its management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
