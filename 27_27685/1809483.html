From now on - point 515 fans festival to enjoy double monthly tickets, other activities have to send red envelopes can also see a look! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one head of the lich is still very dangerous, the soul fire continues to provide negative energy support for it, the whole skull is like steamed, there are constantly The black haze is rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel lowered the staff that fired the positive energy and brought it closer to the Lich Alexander. The two opposite forces cancel each other out and reveal the skeleton of the lich itself. The staff continues to approach, and the positive energy acts directly on the body of the lich, producing a burning-like effect. Alexander screamed angrily: "Get away! You are the running dog of the morning god!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that you misunderstood something, the gods and positive energy are not interdependent Positive energy is just a rule that exists in the world. It is actually the same as the power of God." Siegel raised the hoe with the sword tip of the sword, and placed it in front of him, letting the eyes of the burning light blue soul fire Facing yourself. He sighed and said: "Survival or death, this is really a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a problem, you are dead, aren't you?" Alexander There was a burst of light in the eyes, and the mandible slammed open, and the death mantra was blurted out. As long as you can talk, this spell can be displayed, and there is no effect on the body. Siegel had precautions. His wrists shook. The sacred, undead-breaking star dust stirred in the skull. The soul fire was hit hard. The spells that had already reached the mouth could no longer remain focused. The word "destroy" only issued. The sound of "咩". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't bother to cast spells, you can't keep the spell model." Siegel shook his head and said to Alexander: "I know I accidentally lost." Your life, but this is not to let you kill the door? Can you tell me what happened, who is referring to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Siegel, I will be resurrected and come back to find you, hahaha!" The lich screamed wildly, trying to open his mouth and bite to Siegel. "I didn't expect you to turn yourself into a lich. It's rare to have such awareness at a young age! Faranes left you a lich medic. It was this plan. Let you master the lich's secret early. No one knows your true face, you hide yourself with positive energy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel puts his wand on his head, Alexander Surprised to find that positive energy did not hurt Siegel's body. "This is not a sorcerer body. I have not used the lich change to get eternal life. The successful cloning of recent experiments is a better choice." Siegel used psionic vision to observe carefully and tried to find clues in the soul of the lich. "How long have you been crazy? Even the color of the soul fire is different from before. Alexander, what have you experienced?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s your bastard!” The Lich just groaned a few words and didn’t explain to Siegel’s thoughts and dialogue. He constantly tried to anger Siegel in order to be able to be killed. Then resurrected from the life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not provoked - there is anger and disgust, but not to lose reason. He deliberately said: "When the lich resurrected and repaired the body, it slowly grew up, or did it complete suddenly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander suddenly silenced No words, the soul in the eye can not shake. As a lich, he is not afraid of destruction, because it can be born again after destruction. However, if it is used as an experimental object, it will be studied every moment, and such a day is definitely not as good as death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lion, you said, if one day you become a crazy and evil undead monster. Let me destroy you." Looking at the head of the lich with a look of pity, he solemnly said: "I have a way to make you unable to return to life and completely dissipate in this world, so before you really die, what other wishes do you have?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My wish is to let you bastard die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know you There are only two possibilities for coming from such a big hatred. First, you are completely mad, you have lost the most basic logic and control, even a qualified mage is not considered; the other may be that you are affected, Control, mistakenly regards me as the biggest enemy. With my understanding of you, the second possibility is higher. Because I know that your first death is defeated by the Knox Association ** Caspar On hand, it is possible that you have insufficient spell defenses for mental control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head. "I know the answer now. You are indeed controlled by the mind. You didn't answer any of the questions I had before. Just change the pattern and yell at me. And only this thing you said There is an unusually positive answer. Your soul is deeply trying to cover up the fact that you are controlled by the mind, just like you are constantly hypnotizing yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow The spirit of the demon trembled and then burned wildly. Siegel puts up the positive energy ray, but instead collects negative energy from his hand and transports it into the lich's skull. "You don't want to exhaust yourself. I won't let you be born again and threaten my family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waved his wand and cast a magical spell to the outside world, directly connecting to the extreme music. This is a world in which only goodness is formed, and only purely goodness is formed. Positive energy reaches its peak here, and the battle of order and chaos succumbs here. Many gods in the solar field settled here, and this is a terrible melting pot for undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will summon God here to give you directly to him. You will be thoroughly purified, and the soul fire will burn out. No matter your life." Where is it, it will be turned into fly ash together. In the extreme music, you have absolutely no chance to resurrect and reorganize. You said that I am right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soul of the lich's eyes is full of fire, and the original flame is now like a pillar of fire. He tried to commit suicide before entering the paradise, but Siegel did not even give him this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the extreme music, Siegel changed back to the mortal, and then was embraced by the positive energy here. His internal injuries and acne were quickly treated, and the exhausted spirit was swept away. However, he also knows that it cannot be left for a long time, otherwise the positive energy of the cockroach will hold him up like a balloon, and the flesh and blood will always have the moment to withstand the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil creature of the Lich enters the ecstasy, just like throwing a piece of black coal into the flour, don't make it more conspicuous. I haven't waited for Siegel to display the spell that summoned the gods. There are already four Peng Yu angels and two blazing gods flying over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of blasphemy, the existence of filth! Why did you, the mortal, enter the sacred land with the undead?" The sacred god of the three-meter-high glory opened With the wings of golden light, the epee in his hand scatters the divine light of sacred and dagger. His voice was low and majestic, and he challenged Siegel in a polite voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that with your ability to make the Lich completely disappear, leaving no trouble." Siegel is not afraid of the deterrent of the blazing god. He felt the power of more powerful quintessence from the little angel called Soka, and he had already had resilience. "I want to make sure that this lich is not born again, but I don't know where his life is, so I come directly to the paradise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not The problem. Purifying this evil undead is the force we are willing to exercise.” The left wing of the blazing god shivered, and the lich flew from the heart of Siegel to the air. Until this time, Alexander was still groaning, and the celestial gods served a little, and a group of positive energy condensed from the world of ecstasy completely wrapped the lich's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god of light and the sun of the sun. Use your power to purify the evil souls." The celestial gods have a message, and the angels gathered around join them. , common chanting spells. The lich who was surrounded by positive energy was not injured, and he looked at the light around him strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first he didn't know what it was doing, but he immediately felt the difference and then yelled. Lear, who was far away from the Tongtian Tower, felt that her waist was hot. It turned out that it was a problem with her own space bag. After opening, he saw that Alexander's defensive staff was burning, and a powerful positive energy flame burned everything. Completely cut off the possibility of the lich's rebirth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel! What is he doing?" Lear rushed to calm down and cast prophecy spells. He couldn't count Siegel, but he knew that Alexander had left the main material plane. Now he is in a paradise. How can he not immediately understand the truth of the matter? Lear sighed and emptied the residue left by the destruction of his life, then patted the dust on his hands and did not care to do what he was supposed to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander knows that this time is really dead, there will be no chance of resurrection. His undead body was shrouded in light and disappeared one inch and one inch. The light blue soul fire is gradually extinguished. However, after completely disappearing, a golden little flame was again raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Lear!" Alexander shouted with last strength: "Siegel, Lear, report for me..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
