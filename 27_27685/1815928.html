			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heam’s lord lord, commander of the Magic Warrior regiment, the female knight, Mana, gave up her son’s title, gave up the territory, and gave up at Heim. In all the duties of the collar, I made a paladin to the Temple of Magic. Although it is not certain whether she is the chief of the Paladin, but the current etiquette force is also the size of ten people, not as good as a patrol squad in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly a major change in the power class for Heim. Who can replace Mana in the position of the lord, who will be able to influence the direction of this powerful territory for a long time. The news that Siegel will hand over the position of the lord to his son Isaac has already been revealed. Everyone knows that the young lord is still very young and needs to be assisted in managing most of the territorial affairs for a long time. It’s not that the main mother, Janet, is not doing well. After all, she has no actual powers and responsibilities in Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, everyone wants to express themselves, but no one dares to take it easy. They are not faced with a simple Marquis lord, but a true God. Legend has it that God is omnipotent (when all the gods are together), and the temper sometimes becomes capricious. If you want to strive for further advancement in status, you need to find the right time, especially to wait for the mood of Siegel. time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are destined to be disappointed. When Janet was in a bad mood, Siegel was the first to bear the brunt and feel depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your temple is really interesting, one by one has passed." Janet held Megan and said while breastfeeding: "Good for that Ayr." Sha did not go, otherwise it is complete. They all say that the temple is the home of the gods, it seems that you really think so!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My home Here, around you, Isaac and Megan.” Siegel can only explain this: “When it comes back, who approved the request of Mana to give up the title and the vow of the Knight?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He found Isaac and approved it through the small council." Janet paused and said, "This... I know it. I couldn’t help it. Na Tie was determined to follow you as a paladin. She wanted to donate all her territory and property to the Temple of Magic, which was prevented by Isaac."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel snorted: "Don't hide for him. I can imagine how firm Mana was at the time, but Isaac did not do it." What he did. Mana is my loyal knight, only I can waive the oath. Even if I give the title to the Isaac, and before I agree to swear allegiance, Isaac There is no power to manage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oath? Mana did not break or pledge, she still loyal to you, because you are a magic god, she is magic God's paladin. It's more convenient now, she just can pray, you can hear it - don't tell me that you choose to listen and not listen, but you can hear it! And that Wendy must be in your ear !? Siegel chatter it, this thing makes me very unhappy, if not beat you, I will hit you! "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" just beat If you have a meal, you can do it anytime, I will definitely not fight back." Siegel said in front of Janet: "I respect your promise, I have strong restraint and restraint. You have to have this for me. Confidence. I can even cut off and send people to God’s fire and priesthood, just to complete Agreement between them. There are not a few things God can do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will listen to you and will look at you." Janet Pointing at Siegel, "The temple, you want to find someone who goes in and find someone to go in. There are two more I can't stop you. But don't forget, you are responsible for magic and knowledge, not impulsiveness and love. People stare at you, don't do things that destroy the present happiness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this verb seems to have passed, the atmosphere in the city of Mire is still not very good. Janet did not mention this matter, but I still rarely see a smile on my face. Siegel knows that it takes time, maybe it needs a distance, so that he is ready to start his trip to the north.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First When he went to the north, he was accompanied by Janet. The two did not know what was going on before, or they knew that there was danger in front but they didn’t care. At that time they marched like an outing and stopped when they met the river. Take the water, catch the fish, and shoot the animals with bows or magic when you meet the small animals. Never take them, but they have not grievanced themselves, so they go to the front line of the orc battlefield.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain the happiness of mortals, there must be afflictions of mortals, which are almost intractable contradictions for the gods. Perhaps it is not that the gods do not want to allow more time to exist by maintaining the universality, but they simply cannot do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was originally a distracting process. I walked back the road through my own feet and took a look at the scenery I used to experience the mood of the year. Siegel even found a place to make an oath under the stars, where there was no trace of camping, and it was covered with grass and sand like the surrounding. When I came to this place, Siegel did not feel happy, sad, nostalgic or jealous. It was completely calm like a stagnant water. This is the thing that scares him the most. At this time, even the small depression of Mire City is much better than the current state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "End this matter as soon as possible, then go home." Siegel wiped out the place where he camped by hand, combined with the transfer and any door, to speed up the progress pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs of the Northern Wilderness have stabilized their positions after years of war and began to multiply. The original Jackdaw tribe had the opportunity to completely break up the orc's social structure and solve the troubles of the North for many years. But in order to be a true northern king, Kerry mobilized the army to occupy the deep water city. The merchant union of the city’s lieutenant has long shifted the industry and property, some of them went to the rabbit ear port, and some went to the east continent. Kerry eventually got a city that was almost ruined, and war refugees who were eager to feed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did become the king of the North, but Deepwater City did not strengthen his power, but greatly slowed his pace. If you kill these tens of thousands of prisoners, or use them as slaves, it will probably arouse the crusade of all the countries of the New World. Even the Heim collar will have to send troops, which the cannibal tribe can't bear. Therefore, Kerry needs to spend a lot of effort in the rear to resettle these prisoners. Even the troops who could have traveled to the north have left a group at home to prevent "unstable" situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs got a chance to breathe and they hurry to survive. If they do not consider the means of their survival, the orcs and other races are not fundamentally different in terms of will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel continues to the north, to the wilderness where the physically strong orcs, trolls, and giants are not willing to go deep. There is almost no grass here, and all of them look like black gravel. Occasionally the soil is hidden in the cracks of the gravel, and no plants appear at all. In fact, there is often a storm here, and the edge of the stone like a razor sweeps across the earth, killing all the vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final decision on whether to survive is not the thickness of the steel armor, but whether the soil can grow green. This is the role of the mother of the earth and is the rule that belongs to it. Magic does not help this place. Even if the wall is used to block the storm, can it change the climate and geological environment of the whole place, and thus trigger the machine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also encountered such a storm on the way north. Black and gray, which cover the sky, the gravel constantly collides in the wind, giving off a sour tooth. In a flash, Siegel seemed to hear the sound of the waves breaking from the bow, and the vibration from his feet was like the bumps of the waves. He lowered his head and walked against the storm. The powerful body of the gods blessed these horrible blades, and the power of the mind slammed him firmly on the ground. He is a stronger force than this storm, and God can do better whether it is power or destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked out of the storm, there was only a layer of dust on his body and no other damage. But when he took the dust off, he was surprised to find that the dust was mixed with very tiny green. This root-rooted plant, which is even smaller than algae, is light and small, and the interior seems to be hollow. A gust of wind can be rolled up into the sky. They stubbornly survive in ridiculous places, never grow up, become low, but can live forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel carefully picked up some of the plants and sent them to their country of God. The Magic Academy, which was destroyed by his battle with Lear, is still being reorganized. The restoration of the building is only a matter of thought, but it is necessary to restore the room that was removed before, but wait until Siegel completely absorbs the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to the north, there is nothing on the ground, even the gravel does not exist. Here the flat is like the hall of the temple, the smooth, mirror-like slate continues from the foot to the end of the sky. There is no wind, no snow, no vegetation, no sound, it is an isolated and remote place. Looking at it, only the lightning that the wall of the storm is constantly emitting is the only thing that is still changing here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this anomaly is the wall of the storm. It is not just a collection of lightning, rain clouds and tornadoes, but a quencher of the rule of the crystal wall. The state of "existence" began to "dead" as it approached the wall of the storm, gradually becoming a state of nothingness. Among all the concepts, the most vulnerable is life, and it is also the earliest disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
