			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone gate closed quietly behind him, and Siegel did not notice that his attention now is on the gray shadow in front. As the distance shortened, he became more and more clear until he found that it was not a step at all, but the wreckage of some great creature. Straight spines and curved ribs fell to the ground, which was mistaken for a period of time. Beside the ribs, you can see the broken thick thigh bones. The bones are blown up by unknown forces. Like the honeycomb, it is obviously unable to support the huge body. From the spine back, the bones become thinner and thinner, eventually becoming a sharp tail with a length of ten meters; and from the spine forward, there are only a few broken cervical vertebrae. The wreckage stopped, so Siegel did not see the head of this monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the huge wreckage, there is a three-story cube building with a red body and a seemingly crystal surface that reflects the bright light under the light. . Each side of the cube is divided into nine pieces, and this image reminds Siegel of the Rubik's cube toy. There is an open door on each side of the building, but only one of the doors is filled with burnt marks - a high-temperature flame can melt even the walls of the crystal. Siegel thought of Elinte’s warning and decided to go into this door and have a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is wide open, you can see that there is a hall inside, the floor is covered with marble, and the black pillars support the room. Under the pillars, it is full of gold and silver treasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stumbled into the room, and he grabbed his mouth in surprise, or he would definitely scream in hysteria. The dwarf only said "you can be as rich as I am". At that time, Siegel had tried everything he could, but it was definitely not the scene. Layers of different sizes are piled up together, from the corners to the ceiling; jewels and jade are scattered all over the ground, like the fallen leaves covered in the late autumn forest – these should be the collection of dragons, mostly from the hills, Deep valleys are some uncut treasures. In addition, there are many artworks, decorations and fine weapons. Perhaps these are the collections of "magicians", perhaps the legacy of the "Dragon Warriors". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, these things are close at hand, Ren Jun collects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s knees in the middle of the hall could not be said in one sentence. He was so excited, his heart was beating wildly, but he still felt awkward and could not breathe enough air. The great wealth far exceeds his ability to withstand and is constantly tempting him—not to let him fall and evil, but to make him lost. The bright light of gold and silver shines on the body, as fascinating as the Holy Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sense of fear bursts from the depths of the soul, holding Siegel's throat tightly, and suddenly he becomes unable to breathe. The black-haired boy dropped the lighting stick and walked away from the door until he was no longer illuminated by the light of the treasure. After he devoted himself to the dark environment, he felt the "rope" on his neck relaxed a little. Siegel greedily breathed the air, re-experiencing a simple happiness of living, and then retching on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, he hasn’t eaten anything, and he hasn’t messed up around. After a while, the physiological reaction was terminated. He opened the water bladder and took a few mouthfuls. After a break, Siegel suddenly laughed, and at first he laughed and whispered, and later became a big laugh. This is not because of the ecstasy of getting great wealth, but by the jokes that I almost lost my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he entered the hall again, he had already controlled his emotions, he was still excited and happy, but he would not be crazy anymore. He picked up the gems from the ground and let them slide off the fingers like a waterfall. Listening to the sound of the crashing ground, and then only sigh: "This is much better than the poet's singer of the king's wealth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the coming up When it was light and simple, Siegel left the bag under the mountain, so there was not much to bring. He looked around and could only find some unusual treasures that were easy to carry. He stepped on the jewel and, according to his own preferences, first pulled out a few weapons buried inside. To his disappointment, several weapons were ritual decorations, made of rare and expensive materials, which had a high artistic value, but were not manufactured for practical use. There are two hands with long swords, but Siegel can't carry such cumbersome things. Only a pure black dagger attracted his mind. This dagger does not use metal, nor is it a crystal gem. It is just a black rocky rib, even without any signs of sharpening. However, Siegel gently rubbed his fingers on the surface of the dagger, and even if he did not touch the sharp place, he would still be swept away by the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good sharp dagger", Siegel exclaimed. There is a soft scabbard and its matching, can not see what animal skin is made, but it will not be injured by the dagger. Siegel puts this thing on the belt and throws away other items - and the second floor needs to go up and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a combination of study and bedroom. On one side of the wall are three bookshelves filled with books of varying thickness and thickness, a comfortable sofa and a set of copying tables next to the bookshelf. On the other side is a single bed, the thin silk made of silk is smashed, and a pillow embroidered with gold thread falls into the gap between the bed and the cupboard. It’s clean, just as soon as the owner has just left. Siegel couldn't help but scream: "Is there anyone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no echoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't scare yourself any more." Siegel looked around and opened the door next to him - behind It is a kitchen, cloakroom, storage room and toilet. He is sure that there is no one here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Master of the Commonwealth has not come here, what can I do?" Siegel scratched his chin and thought about it. He used the toilet here first, then found some bread from the kitchen, ate it with honey, and the taste was still good. There must be some power to save these things and protect them from time. Siegel does not understand the principle, but does not affect his use. Then the black-haired boy unpacked the quilt and tied the quilt with a rope, ready to use this as a pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He accidentally touched the pillow and dropped it from the gap in the bedside table to the ground, giving a crisp crash. Siegel was very strange and picked up the pillow. He saw a metal key on the ground, stringed into a necklace with silver wire, and should be hung around his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is unusually cold and uncomfortable to hold on the hand. The dwarf text is decorated on it, and the meaning is about "heart" and "door lock". Siegel's Elvish is already very good, the dwarf language is still a little worse, and the key is a rare dwarf dialect. Siegel can only recognize the meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a key that means unlocking." Siegel took the key to look around, for the first time, I couldn’t find the key to unlock it and couldn’t find it. The lock with the key is exactly the same. He said to himself: "Where is the lock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and a light appeared in the void in front of the key, even weaker than the candlelight. It is about the shape of a keyhole. Siegel's curiosity rose, the key was smashed in, and then volleyed. The spot is elongated and becomes a strip of long palms that then extend to the sides. Siegel held the key and looked at the light change until it volleyed to form a box with a shimmer. Inside the box is a separate space, about one arm deep, with two golden books, two small bags and two rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out two books and found that they were all the same. The cover was written with the study of Magical Decoration and two on the title page. Master's signature - Lynch and Ossos. He threw the book aside and found that the floating box would change position with the movement of the key, and he could take things in and out at will. Siegel only thought that this thing was very fun, and he threw a few books into the shelf. He wanted to close the "portable space" and tried to reach the middle of the box with the key. Sure enough, the space is still, then shrinks into spots, leaves the tip of the key, and disappears into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a good thing!" Siegel was so satisfied that he hung the key around his neck and put it with his icosah face. Then he took the silk pocket and went to the bottom floor, filling the gaps in the space first, and then stuffing things into the bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the lighting stick burned to the end, no longer shines, and the surroundings are immediately dark. Even in splendid gems, you can't shine in a dull environment. Siegel took the last light stick from the bag and was about to use it. He suddenly saw several bright lights in the cave outside the cube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately alerted him, this may only be entered by outsiders, perhaps the Master of the Commonwealth. Siegel had no time to run out of the Rubik's Cube, especially if there was no lighting at all - it would easily fall and make a leak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought about it, hid behind the gold nugget, blocked his head with a huge gold cup, and then weakened his breath. The light outside is getting closer and closer, and he also heard a few words that seemed to praise the spectacular bones. There are footsteps of three people, and the sound of bats flapping their wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps stopped outside the Rubik's Cube, and then it was like a singing voice. The bat screamed and flew near, then he heard the sound of lightning and thunder and a person's exclamation. Siegel resisted curiosity, motionless, just listening. After a while, there were explosions, loud lightnings and whistling winds. A hollowed out hand slowly walked into the right door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
