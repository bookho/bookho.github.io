			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Deepwater City, everyone has been licking Heimqiu, and now finally sees it. This is a plain that is cultivated by few people. There are sparse shrubs on the flat hills and large forests in the north, but there are only sporadic wild apple trees in the fields. A stream flows from the valley between the hills, and the frog's cry is faintly heard. Some gray waterfowl were alarmed by the team, flying from behind the reeds and screaming to fly into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven Baron flies high, so Siegel can see the land. The land named Heimchu is about fifty miles in length, but there are no other lords around, so there are no very accurate boundaries. Starting from the foothills of the Walled Mountain Range, a river channel called the Shield River is used as the central axis until it enters the two sides before the Heimian Sea. Within this range, there are three small villages where you can see the fields enclosed by simple fences, dry barns and a workshop for kiln firing. Some people in the village are catching fish in the river, but there will be no good harvest in the shallow river in the early spring. Some people are working in the fields, bending down and going to work hard. Siegel did not see any horses and horses, there were only a few scorpions in the village, and the dogs chased the hens in the courtyard: this is the territory of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the air did not find the hunter, but fortunately did not see the beast. It may be that the dead water marshes in the East have become obstacles for predators, and creatures like wolves cannot come from there. There are more terrible monsters in the legendary swamp, such as ghosts, fish monsters and arrogance, and Siegel will not be taken lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wall Mountain Range is in the western part of this plain, where the peaks are not as towering as the Mola's, except for the St. Joseph, which are basically under the clouds. As long as the weather is fine, you can see the peak. As the dawn rises, the sacred peaks slowly turn from gray to dazzling white, brightening the surroundings like white, as if the surrounding cliffs and valleys are full of sunshine. In the meantime, the sun seems to rise at the same time in both directions, and the brilliant golden light is projected on the hills of Heim. In the morning breeze. Siegel launched his own flag, and the nine-claw squid flag surrounded by magic runes fluttered in the wind. The Orc will stand up and beat hard. So in the loud noise, Siegel entered the first village with his own team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of situation made the villagers very scared. They have retreated into the house, only the brave man stood on the village entrance with a fork and stick. Siegel waved to stop the drums and then used his magic to strengthen his voice. So everyone in the village heard the words of the new lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Siegel, the first person of the squid family, the pioneer of the Deepwater City, the Royal Baron of the Star Kingdom. The lord of Heimchu. Here I It is announced that Heimqiu is under my management. All those who threaten the power of my territory and the lords are my enemies. The taxes you pay will be used to build castles and troops, in which you will be protected."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is three times in a row, deeply imprinted into everyone's mind. After that, Siegel let everyone stand up. The phantom saga carried him in the village, and Zucker, Mana, and Fitzak rode behind him. The half-orc twins carried the battle axe, holding the siegel’s flag and the three-peak tower symbol of the Mage’s Federation. . Followed step by step. The villagers knew that it was not the arrival of the bandit gang, but the "big man of the lord." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heimqiu has no lords, so there is no protection. The villagers living here can only rely on fragile wooden fences and muttering prayers to protect themselves. Even if they want to build a city wall, there is not enough manpower and technology. Don't say against the fierce robbers, ordinary beasts, diseases and even a heavy rain will put them in a difficult situation to develop. Without the lord, no one pays the salary, so it is difficult to attract professional craftsmen who have gone out of farming and eat by hand. This means that there is no blacksmith to repair the tools and no masonry to build the mill. The passing caravans will know the plight of the locals and will also raise the price of their goods, and the residents will not be able to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have long expected to have a lord. Let's build these long-awaited things. Their only requirement is the justice of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Lord, where is your castle built? Our village is willing to serve you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer you are to the lord's castle, the safer it will be and the more convenient your life will be. The villagers hope that there will be pubs in the castle, there will be temples, there will be barracks and markets. There will be a benevolent and impartial lord, and there will be everything that will enable them to lead a good life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My castle will be built at the foot of the city wall, St. Joseph provides me with the rock of the fortification, and the shield river will provide water for the moat, where the laborers will provide Can live in the city under priority." Siegel replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They laid down the camp next to a low hill, fixed the tent on the ground, and built a solid stove. The nearby Shield River can provide them with plenty of water, and there are forests not far away. Everything in this land is Siegel, as long as he has enough power to protect it. If it is a general lord, it will take a long time to patrol the territory, but as a mage, the magic pet raven has already seen the entire land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the camp is set up, Janet is preparing lunch for Siegel, and the servant Moore is helping to take care of the fire. They don't have much food, but they can exchange vegetables with people in the village. She is preparing to use beer and meat porridge, which is filled with garlic and mint, and has a rich flavor. After getting a few carrots, she washed it and smashed it into the porridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak came back when the food was ready. "The lord, the statistics, came out. There are more than 700 people in the three villages, most of them are Ordinary farmers, only a few self-study carpenters and potters. Now they seem to welcome you, and they have asked for help to build the castle. I asked a few of them, this land is not too peaceful, there have been The robbers such as the goblin climbed up from the rift and harassed the village. Sometimes there are bandits in the south. Because there is no money here, the bandits will not be able to fish and water to deceive the villagers. Fortunately, with the arrival of the Orc troops, I I think this will effectively curb these robbers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, almost the same as I expected." Siegel greets Fitzk, let him sit down together eat. "First solve the problem of the stomach, then let's go up the mountain and go see the money bag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people who know gold on the mountain, but only Siegel, Jenny Special, Mana, Zucker, Janis and Fitzak enter the mountain, others continue to build camps and surrounding guardrails. Before the walls are built, the camp will be the place where they live, and it is natural to be safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zucker and Fazak found a big bag. It contains hoes, pickaxes, shovel and claw hooks tied to the ropes. "It used to climb mountains and mine." Fazak said to Siegel with a smile: "Zike is very strong, and it is okay to give him a hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There is no need to bring these things." Siegel shook his head: "It is in vain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, do not need these things to climb the mountain and Excavating the mine?” Fitzak was very surprised to scratch his bare head. "Even if we don't dig today. Please try the soil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Siegel is very determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak is also not good enough to persuade, put down the bag, but still let Jack wear a pickaxe and rope, and he is carrying a shovel. These three things are the treasures of the miners. He does not believe that the mines and mines can leave these tools. Siegel just shook his head. With a few people tossing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy peak is white, and it shines like a light source in bright sunlight. The gold mine is not on the St. Joseph's Peak, otherwise the Platinum Dragon will never give up. A waterfall that passes through the shield river between St. Joseph's Peak, an unremarkable gray hill is the destination of Sigel's group of people. In the records of the Dwarf Library of Mora, the characteristics of this place are very obvious: "Beside the Shield River on the shore of St. Sergi, the gray hills are golden; the red soil is forgotten, and the gems are like stars."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet climbs lightly on a cliff like a happy springbok. She is responsible for finding a solid foothold and preventing loose stones from hitting others. Then she discovered that Siegel had cast a spell for everyone. Everyone is able to walk freely on a vertical cliff, like an agile spider. Janet looked at Siegel with a resentful eye until the wizard showed her flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼克 Look at the rope with the claw hook in his hand and sigh and wrap it around his waist. He understood that he couldn't use this thing when going up the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he climbed halfway up the hill, Siegel saw the red rock formation in the dwarf record. On the cliff in front of him, red and black rocks are stacked on top of each other, just like a page book. This strange terrain may only be known to the dwarfs who are proficient in rock. It is not that Siegel does not want to delve into the geological knowledge. All he needs is gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can we find the gold mine?" Janet asked: "Do you want to dig it from here?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't know the direction, it is very likely that you will find a vein in your life." Siegel took a gold coin from the purse. There used to be a lot of things like this orange orange, but now there is not much left. Using this gold coin as a spell medium, Siegel began to locate nearby homogeneous materials. He carefully controlled the spell and prevented it from shrouding in the direction of St. Joseph. It is estimated that the dragon, called Capricorn, absolutely does not like to have detective spells into her lair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
