			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stood in front of the door and jumped down in a cloak. Feeling bad in the mud, but I still feel that there should be a stone paved road under the mud. Siegel turned on the vision, there was no fluctuation in the magic around it. Are these amulets all deceptive? With such doubts, he grabbed the wooden door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the door frame has been in disrepair for a long time, it has already been separated from the wall, so when the wooden door is opened, there is a corner that has fallen into the mud and must be lifted up. Inside the humble huts is a very simple room with a reed-woven mat, a run-down long table, three chairs and a bed on the ground. A rusted iron stove was placed in the corner of the room, and a gray-haired old woman was boiling water with a kettle. She has already had a hunchback, her legs bent inward, and her body activity is very inconvenient. She coughed loudly, posing her dry hands, and said in a voice full of voice: "Come and come, rub your feet, then come in and sit down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp There is no holy emblem, nothing about religion or gods, no casting materials, but there is a cage with monkeys in the corner. The monkey is looking around with a vibrant eye, and it seems to be able to see human emotions. In addition, Siegel only saw some simple alchemy instruments - although they were disguised as ordinary pots and pans, they were all made of special materials, and Siegel would not admit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ghost fog swamps are full of ghosts, and it is dangerous to come in." The old woman used a twitching hand to pour hot tea on both of them. Come over. "Drink it, it's a sweet reed root, it's very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is basically not afraid of toxins, he can become awkward at any time to avoid this Types of damage. However, he glanced at it. The water was indeed the root of the reeds. The white and yellow yellow looked very good and exudes a bitter fragrance. Siegel took a sip and set aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old man, we came to you for the amulet." Siegel said: "It seems to have this. You can see the lord."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, amulet, who is not here for this?" The old woman moved to the chair and sat opposite Siegel. Said to him: "Come, let me show you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said according to the words. The old woman slid through his palm prints with rough knuckles and flipped back and forth over the palm of his hand. "Your experience is very strange. I have worked hard and have a sword. Now I have a good life. Um?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she looked at Moore again. Palm print, "A good boy, looks very hard, not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sniffed the smell of the two, nodded, then Take two amulets from your pocket: "Every ten gold coins," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is expensive." Siegel said, "Many people outside wear amulets, it is impossible to be this price, not everyone can afford it." Ten gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can afford it! I don't know if I can lick my nose. I can know if you are a bad person, you can know that you are very good. How much is it?" The old woman handed over the amulet. "Moreover, this can protect you from the threat of evil spirits, otherwise you can't move here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the hostile look outside, I think there is another main point Siegel had to save money and take the amulet. There is no magic fluctuation above, it is more like a certain totem token: "The old man, what is the evil spirit you said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a ghost fog swamp Eat monsters, then put on human skin and pretend to be normal. Try to get in. Many caravans have been attacked, and most of them have not bought amulets. Here, leaving the road is very dangerous, you must not go in; no The person with the amulet can't trust it. Be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the ghost fog swamp, is the original inhabitant of the wasteland dangerous?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Lord is very kind, let everyone live around the castle, it is safe." The old lady smiled, only the last tooth in her mouth is still stubbornly persisting . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All have been withdrawn, what do you eat? I don’t know if the mushrooms are grown enough. I heard that there are big mushrooms that even the wizard likes to eat. But I can't remember what the name is, is there still?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, we are leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Moore left the hut and hung the amulet on the chest. The surrounding eyes are much softer, no longer cold, cautious and hostile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards also took a sigh of relief, spread the original formation and returned to their respective positions. Siegel looked down at the amulet on his body, and he could not help but wonder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to see the lord need to pass through the layers, Siegel will go down to the pub to stop at the guidance of the villagers. There are a lot of idlers gathered here, and the shops that were not very spacious are crowded. Siegel feels that the mount is better than himself, at least it can take care of the single room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air in the pub is damp, mixed with the smell of inferior alcohol, sweaty smell and greasy food. If it is combined with the salty water of the sea, it is more like a cabin. Siegel walked through the crowded table and went straight to the front of the counter. The weapons on his body creaked, and many of them could raise their heads to look at their eyes, then they lowered their heads and carefully observed them with the cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the pub is a human with dwarf blood, thick and thick, with a thick voice talking and snoring. "What's the point?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out a gold coin: "Give everyone a glass of ale, count as my treat, then pour me two cups of honey Wine." He asked Moore to stand behind him and watch carefully around. The mermaid is mixed here and needs to be guarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss glanced at Siegel and muttered, and took out the pottery cup and placed it in front of the guest. Siegel took out a bright gold coin and placed it under one of the cups, then picked up another cup and waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a common way of inquiring about messages in a pub. The person who comes up with the cup needs to have the confidence to earn the money under the cup: or drink it and take it away. Or put down the cup again and pay for your own recklessness - usually the price of this glass of wine. But no matter who you are, you can't reveal the question of the questioner, so as not to cause unnecessary trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is another situation where the respondent breaks the cup. This shows that the questioner is deliberately looking for trouble, and everyone must work together to eliminate this troublemaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discerning eye knows that Siegel is from the outside, and his body is well equipped and he has a good style. Not a simple character. Many people hesitated, thinking that this gold coin is not good to earn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is very patient, the hand holding the cup is motionless, and erects his ears to listen to the sounds around him. after awhile. Finally, a young man wearing a leather armor and losing weight came over and moved his butt to the chair. There is a long dagger hanging from his waist, and it is estimated that there is another handle hidden in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the cup and then probed his ear. Siegel leaned down. In his ear he said four words: "Mage McGonagall". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s face changed, and the hand holding the cup shivered involuntarily, but he still raised his neck and drank the wine. He and Siegel turned in the direction and sat down at the bar, facing away from the pub's customers. As for the dwarf hotel owner, it happens to have something to do and give the space to these two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man wearing leather armor lowered his voice and said to Siegel: "If you want to know the general news, then a gold coin is enough. But If you want to hear the truth, then the price you open is not enough to make people risky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said: "Open a price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten gold coins. But don't pay from here, wait until you leave the pub and say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nodded and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage Master originally lived on a cliff on the east coast, where there was a stone house surrounded by some herbs. She used to come here to buy Grain and mushrooms, and sold her alchemy pharmacy. Later, some of her experiments had problems, which led to the swamp of the swamp, swallowing the open space of the wasteland. The lord convicted her and offered a reward of one hundred gold coins to her. For the first time, a lot of mercenaries are looking for her in the fog. From the news that has been obtained so far, no one can earn this bounty except for many missing people."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
