			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorne smiled at Siegel, the smile of the serpent, the smile of the fox. ※%※%, he spread his hands, closed his eyes, and kept whispering: "Darkness is my ally, darkness is my ally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Darkness is never an ally of all, fear is, but I have no fear when facing the enemy. Siegel step by step toward Dorn, getting faster and faster. The whole body of the soldiers was motionless and there was no thought of coming to the rescue. Where are the assassins? Siegel’s mind is very clear-headed, and he has always been eight-pointed to prepare for the assassin of the murder god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorn suddenly opened his eyes, but suddenly suddenly fell into absolute darkness. The brazier and the immortal flame can't be extinguished so fast, only the spell can do this. Siegel felt a wave of magic on his side, and the space was torn open with a small hole, which is surely the enemy cast a shadow jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly accelerated the front and broke the contact distance. The enemy could not touch him even if he used a long whip, not to mention the only flying knife in his hand. Shadow Assassin thought that darkness is his ally, but with the help of real visual spells, where is the darkness? Where is the disappearance? Unless these people have more than Siegel's magical level, the sneak caused by potions and magical items is meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two knives flew side by side to Siegel, and there was no sound of breaking the air. Obviously, the skill of this person throwing a flying knife was hard. Practice. Siegel used the elf to step a little, and he fell on the ground and rolled forward. He did not slow down the progress of the advancement, but also avoided the attack of the flying knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can see!" The attacker audified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spatial fluctuations of shadow jumping in the darkness are constantly occurring, and one after another black assassin is in front of Siegel. They all carry crossbows or shortbows, but the daggers and daggers hanging on their backs are also very threatening. Siegel is not worried about the shooting. Under his magical protection, these ordinary arrows without magical aura are not threatened. But his primary purpose is not to kill the temple. Instead, find the whereabouts of Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stopped and raised his empty right hand, and the runes on the gloves glowed. The element of fire obeys his call and quickly forms a hot circle of fire, encircling him in the middle. The bright light dispels the darkness and illuminates the narrow eyes of the assassins. Their pupils are shrinking rapidly in order to adapt to the transition from dark to bright. If an attack is launched at this time, it is difficult for these assassins to see Siegel's technique. Eighty percent is the end of the commandment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master did not attack, but was watching the opposite assassin at this time. Plus the people who just used the flying knife, a total of five men and two women. There is no mercy in their eyes, no hesitation, but no anger and honor. Blocking the enemy or killing the enemy is no different for them, just the difference between the missions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, only let Janet recognize himself, Siegel thought. His fingers twitched and his mouth sang like a music. The ring of fire that revolves around him suddenly splits into nine long tentacles, waving a few outwards, then slamming into the middle and squeezing into a small fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball gradually deepens from red. Eventually it turned into a dark flame. The flame grows wings and tail, and a small pointed mouth grows on the little head. Siegel used the flame to vividly reveal the image of the magical patron. Let it kiss on your shoulders intimately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that such a reminder is enough, Siegel has a long sword in his left hand, a burning flame in the palm of his right hand - the secret castle in his study There is a painting like this. Unfortunately, the opposite assassins did not respond, they still looked at him with a dull and calm expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the excellent assassins," Dorn said, holding the holy emblem on his chest, and said to Siegel in a proud tone: "You are now Are there any confidence to fight with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only seven? That is 5,600 gold coins, barely a good income." Siegel laughed, but his heart was extremely painful. "Send more people, don't worry about me. I am afraid that there are fakes among these people. The treacherous elves are not willing to pay for my money. I will put more heads back to compare insurance."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don snorted and shook his head: "Cheat you? You look too high, mercenary. Your ability is very good, but the only ending is to become a template for the glue soldier. If I let all the clay soldiers attack you, you have been besieged and died. But the promise is commitment, just like the vow. I will still give you the opportunity to confront you with the assassins."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not answer, but looked at the seven people in front of him silently. Is Janet out? Regeneration failure or identity exposure? What should I do now, grab these people one by one, and then use Knox's spells to control and mine the truth? Suddenly he was a little disheartened, only the magical power in the depths of his soul was ready to move. He wants to summon an endless flame and burn this place thoroughly into coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he did not move, the powerful magical fluctuations still emanate from him. The clay soldiers did not have a sharp sense, but the assassins clearly felt the threat. This is like facing a sleeping dragon. Although it does not release Longwei, it can cause the deepest fear in the heart with only eye contact. They clenched their bows and took a half step back to aim, but they did not report much confidence in the weapons in their opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel made a final attempt. He smiled and said to Dorn: "For my cat, in order to get rid of the devil's temptation, I I have to dig more gold from you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Dorn frowned and couldn’t understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one of his assassins can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha..." Siegel screamed and his eyes became red, like the lava flame when the volcano erupted: "You are going to die!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flamingo composed of black inflammation screamed, slamming its wings across the air and then exploding. The red fire rain fell from the sky, like the arrow rain from the military array, which is innumerable. Every drop of fire and rain is not very powerful, even lower than an arrow, but they are too many in number and too dense to be avoided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assassins pulled the trigger in their hands, and the arrow and arrow flew to Siegel. He didn't bother to avoid it. He just pushed his right hand forward. The wind blowing up by the element of gas was like a barrier wall, and the arrow was crushed from the air. The extremely compressed air rubs against each other, and the power of lightning is born. Like the madness of the snakes, the electric light shines on the human eye, and the boundary between light and shadow becomes blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assassins look at each other and shun them on both sides. Only Dorn did not react like that and still stood still. However, he has the refuge of the murder god, and the light emitted from the sacred emblem forms a protective cover to help him withstand the impact of the electro-optical network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire rain fell at this time, constantly hitting the body of a warrior. If they are wearing real armor, they will only be hurt and will not be physically damaged. Unfortunately, the funds of the Solidarity Committee are insufficient, and the thin iron sheet can only pray for the role of deterrence. The armor is also a clever woman. A large amount of armor was broken and the flame pierced the colloidal body. The Tin Warrior fell a lot and looked at Duan’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a comprehensive declaration of war, ah, subdue him!" Dorn waved his fist, and anger finally came up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not talk nonsense with him and concentrated on the assassins who rushed up. He knew that he couldn't fight at the same time with the seven assassins. Evan might be able to do it, but he didn't have the technology or the patience. He cast a flame shield on himself and took out a spell wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a stupid move to release the fireball yourself, but the protective power of the flame shield is enough to offset the damage, but the assassins are not so convenient. A burst of fire flashed, even an assassin who was quick and agile was inevitably injured. The flames climbed up on their clothes and burned their flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s these people who attacked the Elven Forest, causing problems with Janet’s reincarnation ceremony and triggering everything behind. Siegel looked at the wolverine postures they were escaping in the flames, and the anger in their hearts was ignited by hatred and burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An assassin used the shadow to jump to the side of Siegel, stabbing him with a short sword with poison in his hand. No matter where you hit, as long as you encounter blood, this poison can solve the remaining battles. Siegel did not give him this opportunity, and the sword swayed and turned off the attack of the short sword. Then he used the fireball spell to smash the assassin's teeth, then smashed it into his mouth and fired the fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bursting of the head flesh and blood, Siegel is still silent, just like just doing a trivial thing. His enthusiasm is not weaker than the assassin of the murderous god, but the strength and means are far above it. In a matter of seconds, he shocked other people, and no one dared to rush forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
