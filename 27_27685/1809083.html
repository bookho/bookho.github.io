			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick! Report this news to the Siegel Master as quickly as possible." Weywood will write a letter Give it to your falcon, then open the window and let it take off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The falcon stretched its wings and flew away from the magic ship with a slap in the foot. But a yellow light followed, and after the falcon was concentrated, it became a golden cage, trapping it in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't leave during the meeting. This is a confidential meeting. Only members of the federation can participate. Outsiders can't know." It sounded from midair and then saw the lion Alexander slowly descend. He has a fluffy blond hair with a slight curl, and his thick eyebrows reveals perseverance and majesty. It’s just his eyes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion Alexander was originally a black-like lion-like eye in the center of the gold, but now it’s blue and blue, like The clearest lake on the ice sheet reflects the color of the sky. The soul can be seen from these eyes, but only you can't see the anger. Alexander explained that this was the aftereffect of the magical battle. It existed in the Battle of the Three Peaks, but Weywood did not believe it. Even if he is not the chief mage of the Necromancer, Shelley, he still vaguely notices the atmosphere of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Williams is going to do something, everyone has speculation, but everyone knows that Siegel’s division has arranged an important task. Yesterday, William Fa came back, seriously injured, groggy and rarely awake. Returning with him is Lion King Alexander, whose eyes turn into the blue lion king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Three Peaks of the First World War only Siegel knows the result, all other wizards either die from elemental surges or die in the spells of the two subsequent divisions. So Alexander's participation in the war, and what became a lich was only known to Siegel and William. Most of the Masters of the Federation enthusiastically welcomed the return of the Lion King, and only a few people remained skeptical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander and everyone finished greeting, and began to visit the magic spaceship. When he saw the secret of the nuclear, he suddenly shot, using his own ability to assimilate the nuclear, and control to his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy first noticed that it was wrong, she found that the spacecraft’s protective law array had changed. Many parts are starting to get out of control. At the time, she had not linked this matter to the Peruvian nuclear power until after meeting with Weywood. Verwood and Siegel are as good at the spell system, and are more sensitive to the changes in the Urgian nuclear. When the two met, they thought it was an action specifically for the federation. The result can be catastrophic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only Siegel has the knowledge and ability to fully manipulate the secret nuclear power, and must be notified to him." Wendy took the initiative and split the action with Wiewood. At this time, they heard the meeting notice of the Federation Council and it was the highest level of security meeting. All members must attend immediately and the entire magical spacecraft is on alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wywood's Falcon was caught and Alexander reached out to the Falcon's paw. The falcon screamed and ate the bottle of the letter on the ankle. It also used 喙啄 to Alexander, but was easily flashed away by the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a clever bird, Wywood, your enemies are enviable." Alexander said: "You have also seen the one I have raised. The old yellow cat, unfortunately died in the Sanfeng Pagoda. Right, did you hear the meeting notice, go to the meeting together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are you joining? Council? How do I not know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I represent William. He has authorized me." Alexander smiled and replied: "I will listen, Don't talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodwood didn't believe this, but what? Although he has become a sergeant now, lion Alexandre has had a long history before. In the same level of confrontation, the Lion King has never lost. Wiewood suspects that the secret nuclear can now be controlled by the Lion King, and that there is no victory. The only way is to unite with other mages, so he must know what the Lion King is going to do before he can unite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are fighting with him now, then you can’t help with the whole incident. It’s better to hope that Wendy’s side will be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the federation is on alert. According to the design, the magic spacecraft immediately opened the space lock, and the transmission spells could not work. Ordinary summoning spells are too short to be used, and now it’s too late to hire a different helper. And the spell block that prevents the prophet from prying also blocks the role of messenger-like spells. Wendy thought about it and finally decided to run it for herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wendy designed and built most of the protective enchantments and knew how to reduce the dangers of being discovered. She came to the window of dumping garbage, found the time to avoid the detection of the array, and then jumped and fell directly from the spacecraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the spell is cast, it will be discovered, so Wendy will not show the feather until it is very close to the ground. The feathering slowed down part of the speed, but it still broke her more and more, just like she was about to fall apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I arrived in the city of Myrtle to find Janet, I was shocked by the hostess of Heim. After hearing about the great changes in the federation, Janet immediately alerted her to let Wendy use the trans-continental magical array to find Siegel, and he seized the Raven Baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Marquise, have you seen Master Wendy?" Alexander’s voice suddenly sounded from Janet’s side and shocked her directly. Looking around, the Lion King swayed beside him like a ghost, and a pair of blue eyes was heart-rending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...how did you come in? There is a magic defensive array!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Marquis knows, this is the secret between us." Alexander smiled and said: "Because of the care of the Marquis, I have today, I will personally thank him, but not now. I want to find the Federation's warmth. Master Ti, I saw her coming to you. In what direction, I don't know if you can point to one finger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is Heim's secret Seoul, the castle of the Siegel squid family! Please leave now!” Janet shouted and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't stay for a long time, just find Wendy and leave." Alexander did not put Janet in his eyes and looked around: " Wendy, Wendy... Your mouse is here, I know where you are, I will kill it if I don’t come out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Room The movement in the room was heard by the servant outside the door, and then immediately called the guard. They rushed in and kept the hostess behind. Janet gave her a wink. Then the head ring on the top of the head is activated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She disappeared from the crowd and then appeared next to Isaac. Janet picked up her son and was about to start the headband again, but saw that Lion King Alexander also flashed to her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I were you, I wouldn’t use that thing again. Because the next transmission will tear you into pieces." The lion pointed his fingers and then Said: "Send the head ring, Siegel really does not leave you a lot of good things. My request is not high, just give Wendy to me, everything will be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Junetra is with Isaac. Hide him behind him. The little guy waved the blunt-edged dagger in his hand, but tried to protect her by standing in front of her mother. "Leave the castle immediately, otherwise..." Janet didn't know what to say for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Otherwise?" Alexander laughed. "You are still protecting Wendy, the woman? I didn't go back to the federation for a long time, I know Wendy has a relationship with Siegel. She is robbing your husband, the Marquise. You thought Siegel was in the federation. What kind of spells do you use when you are studying? And who is practicing with them? I am afraid that the familiarity with Siegel’s body is clearer than you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shameless bastard, roll!" Janet glared at Isaac's ear and motioned for him to escape. If the Capricorn is here, the Dragon Girl's physical strength is especially restrained by the caster. Best suited to handle this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the mud man!" Janet said to her son: "Come, ask him to help!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lion King Alexander raised his hand and was about to point to Janet, only to hear a sharp scream, Raven Barron vacated from Janet's shoulder and rushed to Alexander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel's magic pet?" If you kill this magic pet, no matter how far away, Siegel will have a sense. He is not ready yet, and he does not want to face Siegel directly. So Alexander waved his hand and tried to force the raven with force-like spells. Solve this trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never thought that the Raven Baron opened his mouth and almost condensed into a substantial elemental energy that glowed. The elemental polymer almost instantly evacuated the power of the Mire energy core and compressed it into a structure similar to the four-pulse arrow. Then burst out suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
