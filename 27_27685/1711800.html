			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the banquet, the mercenaries were loud and noisy, swearing at the accents of various accents. They trampled the camp, and several people had fallen mud all over the body. Several people quarreled for a round ham, escalated from a dispute to a war, and even pulled out a knife. The sympathetic companions, who were still awake, held their hands and took them to the snow to wash their faces with cold snow. Pulling the knife near His Royal Highness is enough to beheaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility and the mercenaries were very clear, they did not care about the food for the dinner, but they went back to courtesy. If the time of the prince's presence is longer, then the table left to the nobles will not be so cold. It is a pity that Prince Aaron is still recovering, only toasting at the beginning of the game, and then accompanied by Count Todd back to his camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of eating outdoors is that the ventilation is good and the sound is not a headache. Siegel and Sir Bill, Janet and Evan sat together and often toasted with those who came to bless. But everyone controls the speed of drinking, and every time they just touch it a little - except for Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Baron Siegel, really a good name." This sentence Evan has said many times, but he is still endless. "When I met in Ximu Town, I never thought of this day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world is unpredictable." Sir Bill replied with a frown. He saw that Evan had been drunk, and he quietly took the bottle farther, putting bread, onions and fat mushrooms in front of him. "I have to say that the food in the endless basket is really good, and it won't be too much to eat a lot of times." He said, putting a plate with brown-red and hot sauce in front of Evan. Transfer his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured adults, I can eat myself." Evan flexibly bypassed all the food barriers and grabbed the red wine bottle: "You rest assured, I don't Will be drunk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't drink any more." Siegel also advised him: "If you drink too much, you can't talk, I am not easy. I can talk to you"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You love to listen to this sentence." Evan put down the wine glass and tilted his foot to the table, leaning against the chair. Shaking. "Siegel, I want to go out and take risks, rely on my swordsmanship to eat rice, will it be more free?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe we can go adventure together, Take a look at each place.” Siegel said excitedly: “I heard that there are still many treasures hidden in the wall mountains and hidden entrances to the underground world. Do you want to see them together?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ewen heard that he also had an interest, his eyes were shining, and he was about to agree. Sir Bill interrupted them and said, "I can't do it now. Siegel, Evan, now is not the time for you to take risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Why?" Evan was impatient and his body was shaking faster. "I want to leave, I don't have any knight vows, and I don't have a contract mercenary. You can't manage me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A morning guard, the guy can only deal with the novice at most, it is a display." Sir Bill's voice is lower, almost in Siegel and Evan's ear: "I believe that you can really protect your Highness, except How many people can you be outside of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked around, the mercenaries were more cheerful, and some people sang A cliché. These people are mostly people who do things with money and have no money to talk about. It is impossible to find responsibility and loyalty from them. Even if enough money is paid, the mercenaries are not disciplined enough to reach the level of escort. These talents can only help when they are scaring thieves and defending the beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the aristocrats accompanying them, each of them vowed, all for the benefit of the royal family, can be sacrificed at any time. But in fact they have the most thoughts and the most likely problems. And the relationship between the nobility is intricate, and even those who specialize in the history of the aristocracy can't judge the loyalty of each family. There aren't a few people available around the prince - this is the judgment of Sir Bill. After taking over the camp chores, Sir Bill was observing everyone to see if they were dangerous and would not be a factor of instability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They dare?" Evan snorted and said: "The combination of the royal family and the morning temple is enough to deter all enemies. Who dares to do it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, this spell is not common, and the temple will provide protection." Sir Bill said: "There is no lord who can sleep peacefully in the castle. OK, don't say more, and start to pay attention to observation. What if someone is messing up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, picking up the transitional crow from Janet and letting it fly into the sky. Although I enjoy the touch of the kitten's fingers, the magic pet and the wizard are one, so there is no loss of work and complaints. After Siegel became a baron, it seemed that Janet became shy in front of him, saying nothing in the afternoon, just silently following Siegel. Only when Siegel volunteered to ask her, she would use a short answer such as "Yes" and "Good",<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is trying to catch When I lived and asked her about her situation, I felt abnormal from the Raven. He stared at his own magical pet, and found through the eyes of the air that a group of four people were riding close to the camp. Three of them wore black cloaks to cover the armor and weapons underneath; the other tied a red cloak on the back, which was very visible in the snow. The four people are very skilled in riding, and even if they are in the wind, they should arrive at the camp very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel told the Jazz about this matter, he immediately alerted him, and greeted a few guys who usually had more points to add to the position of the sentinel. Evan was responsible for reporting the incident to Earl Todd, and by the way prepared armor and weapons. If you are coming from a friend, there is a banquet to entertain. If you are an enemy, you can't be unprepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd has not yet had time to appear, and the four have already entered the camp. Despite the heartache of those unscrupulous standing mercenaries, Sir Bill still had to change his face and greet him with a hard scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, brother." A group of four people jumped out of the horse and stood in the middle of the muddy camp. One of the black cloaks showed a yellow, broken tooth, squeezing a terrible smile: "Look for someone to help us look at the horse, my young master will come to see the prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know who asked for this honor?" Sir Bill held the hilt and stood in front of four people like a rock: "I don't see any badges on your armor. Where do you belong? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin man wearing a red cloak came forward and smiled and said: "Forgive them, they are just the big soldiers who have never seen the world, just think of our castle." The lords of the world are the only nobles in the world. Their loyalty and obedience are worthy of praise, and courtesy is never. I am Cathy Schlint, the Viscount of Bluff Slink, the lord of the Black Blood Castle is my father. The orcs' black blood proves that we are all heroic fighters and strong guards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I didn't see it when I passed Black Blood Fort last time. Have you. Can you have something to prove your identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the Southerners such a serious brain?" The red cloak shook his head and said: "There is not far from the battlefield. The armor on the armor will only make the orc's arrow more. I’m shooting it. If I didn’t come to see the prince, I wouldn’t wear this stupid red cloak. I didn’t bring the identity proof. I just asked if I wouldn’t let you see the prince?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This I can't answer you." Sir Bill can only answer this. “But we are hosting a banquet. You are welcome to taste our food and see if the drinks here are suitable for your taste.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It looks like it’s not needed We provide food, and you are very moisturized." Kathy untied the cloak and threw it to his companions behind him. He walked past Sir Bill and went straight to the banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clay legs, what do you eat?" He pulled the stool and sat up, picking up a meaty chew from the plate. . "Well, this garlic tastes good, the meat is also real pork. Where did you get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The royal family will always offer rewards to those who serve loyalty." A majestic voice came from behind him. Count Todd hurried to the back of the card and the surrounding mercenaries were quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card didn’t stop chewing at all, until the whole sausage disappeared, he turned his head and looked at the gray-haired Earl, sour. To: "You are not the prince, his grandfather is still possible. The food here looks very good, do you want to come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shilin Is the special family so rude?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
