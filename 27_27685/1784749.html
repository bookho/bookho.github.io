Then he moved his toes and stepped on the chair from the soft slippers, stretching a big lazy waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new magical array of the City of Mystery has cost him a lot of energy and has a lot of calculations and experiments every day. The cost of production of the entire phalanx exceeded expectations, but fortunately, Heim’s finances were not dragged down by it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has to be said to be a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not “robbing” Deepwater City, then moving away the most essential part of the Master’s Union, this magical array will surely make Siegel completely bankrupt . Although Fitzker complained about the empty vault more than once, he soon understood how the magical array could change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last piece of magic crystal was made three days ago, but Siegel did not immediately put it into use. The mage turned around and emptied his mind, abandoning the inherent thoughts that had been formed, and re-examined the design and function of the entire magic array. He self-examines with the attitude of a critic rather than a builder. After all, this is a giant magical array that is related to the security of the entire territory. There can be no flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up his wand from the table and waved a message, summoning Alfred to come. Later, he used the power of fire to heat the basin and washed his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a knock on the outside, and Alfred’s unchanging magnetic voice: "Lord Lord, what do you have to order?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opens automatically, and the new official manager of the city of Myrtle is standing straight. The cotton clothes on his body are always very decent and they are spotless. Compared to him, Siegel only felt that he was much more embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me two letters, one for the hub. The new hub of the princes has returned so long, and it is time to officially greet you. By the way Prepare some gifts, just follow the standard arrangement given by the count to the Viscounts, and there are more practical things. After all, it is very devastated by the war.” Siegel opened the closet, all of which are exactly the same mage robes, saving the choice. The tedious. He finds the one that looks the latest. Throw in the chair and start picking the shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is another letter to?" Alfred asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought about it, you still have to find someone to run for yourself." Siegel said: "Do you know the residence of Master Wendy? Tell her. The Magic Array will be opened tomorrow, in accordance with the agreement reached in advance, and she will be invited to visit and hope that she will keep it confidential in accordance with the practice of the Federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wenty Miss will hear this news will come." Aide said with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel extended a finger and slammed the door closed. He changed his clothes and closed his eyes to feel it. Determine the location of the magic pet. Then he used his fingers to play the magical movement, tearing the air in front of him and stepping into the room belonging to Isaac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired little guy has learned to crawl, so Siegel let the servant specialize in picking up a house, except for the soft carpet and pillows. None, as a little guy's activity room. Most of the fabrics come from the Jackdaw tribe, or the jackdaw collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaac saw his father and immediately called "Dad! Dad!" and struggled to climb out of the hands of Capricorn. The dragon girl grinned and took a picture on Isaac's ass. Then "released the hostage." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel squatted down, waited for Isaac to climb over, and then triumphantly picked him up and kissed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little guy was tired for a while, hit a few yawns, and then fell asleep with a soft velvet mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you do just now, why Isaac is so tired?" Siegel frowned and gave his son a silence to keep the sound around. Will affect his sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am teaching him to walk. The human child is too ugly to climb up, stupid and slow. So let him learn to go!" Roll it on the carpet and curl it into the pillow. Her long hair was spread out, as the quilt covered the curve of the body, the eyes of the different colors with a lazy look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be small, the toughness of the dragon body, how much fluctuation can you cause?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The element surge level." Siegel saw the dragon girl The body trembled a bit and said with satisfaction: "So, take a break tomorrow. Or you can go back to St. Joseph. You don't worry about your cave being discovered by adventurers, and then losing some treasure?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn squatted straight, his eyes flashing, watching Siegel with a sceptical look. Her mind turned fast, trying to figure out what the Master said was profound. It is said that the human masters are very embarrassed. They deceive the dragons and cultivate various dragon warriors. These are all mentioned in the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel didn’t lie to her. All that was said before was done: the array of elements that enhance the concentration of elements, the receivers that carry them, and the magic of transmission. Tricks. In addition, he accepted her like a family member, let her live in a comfortable castle, and assuredly placed her newborn child under her care. In the city of Miele, she finally realized what is the power of family and family. Now think back, the cave filled with treasures seems to have no big attraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only so many souvenirs left by her father are needed to get it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Capricorn blinked and lay on his back on the floor and stretched out. The slacked top was smashed up, revealing a white, flat belly. According to the habits of animals and beasts, revealing the belly is a symbol of trust and obedience, and has similar meanings for dragons. However, Siegel paid too much attention to Isaac and did not think of this layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master just raised his hand and let the tapestry on the wall fly down and cover the dragon girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember, don't rush to absorb elemental energy tomorrow." The mage groaned and walked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon girl wrapped her blanket and covered her cheek, and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn silk appeared before the dawn of the second day, and opened its wings and flew away from the city of Miele. She naturally did not forget the invisibility, otherwise people in the entire city will be awakened. Half an hour later, Platinum Dragon returned to his original cave. In her memory, it was once a quiet, gentle and comfortable place, but now there are only cold rocks and gold and silver treasures reflecting the cold light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She threw herself into the treasure pile in the shape of a dragon, letting the hard scales rub against the metal and the gemstones, and made a deafening noise. The dragon is rolling, jumping, snorkeling, trying to smash on the rocks and treasures. Her original platinum scales are constantly falling, and new scales are generated below. This is a feeling of pain and itching. The instinct drives the Capricorn to constantly change the outer skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first sunshine came in from the hole in the morning, the dragon girl finally stopped exercising and panted on the ground. Her fading scales turned into white gold coins, and the dragon skin became a magic scroll. They are all mixed in the treasure heap. Some of the dragon's blood oozing from the skin turns into a ruby, which contains the power of a single element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earliest white gold coins, magic scrolls, and magic gems are fallen from the sheer magic dragon. When the elves learned magic from the dragon, they were inspired by these, replacing the dragon skin with paper and creating a new generation of magic scrolls. They also use elemental gems to dope with other substances. Made a general casting material powder, which makes magic develop in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as the war increased, the sheer number of pure magic dragons became less and less, and this truth gradually drowned in the long history. Even Capricorn looked at the things that he had fallen, and he thought that he had some strange disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is somewhat different from the past, and the scales are softer and more resilient. A thin layer of force is placed on the periphery of her body, and the sword and magic of the sword cannot destroy the protection of the force field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's claws are shining with purple light, which makes it easy to introduce the power of the elements. Capricorn tried it, and as long as she read the correct spell, she could cast various spells like a mage. The purple claw is the wand. Ordinary dragons can only release specific spells depending on the color, but the magic dragon can learn spells, or dig from the blood heritage to those dragon magic that have not appeared for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obvious benefit of using the dragon's body to cast magic is to be able to mobilize and withstand more powerful elemental energy and magical fluctuations. The human and elf mage are physically limited and rarely able to exert the full power of the spell—they can only do it with the help of a joint spell or a magical array—the Capricorn is no longer restricted by this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
