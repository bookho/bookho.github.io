The pile of shining golden letters is even more striking, especially on dark nights, whose light exceeds the moon, which has seriously affected the mage's observation of the astrology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the Masters Association, there are many stories about the Union’s sergeant Siegel. His rise is amazing, and he has grown up to be a person who needs to look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People mostly only have people who are stronger and stronger than themselves, but it is difficult to have a heart for the genius who completely surpasses himself. Siegel has become a sergeant in a few years, and it has exceeded the understanding of everyone, so the feeling of awe will be more. Later, I heard that he became another Master of the Master, and he was using his magical power to transform and rule the New World. Even the Federation became his one. Seeing that a new spell dictator is rising, the association’s mages are filled with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the propaganda of the association, Siegel will most likely follow the footsteps of a mage lord and bring a new round of "caster tyrant" image . Although many mages also feel that the Masters Association is somewhat old and rigid, it exists at least for the purpose of researching and preserving spells, and will never become a springboard for some people to compete for power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that some people feel that they are so good until they slap their faces. The distant squid baron drove his boat to the edge of the Tongtian Tower, and the golden declaration was lifted all day at the bow. Exchange high-quality spell reels with cloning services? This is obviously the use of the Masters Association as a market in a certain country, and he is a nobleman riding a high horse. "Take me the game, I will bless you." The wizard of the association is such a feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day, everyone just watched the fun, but when the setting sun fell, the words "Praying" disappeared like a blue sky, and the Association Master was shocked. Mind. Who is it, who made a deal with Siegel Squid and gave him a scroll of prayer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have guessed which lucky guy is, but they don’t know that this is just the illusion that Siegel made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Siegel, the prejudiced mages can not like it, but this impression does not affect the spells he invented. The energy focusing lens, or the venus virus No. 1 is his earliest masterpiece. The plasma technology that dominates the void is highly targeted and poses a huge threat to them. The wizards of the association also have a certain reputation in the outer plane, and some worlds that are worried about the threat of the brackets will also invite the masters of the association to study the subsequent versions of the venus virus No.1. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters Association never told this news to Siegel, and took advantage of it alone. Their reasons are very good. Siegel has "sent" this spell to the association, and the latter things have little to do with him. It is said that the refractory virus No. 1 was modified in the energy focusing lens spell, and it has been different. The foreigners are looking for the developers of the Nile virus No. 1 spell. Isn't that the Master Association? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windings are not known to every mage, and many people are still immersed in glory. However, the appearance of the secret nuclear core made the wizards very shocked. Unlimited energy. This can be regarded as a reform of the world in any world, and actually let him finish! The association immediately began its own research on nuclear energy, and relied on "intelligence" to imitate two energy cores. Although the experiment failed and caused an explosion, the association proved that it was able to do the same thing, which greatly reduced the enchanting degree of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect him to have cloned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news from the Starry Kingdom has confirmed that cloning is a very effective spell of resurrection, escape, and youthfulness, without the need to pay for money and casting materials. Any price. In addition, it can be used to treat certain physical acquired damage or to remove some stubborn symptoms associated with the body. Any of the above can be done by the past Master. Can only seek the service of the temple and the help of the gods. Now, the situation has completely changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once forty-four thousand gold coins, each year, Sigel can provide five places. It is said that everyone who is resurrected needs to report to the royal family and get the approval of the king. But even the royal family wants to make clones, they need to find Siegel. This kind of reporting system is just a form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that a life has finally got the price, that is 440,000 gold coins. This is not a small amount of money, even for the Master, it is difficult to get it. However, Siegel does not only have gold coins, magic items, casting materials or other rare items are more suitable than gold coins. They heard that the skull of a dragon is estimated to be 50,000 gold coins within the association. Then there is a service fee of 80,000 to 100,000 in Siegel, and other magic items are similar. After all, Heim's collar is the world's premier rich territory, and Siegel, as the lord, certainly does not lack gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an evil act to become an undead, because the wizard who becomes a lich will eventually be affected by negative energy and become a selfish, terrible, evil monster. The Masters Association and the Temple of the Morning God have cooperated in this area to hunt down the incurable lichs. The folks rarely hear the evil things of the lich. It is also mainly due to the deterrence of the two organizations. The lich is not a fool, so big in the multiverse, where can I go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacture of the Lich Pharmacy requires 120,000 gold coins and damages both body and intelligence. These 120,000 gold coins are the cost of a successful, waste-free situation, and do not include research costs. Every mage must make his own lich remedy, and he can only take effect on himself. Others can't help it. And forty-four thousand gold coins can guarantee that they will live more once, have no side effects, and can regain their youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not because of the contradiction between the Masters Association and the Federation, the Master has long been looking for Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a very small number of mentors know the existence of the life extension pharmacy and are eligible to use their own contribution to the association to change this pharmacy. Contributing to this kind of thing is imaginary, not as versatile as for 440,000 gold coins. Moreover, the life-extending agent is only valid for 20 years, and it does not have the effect of saving lives. It is completely inferior to cloning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Siegel’s magical spacecraft came outside the Tongtian Tower, many of the Master’s hearts had already wavered, and many people were already tempted, just didn’t know Whether this will cause opposition from the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the Masters Association?" Siegel poured a glass of cool mint on the opposite division of the department, Shaw Gerard. "I know what the Masters Association is, but who is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerard's face is thin, a pair of big eyes twinkling with light, laughing and saying: "This Can things be kept secret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no problem, you say an address, and after two months I will send the completed clone to the specified location." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the last question, is cloning safe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded . "I have been a major threat to the Masters Association for a long time. In the past, I only dared to operate within the scope of the Peruvian nuclear. I can't say that it was a last resort to create a magical spaceship, but this is indeed one of the reasons that affected this incident. Now there is After the cloning, I was more reassured. Even if some people in the association decided to attack my magic ship and kill me, I could stand up again. One person can only have one bottle of witch medic or life extension pharmacy at a time. But there are many clones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaw Gerard brows slightly wrinkled. He knew that this was what Siegel deliberately said, just to listen to the seniors of the Masters Association. For a long time, the Masters Association has different opinions on how to deal with the Federation. However, the clerk Leer is fully committed to promoting the blockade of the Federation. Other Masters feel that there is no need to oppose Leer, so they will let it go. But he never knew what "life threat"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just came to exchange, high-quality spell scrolls for cloning. As for you and the Masters Association, and the Federation and the Masters Association..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel followed his words: "Not within this agreement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gerard drank the mint before him and stood up to reach out to Siegel: "In this case, I have no doubt. What do you need for cloning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Some of the meat on your body, if you don't want to be seen by others, I suggest the buttocks or the meat inside the thighs. You don't need a lot, just one finger." Siegel said: "You don't have any family history. Or is it a natural flaw?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Master Gerard took a bundle of scrolls from the space bag and placed it in front of Siegel: "Change Spells, time stops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not pick up immediately, he did not want to be exposed Because the excitement and trembling hands. Time stop is the most representative of the sorcerer's spells, and the crown of all spells. Even some legendary spells have no time to stop more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Happy cooperation, Master Gerard," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Happy cooperation." Gerrard did not leave immediately after he finished, still standing in front of Siegel, the scroll of time stopped by him. On the table. "There is one more thing to tell you. I have a friend and I want to use it to exchange cloning services. His body is very weak. He can only lie on his bed every day and can't come to you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
