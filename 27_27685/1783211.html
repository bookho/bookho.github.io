			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, I believe in your words, but it is difficult to understand." Fitzk said: "I will never be able to reach those stars, this world is What is the impact of big and small?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the records of the metal plates, their world was destroyed by the wall of the storm." Siegel patiently explained Road: "The wall of the storm suddenly appeared, surrounded the homes where they were, and then gradually tightened, causing an extinction. You think about it, our world has always been surrounded by the wall of the storm, isn't it dangerous?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But our storm wall is backing up, and we have revealed a new big 6". Fazak does not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ruler of Nexus pursues the world that will be destroyed, and they are eyeing here, I think this is not a simple coincidence." Siegel said: "Evan, have you ever heard of any record about asking the gods about the wall of the storm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I have never heard of it. Evan pinched his nose and suddenly became very interested: "Interesting, really interesting. How did such a big thing leak from history?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am afraid it is intentional." Siegel said: "Do you say who else in the world has such ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak rushed to catch Lived in the Master's hand: "Siegel, can't think about it anymore, go on! If this is really God's will, then don't go against it. God is high above, and their power is strong and true. A secret only, no It’s worth sacrificing life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at Fizak, patted his back and comforted him. "You can rest assured, I just have some thoughts, I don't really have any action. I have just seen the power of the Elven Saint, and I naturally won't be stupid enough to break them. Just because it is so shocking, I only I feel it. I know the difference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man nodded. "That's good, that's good." He whispered and said something about it. Most of them are related to Heim’s collar and Isaac. "Take your life and watch your child grow up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the old man feels sleepy. Siegel called the attendant to send him back. Evan watched him go far, then looked at Siegel and said, "When are we going out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unique thing is born, it is called a special case; two pieces together are called coincidence; three pieces are called miracles together. Available on Siegel and Evan. Too many unique things come together and they can't help but make them suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected common sense in the closed world of the storm wall, the disappearing civilization sounded an alarm in their ears. The master of the emptiness of the sky, may be cleaning the tableware, ready to taste the thunder wall big 6 this meal. And the two have magical dice. Young people who are not willing to listen to the response are determined to find out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are fully armed and ready for the best. It is not said that the sergeant Siegel carries a full set of magic props, even Evan, who usually only takes a long sword, even the leather armor is too lazy to wear, this time also wears a flying breastplate and a defensive cloak. Siegel prepared a protective energy talisman and an adaptation ring for him, and the other hand was the ring of defense mind control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The milky white milk-like bottle is a therapeutic agent, produced by Mire City Reid, which is not the same as the usual ones, but the effect is very good." Siegel patiently Said: "The transparent liquid that always bubbles is a gasification agent, and the one that does not bubble is a stealth medicine. The purple color shrinks, the blue color becomes larger. The dark green color is used for detoxification."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go out for adventure in the future, I will bring you." Evan shook his head and sighed: "Compared with you, the nanny of the morning temple is a rookie!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have God's care, I don't have it." Siegel summoned the defensive staff to his hand and looked at Evan. "We don't have it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two left a letter to explain the situation briefly, and then quietly left the camp to the deep pit of the lacrimal gland. Siegel casts a dark vision, so the two can see the surrounding environment without having to use a torch. Both Siegel and Evan belong to agile people. It was easy to get down to the bottom of the pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the metal plate is made of special material and is extremely hard. Although there is no magical light. But the spell that generally changes the metal can't affect it at all. Siegel also tried high temperature and freezing, but also used acid and plasma, but the metal plate did not move, and there was no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this characteristic that makes the people of the Niu Rhino tribe respect the metal plate. They think that this is something God made, and can't be free. However, Siegel and Evan clearly have no such concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing is too strong, how can it be opened?" Evan touched the metal plate by hand and could not find any gaps. Although his bonfire has been strengthened, there is no trace of this thing. "If there is an artifact, there may be hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and said to Evan: "Don't be discouraged. This metal plate is strong, but he Just for the purpose of recording history, it is not designed to be protective. Although the metal plate is indestructible, it can be entered from the side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Side? You didn't This is this kind of thing?” Evan said: “I looked at it, although the word, but the material is clearly the same. Can you open the side without opening it?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think more." Siegel said: "Although the materials are the same, there are two kinds of words without words. How are they connected together? Will there be loopholes?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is awkward: "You are right! There is such a possibility! How do you think of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shipboard is not like this?" Siegel said: "This matter is handed over to you, I try to dig down and see what is underneath."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people split their actions and look closely along the side of the metal plate. Evan broke the clods and rocks attached to it and touched the seams with his hands, hoping to find a hole; Siegel summoned the unearthed elements and continued his excavation work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed by, Siegel first found a way. After digging for three meters, he now has a metal plate that is broken, and a large area is closed with granite. I don't know why this is the case, but it is a direction that can be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon jumped down and knocked on the granite and said to Siegel, "What are you waiting for, let your earth elements knock it out!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful and careful." The Master read the spell and summoned a small body cavity. This three-legged monster, shaped like a scorpion, has jagged teeth that often pop out from the ground, swallow the victim's foot, and chew it down. But the creatures summoned will not be in danger of reflexion, and Siegel lets it dig a hole in the body of the earth element. Then let the earth elements pass through the granite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental creature disappears into the wall, just as a person passes through a waterfall to the other side. Evan strangely asked: "Why is this so troublesome? Let the earth elements go back and forth once?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The earth element is not aware of danger, it is basically not The impact of harsh environment, no breathing, no fear of disease, toxins. It can not represent what is going back and forth.” Siegel explained: “The soil worm is different. It has biological characteristics. Even if it can stay in the soil. For a long time, you still need to breathe, drink water, etc. Let it test the environment is more convincing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the soil elements follow the prior order came back. The earthworms are still alive and kicking and have not been affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, give me ten minutes. Then you can prepare to break the wall." Siegel took out the crystal spar and painted the elements on the ground. Rune magic array. This time he only summoned the strength of the earth element and pressed the two reels on the top and bottom of the crystal column, placed together at the core of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing?" Evan felt like an idiot who didn't know anything, but couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's two of them temporarily like the earth element can be bandit." Siegel said: "If this is not the way, then break the wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Array summons the power of earth elements to act on the Crystal Stone. One of the reels covered on the crystal stone is fossilized mud, and the other is fossilized stone. There is a mutual confrontation and offset between them. But balance can be changed. Siegel manipulates the crystal stone and adjusts the proportion of its assigned elemental power. Let the fossils be the upper hand for the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
