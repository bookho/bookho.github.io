The dead sacred all the way to Siegel to explain the current situation. "They will not die, but because of the intervention of our world, we are welcoming the destiny of destruction. But the wall of the storm should swallow up their world, let them fly away, but they have not done their best. Many accidents and The things that shouldn’t have happened are combined and become the shadow of the world’s souls.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Netherness in the void is not a shadow of the spirits. Have you collected it as an energy source, have you tried it in such a way?” Siegel followed the death and asked while thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We tried it, but the effect is very weak." The god of death screamed and said: "Naceus collects power from the world that is about to be destroyed, in fact It is also the use of this contradiction in the rules. But it is only a case of damn death, the power of its fate is not so strong. The shadow of the world is subject to two rules contradictions, you can constantly weaken them, but want It’s very difficult to eliminate. I tried it, just push them into the storm of destruction, and I can only smash them. After a while, I will be alive and kick again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So you built a complicated magical array, trapping them here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You all see it?" One sentence, then I feel that I am too stupid. Beside him is the magic god, and should be very sensitive to the existence of the phalanx. They did use magic to create an invisible magical array of magical powers, deceiving the shadows of the dead, and letting them think that they are in a vast and unrestricted world, but they have always been spinning around. In order to prevent this magical array from being destroyed - ordinary people can't wear the wilderness of blade storms, but it doesn't mean that some powerful creatures can't get through - this array is invisible, even the magical fluctuations are covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is also close to discovering the existence of the squad. After focusing on the spiritual observation, you can see the complicated system of the arsenal and the innumerable activities. Text. Here is a fairly complex illusion of illusion, which is also mixed with the ability to create dwarf runes. If the most difficult lie to be seen is the nine true and one false or the eight true and two false, the creation of the law is to provide a natural environment of credible service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forged visuals and hearing are easy, but it is difficult to camouflage the touch at all times. When making different movements, the breeze should slide across the skin from different angles and different speeds, which is difficult to imitate with simple illusion. Although not many people will pay attention to the feeling of skin upswing, but for a long time will still leave a signal of "feeling wrong" in the human consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf's rune matrix is ​​responsible for creating the actual object and then enhancing the complement of the illusionary environment. This kind of thinking is very helpful to extend the stability time of the fantasy. Siegel followed the dead sacred, walked through the safe passage of the magic array, and wandered back and forth many roads, finally entering the core area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a hellish scene. The illusion shows a city of human beings, and the dying spirit is launching an attack. Just like in Makarbu, they use the ability to possess themselves. They do not forge the human guards and kill each other. No one knows that the soldiers around them are enemies or friends. Swords and bows continue to reaper life, flames and collapses spread chaos and destruction, and the entire city is dying - but it will never die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, there will be a priest's dispelling power appearing in the illusion, repelling the attack of the shadows. The divine power left by the Lord of the Morning is still very helpful in this kind of battle. So far it is the best means to restrain the shadows of the soul. Every time the dispersal occurs, it means that the illusion enters a new cycle, which is slightly different from the last one, but there is no difference in essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been cheating all the time, ready to persist until the end of time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is not the case at first. The shadow of the dead is only to stay near the wall of the storm, mainly gray, squatting, hovering, harmless. Later, the wizard of your federation built a red magic tower, the shadow of the dead. Leading to the South, to the world of living creatures. You feel that using the priest's dispelling ability and elemental power to kill the shadows of the dead, but only to return them to the wall of the storm. But this time, after they recovered, because they tasted The flesh and blood of a large number of living people became red. They recalled the pain of their own world being destroyed and determined to take revenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If not a god Involved, the New World has long since become a dead land. You know, even the Dragon Legion has tried to stop the shadows of the dead, but it ended in failure, and now it is still in the cave. Open the long whip, the holy force forms a way with the whip in the air The aperture that continues to spread outwards pushes back the shadows of the souls that are trying to approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original illusion wall can be used to keep the shadows of the dead, and it only needs to be reinforced from time to time. But since the red magic tower has opened the guide, the shadows inside will know that they are in the town of illusion and start to keep on The ground tries to break through. So there must be people here to maintain the law, otherwise it will have been destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel aimed at the sacred At first glance, trying to see the emotions from the expression on her face. However, the little girl still has no waves in the old well, and the face is rarely fluctuating, let alone the expression of the eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you take these shadows to other planes, such as Heaven Mountain or the bottomless abyss?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We tried it and found that it didn't work." The little girl waved the whip and forced the close red body. "They don't get calm in the outer domain. Even if they are swallowed or killed there, they will reappear here. The best effect of all the current attempts is to make the shadows become empty-like. There is no threat. But they can always recover, again and again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head, bounced his fingers, and built a defense against the wall. The shadow of the dead has been hit for a while, and it is too difficult to break open, so I pursue the easier target. When the two people were in the vicinity, they were cleaned up. Siegel asked: "Even if the power is exhausted, where does the shadow of the soul get this level of recovery?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the rules of the world." The dead sacred refers to the wall of the storm not far away: "" At present, we believe that the way to completely destroy this group of monsters is to let the wall of the storm continue, this will The world is destroyed. In this way, all the contradictions in the rules have a reasonable end point, the world will be calmed down, and the shadows of the dead will really die. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is impossible! Siegel refused: "This world cannot be destroyed." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "The voice of death finally has emotions, but it is the coldest thing that Siegel doesn't like. "This is just a world, unique, beautiful, but not unique. In the multiverse, there are almost infinite worlds. What is this one? You are just a new god, and your eyes have not yet expanded. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, I disagree. Siegel shook his head: "This is not the solution to the problem!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Creation is as important as destruction. Without destroying and ending the original state, what do you use to create? "Death looked at Siegel and said to him with a heavy heart: "The wall of the storm can be delayed at most, but it cannot be eliminated anyway." You can't end the wall of the storm because it is the end itself. A battle that must fail, what is necessary to fight? It is better to withdraw early and avoid greater losses. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wise, but I think I can try again." "Siegel pointed at the shadow of the dead to the dead sacred person: "There will be only one way to go. I have encountered the shadows of normal thinking and willing to help. Have you asked them? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have seen that the color is not red, but the white of near positive energy. But they didn't pay attention to me, and I hid far away when I saw it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a dead sacred person, and the negative energy of the body is full of energy. Siegel smiled: "I will think about it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The line is handed over to you. "The dead sacred person said: "Remember, behind you is the New World, living with countless creatures. Be careful, don't make any more mistakes, this is not a joke! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to what you mean, are you not going to stay here?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl's mouth pulled out a weird arc, like laughing, but more like a slight twitch: "I have been here for many years, It's time to take a break. God is not tired, but the Holy One still feels like this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right to tell the truth." Siegel looked at the shadows of the passing of the sky, raised his hand and released several spells, and began to repair and strengthen the illusion of the illusion. "Well, let's go, I took over." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl turned and left, no farewell, no nostalgia. Siegel always felt that something was wrong, but he still blamed most of it on death. The cold temper is temperament. The illusion array here is well designed, and Lear has also incorporated his own command when he has not given up the magic god. It is also good for Siegel to accelerate the absorption of the fire by learning and repairing the squad here. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
