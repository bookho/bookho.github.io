			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One lamp after another was repaired, and then sent out the room of Siegel, and soon there was only one person left, and his lamp god . Siegel stopped at this time, sat on the ground and spread his hands, spent three minutes meditation, and combed the entire plan from start to finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took the Lord of the Rings, put all the magic spar at hand, and took a special-looking bow from the space bag and hung it on his waist. . Since the beginning of the firearms, a series of equipment such as the crossbow and the longbow have gradually been eliminated, but as the first important weapon manufactured by Siegel, the plasma has a cross, he still has deep feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of scrolls, potions, wands, and grotesque gadgets are all in the right place. This is a battle that must be done to the fullest. Being able to prepare is already the best situation. It was finally the turn of Siegel to launch an attack, rather than the means of passively dissolving Lear again and again as in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After calming down, Siegel began a revision of the last lamp god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Tower has become confusing, and Chanem’s three idiots have been hiding in the room to cover him, and there has been a serious conflict with Anna. One is wrapped in shadows to avoid being destroyed by the tide of magic, and the other is like an angry storm, letting lightning and flames fall like rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half dragon is unknown, but it is estimated to be in the magic tower. The gnome Keke was protected by his Golem army and tried to avoid the battlefield. The energy that was bombarded slammed into the Mithril Golem and was broken down into the most basic elements, with no effect at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side is the dwarf, holding a protective magic rune to resist the raging magical energy. It seems that his magical protection is even worse, even though it has been attached to the outer mountain wall, the dwarf is still unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of Chanem’s change creeps like black clay, moving slowly against the ground. Despite being bombarded with various spells, the clay is beaten and split, and can always re-aggregate and never be fatally injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one inch and one inch, Anna can't stop this trend anyway. Eventually the shadow climbed over the door of the room and saw a person curled up in the body thrown in. The elf sighed and put away the spell, or transferred the energy of the magic to the defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows did not stop creeping, but piled up and changed to look like Chanem. He licked his lips, shook his finger at Anna, made a squeaking gesture, and then went straight to the magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be free, there are more than three fools to kill." Anna shouted Channheim. "You can never stop Lear from coming! His Power is far above me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course we know that you are just a simple body, the spell just now is your most powerful level of power." Chanem kept his feet and his voice drifted over: "Besides, you are a good mage, but in my opinion with Siegel, your strength is not enough to compete."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kicked the door of the magic tower and let the light god show the steps. "Go to the Magic Tower! Open the channel within all permissions." He screamed in a harsh tone: "You have been lazy for too long, now it's time to do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp god nodded, while strictly executing the order, while licking his mouth, venting his dissatisfaction. However, this dissatisfaction is not directed at Chanem, but a heavy workload. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney walked up step by step and saw the half dragon on the fifth floor. His hand is placed on the crystal ball and is communicating with this powerful magic item with his mind. The three figures are one, but there are no mirror killers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of Chanem alerted him and let the half-dragon turn over the eyes with only white eyes. He still travels the sky, the past, present, and future rivers flow in his body, gradually submerging the body and beginning to overflow. The milky white liquid slowly overflows from the corners of the eyes, the nostrils, the ears and the corners of the mouth, and can feel the characteristics of the Holy Force. The half-dragon people began to groan, the breathing was no longer independent, and the heartbeat was like a rush of drums. Immediately following the hot blood began to seep out of the pores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see what the power of prophecy is!" He put his hand up when he finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light, countless flashes of light that make up the river and get into its eyes. Each light represents a scene, a scene that is important to history and the future. One choice leads to different results, splitting the rivers of time, forming numerous tributaries, and never ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are countless in the future, but I want the future that will become a reality, the only one!" Chanem concentrated, the power of prophecy is unlimited A lot of tributaries went to the end, and eventually eliminated the last result. "I want to know what kind of development will follow in the Magic Academy. Don't show me anything else!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must control, concentrate on controlling the crystal ball, only let the power Know who is the main talent line, otherwise it will be swallowed up by the counterattack. As a saint, Chanem is well aware of this and has the appropriate skills. He is constantly learning and adapting, preparing for the acceptance of prophetic duties and divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light also began to spread to his body, but it could not be completely wrapped. The shadow of black rushes out and is evenly matched with white light. Both have a retreat, so that Chanem has enough time to experience and adjust. Gradually, the shadows can take energy from the white light, constantly strengthen themselves, and the color begins to change from pure black to rich gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps were uploaded from the stairs and heard by the keen Chanem. He let go of his hand, but did not let the white light leave. The shadow is like a hungry tiger, swooping up, biting this force, greedily swallowing down. His face showed a surprise expression, because he obviously felt that his power to plan the layout was greatly enhanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf is coming up, the probe is very careful. "Is this crystal ball not killing?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you encounter someone who has no self-control, you will be able to touch it for a long time, and you will die." Chanem pointed to the half-dragon on the ground: This is the best example, a fool who is not self-sufficient!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel said that the crystal ball will make a replica, not killing, killing, is it? Are they deceptive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney laughed and didn't answer, but the expression revealed it was obvious. The dwarf slammed his foot. "I know that human beings are not credible. He still lied to everyone! The murderer, how many points do you have left, do you want to go up to six?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "My points are not enough, and this layer is very satisfying to me." Chanem placed one hand on the crystal ball and the other hand on the dagger set on the waist. "Do you want to stay with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, we have no contradictions, and I respect your willingness to be alone." The dwarf will run the rune tightly Hold on the palm of your hand and start climbing to the sixth floor. "The battle will affect the income, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very smart, very realistic." Chanem looked at the dwarf's figure and disappeared on the steps, "but It’s also stupid, always thinking that you are right, stubborn and don’t want to listen to others.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, after a while the dwarf rolled down from the top, the lower half It has become a stone, I don’t know if it’s a good thing for Medusa or a petrified lizard. If it weren't for the protection of natural tough physique and magical runes, this petrified would not only stay below the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf quickly took a reel from the space bag, trembled and opened, and began to recite. The yellow light flashed away, and the petrochemical's lower body began to unblock. In a short while, the dwarf's legs can bend and walk, and he also took a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is consistent with the results that Chanem foresees through the crystal ball, even the slightest details are not biased. This kind of feeling is more than a plan, and then it is subsidized when it makes a mistake. I don’t know how many times it is better, and the kind of pride that the world is mastering is born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you can go, just go and stay, don't bother me." Chanem wants to try to make his future vision as far as possible. He Believe this will help to continue to improve the adaptability to the priesthood and divine power. This is a step that is indispensable for absorbing the fire. All the processes must be gradual, and there is only one result that suddenly embraces the fire. It is destroyed and burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of embarrassment in the process of adaptation, and he told Siegel a small part of it. Anyway, in some way, Siegel will be able to know the danger of ascending God and will find a way to solve this problem. If you don’t say it, don’t you seem to be very sincere? Chanem took the initiative to talk about some methods, but they are the most basic, safest but least efficient and time-consuming methods. For the fire that receives the low gods is enough, for powerful forces like magic, knowledge and prophecy, it is as if the dam is built with dead branches, trying to intercept the tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
