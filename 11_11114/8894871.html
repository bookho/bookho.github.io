He didn't cast the spell, but he was no bigger than one in the dark cave. A little moth can attract the attention of other creatures - the thieves stand in the same place, listening to the ears, in addition to those panicking shouts, now there are more metal collisions and livestock humming. He stood in the same place and hesitated, and he couldn't decide what to do for a while. If you are in the port of Point, or any other city, he will run without hesitation without hesitation, but this is Thunder Castle - he peered through the single wall, although the people of Thunderbolt built it. Just to defend against human thieves and the army, but its width and height are not inferior to the other two walls of Thunderbolt, and its gates have already fallen, and each of the iron gates is poured with molten lead water, the walls and There are soldiers on the tower, and they have a sling in their hands. Gülen doesn’t want to try their eyes. Is there any legend that is as sharp as an eagle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the cliffs on both sides of the Thunder, the wall that is comparable to the vertical mirror is probably only the elves, the caster and the argali. It may be crawling on the top, and Gülen even tried nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, he doesn’t think that Kremar, the black-haired speller who has a hard-won name like a deliberately fabricated one, The conversation between them is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief turned his toes, the boots fell into the thick bat droppings, silently smirking, of course not, he is not the kind of slang that would be white robes A foolish, ignorant person who is being fooled. No matter how dark the caster is a half-elves, a half-dragon or a half-orc, a half-ogre, his foundation is no different from Gülen. From the first sight of him, the thief knows this. One point - it's not just a rope wrapped around his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief Gülen is not a baby with a thumb, but sometimes he must show satisfactory docile and stupidity - he has done this It has been twenty years, maybe longer, so he can live until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beetle got into his boot, and the boots stolen from others were slightly larger, and Gülen lifted his toes and crushed him with his heels. The beetle - those voices echoed in the cave, and the frightened bats vacated again. The sound of flapping their wings was like a gust of wind passing through the cave. Even so, Gülen felt that he could still hear the beetle. The shattered sound, its juice penetrates the rags used to replace the socks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the wizard throw a spell at him in the dark? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan didn’t know, he took a deep, dirty, cold air and walked towards the source of light and sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Gold Long Hair of the Elf Master is burning in the flames In the middle of her roll, her enemies are a red robe. He may not be so strong, but he wins in despicableness and has no scruples. He doesn't have to think about whether he will marry the surrounding humans when he throws spells. No, she can't cast a range of fatal or damaging spells on the weak old man and the child. The caster and the mighty warrior may be able to endure and avoid the flames and sharp edges of the past and will take their lives without mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is standing on the top of the carriage and shooting a sharp arrow to interrupt the Master's spellcasting - they face three red robes and a gray robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him is a wizard wizard, he had to leave the battlefield early because he broke his leg bones, but he still remembered him when he passed the Thunderbolt in the morning. The spell, consistent cautiousness helped him and his companions. Without his help, he could have been swallowed up by the red robe's spells; the other two were warriors, and one of them was cut off by the orc's axe. The ribs were pulled all the way to the ribs; the other was thrown by the small thrower through the chest. Although the priest applied the treatment in time, the new bones and internal organs were still very fragile, and each jump and swing would make their body It hurt like a tear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor and the mage never agree that the injured person will enter a new battle immediately after the treatment takes effect, because the tender and fragile new muscles, bones and internal organs can not withstand Large and excessive vibrations and blows, they will break or even melt, and this damage requires stronger healing spells. The longer the rest can be healed, or the injured person is once again hit hard. No need for treatment anymore, because he is already dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the elves have to fight, the sudden enemies obviously don’t need captives, and they don’t need slaves. The first attack they encounter is two as the sunburst The glaring fireballs, they were thrown into the crowd, bursting in an instant, the tiny flames and the huge Mars flew like all the sharp needles of the porcupine in all directions, people were on fire, discarded the straw rope, and widened their eyes. Cried and fled. The flame fell into the bat feces, and the smoke and steam rising from the feces smelled bad, the fire illumined the cave, and the smog and steam that scented the odor blocked people's sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They panicked and fled aimlessly, ignoring the screaming soldiers and crying children, turning a blind eye, pushing them away and obstructing them, including those who protect them and should be protected by them. People. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ropes and spells attached to the cave walls and the top of the enemy raised their bows, they will not deal with ordinary people for the time being - Byrd Wend The grandfather has transferred 300 soldiers and 50 knights from the already tense forces, and they only have one hundred, but they are very clever and have casters. They can make the whole situation by relying on the latter’s spells. The direction they wanted to develop - a half-orc with a glance of the corner of his eye glanced at the gray robe that was ten feet behind him. He wore a hood, a cloak, and a finger and bone on his outstretched bag. A layer of paper-like skin is no different. He points to a place, chanting a spell, and then the thieves see the humans in that direction suddenly fall into uncontrollable chaos and panic, even though they are not on fire or stabbed by swords, but They still ran wildly, a soldier was pushed down when trying to pull up a little girl, and then many feet stepped on his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thief who confuses the crowd wants to puncture his neck, but a small piece of lightning accurately hits his dagger through the gap in the crowd. The current swayed around him in a snake-like manner, and he screamed and fell into the thick bat droppings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray robes immediately look in the direction of the throwing of the spell, a white robe? No, a mage, or a mage who is disguised as a pastor or a paladin, is really disgusting: "You should wear at least a black robe!" Gray robe whispered, and stretched out his fingers again. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what surprised him was that the spell he threw was like a cockroach that suddenly trembled on the white robe mage and then disappeared. Without causing pain and injury to the target, the young blackcaster of the black hair continues to move forward, and he even has the spare power to make gestures, throwing spells - sudden winds through the cave, taking away some of the smoke, steam, Flame and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight leader responsible for commanding and commanding these soldiers died unfortunately after a first fireball exploded in the crowd. Dagger, the wonderful thing is that the person who took the lead in replacing him in his duties did not belong to Thunder Castle. He came from the kingdom. He quickly put on his armor with the help of his envy, took the cover, and rode back and forth on his horse. His cockroaches followed his flag, followed by a loud and continuous report of his name and command, his title and expensive equipment played a convincing role, and the soldiers who acted were holding darts and The spears gathered around him, and after a moment of hesitation, they followed the jazz's orders and began to "comb" the idiots who were controlled by the fear, with a savage, flashing sword and tangible damage - still big People who are yelling or want to run around will be stabbed in the ears, arms and other unimportant places, the pain makes them awake, and a few people who are still shuddering in the gray robe are stunned and out of control. Livestock Dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf mage throws the seeds that he carries with him into the mud-like faeces, and then drops into his own blood. The vines fly and grow in general, entangled into barriers and traps. The flames of the red robe roar and hit, the emerald turns black. And black has turned into emerald green, they can not persist for too long, but people hiding inside get a breather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some soldiers hand over the excess weapons they carry with their relatives and friends, or recognize the people to increase their chances of surviving in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you use a knife?" A soldier asked, the object he asked was a bard, the one that Birdwin brought from the White Tower to Thunder Castle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am better at using the piano." The bard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier looked at him and found that he was really skinny and pale. He shook his head and turned and went. "Then go under the carriage. Well, although it’s a bit stinky, it’s better than no life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Really,” the bard smiled and said, “I’m not kidding. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since entering the underground passage, he has embraced his beloved Solt Liqin from beginning to end. Now, the flexible fingers are just moving, one The root string has been removed - such a string that the female even needs to hit with a small hammer to make a sound is of course not made of silk or hair, and each string is plated. Silver or gold-plated steel wire, the string used in our bard hot pants is not gold and silver. It is undecorated, smooth and flexible, and it only breaks the soldier's neck at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier didn’t understand what had happened until he died. The bard only used one knee to hold the heavy body on the shoulder of the soldier. After wiping off his strings, he put him down gently and concealed. It doesn't matter, there are many bodies here, and now no one will probe the cause of death of some ordinary soldiers - if no one will pay attention to them The temporary leader is no better than that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bard opens the bottom plate of the Soltley, and the ten arrows are firmly fixed in the area, each of which is only as small as the tail feathers of the pigeons. *** Author's words - thank you for your reward! !
