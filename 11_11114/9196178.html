			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lehman looked at Afra, his face was full of sorrow and joy, which is an expression that makes people feel impossible. Who can be filled with joy and at the same time fall into endless pain, but Lehman can. He knows that Afra is not a mortal, but when her difference with him is suddenly put naked in front of him, he is almost desperate to die - he is already fifty years old, as a mortal, in In life, he has already defeated 90% of the human beings in this plane, and in the maintenance of youth, he has become a minority among the 10%. His red hair has not turned gray, but the color is slightly dim. His forehead and mouth have only slight wrinkles. His eyes are still clean, bright and shining. He can still kill a giant bear by hand. Like his brother and father, but when facing Afra, he only felt full of rancid smell of aging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afra seems to have never changed, time is stagnant in her body, when she first met Lehman, she was a girl, and still is. Lehman knows that some of her people think she is just a wax-sealed, dead flower, but as long as they can see it, they know that she has never left the strong branches, her vitality is from The depths of the soul are emanating, with the brilliance of the jewels and the brilliance of the morning light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some courtiers who want to persuade her to accept Lehman’s love, but will she really give up because of a Duchess’ title? But when she smiles, all the creatures will bend for this beauty and willingly become her courtiers - even if all the kings on the land are gathered together, the crown of the queen will be cast together, she will not They will accept them, just like a god will not marry a mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't know when the dance ended, Afra came to his side, "Good evening." She said: "Duke."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lehman looked up and found that the shining sun was no longer a deep red sun, but a round and bright silver moon, the star river crossed the cobalt blue The sky, but as a mortal, he can only see one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the help of Lehman, the last thing the black-haired dragon gave to Afra, she may not be able to complete it - it is to re-establish people Fro's faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, the black-haired dragon did not think that Afra could do this easily, and he even reminded Afra, she You can come slowly, starting from a settlement, a small town, and a city. But how can Afula be satisfied? Lehman may know, maybe he doesn't know, he is chosen by her - Afra will not choose Lei Zhe, of course, some people think that Lei Zhe, a king can Let her achieve her goal better, but in the education of the black-haired dragon, Afra is also clearly aware that the biggest, most delicious, most beautiful fruit will only receive the most embarrassment, and so is a king. He does It has an enviable power, but in the same way, the people attracted by his power will be as many as the ants gathered around the honey. She doesn’t think she can compete for those who have been in the early 30 years. Came to the Normans in the Highlands beside the King - but Lehman, Lehman is just a duke, and because he is also the lord of Thunder, unless Lei Zhe, his brother and the king died, otherwise he is impossible to become King's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some people around him, but those people are obviously less good at fighting for trust and value than the nobles in the kingdom. In addition, perhaps no one noticed that the feelings of Lei Zhe and Lehman were more profound than any of the previous royal brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the temple of Gredi, Afra is not learning nothing, for example, the belief of an noble person is obviously over one thousand , 10,000, or more civilians...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————— ———————————————— The next part is updated within an hour ————————————————————————— ———<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prelude<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper's unusual anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, the reaper born in the Chaos Sea - an undead creature that can accommodate a small python family in the skeleton has been this The chief scorpion of the chaotic plane exists. They are immune to mental attacks, and most of the spell damage is reduced. The power is infinite and the movement is quick. The most important thing is that they can change the unpredictable chaos in the sea without any need to lock the force field. Appear in every place... Look for any neck that fits the invisible python, and any creature that is attacked by a chaotic weapon made to break the damage reduction will be subject to the shock of chaotic power. Constant pains and sufferings... until they give up because of intolerance, and they become a part of chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paladin snorted, dispelling the negative effects of the reaper's last long, cold, vicious breath, and then he had to face one of the toughest things in this impossible plane. - More than 500 giant clams gathered in the pebbles. A chaotic fluid is produced from the pebbles of this chaotic sea native. The giant python can recognize these fluids and flow upwards, gather around the spawning to lay eggs and fertilize, and their will even gradually expand a large tabletop pebbles into a continent. But the actions of the giants sometimes turn the chaotic fluids that grow with the pebbles into huge chaotic storms. The worst part is that the giant cockroaches of death will become the guards of the pebbles, stubborn, brave, and hard to destroy. The stone guards will shred any creature or non-living that dares to hurt the source of the storm - with violent hurricanes, innumerable flames, ash, gravel, gravel, hail, and even energy condensation... from this The block is basically madly spitting on the self-contained small-scale mainland outside the order, like a large, multi-material meteor shower with upside down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, the frenzied giant breeding ground smashed a piece of solitary sea like a real stone and quickly left, like the choppy airflow aftermath After a period of time, it completely dissipated. It left only a large strip of areas that looked very clean compared to other places in this chaotic plane. Although it will soon be filled with more chaotic substances, It now looks very similar to a trace of a finger on a dusty table, and it is precisely because of this that the only thing that stays in it is particularly eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small, quiet, comfortable, but dark space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original face with a smile instantly became serious. The paladin burned a pure flame, especially the forehead, as if there was a sun in the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to hold his arm has relaxed, and before the wide cuffs of the gray robes hang down again, the paladus’s sharp vision has seen the pale hand bones. Its shape is similar to humans, but it is obvious that the human finger phalanx has only three knots at most, instead of the four knots he sees now, which means that the undead creatures in front of them are transformed by elves or half-elves that are more focused on the elves. Cheng Cheng, this discovery will be even amazed by the gods. Since the destruction of the magic empire, almost no lich has been seen in the transformation of the elves, even the elves who are deceived by the devil and degenerate - the great lich, what a strange noun The relevant written records are probably only the oldest and most secretive on the mainland, and can be found in several libraries protected by semi-stagnant time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It silently retreats into the darkness that is not affected by the light, and the outline of the white skull that is slightly lifted is clearly clear in the shadow of the hood." He "gaps at the light, and does not seem to hate something that can no longer be reached like other undead creatures... subtle, fleeting mood swings are sharply captured by the Paladins - no greed, no hatred, no anger, No desire, peace and softness, except for the child's vivid curiosity and eagerness to try, if not the pure negative energy that can almost condense into the body, the rescued person almost thinks that this decaying and filthy bone is hidden in front of the body. A pure soul that has not been polluted by sin - in fact this is absolutely impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what you are holding out for." The paladin said seriously, "In the name of Tyre, I swear you will receive my thanks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hollow eyes of the undead, the tiny red light spots jumped, and the paladin could feel the joyful emotions flowing through them. The body, this lich is still very young, he does not even know how to hide his feelings, or that he still has feelings, the old warrior cherishes his wrong choice, his eyes are more determined: "Speak your request." Then I will fulfill your wishes in the name of Tyre, and then liberate the soul that you have not completely degraded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull in the hood turned left and right, and the skeleton stepped back: "Hey~~," he said at a loss: "Required?... Hey, say, thank you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his body glowed white, more bleak than the Paladin, but softer, Sudden changes caused the lich to be scared, and the airflow in the narrow space became tense, controlling the action of the paladin like a shackle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin’s old face reveals an incredible expression, yes, a covert, simple detection, just to make sure that you are not being lichled The lie is misleading or exploited, but even he did not expect that there will be an undead creature, pure, not for any purpose to save life other than himself, which almost subverts the definition of the lich for thousands of years. Whether it is the nine-story hell of Bata or the blessing of the region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
