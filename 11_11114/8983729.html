			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 151st chapter team (19)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Baitazhong There are not many people in the same horror, sorrow, and remorse as An Zhen. The Masters of Antonio and the leaders of the guilds are here. After hearing the first thunder, they climbed the tower or the house. The attic looks to the outside, and when the unique light of the elf ships is projected into their eyes, they are relieved and happy. No one does not know that elves are synonymous with wealth and power. Perhaps some human beings have coveted and coveted the elves, and wishful thinking that the gray ridge cannot leave the white tower, instead of the white tower, which cannot be separated from the gray ridge. The idea was changed until the ash smashed the relationship with the White Tower, and then, with the invasion of the "fine net" guild, they realized that even more terrible problems are coming to every resident of the White Tower - lost The devil's deterrence against the evil ones, they even once regarded it as ordinary, the plain but safe life can not continue to maintain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ahn said that he was going to meet with the elves for help, Antonio Master and the guild leader, as well as the chief pastor of Rosada, thought that this would It was a conversation that contained grief, apology and sincerity, and at the end got a happy ending. The Singh Elves in the North are always more tolerant than the Eya spirits in the South. Even half-elves with only half of the blood can get their shelter and cherish - Antonio Master and the front of the hills and white towers The lord can be said to be a very friendly friend, but even so, he has to blame the man who has been buried in the ground short-sighted - he does not understand what the elf will bring to his beloved daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Tower can be said to have been created by the elves. There is no elf. The White Tower is just a barren village that is so small that even adventurers may not stop there. The original intention was just to reserve a small nest for the gray spirit and the silver crown jungle - especially those young elves who just finished their rites and started their first long journey in life. The passengers are shaded under their eaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the love and marriage between the former lord and a female elf, Antonio Master is quite in favor, although they did not get a son, but fortunately, The law of the Principality of Luzer is to recognize the inheritance of the father’s property, surname and territory. As long as she has no other brothers - An Zhen was only a child when he took over as the lord, there is no magic or martial arts talent, except for the exquisite appearance, there is almost no advantage, but in the eyes of the old Master. This shortcoming is not too big, Anzhen is a little flower, it doesn't matter. A half-elves have a life span of two hundred to three hundred years, and for elves, it is short-lived. But for humans, it symbolizes the inheritance and accumulation of more than a dozen generations - as long as she is the owner of the White Tower and the Hill, the elves will continue to watch, and for so long, enough white towers to become A true big city, a city that only belongs to mankind, can stand on the crisis-ridden continent even without elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he did not think was that An Zhen had lost the love of the elves so quickly, and the elves gave up her and gave up the White Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wizard cast a spell that was extremely risky to transfer himself to the junction of the two rivers. The storm that once swallowed the entire white tower has subsided. . The White River's inland river (also a tributary of the Starlight River) choked like a grievous child in a truncated place, turbid water flowing over the original river beach, immersed in the bushes on the edge of the woods, old Master's shoes and robes The edges sank into the cold water, but he was unaware that the elf's ship had a wide flying wing, and under the light of the magical galaxy, the magical runes depicted on the sails and the ship were shining, it was The same starry river slowly turned and turned the bow to the direction of the gray ridge - the elf wizards who completed the mission did not enter the cabin, they saw the Antonio Master. And he gave him a gentle bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind that magically blew opened their hood, and Antonio only recognized a small part of them, but he knew they were the most outstanding of the wizards. Those who can't help but tears. He thought about saving, but he knew that it was impossible. The elf's ship took off in the wind, passing over the river of the Starlight River, leaving a shadow like lightning on the river. People in the White Tower may never see it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is Master Antonio." Ruiwen said, and sighed softly, Antonio Master is one of the few, the elves are happy to be one of the human wizards, but he A person can't save the current trend of the White Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant kissed his partner’s forehead. If Antonio is willing to leave the White Tower, his friendship with the elves may still be maintained for a long time, but He knew that Antonio was born in Baita and grew up in Baita. He left the White Tower only when he followed his tutor. After he got the qualification of the Master, he couldn’t wait to return here. According to Perant, there was more than one. The king or the Grand Duke is willing to provide a prominent seat for this talented mages in his court, but he was rejected by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rui Wen stroked the hair of Perant, it also dripped water. As a warrior, she couldn't dry it right away, but she had already prepared a dry, soft cotton cloth. She let Perant sit down, then covered her hair with cotton cloth and slammed it hard - as A powerful druid, of course, Perant has a way to prevent himself from being so bad, but even a stupid halfling, knowing that when a partner wants to show love, don’t sweep her, or else After a while, she will sweep you up in disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many elves, Perant has long hair that has shoulders. Ricken wipes them and feels the wonderful touch they bring; Perant's hair is tougher and less slender than Riewen's own. Ruiwen feels that she is holding a good bowstring, or that is not a metaphor, because Ruiwen's bowstrings are indeed twisted with the partner's hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she suddenly thought of one thing, even if she turned her back to Ruiwen, as her lover, Perant still felt the warm and pleasant fluctuations: "What do you think of?" he asked softly: "My love, don't deny, I can feel that you are smiling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, I am I don't want to hide you," Ruiwen said. "I just remembered the 'white face' of Gray Ridge - you look so similar to it, it looks like a father and son, I have touched its fur. It’s amazingly smooth and supple. I’m thinking – what is your fur touched?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s better than it.” Perant said "I promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rui Wen’s answer was to lean over and kiss his ear tip, and Perant turned and gave the same gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a comfortable and comfortable relationship with each other. Ruiwen said: "If Kreima returns, he will be very happy - last time I saw the white face, its wife, and their children basking in the sun on the beach, the cute little guy has Growing up. It is no longer a white short fluff, but like its father, it has a beautiful dark brown fur, but its eyes are more like its mother, like an apricot, black and bright. And the temperament and goodness, although a bit clumsy, but Cremari will definitely fall in love with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Perant said: "Wait for him to come back "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is not known to Perant and Ruiwen. They are talking about Kreima, who is also facing a otter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They turned to the southwest after leaving the "concave corner", a narrow strip of forest that grows along rivers and mountains, providing food and energy for them. Provide shade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical star river squats in the sky, the dark blue velvet curtain is full of stars, and there is a faint purple red in the place where the heavens and the earth meet. They ignited a bonfire between the open spaces among the trees, and Birdwin hit it with a leather bag. Water, Kremar puts his own water polo ball into the cooking and purification; the elf and plum find a lot of wild berries, and there are half nests of black-backed pheasant eggs - plum honey is to take all away But the elves are not allowed. Fro's pastor did not dare to violate the meaning of the Ranger, but she still took away the nuts left by the squirrels when she was "not paying attention" by Kerry (a small pipa learned from a boasting bard) ) - The elf certainly found out, but after a cold winter, the nuts that have not been dug by the squirrels are basically forgotten by this little creature with a bad memory. Even if they stay, they will only sprout or die in the land. It doesn't matter if you eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan thinks this dinner is too shabby, but he knows that the elf may not agree to him to hunt, and spring is a good time for animals to breed. And they already have food, "But we can get at least a little fish." He said, bowing to Birdwin and Plum. "Their injuries are not one or two breads and dry meat that can be replenished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And myself, he said in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief caught the fish from the nearby stream, only the palm of his hand, but very fat, with silvery scales, a small weird head - still There is a otter that is stronger than fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" asked the black hair caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Water Margin," Gülen said bluntly: "It stole my fish." More than once, the small fish gathered in a deep ditch. The water in the evening was still very cold. The thieves got a part of it and then ate a few of them - Gülen endured twice, and the third time he couldn't bear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black eyes of the otter reflect the fire, the sparkling, full of grievances, and its four claws are tightly bundled together by Gülen’s belt, in the crowd When I saw it, it actually called a few complaints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meat of the otter is very delicious," the thief touched his stomach with malicious intentions. "And it is filled with my fish. We can bake them together - and I need a fur to make a scorpion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otter yelled and smacked his tail while licking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can it understand our words?" Mei Mi asked vigilantly: "Is it not just an ordinary otter, is it a druid?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the elf smiled and cast a branch into the fire: "Animals always have a hunch for danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really much better than humans," the thief pinched the neck of the otter. "Is it, plum?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei moved Lips, nothing said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After simply eating dinner, plum honey went aside and with the consent of the caster, she used the remaining hot water in the skin. I cleaned my face, combed my hair with my fingers, and picked up the sweet peas that I had collected when I picked the berries. I prayed in front of a sturdy elder bush and prayed piously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she is just a Pastor Fro who only needs to play and indulge, she can’t be said to be a good follower, anyway, Fro It doesn't seem to care so much about whether her pastor loves and believes in her heart. As long as she has enough gold and gems to contribute, she can pass through the front of the chief pastor, so she and other Fro priests only occasionally bow down. Take a look at their gods, and more often just wear sweet peas or dance songs to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she is no longer so convinced now that she has gained strength from her gods, and she thought she had no power, she must reward her and win her The heart of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking of Fro’s celebration day is coming." The thief said with ill-intention: "Fro's pastor does whatever he wants on that day. A silver coin, right? Plum?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t bother a pastor’s prayer,” Birdwin said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay," said the thief. "So you don't need it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Fro's celebration is not dirty," said Kerry Ben. "In my memory, it was originally sacred, full of love and sincerity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
