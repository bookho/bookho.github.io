Since humans came here and thrived on this land, it only broke out once, and the island was counted once. Thousands of humans, as well as their fields, homes, and ports, were all devoid of thick volcanic ash and lava-grayed gray-black rocks. Only the quick-responding wizards and warlocks escaped, and the casters quickly found control of it. They are not as stupid and incompetent as mortals. They think that the volcanic eruption is because a dragon is sleeping underneath. When it wakes up, it will inevitably squirt and turn over something... They know very well that the volcano erupts because of It accumulates too much energy, and no matter which energy, after accumulating to a certain extent, it is always necessary to find a weak breakthrough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing is simple. If a cup can't carry too much water, then pour the water back into the silver pot. They tried a few In this way, it is found that it is one of the best ways to construct a surface pool in the main plane to connect the surface of the fire element, and then to pour the energy deep in the volcano. Later, the caster improved it by the fire element. Instead of directly arranging the surface pool in the crater, the unguided energy is frantic and frenzied, and too much impending dumping can cause the plane pool to fail to load and rupture, just like you pass a thin reed. Like the water in the silver pot, although there is ample space in the silver pot, if you inject the whole cup of water into the narrow entrance, the result is not that the pole is stretched or the water will overflow everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method has been used for thousands of years, and the number of human beings in the Longhuo Islands has increased from thousands to millions. At first, only the caster has temporarily fallen here. After that, they returned to their mage tower, leaving behind the people who came to avoid the catastrophe. The slavery was still used in many kingdoms. A slave is seen as a tool without any autonomy, even food or a sacrifice. No matter where you go, the nobles have only slaves and no slaves. The slave is a new term that emerged after the catastrophe, perhaps because the catastrophe involving the gods destroyed the relationship of too many people, the situation of the slaves has been improved, they are no longer copied to the iron collar or brought Ankles can also have their own wife and children. A simple residence, and a name, if they meet a kind and tolerant master, they can even receive more than one civilian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don't know if it is because of the relationship away from the land. The people of Longhuo Island passed down the law of the millennium. They know that people on land no longer have a large number of slaves as they used to, and they hired slaves or serfs instead. Signing the contract, the lords of Longhuo Island are dismissive. They sometimes feel that they are the true, honorable and ancient bloodstains. The royals and the Grand Dukes who abolished or semi-discarded slavery on land were just inferior people at the right time, otherwise how to explain how they would treat the "bovine horses" so favorably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the residents of the original Longhuo Islands were just businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are good at computing and business. They soon discovered that Longhuo Island is a private library that has not yet been opened. They use the aborigines and gnomes. Help, and from the time still on a chaotic land, bought a lot of cheap slaves, planted sugar cane in the low heat, planted sugar beets in the cool high places, and then proposed the expensive gold-like sugar at that time, their wealth. It is like the energy in the depths of the volcano quickly accumulates, and they hire the caster. Establishing his own army, buying the title of aristocrats from the emperor and the empress, and then more slaves. Some people may not understand why the lords of Longhuo Island are so stubbornly adhering to the system of the millennium, but since Cray Marr and others came to Longhuo Island. They have a certain understanding of the strength of slave work. In simple terms, ordinary humans can't afford even one of the least living conditions, the longest working time, the most rude tools, the most demanding. Abuse and torture...and the fruits of their work are the richest and most stable. Thousands of pounds of cane sugar and beet sugar are transported every day. The amount of sugar is reduced to a pound in grams, and even the squatters and tourists can rest in the rest day. Eat a doughnut covered with sugar, a copper coin, a silver coin, a gold coin, the sweet sugar in exchange for the profit is so little piled up to be seen before Kremar et al. Everything, gorgeous, spectacular and extravagant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like they are overlooking the crater at this time, and they can see the abalone, sandalwood and purple wood as the main hall of the spread. The trestle that extends from the temple, the white trestle extends into the blue sea, like a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really don't understand why they live here?" the young mage around Kremar muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it’s only because it’s the safest place, even if the side of the couch is a volcano with deep red lava, it’s safer than the outside world. The lords of the Fire Island are killing each other, and their sons are always ready to seize every fleeting opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy blunt sound brought back the attention of the young mage, who moved a shallow obsidian disk to the place where the obsidian disk was several times larger than the one seen by Kremar in the Alva Master. If an adult male lie down, a warlock who does not have to bend his knees looks down. The bottom of the obsidian disk is inlaid with Mithril lines and gems. There is a slight invisible flame floating on it. The flame is close to transparent blue. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock Nagar chanted the curse while swinging her body and letting herself fall into a state of disappointment, and the masters and warlocks of her point also raised their hands. Making gestures to cast spells, an invisible cage confines the fire creatures they summoned in midair, turning them uneasily, jumping or flapping their wings, and then screaming or screaming like a sharp tweet With Naga's arms spread out and his fingers curled, the flame in the obsidian disk suddenly spread out an incalculable slender tentacles like a living creature. A fire elemental creature that the wizard summoned him was a vermilion. Into it, those tentacles immediately caught it and the vermilion and the light blue were mixed together, bursting with a pure gold spark. The fire element screamed the last squeak, and was instantly assimilated to see this, and other fire elemental creatures began to become arrogant, the difference is. The casters who are not temporarily summoned or who have not rejected them will put their own demons in their arms or into their sleeves, and the casters who summon the fire elemental creatures just for this spelling are only indifferently strengthened. The power of detention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar’s fire element magic pet, the bright little spider is afraid to lift the cheeks to block his eight eyes, the fire elemental creature The same fear of death is like now. This flame from the plane of the fire element will assimilate them. Although they are born from the fire element, they are only returned to the fire element after the death, but they know with the thought and memory, even the fire element plane It once again gave birth to an identical creature, it is also blank, it is not "self." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it doesn't know if it can be turned to this "person" for help. "This person" is very strange, although he and the owner of the spider use the same body, but The devil is connected with the soul rather than the **, and its owner is not "this person." It should be "that person", although "that person" requires it to obey the "this person" command, but in this case, it is not sure that "this person" will protect it and not sacrifice it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer touched the little spider who was hot because of fear or even forgot to control the temperature, and in his sleeve, it immediately curled up. Eight legs are folded toward the abdomen, pretending to be a deceased look. The devil is indeed a little similar to the owner. The former undead person briefly missed his former devil. Little Devil Asmodeos, no, maybe no, he never felt as shallow and greedy as the little devil; but this eight-legged creature is quite similar to his stupid master. Does it think that it is a normal spider with only the main plane, and even if it is dead, can it still leave a tangible body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger just pressed the back of the spider's back and retired. Without the meaning of grabbing it, the eight-footed fire element creature was slightly relieved, but it still didn't climb out of the caster's sleeve, its ear. It is full of mourning left by the companions before they die. Some humans can hear it, and some can only hear it by fire elemental creatures. This kind of mourning can stay in its memory for hundreds of years or more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mage’s screaming is the latter voice, which tries to grab the finger of his master, but is still not hesitate to throw it into the obsidian disk. Its last call sign is like crying: "Hey... Hey, Hey... Hey, Hey... Hey..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The little spider is on his feet, and he wants to be a spider with only the main plane, so that it can confuse the message from the cilia on the leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the black sapphire basin is like a dew that accumulates a flame, which becomes more transparent and strong after engulfing nearly half of the elements of the fire, it is reasonable to say The pattern on the bottom of the plate should be clearer, but you can only see a dazzling light when you go to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not enough," said Naga, a warlock hesitated, his magic pet is a dragonfly, its color is golden, fire element In biology, the higher the color temperature of the flame carried, the stronger the color, the gold is better than the red color, perhaps because of the long-term combat relationship, it looks even a little dim. After Naga made a gesture, the warlock finally made up his mind, The scorpion-shaped fire elemental creature cast into the obsidian disk, which miraculously did not make a sound, only struggling with its owner before the final demise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Obsidian was finally satisfied after swallowing the last offering, its bottom was tumbling, and the white light and the blue-blue flame entangled each other. The sun-like pale golden enamel spreads out from the bottom, revealing a beautiful view that should not have appeared in the main plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding magical energy fluctuates, echoing the energy hidden under the gray-black rock, which seems to be able to sense the existence of the source, scrambling Declaring their existence, the land under their feet is slightly trembled, the temperature in the air is getting hotter, and some great-minded mages have been able to find those disturbing black gaps from the gray-gray basin, in a blink of an eye. The gorgeous red rushes out of the darkness, and the casters raise their arms and release their own magical pets. The fire elemental creatures of the birds are the first to arrive, followed by the beasts, and the creek's little spiders are not. Anxious to enlarge himself, but to throw a fine as infinite spider silk, stuck to the feet of a blue-blue pigeon, took a ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
