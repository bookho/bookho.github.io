			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is that over there?" asked the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers paused for a moment to understand: "Not very good," he said. "The number of orcs exceeds expectations. We were forced by Sir Alex. Abandoned the first city wall - we removed the suspension bridge connected to the first city wall after withdrawing the second city wall, they tried to skip the distance, but more fell into the outer fort, then we shot from the hole The black oil was poured out, the wizards fired the fireballs, and the beastly beasts were all burned to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder he has always been lingering The stench, "So, have they retreated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Temporarily," the Cavaliers said with respect: "Your tribe has already set out to explore the orcs. The movement, and their number, Sir Alex believes that the orcs have hidden some of their power..." The spiral stone steps down the tower wall are only one person wide. For the sake of convention, the knight has been walking in front of the mage. In order to face the enemy in advance when encountering a change, but He could not see the face of the caster, while the rear a brief silence so that he would inevitably be misunderstood. Although from the outside, the age of the two seems to be almost the same, but the knight knows that he is facing a half-elf, according to the life ratio of the half-elf, the person behind him is still a child: "They should not encounter too much The danger or hindrance," he explained. "Gregory only wants to know if his speculation is correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Correct."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers seem to hear the mage behind him say this, but when he stops and goes back, he only sees a rush of inquiries in the shimmering glimmer. Eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s a mistake, he goes on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the description of the Cavaliers is so simple, the Lich thinks, but he can imagine how long and painful the battle is. Tyre’s followers cleaned and sorted themselves after accepting this task, but his body was still weak and uncontrollable due to extreme exhaustion. His pace was heavy and dragging, and his unresponsiveness was negative for the Cavaliers. The hand placed on the hilt is not for a graceful posture or for defending an enemy, but to avoid embarrassing trembling; he took off the armor in the chain armor - the dress is made of thick cotton It is inlaid with patches. After the fierce battle, it will fill the blood of the knight and its enemies. Unlike the chain armor and armor, it can be easily cleaned by washing and wiping - although his chain is inconspicuous. The place is also filled with black dry bloodstains; and, it is too heavy, sinking to the shoulders of a person who needs rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing is that even if you don't stand on the double wall, as a former undead, the lich can still touch the breath of death brought by the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He happily felt the long-lost coldness, and when he saw the thief Gülen, he actually smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know this person?" Birdwin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An accident," said the Lich. "I used to get lost in the port of Pointy, it was a strange place, for me," he Nodded to Gülen, the poor guy’s eyes suddenly burst into hope. “I asked the owner of the blunt pub to find me a boat... but it’s a pity that Dr. Drake, who is willing to give me this position. The owner of the Golden Lady seems to often confuse 'his passenger' with 'his cargo' and he can't go where I want to go," he noticed that Byrdwin picked him to pick him up. Eyebrows, apparently the lord of Thunderbolt also heard about the name of Captain Drake: "So," the Lich took two steps and sat down in his position: "In the end I found Gülen - in Dray Captain C.’s hard-hitting recommendation, he was the leader of the 'Silver Fingers' Guild’s Point Port of Hong Kong – a passionate and generous good man (Bedwin couldn’t hide his smile when he heard the word) He helped me solve this little trouble. Oh, I hope you don't care too much, He said to Gülen: "I think I should say thank you to you, for the position of the ship - Mr. Cobbert, the owner of the little bird, is a very good friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp There are nearly half of the funds, and Gülen resentfully thinks that the reason why he is here is, in the final analysis, to fall on this young black mage. He threatened Gülen and took away the property of the guild. In order to fill the terrible hole before the audit of each quarter, Gülen only frantically squeezed his subordinates, the pubs and shops of Drake and Tsim Sha Tsui. His actions aroused their anger and resistance, they conspired in places he could not see or hear. In a seemingly simple murder mission, he killed people who should not be killed and suffered terrible Curse - how excited he was when he learned that the guild did not expel him, but in the end, he realized that the guild still retains his membership, just to find a suitable scapegoat . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He helped you solve the little trouble," Birdwin asked. "Do you remember which day?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fro's Celebration Day," said the Master, "the day when the Magical Star River traverses the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"OK." The caster said that if he still retains his original identity and strength, the lich is thinking, this is a stupid question. This Tyre's stupid knight should be peeled a hundred times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He proved it!" Gülen couldn’t wait to marry, he even struggled to get up from the ground, and the two knights immediately held him down: "He Prove my words, adults, I am innocent! I did not kill that person, I was detained! Let me go - you are the Knight of Tell, you must be fair!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin looked up, but before he said the final verdict, a knight next to him put his iron gloved hand on his shoulder: "Gregory," he Say: "You can't forgive this person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The testimony of a caster is not enough to win the prince," the knight said, not caring about the brunette mage. The look of the cast, his dress is luxurious and refined, and clean, even surpassing the owner of the place. His armor is engraved with dense patterns, like embroidery on a woman's skirt. In general, the more patterns, the higher the identity of the wearer: "After you have not found more convincing evidence that the head of the 'Silver Finger' guild is lying and catching the so-called real assassin, You have not qualified to release the criminal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," he continued, sighing: "This kind of person is not worthy of your sympathy, he is a thief." He is also the leader of a branch. His hand cannot be clean and innocent. He is used to lying, stealing, looting and murder. No matter what he has done, his good deeds cannot cross his evil deeds. If he is in the king, he Will be sentenced to a corpse or a wheel, and the prince did not do it but sent him here, just to make him a food for the orcs - if he reappears safely, then whether it is the Prince, or Your Majesty will be very disappointed with you, Bywin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who was he charged with killing?" The Lich suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gorgeous knight is not very willing to answer this question at first, but he is not willing to offend a caster so straightforwardly, especially he knows this caster Although it looked very young, but in fact not inferior to any of the Masters who had served in Thunderbolt for many years, he glanced at Birdwin, and Boldwin turned and approached Kremar: "The son of the Prince, He whispered, fortunately, this is not a secret in the highland Norman: "Although he was not born in a marriage bed, he is the only son of the prince, if the prince is willing to work with his mother." To enter into a marriage contract, then he is the second heir to Highland Norman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
