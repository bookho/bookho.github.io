			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small village called "recessed corner" has only four households in seventy or eighty years ago, and twenty-seven people can only be called It is a settlement. Old people often say that they migrated from the south, only because their lords suddenly became cruel and crazy, young and strong men and women were recruited into the castle by him, and then never returned, someone in his castle I saw the caster wearing a red robe with a pair of heads and a snake with wings on it. A well-informed, good-looking bard tells them that the guy is a red robe, one is raised. The evil and powerful warlock of the devil, he warned the villagers that if this situation continues, they will have to manage to escape - the red robe is never ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers hesitated for a while, although they were called free people, but they belonged to the lord after all. If they escaped, they are likely to be arrested. Being hanged or sentenced to slavery, even if they succeed, they will become a slum without land and property – until the management begins to snatch their children and babies. They fled here because the Norman Highlands has an extremely vast land and a sparse population. Residents who are unwilling to accept in some places can be accommodated and accepted here, and there are also many landless land waiting for them to farm – fleeing The civilians lived here. When their population exceeded double digits, an old man who had the privilege of learning points and reading with the bard went out and walked to the edge of a village. After some hardships. After that, he finally saw the management of the village. The manager reported the matter to the supervisor of Sir Alex Ferguson. A few days later, he took the two knights and asked him in detail. He read the order of the lord (mainly this new The village has to pay taxes and rents, and there are some small pieces of small money.) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They lived here like this. With the death of the first generation, later people almost forgot that they came from the south, only in When I went to the market, I got some trouble because of the language barrier, but even local residents could not avoid such problems. Only the royal family, nobles, casters, wealthy businessmen, and various professionals in this continent have the opportunity to learn to read and write. The lingua franca is not as versatile as the literal, the city or more than a thousand people. The area is better. But in the remote wilderness, it is common for a village to call bread "啪啪" and another village to call bread "嘎嘎". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord certainly does not want to see a group of stupid civilian excuses who cannot understand and ignore his orders. So in a small village like this, you can often see the pastor. He may be Ilmot, or Merika, more likely Idas. Or other followers of kindness or neutral gods - under normal circumstances, they are almost a little better than mortals, sometimes just apprentices who can't even be treated by healing, those who are deeply loved by God, strong The powerful pastors are in the temple or are worshipped by the king and the lord in their own castles - anyway, there will be no dragons or demons in these small villages. In case, I say, if there is, then he can Going to ask for help, the gold coins that the lord delivered to the Master and the Temple every year were not for the sake of hearing in vain - he had many positions on his body. Like a pharmacist, a supervisor, a judge (sometimes a sour plum, sometimes two eggs), a mentor (if he can find a smart child), the most important thing is to translate, to be a steward, a bard, a past The part of the businessman who said that he could not understand was translated to the villagers, and then the villagers’ demands and pleadings were told to those people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Kerry was only standing on the edge of the village for a while. After several farmers rushed back, the priest who came to meet him was a priest of Ilmot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides being draped over the body, it is a few inches shorter than the usual priest's robes and a gray belt tied to the waist. This must be gray and rough. . The middle-aged man with a large joint can hardly see the difference with those peasants. He stared at the elf for a while and hesitated, as if he had to run back to his room and take out the book to compare it. When the elf bowed to him, he stiffened and slowly returned a simple, wrong breast-care ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, he said that the lingua franca is still fluent and clear, and the elf originally thought that he had to spend a lot of time to be allowed to enter the village, and then Try to get some trust from the vigilant villagers to get a temporary rest area - but he told the priest of Ilmot, he was a Ranger. The pastor who had been holding a serious face began to ask if he had a companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Kerry said: "Four, but we encountered some dangerous enemies on the way, so some of them were injured, this is also us The reason for the help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor’s eyes seem to have passed a trace of disappointment, but he quickly got rid of an Il The bad mood that Mott’s followers should not have: “You can live in my house,” he said. “I planted a lot of herbs, maybe you can use some of them.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grateful," said the elf, although he has noticed that the whole thing will not be that simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were watched by children and women as they followed the priest of Ilmot, although they were far away, the children would finger Put it in your mouth and bite it with gusto, like treating this stranger as an imaginary candy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small village with only 30 households. The house is about three feet from the ground. It is a grayish-colored irregular stone. Moss, the snail crawled unhurriedly, leaving a dark green damp mark; above the stone brick is a mud brick showing the true color, and there are thin weeds growing in the cracks - only the priest’s room has stones. The rest of the place is mud, and the plants near the wall roots are very lush, and the places where people often walk around are sparse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest’s house also serves as the sanctuary of Ilmoth, compared to the ones that Krimeral saw before, Rosada’s, Gredi’s, and even Fro’s, the church of Ilmot. It can't even be described as simplistic, in the mouth of some more sharp people, this is simply an embarrassing behavior - it is just a room, the wall is inlaid with transparent glass of the size of a human skull, the sun is thrown on the ground, A bright circle is formed in the circle, which is a finely polished root. The smooth section is enshrined with a small statue. Only the middle finger of Mei Mi is as tall as the elbow and is also wood. The costumes are simple and the lines are rough, but these are not important. Everyone who steps into this room will be touched by the look of the gods. It is a face like an ordinary young man. Only deep love and endless compassion explain him and the roots of all the good things his followers are steadfastly engaged in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry This is a tribute to the gods with the most formal etiquette in the elves, and Bedwin is close behind. Kreima took a mage ceremony, and Gülen and Mei Mi also lowered their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irmot’s pastor led them into their room, which had two large wooden windows that opened and the room would be very Bright, fresh air and pleasant winds can come in. The room is covered with slate, the floor is spotless, the walls are covered with mortar and white, and there is a triangular table in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one bed, the elf looked at it: "We can live in the woods." He said to Kremar: "Here to Bedwin, As for Gülen and Plum...” he asked the pastor: “Can you find them a spare room? We can give the house some copper coins.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will," said the priest. "Two families, two rooms, I think I can still find them - you better not live in the woods."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a bear there," said the thief. "We already know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a bear," the priest paused for a while and said, "I don't know if you have met - a big, white bat." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh oh." The thief said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have encountered." The elf said: "But it is just fruit bats, they make a living from berries and young leaves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now it is." The priest said: "They drink Blood eats meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman's king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second day of the collapse of the tower, Dylan accidentally saw a man in the broken brick pile that he thought was still thousands of miles away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher?" He hurried past and gave his mentor a ritual, and his mentor did not return. I just waved my hand and said that I had noticed him. He was wearing a black cloak and grew to the feet, covering the red robe that was like being infiltrated with blood. He even pulled a hood. But his shoulders hovered with the two heads, spreading their wings and constantly licking the tongue to intimidate the mortals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the servants who searched for precious things in the ruins of the tower were far from him. There was already an idiot who had not tried to open the distance with a red robe warlock at the first time. He was dug up by Anemos, and now he is still crying in pain in the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan’s mentor, and Demon’s mentor, wholeheartedly searched and observed in the original place of the tower, his fingers swaying gently The magical wind blew the air, and the chill of the bones passed through Dylan's long red hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have I cast a few spells?" The red robe warrior suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three." Dylan replied without hesitation, the correct answer, the instructor said in his heart, but he is not very satisfied, the outside apprentices are always a bit Stupid and dull, if it is in his tower, the apprentices who are destined to become a red robe or red robe guilty will answer the wrong question, so that his mentor can punish him logically, otherwise why Asked a simple question? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Dylan Donkley is better than Demon of White Tower. Even if he thinks of Demon, he can’t help but vomit. What kind of monster is this? ? Even if he is only smarter than him, a stone is softer than him. A sword can be compared with him. Fortunately, as the instructor knows, Demon’s wife has been dragged down by his stupid master. Half-dead Asmodeos had a lot of secrets in the dark, she was raising the little devil, and the little devil was raising her, and the mentor could say that she couldn’t wait to sip the evil wine they had brewed together— - So he doesn't have to face the once-disciple - the replacement of a smart point master in White Tower is not a bad thing, even if the new owner may have half the blood of the elf, but her heart is half the blood of human beings. Filled up, the instructor is willing to give her more and more correct teaching and instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what I am looking at?" The instructor asked the second question, but this question does not require Dylan to answer: "I am looking at how the cute little mage did it - oh, I am a bit skeptical that he is not a mage. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a mage?" Dylan asked in surprise: "How can an elf allow a warlock to walk by his side and call him a friend?" He is still a half-elves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructor snorted: "The tolerance of the elves is something you can hardly imagine, just like their narrowness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pokes a stone with his toes, the effect of magic has disappeared, but the re-condensed texture still allows this experienced warlock to find out trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me," he said: "Dylan, if it is you, standing on the position of the little wizard, want to escape from this capital, you will "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will cast a fire," Dylan said, he has considered this question: "Or a plague, specifically It’s urgent to see if the recourse in Wangdu is tight.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He first cast a illusion,” the instructor said: “We’ve all guessed that, the group was The puppy that was released was very bold. You must know that at that time, any caster passed by them and bowed down in time. Their traces were revealed. Then the tower..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suspect he used a spell," Dylan boldly interjected and said the name of the spell: "It caused the ground to crack and the tower collapsed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only that," the instructor said, although he was a little unhappy, he decided to say it. After reading: "Look here, he not only uses a spell, but also includes several reels - there must be two or three fossils for sand. He opened the stone bricks on the ground, and what is below? Mud, then he turned the piece of mud into a swamp. No, it wasn't enough. There was an elf next to him. He asked the elf to germinate the plant, a strong thorn," he said to his disciples. A blackened branch: "It has been burned and withered, but at that time it can wrap the entire tower. Have you ever thought that a thorn with a height of nearly 100 feet will have such a strong and developed root system?" - You should remember, I asked you to do a small experiment, remember the seed? How easy it is when it starts to cover the bones? And that is just the seed of a bean - the roots of the thorns ruin the tower The basis, well, there is a fool, continuous use of fire and cooling spells, causing stone bricks to crack - then, can anyone stop it from collapsing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
