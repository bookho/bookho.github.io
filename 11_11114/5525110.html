"Demon, respectable Demon "Mage," he said sharply. "It's not so good--you called his name and threw him at him. Who knows if he is listening to our conversation?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need to worry about this," said the mage who had previously scorned the daughter of "Pig Intestine" as a hybrid. "The dear Master of Morality will not commit such a low level. Wrong, he deliberately read a wrong consonant. Didn't you hear it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to Demon, the second son of the consul, his face smiled and laughed. "But your words are really amazing. Anyway, you have a brother who is a Pastor of Rosada, and a brother who marks Rosada's holy flowers on his burqa and robes, Rosada. The sanctuary and the sanctuary stand in the city that your father manages for thousands of years...the residents here," he saw The two merchants who were walking by him, with gold chains hanging around their necks, gold-plated bay leaves hanging from the gold chain: "Almost all of them are Rosada's followers."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am a caster," Demon said. "The arrogance is always a common problem for the caster. I have no intention of correcting them. - Ok, give me today's record. You can go back, if there is something else or something else, I will summon you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two casters handed over their records, cast Of course, the way of recording is not ink, pen and paper. They each cast a spell and dig a pair of eyes from the cat, driving their magic pets to sneak one of them into the "intestines" cabin, the other After washing, it sinks into the mixed solution of Mithril and Quartz. After it finishes, it looks sparkling, round and round, and every part of the eyeball is clearly visible, just like some kind of exquisite jewelry. Demon put them in the palm of his hand, the "peeping eye" made by the timid and sweet guy was a bit gray and speckled - it took too long to put in the quartz solution, and the outer quartz remained too much. And the secret silver powder is not evenly distributed, the inside of the eyeball is not handled properly, and some of the blood vessels and nerves are still dragged behind the white sphere - the scene it records looks sure there will be blurring and shaking; and his companions do The gadgets are much better, transparent, clean, and the eyeballs inside are as clean as the peeled grapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon is not so satisfied with the two casters he recruited. One is very talkative, but stupid, even he deliberately misreads Can't tell, Demon really doesn't know how he was allowed to leave the mentor, so he said that although he knows how to obey you, it is difficult to put him in an important position with peace of mind; the other can barely use it. I always love to show off his little cleverness, always remembering the performance, and sometimes I will make some small accidents to calculate and test his employer - this is why even a simple peeping task Demon has to follow. s reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure you have got the eyeballs left in that room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is already in the belly of my magic pet," the stupid mage shouted. Road: "I stared at it and ate it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me too." Another caster said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their pets are just ordinary big bats and snakes, and Demon has a little devil pet from the endless abyss - it follows Demon’s instructions It never appeared in broad daylight, except for Demon's mentor, Demon, who was introduced to his mentor by this tooth-dropping gadget. No one knows that he has such a terrible demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the saying goes, the devil comes to the devil alone - although the coming is not the kind of abyss that people usually mean in the sense - He just mentioned, the brother of Demon, the second son of the consul, a knight, a knight who is eager to fight for Rosada, he is undergoing heavy training and test, hoping to get a vocation, so his The burqa and the embroidered laurel embroidered on the robes are unopened. The color used is also light green instead of dark green. He inherits the mother's deep maroon hair, slightly rolled, no beard, perhaps It was because of the relationship in the inner city that he did not wear full body armor, but only a light Mithril chain armor, followed by two servants wearing two color suits, he immediately jumped off his horse when he saw his brother. Come to him and open his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon's look puts two "peep eyes" into the soft inner pocket, rather than responding to his brother's hug, it is better to say I took a picture of my brother's chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So today's discussion is here." He said to the two temporary subordinates: "Tomorrow will come again."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dermond’s brother and he watched both of them go away. “Is this your new friend?” asked the elder’s eldest son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Occasionally passing the Master of White Tower," Demon replied: "I am fighting for my father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The White Tower already has Antonio and you," his brother did not agree with: "There is only three Masters in Beitburg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The Alva Master of Bibi Dibao is worthy of the first half of the mediocrity, and there are two apprentices who are about to leave the mentor. The situation of the White Tower is more complicated than the Betty Dyke, and there are always people in the shadows who are in the shadows. Demon said: "I don't know if my father has mentioned it to you. We have only recently discovered a dark passage for smuggling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just came back, my father is still in the official residence, I am going to see him," Demon’s brother said: "The last time I received the letter, he mentioned this, but only one or two sentences, or At that time, things were not so bad. I mean, you are collecting soldiers and mages privately-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you blaming me?" Speaking sharply: "I am obeying the orders of my father, the White Tower's consul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't mean that," said the Cavaliers. I am worried about you, my father still has a white tower. I have heard some news. The people you recruited are almost all thieves, criminals, and idle mercenaries of unknown origin. Before that, they were not allowed to enter. Outer towns, but now they can be in the inner city..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third thieves union has now appeared and has invaded the Baita Within, they have snakes and mages, maybe giants, we don’t know how many people they have, but we search The lake around the White Tower has found six full dark passages that can be used for smuggling and can transport soldiers and monsters. We need to strengthen the armed forces of the White Tower. Demon said slowly: "Yes, these people really don't have Your elves are pure and innocent, but they can help us protect the White Tower - as long as they give money, they will do it and do their best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have a direction? The Lord asks for help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor brother," Demon said. "You still don't understand," he looked at his brother with pity and contempt. The elves don't bleed for humans. They only care about themselves. Gray Mountain needs help. White Tower must naturally lend a helping hand, but the other way around - we certainly have to ask the lord for help. Is it necessary to look at the documents? Three, we didn't get an answer, and we didn't get an explanation. This is the elf. They are not humans. Even if they have a beautiful face that is more beautiful than most humans, the half-elves mixed with their blood are the same, just like you love. The woman, Our lords, you swear to her loyalty, docile as an old dog, but she shows you more feelings than others? No, she refuses you, ignores you, just because you are not her kind Even if you die in front of her," the wizard added viciously: "You may not be able to get a tearful tears - because she treats us like this, treating the white tower, as the transit city of the elves, the white tower only has a dock. And the house is fine. As for the people inside, even if it is all dead, some people will come in and continue to be full of it - after all, the wealth that can be learned here can be compared with the tributary of the Star River, how can she use the gray ridge Are those precious elves and half elves in exchange for human life? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
