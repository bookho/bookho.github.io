			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan looked at himself in the mirror, this look, the young man with a clear eyes made him feel strange, "When can I see my lords?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Always available." Empress Dowager Wang said kindly, showing the gentlest smile of a mother who is about to send out rewards and fulfill her promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not talking about John, Fukai and your lord, but mine." Dylan said sarcastically, it is a group of inflammatory trends. The villain, there are many despicable guys who have been repeated in these three, but except for the knight who is deeply loved by the Empress Dowager, the loyalty, at least the superficial and verbal loyalty to John, is almost impossible. What good results were obtained, just before the coronation ceremony, there was a group of acknowledgments or acquiescence to John’s request, to make his daughter or prostitute become an unidentified mistress, watching the children he once loved. After suffering terrible torture, they lost their lives tragically - several of them passed through the princess of Diane, then the hand of the Queen Mother of the Dien, to the eyes of King John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan disagrees with them, they just made a sale with their daughter/prostitute, and almost succeeded, if John is not because If he is too weak, and he has been in the wine, and he has lost the proper control and thinking ability with the herb that is ingested in tobacco, he may really become a king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those are just some swindlers," said Queen Mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You killed them?" Dylan asked, and he is not surprised that the Queen Mother of the Ann is doing anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet." said Empress Dowager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan turned to look at his mother, and after losing her expectations for Morton Don Clay, Dylan’s envy of her parents was all devoted. Diane, and Diane seems to be the same, they are the arms and the only dependence of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Say, "But Dylan, remember that you are already the king of Norman in the Highlands. You need to be no longer just a Thunderbolt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Thunderbolt is the most important armor of Norman in the Highlands. Without the Thunderbolt, the orcs can drive away and attack the king at any time - but Dylan said nothing, no need, if the Queen Mother of the Peace can understand and understand These, Dylan will not be born at all, or, at the very least, an illegitimate child who will bring shame to the Don Cree family and Morton himself, should be a dispensable second son or three sons instead of Have the identity of an eldest son who can inherit the Morton Donkary territory, surname and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan was aware of him after spending a whole harsh winter in Thunder, and his mother brought to Tang Cray an unquestionable shame. With the injury, he found that his original idea was not as complete as he was - but when he wanted to find someone to discuss, he found that those who could give him help and advice had long been with him and his family. The party plume expelled from the Thunder Fortress, not in the wilderness outside the Thunder Castle, or was captured as a slave, or returned to the arm of Birdwin, who knew that Baldwin had a generous friend and enriched himself. The incomparable territory was handed over to him for management, and Baldwin was unrestricted to accommodate the Normans who were forced into exile. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, on the road leading to the kingdom of Thunderburg, on the territory of Morton Don Clay, there are his personally separated Sir Alex, they Originally, they followed his knights, or now, their soldiers and serfs not only need to guard the territory of Sir Alex Ferguson, but also need to go to reinforcements and battles when Thunderbolt is in a tight battle. Dylan is still anxious before As he treated civilians with ordinary soldiers and knights, he cut off these hard thorns, and now he is lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really doesn’t want these people to be detained by Empress Dowager, but he has a vague feeling that these people are really what they think people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will see them soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen Mother’s eyes plundered After a trace of haze: "Well, you can see them immediately. Let my knight take you there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
