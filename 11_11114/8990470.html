			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cleric, who was wearing a beak mask, saw a group of people who walked out of the gloomy mansion. He was deeply surprised because he was very It is clear that the house was the most seriously devastated one when the disease broke out. He and his brother removed more than half a dozen bodies and more than a dozen patients (although the patient has now become a dead person), he remembers Since yesterday, the personal servant of the owner of this house has also died, leaving only his master still lingering. The stubborn former knight insisted on dying in his own room instead of dying with civilians in the sanctuary set up by the followers of Cranford for the dead of the disease, so they scrubbed his body for him (speaking better than nothing) Because he was still vomiting blood and convulsions during the bathing process, he put on a clean linen shirt, wrapped in gray ramie, and took his favorite wide sword and gave it to him. Hold - Ke Lanwo's pastor estimates that he is at the latest tonight, and is ready to go to meet this eccentric old man in time, but he also remembers very clearly, the mansion There is only one living person left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where did these people come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in front, and screaming is a woman, a priest of Fro, the priest of Clauwo saw the golden bell hanging from her waist There is silk robe, the edge of the neckline is kissed and the bruises left behind after biting... and then a thief, although he dresses up normally, ordinary people may not be able to distinguish, but in the dark and the light can walk freely Pastor Wo is no stranger to the profession of thieves, and...the god of death is dangerously picking up his eyes behind the mask. The dark shadow floats behind this thin young man, with a blurred outline, different from the living. Unlike the deceased, Ke Lanwo's priest raised his fingers and did not hesitate to cast a magical spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German immediately wants to return to the manor that floats with a rancid smell when he sees the crow mask that represents the god of death. For him, there is no One. No, a lot of Ke Lanwo pastor is even worse. He still carries the curse of the god of death - but his movements are not fast enough, and the light silver light hit him. The outburst caused his eyes to sting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster, the companion of the priest who cast the magic, said in sign language, white robe? They saw the white robe worn by Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a magical technique, the previous pastor also said in sign language. It is a spell, it is a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other priests of Claam gathered together. Kerry's slightly raised his head, the magical atmosphere in the air fluctuated uneasily. At this moment, the place appeared to be a bit unsatisfactory - like this large-scale, even the priests of Rosada and Ilmot They are deeply troubled. In the end, only the priest of the god of death to clean up the endangered disease is not naturally occurring. It is often hidden behind a red robe or a gray robe. It is conceivable that in the demise of mourning, Suddenly appeared. How vigilant a healthy and unfamiliar person can be - but he can't blame Krimer, anyway, Gülen is a companion, and they can't see their companions being attacked but indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Ranger took a few steps forward and crossed over Kremar and Gülen. He first extended his hands and said that he did not carry weapons and reels. There was no gesture of casting, and then slowly, taking off his hood with an action that everyone can clearly distinguish - when leaving the "concave corner" village. In order to hide his elf character, Kerry is like the first time he met with Kremar, combing his hair into a braid and then fixing the hair to the back. In this way they can hide the most different point between the elf and the human being - the pair of beautiful and lovely ear tips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he solved them, and the tension was slightly relaxed. The Ranger raised his fingers and showed his identity in sign language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Crawford's pastor...Is there anything... I mean, when they become pastors, do you need to do something? The soul of the alien world asks. He has profoundly recognized the cruelty of this plane. It would not be too surprising if a god asked his priest to cut off his tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You mean why they can’t talk, the Lich says, no, they didn’t cut their tongues, but the priests of Kravo are only praying and extremely necessary At that time, for example, when repeating the good words of the dying person to the living, they will speak. In normal times, they use the linguistic language, which is the sign language, to offer their heartfelt respect to their gods, because death is always silent. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world understands - but if no one happens to have a sign language, and they want to have a drink? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The priest of the god of death does not drink, the lich says that they only drink water and eat wheat cakes, and everyone knows that no one will give Crohn The priest has a glass of honey, which is contrary to the teachings of the god of death - because all followers of the god of death have experienced a death, or have watched the closest person die, disheartened, opposite The country of the people no longer has a lover of love. After becoming the waiter of the god of death, they think that they have been included in the list of the souls of the soul, but they have not yet entered the mourning wasteland, so they will not covet any belongings. Enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the lich is concerned, the priest of death, the priest of death, is devout and pure, even far more than some undead. In the first few decades, the undead will fear their rotten body. They tend to use their spells to pretend that they are still alive. They will sip fine wine, taste good food, wear extravagant jewels and expensive silk (although they will soon be eroded by negative energy to ruin) and continue to have beautiful lovers. Many servants can no longer disguise themselves, whether they are themselves or others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the perception of the undead can affect the followers of the god of death. Like other pastors, they will try to destroy once they see the undead. They, in this respect, they are doing better than any white robes. It’s really alive (this is true). The lich has explored the brains of one of the guys. Simply put, they are not dead. Envy and hate - because the latter can die early but refuse to die, but they must live - the lich does not doubt, if not the god of death hates those who lie their lives They probably died and killed each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--They are not afraid of death, and the undead who used to be addicted to add that the city is probably left with the dead and the sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lich and the soul of the alien world, the followers of the god of death, Klanwo’s followers made a less profound discussion, Kerryburn The situation has been explained to the head of the clerk, Klanwo, who is also one of the compulsory courses for the elves. Of course, the identity of Birdwin is subtly blurred, and the elf tells the priest of Cranco. They were inadvertently touched by a magical device with a transport-like spell on the adventure road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the magic device? Ke Lanwo's pastor "asked." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't come with us. The elf "answers" and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does your mage remember the spells of the delivery class? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry had looked at Kremar and asked him, and Kreima shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, the priest of Klamow "said." Please do not use it for the time being, I know, he "said", this request is very unreasonable, but I trust you. He took a nap about the elf. We haven't been able to find out how the disease has been transferred from one person to another. I am worried, you understand, if you use teleportation or use something else. When the method leaves, you may spread this deadly disease to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was silent for a while. He turned to look at the person behind him. As an elf, he was immune to most human diseases. This disease may not affect him. There is also the thief Gülen, who can be said to be "not dead" in some respects. Just like this, he really does not know whether the god of death gave the thief a blessing or a curse; as for Crimal, his The blood of the elf in the body obviously occupies most of it, and the rest of it may not belong to humans. This is known to the White Tower Ranger, like the kind of damage that can cause death and permanent disability in ordinary humans. For the black-haired caster, it is only two to three days of inconvenience; among them. The most dangerous thing is Mei Mei and Baldwin. The former is at least a pastor, and Byrdwin, he is just a weak human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei has been closely watching their every move. She has not encountered a disease that has swept through the entire city, but she can get an extremely intuitive description from her loved ones. Among them are adventurers, pastors, and consuls, as well as Sir Alex and the Lord. Many of them have seen and experienced epidemics, while the latter three have often signed orders to burn a settlement and a village, simply because there is a disease that can lead to death. Some diseases are not incurable, but the time is too long, or the cost is too high. More importantly, it may be too close to the city and the fortress. In case, just in case, it is best to use flames to completely destroy everything. Decontamination and destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they talking about?" She rushed and grabbed Baldwin as if she was hiding behind a solid shield. "You are saying What!?" she screamed. "Why don't we leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf turned to stare at her, how close the eyes were like blue sky Beauty, how cold it is: "We must stay here, Mei Mi." He ruthlessly pronounced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei looked at him, and then looked at Baldwin with horror, and Birdwin was gray, but he was very calm, as a former lord, he I am very clear about what kind of situation I will face. "We stay," he said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin didn’t accidentally see Fro’s priest let go of his arm, her face twisted, her teeth biting her lips, and suddenly turned to the thief Too much to go, the strength is like breaking your neck: "What about you? Gülen, do you want to die here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief smiled He hasn't been so happy for a long time: "I don't want to." He deliberately said that when Mei Mi showed a hint of hope: "But I won't go with you." He waved his little finger viciously: "Turn you Go on your own, cute little wife, as long as you can,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor who had been "talking" to the Elf Ranger made a gesture, and several pastors surrounded him. One of their duties was to prevent the spread of this deadly disease - but a huge voice rang around them. The eye-catching light, after they disappeared, plum honey disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? A Ke Lanwo pastor asked, need to track? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the head of the pastor replied that the gates have been blocked with stones, and she could not leave the city without the help of her companions - We will find her after she dies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street is very dirty, he turned to Kerry Ben, maybe you are willing to enter the fair church of Cranco, we are for the rest The living room built a clean room and the disease could not be invaded there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much, the elf said, me, and my companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, the thief Gülen glanced at the dark alleys not far away, but he said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church in Klanwo was originally the official residence of the consul, and countless crows lived in the eaves, the spires and the gargoyles used for drainage, they gaze The elf and the group of people, can not say a word, the red eyes are like the embers flashing in the black charcoal fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the only shelter, everyone needs to pass the magic test of two Priests of Ilmot, and drop their blood in a full In the silver cup of clear spring water, Kerry was the first one. Gülen followed closely. Kreima took a small needle and gently stabbed himself. The blood dripping was not formed at all. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid of pain." The soul of the outside world is a serious statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is Baldwin, his blood drops into the cup, and the water in the cup immediately becomes muddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irmot’s pastor glanced at the cup and raised his eyes with pity: "May the benevolent Ilmot wish you, Stranger," he said. "You can't enter this room - you have got the disease."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
