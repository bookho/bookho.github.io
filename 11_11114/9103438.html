Devin and Leona were the first to go to the place where the thunder and lightning went. The cold water poured into their boots, and Baldwin waved a wide sword and smashed an ugly head. The sea immediately filled. A stinking smog, the former paladin keenly grabbed a human woman half-immersed in the water, put her on her shoulder, "be careful of their blood." He shouted: "The liquid in their body will pollute the sea. His reminder made Leona a backhand, instead of using a sword, but with a sword, she took a slightly smaller sea ghost, and took her straight into the sea, while pulling the one who was trying to get from the sea. The boy standing up in his paws, holding her hand wet and cold, still trembled constantly, the child's face and body were with deep scars, and the edges of the trousers were black and broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world continues to float in midair, and the night during the eternal life is also half-bright, his vision can make him through the night sea gray The sea sees the situation below - the distance between the sea ghosts is far away, and the children and women who have been looted from the igloo, the lightning that he throws in the sea spreads faster than the swamp or The air is faster, but the power is weakened, but that's exactly what it needs—the sea ghosts are covered with abscesses and dark yellow skin, just as ghouls are thin, only the abdomen is like a pregnant woman. Inflated, and always squatting on the back, when a pair of claws hang down, they can touch the knees, but the most petite one of them is also as high as Bywin. In addition, when running, perhaps because they don’t want to The prey is too early to die, they are carrying women and children running, or biting their children in the mouth like the leader, which makes the first hit by the current is the sea ghost, not the unfortunate victims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thin current can only temporarily paralyze the sea ghosts, especially their leader, the strongest and tallest one, even after a breath Come over - although it seems that there is still a flash of lightning flashing, but she immediately found out that this is not the lightning thrown by the caster, but the double knife in the elf's palm, the "flash" and the "silver crown" in the pale gleam Under the moonlight, they are chaste and soft. In the violent sea breeze, they tremble slightly, eager to drink the blood of the monsters - the sea ghosts scream in angrily, and the children who bite in her mouth fall into the sea and send out A fragile cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's attention was removed for a moment, and the leader of the sea ghosts had already rushed up. She even gave up the human female who was originally in her hand, and her eyes were red like a crocodile or a jackal in the dim light. The light, obviously, the flesh and blood of the elves is more coveted than humans - she does not avoid the elves' double knives, let them puncture their bodies, her blood and body fluids spew out from the wounds, only very much of them A small part of it fell into the sea, the sea water was boiled ominously, and the sea ghosts made a sly laughter - her flesh and blood not only corroded the healthy body, but also infected deadly and rapid diseases. Her hands and feet were tight. I caught the elf's body and wanted to drag him into the sea. The sea is their home. Their restaurant is also their fortress. No one wants to take this delicious sweet meat from her claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dagger piercing her back, no, it will not affect her actions, even if there is no internal organs, the sea ghost is still a Strong sea ghost, for her, this is just a small thorn, although it is a small thorn that makes her pain extremely, she opened her mouth and wanted to bite a piece of flesh belonging to the elf, but she found that Outside of the cold sea breeze, she couldn't bite anything. She stared at her prey in confusion, and the darkness engulfed her as if she swept from the bottom of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has gently closed his arm, and the "Silver Crown" and "Starlight" quickly pulled out after the meeting in the decaying body of the Sea Ghost, and the two knives were not stained. A little dirty, he stood in the sea, no damage, the thief looked at the caster in midair, and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I am doing more than one thing." The thief said that while pulling out the dagger, he felt the cold air from the dagger and pressed it into the sea. It seems that the gray-green blood in the body of the sea ghost is washed away with sea water, but it is waiting for the dagger to completely absorb the filthy power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The help given by the companion will never be superfluous." Kerry Ben said that the "Silver Crown" and "Starlight" will be scabbard, "Thank you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand may have to say something, but those Alatites have already rushed over, and Nanuk and his son are at the forefront." It was Naunuk’s wife and little daughter who was robbed by the leader of the sea ghost. The little daughter’s body was covered with soaked fox skin. Nanuk took the child from Leona’s hand and sorrowed. I found that she had stopped breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see." Kerry Ben said that he had heard the child cry before he met the sea ghost, and he put the child on the sand. The child’s face was pale, and the elf bowed his head. She applied her cheeks to her lips to feel if she could breathe and then moved to her chest. “There is hope.” The elf said, dumping the potion that Leona handed over. In the girl's mouth, after a long silence like a day and night, people were pleasantly surprised to hear the hard and painful cough. Kerry had helped her up a little and let her vomit out the sea and sand. Nanuk’s wife staggered under the support of others. After seeing her daughter regain her vitality, her smile was just as dazzling as the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Quickly let go!” The tribe’s shaman suddenly yelled. He swayed his stick and opened several people who were holding the child and his wife. They were not allowed to approach their loved ones: “Have you forgotten? "He screamed fiercely: "The sea ghosts will bring disease! Leave these people and don't let them get infected with your body!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Let me be with my wife," said Nanuk. "I have got a disease." He bowed his back and his back was full of festering wounds, but he sternly forced his son. They are not allowed to approach themselves: "The other people, those who have not been touched by the sea ghosts, have left here - far away, even the smoke that we ignited can't see it... fast, in the disease Before the Horde was extinct!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and let people clearly see the scars and abscesses on his body, only to be immersed in the joy of Alati The special person immediately silenced, and the Alatitians will take off when they fall asleep. All the clothes, in the sleeping bags that are sewed into the fur, share the body temperature with the lover or the child, which makes most of them, in the encounter with the sea ghosts, all the red/naked battles - if not The shaman reminded that the injured people may not have noticed that their wounds not only spoiled unusually, but also began to fester and exude an unbearable stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman and the child who were looted by the sea ghosts were almost spared, and Nanuk’s wife bowed her head and looked at the little daughter in her arms, shaking It was found that her wounds were not ulcerated, and they were no longer bleeding and red, and they could not smell the dirty smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks at the elves, the Elf Ranger is looking at Perant, the Druid is also heavy, and there are as many as 20 people injured by the Sea Ghost. Their potions are simply not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no other way?" The soul of the alien world asked, and Gülen, who was behind him, looked at the people and stunned slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——This is the Yongyue Sea. The Lich said before the elf answered that he was not suddenly called by Irmot, but if he was If you don't say anything, there will definitely be more terrible things coming to him - one Tyre is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- How do you say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——There may be something we need in the night of the sea, and the undead who once said quickly said that the night sea and the northern land are daunting to the living. Place, but for the undead, it is like a small garden full of surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spear is squatting," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It seems that we coincide, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What is that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——A kind of fish called “stone mill” and “moon”, which can grow to a large size, has a flat body and almost no tail. But one of them has a tail like a spear tip, which is even rarer, but it can't be said to be a fish. It can only be said to be a magical creature because its blood and mucous membranes have the effect of treating other creatures. Sometimes sea lions They will hover around them, and even wounds that have been torn by sharks will heal in a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Can they treat the wounds left by the sea ghosts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Is not very important, the lich sneered, but it can be a cover for us - the most deadly is not the wound, but the disease Our blood is a good and no drug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——呃...I don’t have...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Oh, you want to be with me Swear? Isn't this the first thing you think of? The bottomless abyss is down. Do you know what monsters are filled with positive energy? The pure positive energy is not created for the main material plane. Their bodies will only be catalyzed by the bright and sturdy force, which will swell and burst into stardust – or you can Explain that your other half of the blood is the activating artist (a combination of pure energy) that inherits from the positive energy plane, or is it a positive energy monster or a constructed creature? Whether they have blood or not? The bottomless abyss is down, don't look at the elves as stupid as you are! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——...... I will be cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of silence, the undead once gave a sneer--well, he said, whatever you want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why don’t you leave?” Nanuk said: “Shaman, you are not injured. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My apprentice can already become a real shaman, and I am old." Shaman said: "The most vulnerable to the disease, except for the baby, there is only the old man. Maybe the poison of the sea ghost has already fluttered with the wind. In my throat, maybe ten days, or twenty days, I will rot, will emit poison gas, destroy our tribe. And," he added: "I stay here, maybe I can treat you well." What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanuk smiled very reluctantly, no one knew his mystery better than him. The Shamans of the Alatitians have only been able to treat wounds with the herbs and some shells for decades. Some priests of the evil gods said their gods, the god of the North, Wulou Tiru It has fallen, and the elves and some good god priests told them that Ulu Tiru is just falling asleep, but in any case, it is an indisputable fact that Ulu Tiru has been unable to protect them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the elf coming over to them, and Nanuk subconsciously retreated, but he immediately thought that the Son of Nature was not afraid of most diseases. In his eyes, he passed a hint of envy, especially when he saw the little daughter in his wife's arms. Although the younger daughter was healed, she still did not follow the safe and innocent people because she was too young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me." Nanuk said: "My friend, the agreement between us is impossible to continue - go west, I remember Another tribe of the Alatitrites is about five nights away from here, and their number is less than ours, but as long as they are not attacked by the sea ghosts, they should be able to build a big ship you want. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant had no words, just reached out and touched Nanuk’s forehead, and he was already feverish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know where there are red algae near here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is to cool down and remove "Toxins?" Shaman said: "The north-south position is there, only twenty miles away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will be back soon," Perrin Special said: "Don't give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Alatis who can still act to help the elves to carry the wounded who have fallen into high heat and coma to the igloo In the igloo, most of the sundries were emptied according to the requirements of the elves, and the diluted water of life and healing potions were distributed to ensure that their injuries did not deteriorate. The druid incarnation of the whales quickly found the red algae, pulled a large piece and brought it back to the tribe. Shaman and Birdwin, Gülen together crushed the red algae and applied it to the injured person’s lips and wounds. Nuuk’s young daughter was brought back to their igloo by Leona. Anyway, the little girl’s life was worry-free, but the fright and torture she had suffered before was an adult who might not be able to endure it. The black hair caster Spreading the rose petals on her forehead, she quickly entered a smooth, dreamless sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
