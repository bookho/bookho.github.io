			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be crowned, he must bear the weight<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence comes from another plane, but here also has an approximate proverbDylan Donkre was squatting in the room where King John was still a duke, and the fine gold crown and scepter inlaid with sapphires and stones were placed in a box with white suede and red velvet. Put it in front of him - the flames in the hearth, and Dylan reached out and placed it on the crown. The cold metal conveyed from his fingertips to his heart. After hesitating for a moment, he lifted the crown, and the fine gold was a kind of ratio. Steel is harder, something heavier than gold, melting it and casting it into what people want is not a simple matter – when the first Highland Norman king needs such a crown At the time, the elves of the silver-crowned jungle gave them help. Although the dwarves have always claimed that they hate the elves very much, they rarely refuse them as long as they are required by the elves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crown, according to the wishes of the Norman king, who was then a tribal leader, was cast into the shape of the bear's teeth and the silver-crowned tree leaves, which is said to symbolize Elves and human friendshipBut the life span of human beings is too short, and the life of the elves is so long. I don’t know when it started, the things that need to be remembered are not in the long river of time, and the hard life and the fate of unequal The contradiction that originally existed further intensifiedIt’s like now, whether it’s Princess Ang Principal or Dylan, they don’t know the secrets of this crown, or they don’t care if they know it. For Princess Chang’an, the world’s only Three people need her to love, herself, her son Dylan, and her only recognized spouse FukaiAnd Dylan Don Cray, when he was a toddler, any kind of teaching he accepted was telling him that the elf is a kind of alien that can almost be equated with the devil and the devil, perhaps even worse, long life. With the beautiful face, every lie they say will be believed to be true... They subtly disguise themselves, pretend to be deliberate, and deliberately make a lonely and indifferent gesture, seemingly not interested in power and not interested, but look at white Tower, look at the Bibi dike, look at Norman and Thunder Castle, look at the gray ridge and the silver crown jungle, aren't they all elves or people who prefer elves rule? Not to mention that every adult elf has to travel for decades or more. How many people have they conquered with their own name and charm? No one can countAnd the elves' tentacles will extend to every city and every jungle, or every wilderness, as their footsteps and arrows plague, listening to the songs of the bards, the name of the elf is no better than Is the Cavaliers or Kings more? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan has always thought of this, he is hostile to the elves, despising the elves, rejecting the elves, and after gaining the reign of Thunder, he evoked the elves without thinking. The good knights and merchants, he also refused the assistance of the Silver Crown jungle before each winter. He thought that even without the elves and their allies, humans can fight the orcs, use magic, and will - he is I think so, and he thinks that he will give all the Thunder Fortress like the old Don Cray.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in an instant, everything is subverted - King John is dead, that simple, maybe because many people have already had enough of a madness The king, he looked at his mother, Princess Ang Prin, took the crown of the sly and wore it on her hair, but just a few days ago, she told Dylan that the new coronation ceremony was being prepared, and in the winter Before her arrival, her son will become the king of Norman in the Highlands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan is in vain, he doesn’t know what to do, although his heart is urging him to return to Fort Lee as soon as possible, but Princess Ang Principal, or Her Majesty the Queen of Norman sent no less than 20 casters and a hundred Knights to guard Dylan, lest this wayward little guy escape when she was not paying attention. There was no new king at the coronation ceremony. It was so ridiculous. Up<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan knows that she truly loves her, otherwise she will not give up authority and glory so easily, this is not what he wants, but he can’t Refuse<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow, Dylan Donkre will cease to exist, and since he will inherit the throne of Norman in the Highlands, he will not be able to continue to keep Don Cray’s surname, though This surname seems to have never really belonged to him, but he really wants to lose it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dillen have a rest?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Norman sits in front of the large ebony dressing table, surrounded by three busy maidsOne helped her to dismantle the hairpins, and took off the small hairpins with the stones and pearls. On the huge hairpin, there were probably hundreds of such small things; the second helped her untie the laces on the sleeves. This is a new style that has only recently come from the southern countries. The sleeves are fluffy and wide, and then they are tied up with a thin band of silk of various colors, which are all sorts of fun. It can be written as a three-inch book; the third is for her to use it to moisturize the skin. These creams come from a warlock. Expensive can make a poor jazz bankrupt before the winter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
