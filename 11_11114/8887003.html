			<div id="content">Women are talking about men, and men are talking about women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings of Norman Norman are large and ugly, and all buildings are made of yellow rock covered with pockmarks. Because the second king of Norman in the Highlands was only a son of a northern tribal chief, his eyes were not long-term or critical. So at first, after he wore an iron crown, draped the orc's fur, and held a spear that was immersed in the blood of the enemy, after the tribe's people and the priests witnessed that he was king, he The palace was just a castle abandoned by the original owner. At that time, the first king of Norman in the Highlands occupied half of the northern land, most of which were deserted wilderness, but there was no shortage of A city and a village that was abandoned by its lords because of the inability to fight against the orcs. In the eyes of a chieftain’s son, a stone castle is much better than a cowhide tent, although he and his people are not used to fixing. Live in one place, but it is very tall, safe, won't be blown away by the wind or crushed by snow, and there are plenty of rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, you don’t expect him to value those luxury items and decorations that are dispensable, although some of them do allow users Feeling comfortable and happy - unfortunately, like the first few lords of Thunder, their loyal kings are also a poor man, they even cover the windows of the castle (the ones inlaid with glass) The tapestry of the window was sold to merchants and replaced with wooden boards. For more than a hundred years, the king lived in the room with his queen, children, attendants and their dogs and horses. The ground and walls were bare. There are no beds and no tables, only a few wooden boxes for storage; there is a bonfire in the hall at the bottom, and the pot is hung on the bonfire. The ministers sit on the ground, and only the priest's noble butt can be fortunate enough for more hides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation continues until more and more refugees, fugitive slaves, adventurers and businessmen flood into Norman Highlands - they cultivate, they collect They hunt, they dig, they buy and sell... bring real tax and income to the king of Norman, and bring shackles and greed - at some point, the Norman soldiers and knights in the Highlands not only have to fight The orcs also fight against the nobles and princes who want to recapture the territory and plunder more. Because of this, when the king needed to expand, the less reliable grass mud, wood, and half-wood were immediately excluded from the choice. The king did not hesitate to pick up a stone from the Longji Mountains. And chose the most practical architectural style - simply, after repairing his castle, he built more fortresses on the outskirts of the castle, then connected them with walls - even servants and The house where slaves live is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not cuboids or cylinders. The construction of the cylinder is dull and boring. The yellow-brown exterior wall is smooth and monotonous. There is no line or bump that exists only for decoration. The roof is covered with blue-gray iron. There is no window, only the length of the arm is left. The square holes are light and airy, without sculptures - except for the gargoyles standing on the top corner of the roof, they are magical, and they will take off and attack the enemy according to the commander's command when necessary. The roads in the city are narrow and the roads are rugged. The iron gates and suspension bridges can be seen everywhere. Within the kings, the trees within 100 miles are cut down to avoid being used by the enemy to make siege equipment and build camps. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the princes and knights of Norman’s Highlands have now pushed their territory and army farther, the king is no longer in the enemy’s time. Threat, but the king’s will is completely inherited. After three expansions, the king still looks like a large and densely-structured bastion, not a palace and a mansion. Someone once wanted to transform these fortresses, such as Said, bigger and more beautiful windows and doors, twisted verandas, or terraces and bridges that extend outwards, but they were severely reprimanded by the king and demanded that they be immediately restored. The fortress-like buildings lived dark and cold, dull. Narrow, so hundreds of years later Norman nobles are more willing to live in a comfortable and luxurious outer city. Of course, Wangdu’s “fortress” mansion is still carefully preserved by them, although they do not have to rely on this to guarantee The safety of yourself and your family, but these buildings surrounding the palace symbolize unshakable glory and status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven towers surrounding the palace, and the flags and coats of the seven towers have almost never been changed. One of the flags is a standing gray. Bear, the background is green and silver, it belongs to the Don Cree family. This family is married to the royal family. Their daughters have been married to the king, and the daughter of the king has also married their sons. They and their heirs are deeply influenced by the king. Trust - and the former owner of Thunder Castle, the Marquis of Morton Don Clay, is the cousin of the current king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mordon. The Marquis of Don Clay gave his army and the rule of Thunder Castle to a humble knight before his death - it is said that His Majesty the King This talked to him alone - a whole afternoon, but in the end the king actually agreed to his request, which made everyone horrified. Although the Normans of the Highlands ruled that the Normans followed the sacred tradition of the millennium, "the will of the deceased as the last authority", and forced the sons and tribes of the Marquis of Morton Don Cray to obey this crazy legacy. Life, but many people still think that the Marquis of Morton Don Clay did this because the young knight named Bywin was his illegitimate child. People agreed that he loved Bydwin’s mother. Will relentlessly abandon his only marriage and child, and instead send this inferior who is mixed with inferior blood to the position he had not been able to climb for the rest of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is because poor Dylan is his only legitimate child, and the Duke of John has a slight smile. Dylan's lineage is pure. The problem is that his blood from his father's side has always been questioned. The Marquis of Morton Don Clay has been stationed in Thunder Fortress for a long time, and his wife, the sister of the king, the princess of Norman Norman has never left the king, and as a husband and wife, they only got together twice, once when they got married. It took 12 days, and the second Marquis rushed to the king's call, only stayed in the king for three days, and six months later, Dylan Don Clay was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men of the Don Cree family are almost all gray hair and all kinds of gray - silver gray, blue gray, grayish yellow eyes, but Dylan has inherited the members of the royal family. The red hair, and a pair of green eyes that his mother did not have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People quickly shifted their sights to Wang Du, the only person with green eyes at that time, who was favored by the princess, Fu Kai. This person is similar in age to the Marquis of Morton, but more passionate than the owner of Thunder Castle. The relationship between him and the princess may not be known, but for the members of the royal family and the people around them, this is only a A tacit little secret. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people speculate that Morton. Don Cray will challenge Fukai, using his wide sword that has smashed the heads of many orcs to make this hand a good force. The lover cuts two, or tries to make the "married child" who has stigmatized him disappear silently - he can't kill the princess, but a child, even in the royal family, because of a cold or a fall There are also a handful of children who have died in the horse. But the Marquis of Don Clay disappointed them. He did nothing. The calm and cowardly humiliation of a knight’s reputation, he returned to Thunderbolt and was stationed there to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also for this reason that the King cannot refuse his request, a small revenge made by an upright Tyre Knight at the last moment, he let An illegitimate child became a friend of the king, gave him a surname, gave him a title, and made him the master of Thunderbolt. Ha, when he first came to the kingdom, with the gray hair unique to the Don Clay family. Gray eyes, standing in front of the king and the court, the latter's expression is really amused by the Duke of John, especially Fukai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder sister of the Duke of John was furious after hearing the news. If it was not the strictness of the king, she might order her guard to go to Bedwin. However, as far as the Duke of John is concerned, her anger was only damaged by her dignity and possessiveness. A husband who only spent 15 days with her was probably not as good as her puppy under her skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one who was hurt by the old-fashioned Tyre Knight was the one sitting in front of him, Dylan Don Clay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether that person feels stinging when he sees Dylan Don Clay - he looks like a miniature treasure house, the dragon will be The coveted one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a ring on each of his fingers, a large gold bracelet on his wrist, a gold chain amulet jewels on his chest, cuffs, neckline Embellished with pins, the ears hidden in the hot red silky hair are earrings, the belt is set with precious stones and Mithril, and a short sword with a shank is inserted obliquely. His buttons and tips are pure gold. He also wears a headdress - although he is the son of the princess, he has the right to do so, but the gods bless, even the king will not always hold a pure amount of ten pounds, still The top is set with rubies and a rock that shines like the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess’s son has only been wrapped in fine linen, satin and flawless fur since birth, and now. Because the entire room has been warmed by the pyroxene, the son of the Marquis of Don Clay has pulled off his cloak and coat, and they are directly thrown to a single-person small writing desk that has been overwhelmed, and the ink pollution is overturned. Parchment, white suede, black flying rat skin and bright red velvet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in front of the fireplace, the fire shone on his deep red tight-fitting robe, the surface of the fabric was smooth and delicate, and the gold thread was coiled with small pearls and obsidian. Royal coat of arms - a pair of huge white bears occupies each other on the side of his chest. The larger pearls are used as buttons for the robes, not six but sixty, which makes the whole robes more For luxury and close-fitting, each pearl has a gold semi-circular holder and draws a pattern on it with Mithril powder. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, Dylan Donkre is one of the main material planes, and it can make these jewels set off against themselves rather than jewels. The person who lost color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His appearance even surpassed the Princess Norman of Highland Norman, no, not his mother, but his mother’s niece, the current king only The blood is really a pity, and the Duke of John thought that if Leona had such a delicate face, even if it was a little dangerous, he would be willing to marry her, which would make the whole thing easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the Duke of John thought again, his brother would not agree, and he would not agree to marry her to his daughter. Her uncle, and he has become more and more whimsical in recent years, the owner of the White Tower and the hills gave him some enlightenment. The King is working hard to convince the nobles and elders that they can support him to change the tradition of Norman in the Highlands. And the law, right point, only inheritance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants his daughter, Princess Leona to inherit his throne, not his brother, Duke of John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp cold wind passes through the tiny gap between the tapestry and the window hole, bringing fresh air and deep chill. The Duke of John couldn’t help but tremble a little. He walked over and repositioned the heavy tapestry. The tapestry had adult male arms that were so long, wide, depicting the imaginary, Gaudino. The scene of Man’s first king when he ascended the throne, the king sat in a chair, with a crown, a robes, and a scepter, standing next to the heads of the seven families, each with a surname on their heads, below It is the bloodline of the Norman royal family in the Highlands. To this day, they have had twenty-four kings, and the Duke of John should have become the twenty-fifth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingers are on the edge of the tapestry. The tower of the Don Cree family is the tallest of the seven towers. From the top to the bottom, you can see most of the kings and In the outer city, the palace is like a head defended by a crown. Only the middle of the night is bright, and the rest is dark and dark; the outer city is not, the nobles and wealthy businessmen live there. In some celebration days, it can even be clear all night - even if it does not belong to any god, it is still shining like the lake where the stars are gathered, and the temples of many gods are there. After all, the temple and the sanctuary are in the right direction. There are strict requirements for materials and specifications. It is difficult to find a suitable position in the narrow and rigid kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most conspicuous one is the Temple of Fro, the men with gold coins and jewels who come to worship the servants, the Duke of John has The period is their frequent visitor, but now he has rarely stepped in there, although the servant who can get Fro's favor is rarely aging and sick like ordinary people, but he does not want to be like a few years. The sun and the earth are facing the same woman - a new Fro priest came here from Baita more than a month ago, but she was thrown into prison by the main sacrifice of the Temple of Fro before she could do something in the future. If it weren't for the Duke of John, she would be killed by a prisoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of John happily enjoyed her wonderful tongue and body, and then he called the Baroness, his mistress, to make this tempting little The ewes handed it to her, hoping she could come in handy in his plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fro priest with an ominous name did indeed use his unexpected use. She did not care about approaching a vulgar peasant woman, welcoming her and praising her. Occasionally, he bowed his knees, which was not considered by the Duke of John before. Baldwin’s wife was not welcomed by the ladies of the kingdom. This is normal. After all, their illegitimate children are still working in the farm, and He is also the husband of the princess, the son of Marquis of Don Clay; but what he did not expect was that she was also disgusted by the so-called "Mrs." and he curiously asked the Baroness that the answer was that they had a loyalty to her. The wealthy husband, and not satisfied, the baroness frankly said that if she also has such a husband, she will be grateful to stay at home to give him a child to fight, rather than endless lament and day-to-night complain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no plum, the baroness will have to endure his disgust to perfuse the woman. Fortunately, now she only needs to appear at a critical moment. The plan is going smoothly, but it is a bit expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many devil fingers did you take, Dylan?" The Duke of John put down the tapestry and seemed to ask casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two ounces." The respondent replied scornfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is fifty-six grams, 50,000 gold coins," said the Duke of John. "More importantly, you are still a caster. As far as I know, The casters have always been fascinated by the devil's fingers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because they lack this," Dylan said. "And I don't."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because your chamber of commerce is like a river bringing water to bring you gold coins." The Duke of John mentioned two goblets of Ginza agate: "Honey, winter Wine, or rotted wine?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Winter wine.” Dylan said that he took the cup, took out the small bottle that he carried with him, and poured it inside. Point winter honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of John poured himself a cup of rotted wine, this color purple blue is like a coveted liqueur. Only Thunderbolt has produced: "Where are you? Is there a rotted wine?” he asked, admiring the color of the cup. The blue-violet wine, agate, and the fire were stacked together to form a rather quirky color, which made the Duke of John think of being dug. The liver that comes out, if you throw it hot in the snow, the snow will turn red, and it will be stiff, brittle, and then solidify into the color he sees now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot." Dylan toasted the Duke: "King our Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grace our majesty," said the Duke of John. Then he laughed like he heard his clown say a joke that was no more ridiculous and laughter. He laughed so badly that he coughed fiercely. I took a sip of wine and wanted to stop it, but it turned out to be counterproductive. He coughed even more, he had a fever in his throat, and he tasted sweetness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about your medicine?" Dylan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of John shook his head, and Dylan stood up and took out a few black pills of small finger size from his amulet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will be better after eating it." Dylan said that the Duke of John hesitated for a while, picking a smaller one from it and swallowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect was remarkable, almost swallowed, the Duke of John stopped coughing, and the lungs were no longer so hot and burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about those red robes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't like red robes?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that they took the baby's brain to make medicine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has nothing to do with us. Said Dylan. "That's not our baby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it always reminds me of the orc," said the Duke of John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think is the difference between us and the orc, Your Highness?" Dylan said: "It’s just a difference in the way you eat."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t say that is so bad," the Duke of John took out a silk scarf and wiped his mouth: "You are just doing business now - no interest in the enemy. This year. How is the business, my dear nephew?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good," Dylan said: "The new medicine of the red robe is regarded as the gift of the orc god, hope The great orc god does not care that I took away some of the gold and gems that I should have dedicated to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, this great god loves the battle more Killing and fresh flesh and blood," the Duke of John lowered his voice: "How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough for you to equip a team of five hundred people - spears , wide swords, armor, horses, servants," Dylan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of John showed a sweet smile, or could overcome the wine in his cup: "I can't love you anymore, Dylan, my nephew "There is no doubt that you have inherited the advantages of your parents, the beauty of my sister and the talent of Fukai."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father is Morton Don Clay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
