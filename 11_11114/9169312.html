			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are confusing spokespersons, bringing chaos, expanding chaos, and creating more chaos in chaos<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body that collapsed on the earth elemental creatures leaped over the wall, if it was just a fear dragon, or any kind of service that people were familiar with and prepared for, The resisters may not be so helpless - they find themselves fighting against so many enemies of the breed, they must be alert to the thieves' daggers, and beware of the orc's minions, half-giants, or giant stone hammers. At any time, it may fall from a height. In contrast, the spurs and scorpions of the goblins and gnomes are always ready to take their lives. The inexperienced casters don’t even know what kind of spells to choose, humans, orcs and The giants, as well as the goblin and the gnomes, are different in resistance, and those creatures with short stature run around the legs of everyone, and people are constantly falling, blood is behind their knees or more important. Place flowing out<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s sweat ran from his forehead and back, his hair slid wet against the scalp, he waved his arm, and one was cut off by the goblin The wizard was slammed to one side, so it was free from being broken by the orc's flail, but it also made him and the giant's toes have a warm kiss. Fortunately, although the time was short, it also allowed the mage to tear. On the reel, with a flash of light, he flew up, and the gnome's arrow rushed over, and a slender arrow that was short of the adult's palm hit him.Perhaps the relationship between the god of destiny is smiling at him. Among the two arrows that have tempered the poison and the anesthetic, he encountered the latter. The wizard fell after slanting for a while, falling. On the inside of the city wall - the fat warlock has been paying attention to him. After seeing the two priests running over to catch him, he finally breathed a sigh of relief. His eyes didn't mean to sweep over the right side. There were several soldiers lying there. It looks like a blood-soaked skin. In fact, he hesitated when he cast this spell - he can save these people, but in an undisclosed meeting, everyone's value has been evaluated, cast , knights, soldiers are very clear about what kind of people will be included in the ranks of priority rescue<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor and the members are in the ranks, but their position is not the top, the top is the pastor, then the warlock and the mage, pick up It was the knight who served as the commanding position, and then the governor and the lawmakers. This was a bit out of the fat warlock's expectation, but he immediately understood that those who did not want to share with the city-state had long since disappeared. As he originally intended, other people are left for the city-state. They have the consciousness of sacrificing dignity and life. Of course, they will not foolishly put themselves before the caster and the knight. They are the most city-states. Sturdy and important walls<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rune on the fat warlock flashed, but for a moment, he paid the price for his carelessness, and a heavy stone hammer hit it. On his side, he flew out, didn't use his own strength, and ran into a piece of defective stone brick. It was burnt by the flame, it was burnt and hot, and the pain came from the back of the fat warlock. Then While he was struggling to make a gesture, an obese goblin (probably the leader of the goblins, the only strongest guy in the goblin to get the most food) jumped onto him, and the jump broke. The ribs of the fat warlock, the ribs pierced the lungs, and his lips opened and there was a violent cough. His throat was like a magma flowing through it, and the pink foam overflowed from his nostrils and mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big hand lifted the goblin, it protested in the air, the protest disappeared quickly, and the giant opened his mouth, just like a human being carrying a Like a bunch of grapes, he pinches the head of the goblin, bites off his left foot, then bites off his right foot, followed by the left and right hands, followed by the part below the waist, the part above the waist, and the head, the goblin Viscera and blood fall on the face and body of the fat warlockThat feeling is hard to describe, and it is precisely because of this, although the caster is constantly running around the orcs and humans, or more goblins, no one dares to compete with the giants for this stinking and bloody prey.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the giant bent down again, the fat warlock thought he would die, he smelled the smell in the giant's mouth, and the smell was even worse than the visceral viscera. The pain from the fat warlock's head is much stronger than the chest - he grabs his own pendant, there is a powerful magic, but he has no strength to throw it away, so the result is the giant and he will Will step into the mourning wasteland at the same timeThere is nothing wrong with this. He thinks that although the goblin is obese, he has at least four or five times that of the goblin. That is to say, the meal time of the giant has to be lengthened, and it is not necessary to endure such a long torture. Not bad<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes, the blood of the goblin mixed with sweat flowing into his eyes, time seemed to slow down, he stared at the giant, then he saw The giant showed a strange look. The huge monster paused and looked up, as if he had to turn around to look at the rear, but what he could do seems to be the only way. The giant maintained the previous bend and knees. Slowly pouring down - his body covered the sky, and finally he dumped on the wall, his shoulders on the cornice, and his chest and the mouth formed a small triangular space, the fat warlock gasped Eyes sour<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat warlock nodded. If he was in a safe and comfortable place, he would yell at him and ask people to carry him out with a bed, but now he can only take out a bottle of therapeutic potion and drink it. Hold the chest - the sorcerer's innate talent allows him to move small objects invisible, and the things he does are simple, just let the ribs that pierce the lungs move toward less The important part is that it will not cause more damage when walking and running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the handling, he climbed out of the stinking shelter with his hands and feet. In a short time, a group of orcs, goblins or It’s the low wall made up of the corpses of the hybrids. “We should go!” the follower of Ilmot shouted, when the fat warlock discovered that he had a companion who was standing on the back of the giant, from He pulled his short sword on his back neck: "The bones are pinched."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't want it," his companion said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what the mentor gave me!" The man said that he could not match the three enemies with a dexterous gesture that could not be compared with a butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe that your tutor would like to see you," his companion shouted: "Not a short sword!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am coming, I am coming," said the fat warlock, "a little spell." He bent his finger, and the short sword jumped up and hit it. In the hands of its owner, he was spinning like a dance on the ground. The silvery blade left a dazzling aperture in the dark vision of the fat warlock, and outside the aperture, it was the enemy that fell in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the followers of Ilmot jumped down, the hood flew up, and the fat warlock clearly saw a gray tear under his eyes. Tattoos, which are only available to high-ranking priests in Irmot,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone might wonder why a pastor can be like a knight or an assassin The land has such excellent martial arts, but if it is Ilmot, there is nothing strange. Although this god is known for being gentle and tolerant, he has a cold and cruelty comparable to that of the wicked. The priests of Ilmot have the so-called "ten-day break", in which they can no longer pray to Ilmot, which is said to prevent the priests from generating convictions during prolonged penance. Burnout, but people still recognize another idea, that is, during these ten days, the priests of Ilmot can do things that are not recognized by Irmot, such as assassinating a tyrant, not Try to influence and persuade him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests who are enemies of Ilmot are ridiculed for this practice, which is extremely hypocritical and shameless, but the priests of Ilmot It doesn't seem to care. If they are smashed and ridiculed, they can't be the followers of Ilmot. You know, even Fro has a temple of alabaster, and the temple of Ilmot is in Many times, it is just an ordinary dwelling, and the walls are covered with dirt and grass clippings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two priests of Ilmot went to the end and said that they were flying with a fat warlock. "We are..." The fat warlock is panting. Asked, he noticed fewer and fewer enemies around him, and more and more people are running with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s worthy of praise.” Kelmen said that the wind in the sky will smash the words, but he doesn’t seem to care. Waste a spell: "We might do it from the beginning, and the dregs should let the dregs deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of them may be the most in this battle. Nothing is done, the temporary leader of the Dragon Thorn is bored and thinks that their mission is to serve as a young red dragon as an eye, an ear and a shield, and perhaps a spear or something, but now human beings are busy dealing with those goblins, in enemies and vassals. When they were all mixed together, even the flames of the Red Dragon did not come into use. He looked at one end of the wall and looked at the other end. In their view, there were no more than three towering towers. One of them has been ruined by the Red Dragon.) Is there a huge car used to hunt the Red Dragon?He was a little bit tempted, but with a glance at his front paws, crouching on top of their heads, a red dragon on a solitary shale, he carefully kept his tongue on his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his gaze to the battlefield. Even if the body of the earth elemental creature collapsed, it still looks like a narrow mountain, and it is humanity that breaks the mountain. The wall of the city, its special zigzag shape allows the two sides to protrude enough to accommodate enough humans to stand on the monsters that are on the opposite side of the archery. If the number of vassals has been continuously expanded for fifty years, they may be able to Continue to fantasize, for example, they can defeat the Grenada people - but too much, the Red Dragon has almost no picking of the vassal army, anyway, they only need very low cost, red dragons and descendants have enough The deterrence guarantees that they will not riot, and the innumerable human slaves will be able to get enough food and fixed pastimes. As for the place, Greinada is desert and lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
