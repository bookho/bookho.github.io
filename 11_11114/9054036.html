When the rocket falls on the dry sail, it will immediately burn up quickly. Even if the water for the firefighting is ready for a while, it will not be extinguished. Now they fall to On the tent, the tent immediately burned like a sail, and the tent collapsed. The flame of the breath provided light for the pirates to observe the surroundings. As Rui Tete said, there was no one in the tent. The novel<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are in the cave." A pirate whispered, he looked at the sea, not far from there are a few small and ominous shadows everywhere. Swim, this is a few boats put down from the "Golden Lady" and "Sea Devil", because the Master's spells allow them to breathe in the water, so they must also be alert to the prey to escape from the water, the pirates on board They are all patient and sharp-eyed people. They hold the steel bow in their hands. In addition to the burning torches, there are also fluorspar from the hands of the two captains. The torch can only illuminate the sea, but the fluorite light It is penetrating. It has been able to shine a few feet deep under the water. The water around the island of Longhuo is so clear and clean, even the meat thorns on the sea worms that escaped from the emperor and the garbanzos. The scales can be seen clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tent is empty, but there are still some furniture and blankets in it, but it is not a long-lasting fuel. The flame is quickly reduced. The special bullets move the fingers, let the breeze blow away the smoke, and the caves that their guides call the black snails are not deep. They can even see the white robes flashing in the gap. The only regret is that the orientation of the caves is partial. North, so most of the starlight and moonlight are blocked, and the female warlock in the red robe makes a gesture, this is just a small spell. It just makes the cave shine inside - but she and the pirates only see the flash of the moment, just like the remnant of the light after suddenly closing the eyes, even if it is a short elf, it may not be obvious. . Ruiyite licked his lips. She thought that what she had to face was nothing more than a young wizard who was young and freed from her discipleship. But she suddenly found out that this guy was not as good as she thought, and she put her hand on her pocket. She regretted not insisting on the original idea - she originally asked the sea demon to provide part of the cost so that she could To hire a mage, if she hired from the "fine net", she can still break the fold, but the clever Drake made her finally dispel the idea. After all, "fine mesh" is not her, although she is one of the few masters on the spire of the "fine mesh", but Austal's prestige in the red robe is much higher than her, If the mage knows that what he is doing may anger Nestal, he will not hesitate to reject her invitation and even sell her to Austal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if she can find an ignorant and daring guy to help her with this, the latter will definitely ask for a share in this matter, which is definitely not what Ruiyi wants to see. This information also cost a lot of people and costs, and it can be imagined. Will be facing Ostal, it will not be others, it will only be her - she is exhausted and risky. For herself, not for anyone else, she is not a white robe of Rosada or Ilmot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, when Ruiyite discovers that her selfishness will cause a situation that is very unfavorable to her, she will still be angry with others - she knows Dray Why didn’t he want the Haimo to hire a mage? He always remembered the shame that the sea magic had given him. Although he didn’t say anything to Ruiyite, he definitely had some plans in the process of fighting a spellcaster. A mortal, even with half the orc's blood. Isn't it a normal thing to die? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I usually put a smile on his care, but now she only feels angry and regrets - the mage in the cave does not say anything else . In controlling the magic and estimating the opponent's spells, it is obviously beyond the scope. Although Ruiyi has only thrown out a small trick that the apprentice can complete, the opponent not only expected to cast a corresponding anti-soul, her spell. Only for a moment, fortunately, there is still such a moment, if her spells are so silently annihilated, Ruiyite will immediately escape, because it only shows that the other party is much stronger than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——That, the soul of the outside world is curious to ask, is it a warlock? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The warlock, also the pastor, the lich said gloomyly, the part of the blood that belongs to the dragon is dangerously moving, and there are still a few special days. Days, but the woman wearing a deep red silk gown is obviously a warlock who inherits the dragon's blood. Although it is very thin - humans or humanoids with dragon blood can sense each other by the call of blood. However, this kind of induction is very slight. It can only be clearly sensed when it is close, and there are more powerful descendants who will use this call to find temporary servants or capture their blood relatives. The lich is Before I was taken away by the instructor, because I had suffered a lot of losses, I almost died a few times, so I was very sensitive to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the little devil Asmodeos appeared, the former undead also felt, and the other side was much stronger than him, but fortunately the warlock seemed I care more about the dragon grammar book that is stored in his pocket. In addition, I am grateful to the god of the god of dementia. Although his blood will affect him, it is not so clear to others. At least, his enemies are not aware, otherwise he will not just throw a spell, watching them fall into the Starlight River, even if it is three-year-old children know that people with dragons and blood will not be so It is easy to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the female warlock who has a Mithril hammer hanging around her waist does not seem to find that she is fighting a blood relative, but for the descendants of the dragon, the blood relationship does not make sense, except for the difficulty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Can a warlock be a pastor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The Master can also be a priest, the Warlock can of course, or the Warlock is more likely to become a priest than the Master. In any case, the Warlock’s blood is not from The devils and demons are from the dragons, and they are willing to serve some gods, unlike some wizards who are simply unbelievers or false believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this...the lich turned this message down to the depths of the sea, and the gods’ decisions were not all biased towards outsiders. In terms of concealment and misinformation, the former undead is far more than his cohabitation. He can read each other's memories and thoughts as if he were looking at an open book. But as long as he is willing, his thoughts and knowledge will not be revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up the sand wall. He instructed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world immediately follows the words of the Lich. The light of the spell passes over the sand that is submerged by the sea. The mixture of sand and water is like soft. The silk satin was caught by the invisible hand and spread out in the air, and everyone behind it was closely covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second wave of pirates shot just at this moment, for this mission, both the sea demon and Drake have a big blood, all the arrows The vector is a triangular arrow of stainless steel. The arrowhead of the arrow is silver-crowned, and the tail feather is taken from the middle feather of the black eagle. You know, since the elves have cut off the connection with the white tower, everything produced by the silver-crowned jungle has become a tight-knit item, the price Naturally, it changed three times a day. Drake could get so much thanks to his mother, Aval, who opened her private library and let her only son pick him up. Something, but she also affirmed. These are all repayable, if Drake can catch the prey he wants, if not. With his new ship, he will only be able to work for the rulers of the Azores in the next 20 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of arrow is enough to shoot through a single layer of leather, but like all ordinary arrows, it encounters a soft and sticky sand like silt The water mixture becomes a real useless thing. To be honest, the sand wall that the black hair's caster throws the spell is not solid. If it is replaced by a heavy-loaded knight wearing a helmet armor, what might it do? When they are not up, they are knocked open, but for the arrows. It is harder to break than the tough leather, and the sand is scattered. Water is fragile, but when they are together, they can consume the kinetic energy of the arrow. Some of the pirates' arrows actually passed through the sand wall, but their energy was exhausted when they penetrated the sand wall, so they only flew a few steps and landed, even the caster's toes could not be touched. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates paused, and the caster was very deterrent. After that, the two orc lovers of the Sea Devil came in handy. They slammed a huge axe and hammer and rushed over. The sand wall did not. They can form obstacles for them, and they are easily torn into pieces. The pirates suddenly saw their prey. The swords of the warriors and the bows of the elves are shining in the dark, but they only have six people, among them. There are two women, the greed in the hearts of these evil people violently overwhelmed the jealousy and fear of the caster. They followed the footsteps of the two orcs and even worried that the orcs would preempt them. The ones who won the highest amount of rewards, or the women, or their hammers and axes, hit the prey to the unrecognizable, especially the Drake crew, who were used to seeing a person and began to evaluate, no matter what At the time, a beautiful slave is worth more than a defective waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several pirates raised their bows, their targets were casters and thieves, because the two are the most threatening, but the elves have lifted The bow, saw them - the bard once said that even if an elf binds a hand and blinds his eyes, you have to think about the memory of archery. They not only have hundreds of years of training. With experience, and the god of life, Angris, gave them the gift of the elves at the beginning of the creation of the elves, which humans can never reach - so, as we expected, the hunter became a prey first, and all dared to be in the elves. The pirates who raised their bows in front of them had a chic ornament at the throat and eyebrows. When they fell, the blood polluted the clear water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreek couldn’t help but squint at the corner of his eyes. His crew was re-recruited. During the period, he couldn’t help but get used to it. Now he can finally use it. But as far as the current situation is concerned, perhaps he has to recruit for the third time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caves of Heilongjiang are not that big and not deep enough, although Kreima’s command to Dada is to take the slaves to the depths. But they can only walk out of the hundreds of feet and encounter a hard and cold stone wall. Dada hides behind a rock and observes the situation ahead. Occasionally, the cave will be illuminated by the light that I don’t know where it comes from, he saw His new master, the black-haired caster, stood in the thunder and flames, and he was surrounded by only the elves Kerry Ben and Birdwin, and Leona Meme and the thief Gülen didn’t know where to go - they were away Yet? Dada was frightened and thinking - but he was not surprised. He knew that it was indeed the best time to start doing it. After a few months, his new owner might have his own soldier and he would Living in a safe fortress, unless an army is used, there is no way to shake his rule, like Beavis and his former brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
