			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——This time I should have sat at my desk and comfortably copy my scrolls. The undead who was once dead said sullenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s late at night, the clouds cover the Milky Way, the darkness covers the earth, Baldwin, Kerry Ben, Cremari and a few energetic young knights Wearing their tight robes, trousers and chain armor in a sweet potato field that smells rancid - the serf on the mainland has learned how to use livestock and human waste reasonably to ensure soil fertility. They bring fat, sweet potatoes, potatoes, wheat and a disgusting smell and touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why they don’t sleep peacefully in the warm fur, or sitting at the table and copying the scrolls – the lich seems to need a scroll to ensure his security. This is a blame for Kerry Ben, who told Bender Winkremar that they had no wild boar in their prey, and the enthusiastic owner immediately expressed his willingness to meet the guest's little wishes as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they can at least put this task tomorrow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich has tried to stop them, but Birdwin seems to think that in the middle of the night, slamming one or more wild boars in the stinky sweet potato is better than during the day. Leading a group of hounds to enclose the wild boar's lair is more in line with a knight's work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was honored to have an Elf Ranger, a Master, a Territory with a Territory, and a few knights who politely occupied a night at night. The serf's shack and sweet potato land, and prepared to fight a fierce battle of wild pork here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Because of your boring little hobbies, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world is silent for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Maybe I’m mistaken, the soul of the outside world says, but it’s not me who uses this body today – then eat it again at lunchtime Drink, enjoy a whole pot of stewed lamb chops with pepper and spices and a basket of salted bread, and at dinner...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-When you use the body I didn't give any advice on your good appetite. The Lich said, I was just thinking about the problem and didn't notice what I ate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- On the plate is a whole roast leg of lamb, fore legs, four pounds, the soul of the outside world reminds him, fat and yellowed leg of lamb, sprinkled with lemongrass, rosemary and paprika The fragrance of the fragrance is accompanied by a transparent oil that penetrates into the crispy epidermis. The fat under the skin seems to melt at any time. Each piece of meat is so delicate and firm, fresh and juicy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The wild boar is more alert than the argali. The undead who once said calmly said, how do you feel that I stand up and sing a song to greet it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien has closed his mouth, he has not been able to eat fresh lamb, and he does not want to lose wild boar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin chose this sweet potato for a reason. The wild boar around Thunderbolt has the wisdom of a human child. The owner of this sweet potato is just An alien exile serf, who is still strong but loves to drink, often falls asleep at night in the field. His sweet potato has been destroyed by wild boars and will continue to be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were shackled in the shacks covered by thriving shrubs and vines, and Baldwin also brought some bad wine from the city around the shack, he From the hiding in the shack, he imitated the serfs to fight loudly. Before that, he stopped the serfs from trying to clean the stalks of the sweet potato leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wild boar is a very memorable and suspicious creature," Birdwin said. "Slightly different, it will run away." Fortunately, the weather is cold enough at this time, they don’t have to endure the small mosquitoes that are screaming, but the numbness caused by the cold and cold winds of the land. People don't feel too good, just once the undead want to stop this stupid behavior - of course, not that he really will stand up and sing a song, but he can cough a few times, or get a small spell to go Kick the knight's ass and let them scream and start to jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild boar appeared before he wanted to make any kind of behavior that would make the soul of the alien world grieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a big guy with heavy armor – the wild boar likes to bathe in muddy water, then on hard rock, mounds and drooling The pine branches dry repeatedly rubbing their bodies until they are combined with their own bristles. They do this in the first place just to prevent themselves from being picked up by the sharp fangs of other male wild boars during the affair. They died, but when they found the human field and found a richer and more delicious food source, this approach made them well avoid the damage of iron plows, hoes and flails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there are fangs, the wild boar's fangs are more dangerous than the horns of the argali, they are completely two white knives with white light, able to pierce the steel armor under full force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild boar stops and goes, picking up the nose from time to time or lowering it to sniff the air, the land and sweet potatoes, the bright starlight with it and the ambush The distance has allowed them to see its green, small eyes, a scar from its eyes, splitting the flesh-colored nose - a wounded wild boar, Birdwin hopes that the scar is not human The wild boar that it has left and has been harmed by humans is more vigilant and violent. The worst thing is that he guessed it. The wild boar seems to smell something unusual. Going, just in the opposite direction of the trap they set, a young knight couldn't help but move the body, and the small squeaking sound of a dead branch made him and the wild boar jump at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin immediately cast a short shuttle dart and Kerry Ben shot his arrow, but faster than them was a lightning bolt, the dirt armor of the wild boar It worked, and although all three hits, only Kerry's arrow made it bleed - the arrow was in one of its eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t escape but rushed to humans and elves, the lich raised his hand, made a second and third lightning, and hit it accurately The nose of the wild boar, except for the eyes, it is probably only this place is not covered by mud, but the wild boar with seven hundred pounds is still crushed like a round boulder in the night, Kerry The second arrow of this ruined the only remaining eye - the fourth lightning from the lich was probably the last light it saw in his life, and it could only rely on the last memory to the lightning-emitting human Rushing away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich slowly swallowed but cast a small spell in time, and the effect of the spell made the bumpy sweet potato suddenly become a greasy Smoothing the runway, the poor wild boar slammed into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is a bit funny, but this can be slowly laughed later, and Bydwin pulled out the wide sword and gave it the final blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the wild boar infiltrates the small half of the sweet potato, its nose exudes the smell of barbecue, making everyone feel a little hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bydwin’s cockroach borrowed a sturdy, unmanned carriage that could lie down five adult men at the same time and couldn’t get it back completely. Baldwin and his knight cut open on the spot. Their prey, discarded the inedible fur and hooves, and gave a hind leg and the head of the wild boar to the son who loved to drink, which was the compensation for the sweet potato land, and finally transported the remaining meat and internal organs back to the city. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a coachman with a few coaches, one of whom is obviously isolated by others, he has a linen The hair, while the black mark on his face is particularly conspicuous against the pale skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, Kerry thought he saw Yadel, but he immediately found out that he didn’t, he sighed slightly, he hoped he was Dell, he has been worried about this simple young class, the result of being alone in the wilderness is only to feed the giant wolf or the orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty prisoner swayed out of the cave, this once The caves inhabited by countless big bats are a huge prison, and the people of Thunderbolt temporarily hold the prisoners sent by the kings here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All prisoners wear iron collars around their necks, with chains on the collars, calculated by hits, and every twelve people are fixed side by side in a whole On the wood, they either stand together, either sitting together or lying down together - it's hard, because there are so many people here, they are all naked, hungry - the people who care about them only give them very much With less food and a little water, some people can even bite the people around him when they can't stand it, drink the same kind of blood, and eat the same kind of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A caretaker walks around these dirty and evil people, applies herbs to the bitten, and gives them water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this he was almost bitten by a prisoner, his companion ran quickly and beat the prisoner with a whip until he passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are not worthy of you doing this," his companion said: "They are not humans, they are beasts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Their sin may not be my weight yet." The man said, picking up the white hair covering his cheeks, revealing the brand on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
