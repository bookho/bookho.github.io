			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord of the Spirit is a short, middle-aged man with a hunch and a frowning face. He is anxious to enter the room as soon as he enters the room. Lun. Donkley bowed. It stands to reason that he is an ear, and the young Don Kerley is also a count, he does not have to be so humbly, but Dylan is the son of the princess, if the new king fails to get a son, according to the highland Norman inheritance law (if not People want to change them.) Princess Principal and Princess Leona, both women, will be excluded from the ranks of successors. Then... the beautiful young people standing in front of him may be able to have bright red in his head. Send a crown with a pure gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Dylan Don Clay is still a caster, no one can marry a caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may still want to sing a little, say something moving compliments, and once again express his loyalty to the new king, but Dylan is not interested in this, he There are already enough listeners in the king: "Excuse me," he said bluntly: "Hello, we are very willing to listen to your story, as long as it is not today - we are following the orders of our Majesty, in order to capture the killing The king and the master's sinner come, day and night, and can't rest, so please put it away, I have already felt your enthusiasm, your manners and etiquette are impeccable, now, respected jazz, please tell me What is the status of your city's multi-spirit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, the man could not help but sigh, and the king has a fortress and a mansion. Unlike the great aristocracy, his territory is not barren or rich. Although there is no shortage of rich fields and prolific manors, the city is only a multi-spirit, even if it is just a small town, it can be said to be prosperous. Who knows how? Such unexpected calamity to befall its head yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, because it is a triumphal and a new king’s relationship, many keen businessmen are looking for opportunities in the king’s capital. There are a lot less, otherwise, his entire territory may be enshrined in the black robe of the god of death: "The gods are on." He raised his hands in sorrow. "This is what I never thought of." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz heard this bad news on the way back, the multilingual consul was dead, but he ordered the blockade of the multi-spirit before he died. The message was sent to the mosque in Ilmot - a priest of Ilmot was stopped at Doring, he was the first to detect the presence of the disease, and he immediately informed his chief pastor, and The chief pastor immediately sent more white robes, two of which were sent to warn the owners of the spirits - they were in contact with the priests who were sent to the Spirit. On the morning of the third day, the people who died of the disease by Dolly accounted for one-fifth of the total population and continued to grow. The priest of Ilmot told the jazz about this unfortunate fact. He was in all kinds. After hesitating, he had to sorrowfully announce the abandonment of the multi-spirit, and ordered his army and the knight to patrol the road leading to the multi-spirit, not allowing the multi-spirited people to come out, nor allowing others to enter the multi-spirit unless they It is a follower of Rosada, Ilmot or Cranco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, are the priests of Ilmot looking for a cure for this disease?" Dylan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So far. No." The jazz said with a grin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still have a living in Doral?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but not much The Jazz hesitated: "There is this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say." Dylan said that although his tone is already similar to reprimand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz glanced at them with a glance, he only heard a little bit about Deron Don Cray’s anecdote, his bloodline is already an open secret, this I don't have to say much, but the rumor that he ruled the monks of the Norman royal family in the Highlands was just a rumor, but now this is the most accurate confirmation. His gaze swept softly over the casters in black robes and red robes, especially the latter, who were different from the black robe mage. No matter which one, the red wide hood is pulled low, so low that people can only see their chin and neck, but the red color that is solidified makes everyone fearful – they are not masters. It is a warlock. There are inhuman, turbid blood, evil people who are in the same league as demons, demons and even dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the owner of the Spirit has got a glimpse of peace. Since Dylan Donkre has a warlock, he should not have a decision on himself. What is dissatisfied - the jazz feels that he is doing the right thing. It’s just a little cruel, for those who are stubborn and the ridiculous white robe... “I, I, in fact, no one will come out of the spirit – whether he is healthy or not — - Who knows that he is really healthy, except for those pastors... everyone," he said slyly: "But I can swear, I am a last resort... I can't let the disease spread out." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan is watching this man, the face that can almost be described with beauty is more male and female in places where the light is not bright enough, but as long as you can see him The eyes, you will never mistake his gender - the silence in the room makes the jazz legs soft, the lower abdomen tight - he is going to pee, when the young man who is only half his age finally shows him When he had a subtle smile, he almost softened on the soft, thick wool carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are doing very well, jazz." Dylan said: "It’s right, even the dead can’t leave the spirit.” He turned his head, one The mage came out under his gesture. "I remember we brought in enough runes and scrolls," Dylan said. "Double is not a big city. Can you use them to block the application of any transmission spells?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will try my best," said the wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyron nodded, and he knew that in the spellcaster's language, this answer was close to "yes" without restriction. "We will help you further," he continued to say to the Jazz: "Nothing can purify the disease more than the flames."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I am not I understand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think there is anything wrong with understanding," Dylan said with tolerance: "Everything from the Spirit will be burned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz has widened his eyes, he didn’t expect this, his intention is to wait, waiting for this terrible disease to kill everyone in the Dorothy, Instead of letting them walk around with a deadly invisible demon, by that time, the priest of Ilmot or Rosada would always think of ways to get rid of the disease, just as he had passed before. . He has conceived it. In the next few months, heavy snow and ice will cover the entire city. The disease will also be frozen, and slaves can enter the multi-spirit, clean every corner of the city, and wait until the spring day. The warm sun melts the ice and snow, and the dirty things will flow away with the snow, and he will get a brand new, clean new city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is thinking about it, he will suffer some losses. For example, the whole city may take several years to recover, but the wealthy businessmen and knights in the city, or ordinary craftsmen and craftsmen, they and their heirs are dead, and their legacy is not Will die, according to the law of the Norman Norman, who are the owners of copper coins, silver coins, gold coins, fields, manors, and mansions, in addition to the owner of the multi-spirit? Maybe one or two distant relatives will want to take a share of this huge wealth, but they must first figure out how much property their relatives have left behind. And pay a high estate tax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the Spirit is burned, he can’t get anything, and he will completely and completely lose a city – he can’t rebuild more Even if he takes out all his gold coins, it is not enough for a city wall. Without a city that gathers wealth, his situation will plummet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the Spirit is standing there, looking so stiff and stunned, he does not understand why the situation will develop to this point, just as he is crazy Searching for words in the abdomen pleads with Dylan Don Cray to change his mind. The closed door was knocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing outside the door was the leader of the soldier who was responsible for supervising the spirit. He gave a tribute to his master. "Please forgive," he said. "But I met an important thing. Dear Sir Alex, I I think you should know right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor jazz biting his lips to prevent himself from roaring: "That said!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A nobleman, like a nobleman, has defeated our soldiers... his horse is very fast and rude and rude..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Short!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He went to the Spirit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then go!" The sir couldn’t help but yell: "If he is willing to choose where to die, where is it going to die! Who can stop a person who is eager to die!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier’s leader was shocked and he groaned. It’s like apologizing and trying to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let him finish," Dylan said. "If there is no unusual place, he will not bother us."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz trembled awkwardly. He remembered that the person around him was not his wife or slave, not the "thing" that he could see as nothing. "That said... He waved his hand: "Tell it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the soldier gratefully bowed to Dylan, "I am very grateful, respected adult," He bowed to the jazz again. After all, this is his real master: "I didn't stop that person," he said. "But I saw his hair - red hair," said it here. He boldly placed his point of view on Dylan's long hair: "The same red hair as you, bright and dazzling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please give him a quiet room," Kerry Ben said. "He is a mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Priest’s pastor Nodded: "Of course," he said to Kremar. "But what about you?" He asked Kerry Ben, as long as someone with a little adventure would know that in a team, if the Master did not get a break. Opportunity, then no one else will, no one will be stupid enough to let a mage who has not yet had the opportunity to rest and remember spells to serve as a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My other friend needs to take care of it." Kerry Ben explained. "You can add a small bed next to his bed. I can sleep there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He is a patient." The priest of Ilmot disagreed: "No one knows if it will invade the body of the elf - my companion will take care of him." He paused: "And, we also need you to rest - the silver crown jungle of the Ranger Kerry, your name we often hear, you are praised, a great and powerful warrior. So, next, we It is very likely that you need your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our help?" asked the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a disease," said the priest of Ilmot. "We thought a lot of ways to find the source of the disease. Fortunately, it is not The outside world comes from the depths of the multi-spirit - a seemingly ordinary mansion, but as long as you get close to it, you can smell the evil atmosphere - they are so rich that they are called Countless monsters... We suspect there may be a demon or a devil inside, I have three brothers who have fallen there, and there are fair followers of Crawford who lost four brothers there - but we also I found some things about the disease, some books, and some potions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about finding the source?" Gülen asked: "Is it difficult?" Can we take the devil's neck and force it to hand over the potion for the disease?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not," the thief’s words were rude, but Il Mort's pastor did not think that he had explained it: "We have tried it. Therapeutic potions and treatments are useful. The problem is that if you can't completely dispel the evil spirits in your body at once, then it will multiply quickly—one of us and the respectable Kravo The chief pastor has seen similar situations. They are almost all manipulated by a demon or a demon. As long as they kill or expel the vicious creature, the patient can gradually improve with our help, instead of ... so quickly to mourn the wasteland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is," Gülen tragically said: "After dealing with a half-dragon and a half devil "We have to deal with a real demon again." He shook his head in disbelief: "This is not something that a new adventure team should do, the endless abyss is down, we should be gradual - from the goblin to the brother Brin, then to the Orcs...etc. Wait, the devil and the dragon should be placed at the end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
