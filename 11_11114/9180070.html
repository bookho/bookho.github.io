			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Bydwin returned to the kingdom, it was already near dusk, and the air was filled with a sweet smell of coke. He and his knights relaxed their reins and let the horses move slowly and leisurely. They walked past the people around them, some recognized the face of the new king, while others were because of the coat of arms of the grizzly bear. They threw flowers with water droplets on them, and there were also sweet fruits thrown by the tourists. When the young knights easily received them, the daring people would drink, which was previously considered to be a shame to the knights. Behavior, now very common in the kingdom, yes, even if these children are already knights, isn’t it the little bastard next door that these civilians are familiar with? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin in the forefront is no one to disturb, the person who recognizes him is from fear and respect, and some do not know his identity However, the person who can still recognize from the position that he is the leader of this team has always been cautious. Only a little girl throwing a pink rose flower hits the short hair of Birdwin's gray, and then falls from above. In his arms. She was taken aback and was obviously scared. Birdwin picked up the bunch of flowers and smiled at the child. Hey, if he could meet Leona at a young age, their first child would be so big. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty..." a knight whispered. He does not think that Baldwin will punish this child for this little thing, but as the king's knight, he has his own duties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin shook his head and slowly buckled the bouquet on his pin. "I will bring it back to my queen, they are beautiful." As he said this, he looked up and looked at their way forward, and the last sun stretched their shadows behind them, and the ones that welcomed Bedwin were the towers of the kingdom, the towers. The guards on the wall of the wall have seen them. The gates of the black iron rise slowly in the rolling sound, and the guards bow to their kings and the knights of the king. When they pass the martyrdom, they can smell the richness. The smell of fresh oil, as well as the smell of metal burning in flames. When the orcs attacked the kingdom, they did not retain the defensive measures in the martyrdom, or they took away some things that were considered valuable when they left, and the iron gates could be smelted to arm a tribe orc. They were It will never be abandoned, so the black iron gates they see now are re-created. This is a fatal blow for the empty Wang Du Neku, if not he and Liona The treasures recovered by the North Sea, the operation of the entire country may be stagnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, they have more black iron, and there is a steel above the black iron, the gnome McGee has proved his worth, His rune fragments are now clenched in the hands of Birdwin. If he can't go to Tyre's kingdom, the gray-haired king thinks, then he will build his own kingdom on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Baldwin thought about what would have scared countless people, when he stepped into the court, he saw the servant and the attendant. In the wide courtyard, a high bonfire was set up, as if a grand banquet was to be held here, but why not use the hall of Wang Ting? A Knight in Bedwin stopped a rushing kitchen maid, wearing a rugged leather coat to ensure that half of the squatting sheep would not smear blood on the precious black cotton jacket. "What happened?" "?" asked the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness is to entertain guests." The maid replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berwin was full of suspicion that he had gone to Leona’s room, and the room of the prince was opened from the ochre when the twilight was drooping. The light of the large piece of fluorite makes the whole room look like a white, she looks down seriously and flips through a book - no, it is a book-like book, "My love." Bird After warmly stepping forward and hurriedly and gently kissing, Leona looked down again. This time, Birdwin saw that it was a book, and the new king almost instinctively turned his head. Like poetry, law, history books, these things are still in the category of Bedwin's endurance. These things that should only be of concern to the Chancellor of the Treasury may be the only weakness of the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona couldn’t help but laugh, Birdwin pretended not to see, reached out and took Liona’s hands and took her from there. This terrible book was opened. "It’s time for rest," he said. "Is this something very urgent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona paused At a time, when Baldwin thought that this was not something he should know and tried to change the topic, his wife replied: "I see how many weapons and armor we have?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin stopped: "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————————————————— <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken, and her companion, looked at everything around me blankly<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what they did not expect. Before they became slaves to the orcs, they were once the people of the lord, but they must see the lord, for a civilian. That said, although it can't be said to be unique, it is very rare, and they don't want to see it, because many times, civilians see the lord in court, and the next moment a civilian will be tortured or hanged.Sometimes, when civilians want to enter into a marriage contract, they also need the consent of the lord. They will be brought before the lord and let the lord say yes.Some people may say that this is not a good thing? Of course, it is a good thing. I mean, marriage contract, but the tax that the civilians need to pay to the lord when they enter into the marriage contract is not. This kind of tax is generally a wok that can put the bride’s buttocks. The civilians often need to sell. All the animals in the house can ask the blacksmith to create such a black scorpion for himself, a heavy "tax"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also hunters and craftsmen, as well as tour operators, but they also serve the noble lords, and the hunters see more to assist the lord in hunting. The hunter was injured. After the death, not only did he not get a pension, but he was also robbed of the only savings and housing. The craftsman would also be cut off his fingers and expelled from the city because he could not hand over the works that the lord was satisfied with on time. Business, as they are unable to pay large taxes and enshrines, they have always been the object of the lord’s knights and management bullying – some people, even themselves, have become sold goods, they are the slaves of the orcs.They have a bitter hatred towards the orcs, but they don’t like the princes and nobles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken is their leader, they admire and convince her leader, but as the orcs return, they wander around the whistling plains, using the blood of the orcs When they came to sacrifice their loved ones and their loved ones, the situation became more and more difficult. When the ugly chicken proposed to ask for help from Lei Biaobao, most of them remained silent. They did not question because they respected the tall and ugly unfortunate woman.They watched the ugly chicken and walked into the Thunderbolt with a few people. When they thought that the head of the ugly chicken would be hung on the wall the next day, the ugly chicken came back, and she brought back one even herself. Believe message<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were allowed to see the new king and queen of Norman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the news from the Master, Leona made the decision decisively.This is the first time that a human being who is not an orc slave has appeared on the Wuthering Plain. When she was still very young, she vaguely considered a question—why humans must stop the orc in the dragon’s belly, why can’t humans Northward, although the Wuthering Plain cannot be cultivated, it also has a group of argali and horn deer, as well as gems, gold and pyroxene. Its fertility is not universal, but it is not that it is really worth fighting for if Is it possible to expel the orcs to farther places and allow humans to establish settlements and cities on the whistling plains? Isn't it better than the current situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also sneaked on the people’s thoughts. The king found that there is still a fallacy in human cognition. Why can’t humans be the masters of the orcs? Since the orcs can be killed, enslaved, and defeated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of ugly chicken may become the strongest evidence of the king, she does not know what the other party said is true or false, but if it is true, it means human Line of defense can be extended to further afieldMoreover, if the ugly chicken does pose a threat to the orcs, she is equally willing to meet her requirements - precisely because of this, when Birdwin entered the room, he saw that Leona was burying himself in the books. The reason, she needs to know how many weapons and armor Norman’s inner library can still produce, as well as magical equipment.The latter one is not required by the ugly chicken, but Leona is willing to give her - she is full of admiration for the ugly chicken after talking to the soldier who has no female characteristics on the outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest who gave the ugly chicken treatment told Leona that in order to facilitate the operation, the ugly chicken not only cut off his chest, but also used a rough and simple way. Pull out the unique organs of women, so that the orcs can follow the bloody smell of human beings - the body of the ugly chicken even smells like an orc, from bloody smell, to the smell of feces, and internal organs. The smell of the soil, this is not just a stench, it is also a threat. When the ugly chicken and her soldiers carefully step into the royal court, all the dogs in Wang Tingzhong are not fiercely screaming, just sandwiching Yellow water flowing from the tail<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken still has a soft and soft touch on the velvet blanket in the queen's room. The queen is a kind good person, she is even ugly. The chicken died with tears, but the ugly chicken didn’t think there was anything. She had lost all the good things in her life, supporting her to survive like the stones on the plains. It was hatred and sorrow. Like everyone behind her, they used to have different careers, different lives, different futures, but these were all stopped in a late night or dawn. Their hearts were as empty as their hands, and nothing could ever be Fill them up<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
