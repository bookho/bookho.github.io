In a matter of mention, the church in Ilmot re-dispensed a new priest, and the old priest was buried on the edge of the woods. People transplanted dozens of onions in his burial place. The onion blossomed for a few days, and the white flowers were small and dense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s late at night, the villagers of “recessed corners” are sleeping, the fat rolling three-line mouse curls up in the onion bushes, and the heart is licking and eating, the onion is One of the rodents' favorite foods, long-term consumption of onions and other plants with various odors gives them a strong pungent odor. Many predators will give up because they can't stand this disgusting taste. They have exceptions, such as a special rabbit bun, a gray-white stripe is the best protection color, but in a blink of an eye, the stupid three-line mouse fell into its claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of the onion made the rabbit sneeze a few sneezes, the three-lined mouse under the paw was still struggling, the fluffy hunter impatiently Going up and scratching a few claws, its prey was finally quiet. When it wanted to pick up the three-line mouse to leave here, a strange voice made it alertly straighten its ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that appears in the air is a light spot, the blue light spot, which spreads to the left and right, after reaching the width of an adult male arm. The lower extension is as high as a semi-adult male, and the last two lines are closed inward, forming a door covered with a transparent water film. A man in a black robe walks out from the inside, his feet are wonderfully stepless. On the ground, but suspended, he acts like a shadow or a ghost, even the dew on the tip of the grass is not touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rabbit cocked up the hair of the whole body, it opened its mouth and wanted to make a scream of guilt, but before that, a subtle magical force hit In it, it fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you let me kill it?" Anemos said regretfully, "My venom is still abundant." And the little devil never swears. To capture a life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to leave any trace here," Ostall said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil snorted and it knew it would be an extremely boring night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to obtain this clue, Austal took out all that he had obtained in the last winter. Human slaves, orc's pyroxene, gems and gold, and the bodies of orcs and humans, especially the orcs who took the potion, even quietly hid the body of a priest, which is dangerous. Not a broad-minded god. He knew from a demon that this spell book originally belonged to a lich, but the undead did not have the blood of a dragon. He had this book for research purposes only; then he Another eccentric necromancer learned that the lich had been purified by the noisy white robe, which made him feel anxious because he knew that the white robes would destroy or take away the lich’s collection. This spell book was shattered, or it was banned in the main sanctuary of Rosada or Tell. It would take a lot of effort to get it out, and the white robe’s obstruction Secondly, the problem is that other people who have also accepted this task must also peep into each other's traces and actions. Once he starts to move, he can't hide what he knows. In the end, it is very likely that he has worked hard. While it is tempting to take off the fruit, but was someone else swallow the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer did not tell him which white robes of the good gods purified the owner of the spell book, but Austal knew that the white robes had a bad Habit, that is, they have a bard-like hobby, and they record the details of each task in a ruthless manner, and put it in a room to be completely open for reading; Austal disguised as a common with magical instruments. The warrior, rummaging through the records of all the churches in the vicinity, finally found a related content in a thick burdock roll. They did not record that they had a pure gold cover and a gem-set spell book. There is no mention that it has been destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that the distance between the date on which the new record was recorded and the day he looked up was staggering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following content is changed after an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Elf Ranger and his companions successfully expelled the large and bloodthirsty bat group, the small village of "Concave Corner" has almost nothing to happen.
