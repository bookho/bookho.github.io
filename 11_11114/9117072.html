			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The island was attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very common, Longhuo Island has never been a peaceful and peaceful place. Although these attackers are still wearing pirates or thieves' cloaks, there are many soldiers and mages who are supported by the lords, but now the side island is not a fat fat but a hard bone. There are more than 20,000 Normans on the island. What makes Bedwin and Leona heart-wrenching is that some of them were bought by the Cavaliers and Master Gavin from the merchants. They were originally Norman. The serfs on the aristocratic land, but it is said that their owners are now starting to grow herbs instead of wheat. It is no longer necessary to care for the herbs. When Dylan’s business group came to discuss, they were of course very happy. The humble squatter can also exchange himself for the silver plate, the gold cup and the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worth mentioning that the most proud of Norman’s pharaohs was to maintain the tradition of the king’s Chongwu and refused to spread from the southern countries. The extravagant atmosphere. But these seem to have become a thing of the past with his death. New John is a man who loves art, beauty and power. Although he has to succumb to Norman women for the purity of his son, Norman’s women, Like Leona and Princess Chang An, they are like shrubs growing in rocks. Even if they are beautiful, they still can't get rid of the roughness and sharpness brought by the wind frost, but the girls from the warm areas are different, they are tender. It’s like a stream of flowers that bloom in the palm of your hand. It’s crystal clear, small and cute. It’s broken when you touch it. The new king takes them around and dresses them with gems and silk. They use it for Wang Ting. They are all horse-drawn carriages. The horses on the carriages are all purchased in the South. They are temperate and slender. They are best taken care of in the stables. They are almost left behind by the old kings. They will only be on the battlefield. The rough horses that ran on the run were all crowded away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new king is clearly very clear that, for his part, not a king who can be supported by the Normans, he has done a lot of things for it - for example Almost all the ministers were dismissed because he suspected that they did not support Pharaoh, that they supported Pharaoh’s daughter, or that they were privately connected with Princess Ann and Dylan. If he did not still need Dylan’s Masters for him. Guarding the Thunder Castle, and his caravan to bring him a box of gold coins, maybe Dylan can not help but die, or it may be because he does not feel that he can do it - he used to be eager to have this brother who belonged to him Position, but he really sat up and thought it was a nailed iron chair used to punish mortals, and everyone would be willing to add a burning torch below, he did not believe those who have the ability, only I am willing to hire some villains who are willing to swear to him, and when the villains become ministers, in order to get more favor, they are like mirrors to imitate the new king’s every move. Mu Norman King City turned into a funny circus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold coins poured out in their hands like water. In order to make up for the deficit in the box and the book, they urged the new king to rob the land of the ministers, forcibly recruiting their knights, engulfing their land, and constantly A person who is honest and loyal wants to rebel. What these bad guys didn’t think was that here is the highland Norman, not the weak southern countries. In the first few, the ministers who were lucky enough to be new to the new king lost everything and were cut off. . The owners of those towers immediately returned to their own territory with tacit agreement and quietly, instead of being as sinful as those who were, fearing and fearing, arrogantly and bribing them, punishing them with humiliation and anger. When the arrogant idiots, John, who knew exactly how much power he had, categorically refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are even powerful lords who Pharaoh can’t fully control. It’s a sword that can reverse his neck at any time. John knew that they were silent when Pharaoh died unexpectedly, just because they were dissatisfied with a woman who was on the throne, but not because he liked John over Leona, and said straightforwardly, if Leona is a man, then John may I have been safe to be a duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being awake by the stunned minds of those little gentle hands, John found himself making a mistake, but he is already King Norman. Moreover, remorse and apology are useless to those people, just as you can't use the dexterous tongue to compete with the claws of a big bear. He once again thought of Fukai, maybe he could give himself some help. In order to guard the Thunderbolt, Dylan took away many of the casters who should have been around him, so John had been cold for a while, thinking that he should have understood it now - when John was a duke, he Can be a friend, but now that John is the king of Norman, he should abide by the duty of a courtier. At least, he should make the necessary compensation for John for his behavior of being born out of wedlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John wants the army, a powerful army, all equipped with steel armor and weapons, even if Norman can’t recruit enough people in the Highlands, Or he can't believe the knights who once belonged to the lords. He wants to recruit mercenaries. As far as he knows, there are a few places where the number of mercenaries is staggering, and after several eliminations, the ones left are strong and refined. Good guy - but he doesn't want to use his own money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw Fukai, he must admit that he was shocked, Fukai became very thin, thin and moving, and when he was kneeling, the new king I thought I heard the sound of bones and bones colliding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
