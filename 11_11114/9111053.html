			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frost giants are almost going crazy, they beat the door, the curse keeps on, and the eldest son of the giant mountain bends down, intimidatingly put a finger On the shoulder of Austal, "Give us the door, the warlock." He said unceremoniously. I have already made up my mind in my heart. Once they have found the gold, they will kill the warlock with stones or ice. But before he even had more time to say more, a force hit his abdomen, and the pain swept through his body, as if he was bitten by a winter wolf when he was very young - Frost Giant Roared in horror and pulled back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal doesn’t think that the priest who is better at dancing than casting a spell can help himself, what he did to the eldest son of Jushan The Frost Giants became calmer because of the wealth that seemed to be at their fingertips. They retreated to the sides of the gate, leaving a large place for the Red Warlock, and the Red Warlock went to the gate. There are still twenty feet, grab some powder from the robe and start cursing. The Frost Giants stared at him curiously. The powder in his hand was like the burning charcoal fire. It did not know that it was the powder of the red dragon scales, but this did not hinder them. Submissive to the power of the warlock - Austal shakes his shoulders, the powders burn his hands, seeping into his skin, causing tingling, they flow along the blood to the heart, where they condense into fiery Crystallized, the warlock's lungs swelled fiercely, his throat twitching and burning like the saliva of a poisonous snake, but he insisted on accurately emitting the last syllable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock silenced about a heartbeat time, when the Frost Giants thought his spell failed and was ready to roll his lips, Austal’s double The lips open and the flame slams from his throat violently on the cold, hard threshold. Ordinary mages can only produce a dark red flame when casting this spell, and can only hold about a hundred times, while a warlock with a dragon's blood can produce a golden or even white flame. Even steel can melt, and ice can't resist it, and Austal's spit continues for a full hundred and fifty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter wolves around the Frost Giants mourn constantly, and their owners raise their arms to block their eyes, avoiding the heat and light of the flames, the priest is the first The one who retired, compared with other frost giants, he had the most fur and the richest, and he wore a crown decorated with many silks and feathers. He didn’t know what it was called, but he could I felt that his original plan was shrinking as quickly as the most beautiful long tail feather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the warlock's spells ended, the air still had a trace of warmth that made the frost giants uncomfortable, but to their delight, the transparent and sturdy threshold was melted out of a large hole, and the water ran down from the hole and was extremely The cold solidified, like a long blanket with tassels in front of the door. A Frost Giant walked up cautiously, grabbed the smooth edge with his two hands, first explored a head, then the shoulders, legs and arms, and when he found himself standing in the hall, he grinned. It’s up. After discovering that the companion of the first action did not die or was injured, the remaining Frost Giants also clashed to climb in. The two Frost Giants were blocked by a small hole for them, and no one would let anyone. The eldest son of Jushan strode up and grabbed the two fat necks and pulled up the two frost giants who had obviously forgotten the identity class. He threw them on the ground and then gave them a fist. Or because the priests screamed, after all, they lost a few frost giants and ogres when they landed on the island. When they entered the kingdom, the ogres were sent to entangle those even if they were beaten. Broken can also stand up and wield the spear guards of the spears again and again, they also lost a winter wolf before - no one knows when the gnome was mixed with poison in the flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have not been able to withstand the extra losses, don’t forget that in addition to humans and elves, they have another enemy to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest son of Jushan climbed into the hole, and no one dared you to fight for it this time. After standing straight, the first thing the new owner of the tribe did was to beat the Frost Giant who dared to enter the hall before him, but did not break his hands and feet, and did not dig his eyes, this can stay Do it later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves have escaped, leaving only the empty hall, there are hundreds of square columns standing in the hall, the top of the column and the pedestal are coiled around the dragon. The light shines from the translucent dome, and the ground without a gap is as bright and bright as the frozen lake, like a huge pale emerald – not the kind that Frost Giants want – “Gold?” The eldest son of Jushan snarled in anger: "What about gold? You said there is gold here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly don't worry...Slightly, don't, I "Friends," the red robe warrior still said softly in his tone of good habits and habits: "Silver Dragon..." He paused. He originally wanted to say that the dragon would not put gold on everyone. The place, but the Frost Giants, they decorate themselves with gold, so he changed his statement in time: "The Silver Dragon is extremely cautious," he said. "After she has accumulated enough wealth, she will dig a cave. , hide them, it might be a deep cave & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp "<br <br /> & nbsp />;"There is no cave here." The eldest son of Jushan said, and then the other frost giants began to hit the ground with a hammer and an axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will take us to the cave," the priest said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt," Ostall said: "This is my wish." He stretched out his fingers, the invisible little devil appeared, double The headed snake, Amonis, lazily swayed his tail. Of course, he would not follow the idiots himself, and then let Asmodeos give his hosts a diligence. "Let us lead the way," Austal said. "Amonis, my little devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This special title makes Amoni laugh happily, it has to admit that it has one Like a fascinating master, but it still needs to admit that it also likes to be complimented and recognized, just like now: "Follow me," it flew up, the tail happily Curled, "Asmodeos is biting their ass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————— —————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "A little devil." The Elf Ranger is full of hate and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An innocent little devil." Asmodeos said that he was caught and could not move, but to be honest, he was not afraid The wicked are also afraid of the wicked, but he is facing a good person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan said with a smile: "I am not a mage," he said. "But I also know that an innocent little devil is as ridiculous as a pregnant virgin. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words angered Asmodeos, but now it can't even move the tip of the tail to even an inch, it is maliciously Kneeling, in the language of the endless abyss, everyone who hears the language can feel nausea and dizziness - the lich raises his hand, and the voice that afflicts their eardrums is immediately reduced by that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this scroll?" asked Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A scroll that allows us to drive this little devil." The Lich said that he could say that he was very satisfied to see Asmo Deuss shrinking. For the evil little devil, nothing is driven by a kind person. Of course, good things are more shameful and painful, but since the master of Asmodeos is in this embarrassing situation and It may last for many years, so it may be a good idea to feel this indescribable taste as a pet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," as expected, Asmodeos shouted loudly. "I can answer your questions," he said urgently. "Or obey your orders - Oh, good people. Every word you say will be engraved on the skin, but please, don't do this," it pleaded: "Don't do this, it will make me feel pain," it even weeps like a decent Get up, "I will die, dear master, it is like peeling off my skin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may be worse than that." The little devil was angry that the black-haired caster did not move (not surprisingly, it found some pleasure that should belong to the evil), and then, when the little devil searched for another goal, he unfolded. The reel releases the spells hidden inside. The spell works in an instant, and the spell from Antonio Master is powerful and precise. It is more rigorous than any law on the main material plane, and more robust and reliable than any chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I heard the voice of Asmodeos.” Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We haven't heard anything." The priest of Frost Giant said with suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it like a knife rubbing the bones?" Amonis did not think he said: "This is what our little devils use." Abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest who listened to the ear slammed a chill, and it was said that the sound of the abyss was very small and low, but it was like a long The thin needle can pierce the brain directly from your ear. He immediately lifts the crutches and shakes the ornaments hanging on it. The sound of the metal ornaments knocking on each other sounds disorganized, but as the jitter increases, The look of the Frost Giants has begun to become gentler--the abyss language is like a boring noise when you don't pay attention to it, but its damage to you still exists. These frost giants just didn't find it before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let it talk." The priest ordered: "Otherwise my poisonous insect will get into its body and suck it out of the last blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can, then dare to be good." The double serpent laughed and said, until he was stunned by his master, "Okay," it said: " Asmodeos said that they are busy opening the threshold of secrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
