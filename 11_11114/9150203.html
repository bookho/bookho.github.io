			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unpleasant prank is finally coming to an end. The chief pastor thinks that some priests are inevitably lost in the hive, and there are disciples and apprentices, but it doesn't matter. Soon, new blood will be added. She put her hands in the wide sleeves and held a new wand in her hand. She is a little tired of this, the flame is still tolerable, but the sharpness and chaos The sight is not so easy to be accepted by a leader who is proud of the blood of the dragons. She unfortunately casts an invisible blade to a priest with the talent of the dragon, just because she It’s too screaming, even though she’s just shamefully smothered by the flames of Kelsey’s flames.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After losing the support of Floro, the spiders gradually fell into an embarrassing situation in this battle, like Kelsey’s The servants thought that the priests who did not participate in the ritual ritual in the hive appeared. Because of various sinister traps and tricks, they failed to give their most sincere loyalty to Grei, but they realized When there are no other people, the chief pastor who can dominate their destiny, these women who have always been very cautious or ruthless, like the attentive worker bees, immediately ran out of their nests, especially In the case of the public, they are still very willing to show their good performance in front of the chief pastor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a demon spider is facing a pastor, it may be strong and terrible, but in it it needs to face no less than 50 pastors, And when there are quite a few high-ranking priests, they become bully and poor, the last hunter is hit by a pointed hammer, and the hammer is running through the whole head from the eyes. The demon spider has a lot of eyes. This is true. Unfortunately, there is only one brain. Several priests throw ropes and tie the body that can still be bitten and scratched by instinct. Its pointed feet And the chewing limbs are cut separately - these are very precious materials, but I don't know if the Warlock Tower can be repaired at a price where the hive can be repaired.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she remembers that there is still one? No, wait: "Catch Kelsey," said the chief pastor. "The disciples and apprentices all return to their rooms."She now needs to clean up this chaotic scene. In Kelsey's room, they didn't find the summoning method, whether it was engraved on the ground, hanging on the wall, or hanging directly. There are no airborne, no new demons appear, but this is not to say that they can throw this possibility together with the passage of the infinite abyss in the sanctuary of Gredi. The chief pastor tends to be A rune plate, recently Greed seems to be very interested in the rune plate, so there are a lot of such precious magical tools on the black market, but in terms of the number of demons, this rune plate will not be small, and now the chief priest is most worried about A short-sighted idiot suddenly caught his mind and stole it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wrinkled her eyebrows, estimating how much time the pastor still needs to be able to subdue Kelsey, although to say that to subdue, not kill or repatriate Very difficult, especially the pastors are always a little bit shackled, for the same reason that the chief pastor considered, they did not dare to dump those vicious and deadly gods on the red dragon girl, and after Kelsey, She has a lot of coveted special abilities - like one of her heads can madly bite and spur the flame like a red dragon, while the other head can still cast spells, even if no one can find her Where is the mouth, and her claws have changed from five fingers to six fingers. Her scales are unevenly distributed, but even the skin is thick and tough like steel, and the claws are sharper like some kind of magic rather than physical. No ropes or chains can trap her, and a priest threw a spell that would make a Deinonyx coma, but she only got rid of the nuisance of the spell by licking her head, maybe only one There was less or less chaos that made her know that she had been attacked by the enemy. She became even more angry. The red dragon head slammed a flame, which was great. Another priest fell from the air, maybe her Allies, a priest came forward with a spell to catch her, but unfortunately this is useless, the red dragon's flame engulfed the legs of this idiot in this short period of time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“凯尔丝"The chief pastor shouted, and the innate dragon-powered ability made her voice become like a thunderous sensation. The monster that Kyle became a pause paused a little, and the priests around her spread out, at the director. The priest's gesture temporarily suspended the attack, and the chief pastor suspended himself in the air, "Kelsey! "She continued to shout the name of this unruly lady, while watching her eyes, whether it is human, dragon or monster, the eyes are the projection of their souls, and those who are good at it can even read from them." The answer to some questions is like the current chief pastor. When she saw these eyes, her heart was slightly cold, the golden iris, the diamond-shaped black hazelnuts were not at the bottom, but it was a no thought. There is no sensible monster, not a smart creature - she must admit that Kelsey was not so smart, but at the time she at least knows how to measure, she is indeed rash, violent, and hidden in the depths. And inferiority, but she never crossed the line that should never cross.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests prayed for the fall of Kelsey, perhaps because Grydy was really watching their relationship, and this magic finally fulfilled their desired effect, and Kelsey’s movements solidified. She kept this posture - the wings were still close together, and the claws were deeply embedded in the dark black rock, her red faucet was tilted towards the interior of the hive, facing the priests, and her humans The two narrow slits on the skull were open, and the priests speculated that this might be her eyes. They looked at the wall, observing their enemies with the reflection of smooth walls, and the other underneath was twisted and twisted. It should be Sing a spell or pray for a magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." The chief pastor said, "Get her down, be careful, she may be a bit brittle now."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastors showed a relieved smile. "This is a tribute to the 'mother'." The disciple of the chief pastor said: "She should appreciate your piety - given that you are so critical In the case of the case, it was kept intact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be drawn twenty whips," the chief pastor said falsely: "The 'mother''s will only belong She herself, we just did what a loyal follower should do.” In fact, her heart is satisfied and proud, and she does expect that she can win the “mother” award for this matter, at the very least It is flush with the ones she has to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the chief pastor still carefully watched the actions of the young pastors, lest the last mistakes occurred, and several pastors were about to become empty in Kelsey. In the room of the warehouse, waving the arm, Kelsey moved out of the wall, she will be placed here, and then they may be able to cast a black iron cage on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has noticed, or said, that there is only one apprentice, that is, the one with a meager red dragon blood, still in the companion’s death due to sudden disaster Successfully protecting her pastor apprentice, she found that under the cover of the hot air, the lava pool was surging uneasily, an oversized circular bubble was forming, she put her hand on her throat, only hesitated A moment - a claw of a flame condensed suddenly jumped out of the lava, accurately grasping the apprentice, the fragile flesh immediately carbonized at the high temperature that can melt the steel, and the black ash was silently falling from the air. Did not attract anyone's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the unlucky Kelsey has been moved to the air by the priests, waiting for the chief pastor to breathe more sulphur than the past. It was too late, the burning waves rushed straight up, the priests were thrown to the wall, the honeycomb like a cylindrical structure allowed the tyrant of the flame to leap into the air without any hindrance, it had no wings, but the flame never No extra limbs are needed. In the frantic shouts of the chief pastor, this huge flame element spreads out his arms and wraps Kelsey wholely in his broad chest. Then, he leaves nothing for them. In the reaction time of the child, the flame fell like a water column from the air, and with her prey, the splattering fire illumined every horrified face—the chief pastor swooped down desperately. Just a few feet away from the lava pool, her robes and arms were black, but she didn't care. Her disciples were suspended in the distance, not as diligent as they used to be for their mentor. She also knew the senior pastor has finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lava pool restored the original calm, the chief pastor looked at the ground, the Mithril lines and gems were destroyed, she did not know when they were destroyed Who is destroying, she only knows that their damage means that the fire elemental creatures can come and go through the lava pool, that, the hands hidden in the darkness not only attracted the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How thoughtful preparation, the chief pastor even wants to reveal a mocking smile, it could have used a more critical place, just a Kelsey, She deeply felt that the one might be a bit eclipsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ——————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I think I will never understand people, I mean, including why dragons care about cost issues,” Gray Robe is really sincere. Say: "Don't a happy mood still exist as the heaviest bargaining chip on the balance?" He made a few gestures, nothing else, just to strengthen his tone: "H, why should we become strong? What? It’s not for what you want... If we have to work hard, and it’s a sad thing to do things, it’s really sad.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
