			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know," the knight from the kingdom looked at his empty hole and said: "The noble and glorious Highland Norman King is A wise and far-sighted person, he allowed the dwarf to take away the money from him enough to cast a gold castle. For this cost, the lords who connected the ten Thunderbolt were in a state of extreme poverty for a lifetime, and the dwarves did Is this? Turning the entire Thunderbolt into a trap?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why not,” Birdwin said: “It buried nearly 10,000 orcs, and The collapse of the inner city, the three castles, the city walls and the moat are all safe and sound, as long as the Master is allowed to cast a few spells they will be able to return to the original."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But your city What?” The Knights of the Kings said incredibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can always be rebuilt," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think they will continue to live here without any ills after seeing this." The prince's heart shook his head: "The dwarves are crazy." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out from the wall, you can see a fairly neat rectangular depression. If you want to describe it, it is like sinking into the snow. The stones, and the stones are piled up with ruptured toy huts. The orcs' bodies are covered with dust and look like small particles scattered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least this war is over." Bydwin said that he never felt that rebuilding the city of Thunderbolt would be a difficult matter. Like the White Tower of the Elves, Woking believers chose to live here for a long time just to get more gold coins - as long as the Whistling Plain still exists, or more correctly, its gems, gold, pyroxene and fur still exist. His city will continue to exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And merchants will be pleased to discover that the orcs will be more keen to trade with humans, they need salt, they need copper and iron, they need slaves, they need everything. I have never robbed what I got. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, Bydwin thought, he could still do something that the previous lord had never done before, and he was tired of waiting for the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these have to wait a long time later. He has a lot of things to do - the bodies of the orcs are going to burn, they are full of poisonous bugs that bring plague; his people and soldiers... the need to die, and the need to live warmly Clean water and plenty of food...and merchants...The owner of Thunderbolt thought that he should write a letter to the nephew of the king, Dylan, his bloodless brother, the leader of a huge guild, Like every time before, he would send his businessman to talk to Baldwin, and Baldwin must admit that they are very greedy, but similarly, they are also very good at dealing with the messy things that Badwin is not good at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the text, he can ask if Dylan is willing to sell him a complete city. Birdwin smiles and Dylan will be ecstatic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My brother wrote to me and asked if I had a complete one. The city is for sale," Dylan Donkley raised a piece of parchment, which curled up so badly that it was seen in a copper tube and was sent by the eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of John wrinkled his eyebrows irritably, and he strode over and took it out with a rudeness that was rare in him. A piece of parchment was thrown directly into the burning fireplace: "Don't open this inferior joke!" he snapped his scream: "I don't have a nephew from the skirt of the woman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan does not care about shrugging. Today he wears a full set of jewels inlaid with Mithril and Obsidian. The robes and cloaks are silver-white and look like It’s cold and elusive like a river in the snow: “You are anxious, dear,” he asked doubtfully. “Why?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can I do for it!" The Duke of John said loudly: "Bedwin, of course, is Bywin, my brother, your other sister, and the king of Norman in the Highlands, wants to give him a grand triumphal!" He hurried back and forth in the room, and the wind from the robe even affected the flame in the fireplace. "It’s ridiculous, it’s ridiculous! Is this a victory? His knights and soldiers are few, and his people are dead and wounded. He said that he killed tens of thousands of orcs, but who can prove it? In fact we I only got a box of ashes! We can't even see an ear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My businessman can prove it," Dylan giggled and said: " After all, it’s not us who called him these troubles. It’s us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Now is not a joke,” said the Duke of John, gloomy, while The silk cockroach blocked his mouth and suppressed the urge to cough: "This trouble will soon come to our own head... Remember that one? Embroidered on the tapestry - Norman's blood will be Thunder Forever Shield and Spear - Our sire is asking me for my knights and soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a law, just an old to be The tradition of forgetting," Dylan said: "You have the right to refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this will affect my reputation," the Duke of John coughed twice in an unbearable manner, and then several times, he coughed almost nowhere: "Cough... they think I am a coward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you have not compromised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is thanks to my son, although he is only A small hybrid of impure origin," said the Duke of John. "But his death helped me fight for a four-month suspended sentence. Plus the time of preparation, I can delay until the summer, but before the early fall, I must surrender. Five hundred knights and two thousand soldiers - the gods are on, if Birdwin died or was sinned, as we did before, I am quite willing to do so, Morton. Don Cray from your hand The last one was taken back to you, but now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Majesty is putting his arm on his most powerful arm and sending it. Lee Sword, for his daughter, he seems to have been less concerned about the hypocritical mask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp;Dylan stroked the ring on his hand and repeatedly chewed Bedwin’s name between his teeth several times. “He forgave the thief?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "He must be sympathetic," the Duke of John sneered: "A pair of mice drilled out of the gutter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your knight How do you say that?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“An idiot,” said the Duke of John, “I will hang him when he returns.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought he was loyal to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not the lord but the prince," said the Duke of John. He is a duke with a vast expanse. In addition, because he is the brother of the king, the only male heir, and the title of the prince, he maintains an abominable attitude towards this so-called prince, because it will change at any time. Be a joke - if his niece, Leona, inherits the throne, the title will be taken back immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just said four months..." Dylan thought and asked: "So, will this triumphal will be held in April?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost," said the Duke of John. "The Thunder Castle is no better than the Whistling Plain. As a lord of kindness, Birdwin will not look at him. The miners died of freezing and starvation, and he had to be busy for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
