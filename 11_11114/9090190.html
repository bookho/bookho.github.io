Jump, the pastors secretly complained again and again, but no one dared to say anything more - there are not many people who come to visit Mei Mi, but they are the most powerful and positional people on the side island - a Rosada The priest, who is said to have committed the sins of blasphemy and sorrow, but regained the favor of the god of morning light, and the priest of Fro is also a pastor. Of course, they know that a deported pastor bites once again to receive the god’s care. What a tough thing, what kind of clever means does this seem to be a pretty pastor? Or is there a more terrible figure standing behind him? Well, they don't want to know; the other is the knight, which is said to be from Norman in the Highlands. It is taller and taller than the men of the southern countries. Many of the priests of Froe are dreaming, not to mention the 3,000 fierce and strong all the side islands. The Norman soldiers were completely under his command. He and Yadel, one responsible for the military, one for the administration, held the entire side of the island in his hands, leaving no gaps - trying to steal gold coins or power from them. Merchants continue to contribute a variety of exquisite and expensive gifts to Fro's pastors. I hope that these glamorous demons can provide some more conclusive information. Even if they can't find the weaknesses of these two people, at least they can check it out. Their hobbies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that they came to the Temple of Fro and they only entered one person’s room, that is, Fro’s chief pastor, Mei Mi, but this is normal, after all In Fro's Temple, the Chief Pastor is one of the most fascinating and tempting ones - the priests are annoyed that even in Fro's main hall, the priest will also give a one-and-a-half dew of dew to nourish the flowers in the temple. We, but Mei Mei never seems to have thought about it. The thief Gülen has never been to a woman's room other than her, and the pastor Yadel and the Cavaliers are also - when Gülen alone dominates plum, they I have also privately talked about whether Mei Mi really fell in love and decided to be a man. They are almost ecstatic to wait for her to be punished by Fro, but now the situation makes them discouraged, after Gülen leaves Mei Mei did not wait for a day to let the priest of Rosada enter his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they don’t dare to show anything in the face of plum, especially the youngest and most popular among them, somehow poisoned to the remote In the corridor - Mei Mi is not the kind of little girl who has not left the temple. On the contrary, she is very ruthless, and she never succumbs when dealing with people who are obstructing her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, these Fro priests bowed their heads (even if they were temporary), and the silence and silence of Mei Mi’s looks and body—yes, she is more beautiful every day, her body is like a rose petal, and Her lips are like garnets, her eyes are comparable to the seawater surrounding the side islands, and the long hair that hangs down to the heel is as soft and smooth as silk satin. Her whole body is like a layer of pearls. In the light, everyone, male or female, can't transfer their eyes when they see her. Some priests remember that when they first saw Mei Mi, her lips had a few fine lines, scars on the ankles, and some noses were not neat, but now they are gone, they are gone - this one Can explain one thing, Fro is watching her and allowing her to share her glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that may not be noticed is Mei Mi, the change that happened to her, not only did not surprise her, but made her fear, how she hoped Gülen can be by her side, but she knows that this is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the round house farthest from the altar, there is a follower of Fro's future,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, Even the Temple of Fro has been shrouded in sweet silence, but at this time, the soft and slow sound of water awakened one of the children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She got up from the felt of the whale skin, her eyes were aimed at the wall of the round house, and she looked out hard, this is a gum filling she found. In many places, the translucent gum allowed her to see the outside situation, especially when the moonlight was bright outside and the house was dark. She saw Fro’s chief pastor, the lady who had been teaching them, walking on the water. On the top, the transparent waves hold her feet, just like walking on a soft velvet blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pressed her breath, climbed up, and crossed her peers’ body with her own memory, putting her hand on the wooden door, but in the When she wanted to open the door, a hand came around behind her, holding her mouth firmly, while the other hand was around her waist. The man’s strength was so big, she It is impossible to move at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She frantically scratched the man, the child’s nails were thin, but sharp, and she could feel the person shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
