			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I had to wait a long time, after all, Kerry’s injury seemed so terrible and serious, but I have not waited for him to go back and forth in the room. On the narrow aisle, the closed door was opened, and the closed door was opened. The black-haired caster stood at the door, pale, breathing shallow and short, and looked tired - survived from the dangerous task. Every elf is exhausted, but the caster's exhaustion is different from them. He seems to be split or taken away from the essence. If he falls down and sleeps, he won't feel it at all. strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar nodded, and even making such a small move would make him feel awkward, an elf warrior helping him in a chair in the room Sit up, but the soul of the outside world wants to sleep directly on the ground, anyway, this room is covered with white bear skin carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest elf priest eagerly walked over to observe Kerry's situation, which was very pleasing, the ominous black that shrouded the wounds of the Elf Ranger. The fog had vanished. He glanced at Kremar and got a certain look and then tore a treatment reel. The reel gave a soft white light, and the white light fell softly on Kerryburn like a floating snowflake. On the body, the bleeding immediately stopped, the new muscles and tendons, the skin like spring buds and petals rushed to grow and stretch, the pain disappeared from the face of the young elf, and the breathing gradually turned from hard to comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A female elf handed a silver cup with a glass of life that shines with light, and Crimmar took it and sipped it, clean The water is still cold in the mouth, and when it reaches the throat, it becomes warm and even hot. It spreads from the depths of his body to every blood vessel, and is carried by each blood vessel to his fingertips and toes. He shuddered softly, and the cup almost slipped from his fingers. "You need to rest." The female elf said, took the cup, and her other hand gently held the caster's shoulder to prevent him from taking the chair. Falling down - she has similar blond hair and green eyes like new leaves, Kremar almost turned away immediately - he knew it was rude, but he was deeply afraid, afraid of the next For a moment she would look at him and smile and say her name, just like Illu... The soul of the outside world doesn’t want to know her name at all. They are in the middle of war, she...anytime Die. Fortunately, the silence between them was quickly broken. "The orcs are gone." Birdwin’s awkwardly said from a panting voice: "Gregory makes the wounded." The man and the mage who needs rest will return to the twin towers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two towers he said are the two towers standing between the heavy fortress, the double city wall and the inner city. One belongs to the elf, one belongs to the human mage, and Kremar is of course with Kerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Maybe we should leave when everyone has no time to take care of us, the undead who used to slap his cheeks boringly, I know they have a secret Underground passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Kerry has been sleeping, and he may not know what happened. The soul of the outside world is weak and says that for the first time, he knows that the soul will also turn around under his feet, and his eyes will be black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This is normal, the Lich said, you prayed to the elves' life god, Angris, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world is a little surprised, the reason why it is small, or because he is now hanging a weak dff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, when you cut your arms and watched that you were filled with light and became like a mercury-like bright blood flowing down, root Zheng Miaohong, who has been worshipped for more than a decade of atheistic education, is not a god in his world, without a trace of embarrassment and neglect, he seriously and sincerely goes to the gods of the elves. Thinking about praying - he doesn't know how to pray, nor does he know whether the "supreme", "love" and "gospel" he has heard in his world can win the hearts of different world gods. He is stuttering and incoherent. Praying, shouting the name of Angris, hoping that he can cast his sight here, to vote for his dearest child, an upright and pure elf, begging him to allow his blood to play in Kerry’s body. The correct utility, don't let Kerry die, and don't let Kerry this become the first (only?) octopus fairy ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Angris responded to me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Maybe. Once the undead said, because he had a little while involuntarily wanted to squash himself in any dark corner, but also felt sick and vomiting, want to eat some acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——But I am not an elf, the soul of the outside world is confused, I don’t believe in Angris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Who knows, the Lich said impatiently, anyway, you are flexible and have no eight arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Well, the soul of the opposite world said, then, the rest is pleased - if... he hesitated, if not... no... I mean, things that might threaten our lives happen, you Can... stay here for the time being? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Depending on the situation, the Lich said, but I promise not to cry and run away because of a feather that has reached my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Thank you, the soul of the opposite world said happily, and then he fell unprepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is not in a hurry to rise. Before the stipulated time, he can’t manipulate the body even if he is floating up to the surface of the sea. He has already tried it. - He stayed quietly in the same place, and the soul that resembled a large piece of colorless jellyfish was slowly sinking from the surface to the depths - that is, where he was, he "gaze" at it, its The outline is still so vague, but it can be confirmed that it is more solid than when the undead first saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fragile, timid, and ignorant. A goblin soul may be stronger than it. The lich thought it was just useless. Or a special punishment tool, he teaches it to use the magical power contained in the body's blood to cast spells, because he never thought that this despicable thief could become a mage - its mental power was not at the beginning So strong, more correctly, it is weak and sloppy. The mistakes and mistakes it made in the process of learning have accumulated enough to make a dragon that has lived for thousands of years go crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later it became more proficient and even good at casting spells, but the Lich thought it was more related to the blood flowing in the body - he must admit I made a mistake myself. The former undead thought, it may not be a simple accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A god, even a good god, will not listen to the prayers of an unbelievers, in their world, an unbelievers are more than a false believer Not worthy of care, because the latter has at least faith, even if he is not pious – no unbelievers can get a godly response when they pray for the first time, even if he is an evil god And dedication to a village, or a city's life as a sacrifice - because their unbelief will shake the foundation of all gods, they are the object of all gods hostile, they can not be saved, can not be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this soul from a world without a god has succeeded, and the elf's life god responded to his call - the lich is now able to identify those The gentle whisper of the guide is from Angris. Simply giving blood will only make the body exhausted, and the exhaustion of the soul will only come from higher losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I hope that you will come just for your people, Angris. The lich said gloomyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin stood on the tower and looked down, the beasts were crowded Together, their eyes shine like night beasts in the night, and the gathering of the ominous light river spread from the other side of the mouth to the wall of Thunder Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have no siege hammers and no giant trebuchets," said a knight who served for the first time in Thunderbolt. "But they are still going on." Attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The orcs are not humans," Birdwin said. "They have never had a giant trebuchet and a siege hammer before, but they still attack. The thunderbolt was six years old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1,500-foot wall is like a rock that has been hit by a tsunami, and the orcs pile up under the walls, they step on it. The companion's shoulders and even the head, climbing up wildly - there are only a few places that need to erect a long ladder, throwing a grapple - and the siege hammer that was destroyed by Birdwin when it is not working, The giant trebuchet played a big role. The white phosphorus pottery that it projected crushed the ice armor of the city wall and left countless potholes on the stone bricks. The orcs could use these bumps. The place directly climbs the wall - they bite the rough bone sword, or use the teeth and claws directly, only A small portion of the orc armor, the other is mostly a piece of armor made of fur, then fight piecemeal armor, but their fur just like painted pine wild boar, ordinary soldiers could not pierce them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So humans entertain them with boiling water and bitumen, each pot brings a long-lasting mourning scream, in addition to these, more soldiers Running on the wall, cutting off the ropes connected by the hooks, pushing the ladders out, sticking out spears and stabbing the heads of the orcs who dare to explore the walls, but only the well-balanced elves can stand on the woods that stretch out the battlements. Shooting down the platform, their goal is to focus on the orc warriors wearing iron armor, the latter being the easiest threat to human defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights are wearing chain armor, wielding wide swords and long swords, as well as hammers and flails. They are like elves, mainly dealing with the strongness that ordinary soldiers can’t cope with. The orcs - the most eye-catching of them are Birdwin and his knights, who are followers of Tyre, and the light of Tyre always shines on them, almost making people think that dawn has arrived in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
