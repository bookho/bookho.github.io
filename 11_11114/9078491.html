An unfortunate thief apprentice was hit and connected with his crossbow from the multi-branch chandelier hanging on the towering dome. Lord Thunder Castle has time to look at the people behind him: "What do you want me to know?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Mei Mi said categorically, and Birdwin gave her a look that she didn't believe. He turned his gaze to Gülen, Glan's thin face. It is filled with the kind of smile that the former paladin least liked: "It’s just a small problem." Just as he replied, a fireball roared, and their mage was still fighting a red robe warrior. Baldwin warned that the three people behind him, Plum, Gülen and Gnome McGee jumped agilely into the corridor on the left, leaving Podwin. The warrior burst into a fierce roar in the middle of a cry, and the flowing Mithril spilled from his "right hand" like a thunder, only in the blink of an eye, as the gnome McGee said, as Birdwin imagined. He got a wide sword that he is most familiar with. This enchanted steel wide sword was given to him by the lord. He has been with him for nearly two decades in Thunder, but since he was put in jail, he The weapons have been collected and destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he has got a weapon that is so subtle and fit, the Thoris once said that the best weapon is like the user’s arm. Extension, Baldwin thought it was just a description, but he now knows that this is not just a description. It is a miracle worthy of praise 10,000 times - he not only got back his arms, fingers, palms, but also got a weapon that will never be lost - the fireball hit the wide sword. The hot temperature is enough to melt the black iron steel, but it encounters Mithril, the Mithril flows, like the rushing water, and the temperature is quickly lowered below the line that humans can tolerate. Even so, Birdwin still felt a bit of burning, but this burning did not make him lose his keenness and tenacity as a warrior. The wide sword deformed in an instant, narrowed, stretched, bent, and pulled out at both ends. The slender bowstrings of the roots condense in the air and condense a small ball that jumps like a frightened beast when the second spell screams. It became thin and long, which could not be said to be the standard shape of an arrow, but Birdwin is not holding an ordinary longbow now. All the changes are so fast and accurate. Birdwin is shooting this arrow. Later, there was time to escape the attacker's attack sideways - an acid almost hit the pygmy McGee behind him. If McGee is not a gnome, then his upper body is likely to become a pair on the wall. Black and white abstract painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Ruiyi made a mistake. She wore a pair of dragon leather gloves, which were made from the skin removed from the back of a dying dragon. Even so, its thickness can be equal to two layers of cowhide and five layers of sheepskin, which makes her a little inconvenient, but this glove can capture the magical energy of the enemy and the other's weapon after the magic. She is not facing the caster, it is just a former paladin who has lost God's care, so she can say that she is very careless in holding the arrow shot by Birdwin in her hand, but not the first time. Destroy or discard it, like a feather-like arrow shrinking in the palm of her hand, slamming out countless tiny spikes before she notices. These spikes even penetrated her dragon leather gloves and pricked her hand into a small hole. Reyette screamed back and held his injured hand, and the drop of the secret silver that left the owner solidified on the floor before she could do something, and then quickly slid into a fine blade. The gap is gone in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you knew it was a Mithril arm with magic attached." Rika said falsely: "Sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reiite grabbed a wand from behind the waist and slammed it on his knees: "Get out!" she shouted rudely, just wondering if it was against Rica or Bird. Warm them, the spells cast by the wand formed a thick green smog, permeated in the corridor of the latter hiding, but Ruiyite could not hear the sound of human barking and coughing as she wished, she looked distorted from the hanging Take a bottle of healing potion from the potion under the robes and put it directly between the teeth instead of sipping it up like everyone else - she is not only wary of her enemies, but also guards her allies and brothers. The red robes of Reinada don't admire the charcoal in the snow. They are best at falling down the rocks. Every warlock or priest who lives and lives in that country, or a mage, knows not to expose his wounds in front of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitter healing syrup is integrated into her wounds, but Reyote’s tongue and mouth are still faint, that is, the bottle debris she has not had time to spit out, After the potion is in effect, they and the flesh and blood grow together. It may be necessary for Reyote to have time to pick them out one by one after the end of the battle. The treatment may be better, but Ruiyite is not available now. Time prays to her god for the magic. "Why are you still here?" She blamed her brother, telling the truth, and blaming him all the way it is now, is his proposal to capture the friend of the black hair caster as a bait. With the hostages, he also revealed the secrets of his mentor, and in exchange for the cooperation of Reyote, even the detention of Birdwin in the tower of Antonio Mage is also his insistence, although Ruiyite also thinks that The idea is very good. The people who are coveted by the secrets of Austal and the interests of the darkness are not only Rika. As for the “residence” of Bydwin, at the very beginning, she also quite agrees. Because she doesn't want her husband Destroyed in the battle of the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it seems that it is better to destroy one or two guilds. Anyway, the construction of the guild is also taken from a businessman. They can come again to see the layout of Rika! Her thieves are not small bugs hovering under the light, even if they have heard the whistling sound of the mourning of the wilderness, they should die for the greater and more worthy benefits - she does not even understand how Baldwin is Leaving the prison at the bottom of the tower, it was originally the room used by Antonio Master to cast the summoning spell, because the object of the summoner's summoning is not the devil or the demon, the lowest level is also the powerful ghost. Therefore, their call is always quite concealed and solid, and the secret room of Antonio Master is deeply buried in the ground. The lead water is cast between the cracks of the rock, and the wall depicts the magic. Most of the spells will lose their effectiveness in this room, and the three consecutive black irons mixed with Mithril's narrow door and narrow and tortuous steps are also destined to be very difficult to enter or leave, let alone the ghost she left behind. And the thieves - but the tall human man is at the expectation of everyone, just like the wild boar that was irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest and the warlock in red robes gently rub their lips, if you want to find the reason. The Mithril finger, which can change with the owner's mind, is certainly one of the biggest reasons. She didn't get enough knowledge from the warlock's tower. After all, the noble women of Grenada will almost become Gredi. Pastor, so no male tutor will be willing to teach a woman with sincerity, so Ruiyite has never heard of the silver golem, but this does not prevent her from perceiving the magic arm. Precious – her fingers and palms are almost healed, and the glamorous female warlocks gently bend their fingers, unobtrusively checking to see if they can still make the spelling gesture correctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your enemy?" she asked sharply, hoping that this would bring some pressure to her allies and brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rika shrugged indifferently. "He hid it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Find him out!” Ruiyite screamed: “Do you think he will ruin his friend and threaten him? Let the whole thing go wrong?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows, my dear sister," also dressed in red robe, but the color is deeper than Ruiyite, and the male warlock, who is close to solidified blood, said happily "Although he is a mage, he has half the blood of an elf. He is still mixed with an elf for a long time. Who knows if he will get sick with the elf? - Maybe he will be quiet. Go back to his island, or we can talk to him and see if we can cooperate. What constitutes an adventure squad..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"You are crazy," Ruiyite said bluntly: "When can the red robe be with one, even half an elf? They are cute to shoot on your little ass - you can try Try, I think the next day I can get a needle that makes sense again." When I saw Ricardo's smile. She was even more angry because she knew she was being teased again. Of course, Ricardo knew better than her that there was no possibility of compromise between them and the black hair's caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bywin has been out of their control, but they also have Leona, the king of Norman in the Highlands. Reyote only worried that these people are not worth the new value of the king, but she will be willing to explain to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now can you tell me what can't be said to me?" Birdwin asked: "When they are still quarreling."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They huddled on one side of the corridor, thanking the gnomes, oh, those sensitive and alert little guys, they will always hang a lot on their body and it will make people The stunned defensive charm, McGee is no exception, but his defensive ornaments are deliberately made into a rough shape, but the effect can not be reduced, which makes them not suffocated, stinging or stinking by the stench cloud created by the spell. It’s a tearful flow – it also gives Bedwin’s rare curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said it was just a small problem." Birdwin looked at Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief’s eyes moved to the left, his left is plum, and Mei Mei glared at him, and then turned to McGee. Gnomish McGee grabbed his face: "Before the Master controlled it to kill a thief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin bounced his tongue: "I don't think this is A thing that needs to hide me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan made a face in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomish McGee looks at Baldwin’s new arm, the drop of Mithril should have returned to its original position, and Kremar’s adult is in jail. The last cast of the spell, the room that was once used to summon the demon and the devil is indeed tightly guarded, but there is no gap to go, even if there is a spell blocking, the black hair caster can also feedback according to Mithril The message that came back was lifted one by one - he was a smart and powerful mage, at least McGee had never thought of preparing so many spells that seemed to have nothing to do with the battle, but the price was as expensive as the return. The scroll and rune coat of arms cast by the caster this day may be the sum of the other wizards for a year or years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
