			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," the lich added: "I don't think we will be easily forgotten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Just like to prove his words, the sharp hearing of the elves and half-elves captured the footsteps, more than one and very hasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich opened the door of the room without the consent of the other two. A waiter who tried to dress himself as if he was not in a hurry saw him stunned. He was still 15 steps away from the elf's room. For a time, he didn't know if he should go past or just read it out loud. The order of the new king, the Duke of John, is now the new king, and is not prepared to be hostile to the Silver Crown jungle. Although they are indeed close to Pharaoh and Birdwin, as a king, John considers himself to be quite open-minded and gentle. He just wants to control and comfort them, lest they make any tricks in the next few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the lich helped him make a decision, and the attendant officer looked at the wizard stupidly, raising his hand and sprinkling a fresh rose petal (this Or he got it from the pink robe mage) - and the wizard behind him was slower than one step, they were sent just to prevent it, but how could they not think that the other party would be without talking or threatening In the case of the first cast - the battle between the Master is always very fast, before the sleep of the former undead is fully effective, the attendant heard the Duke of John's Master chanting a spell - it sounds like a The drunken madman cursed a brainless bunny scorpion to the three-legged hair, but he was just an ordinary person, and he knew nothing about magic, so he still had such a small hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the wizards may carry a reel or rune that can counteract sleep, when the people around him are swaying down, that Keeping the beard long and looking like it is like a male goat's mage who is nervous and proud to start casting his spells - this round is mine, he must think so - then Kerry Ben and Leona Just watching Crimare jump over, I don't know if I pulled out a ruby-inlaid wand from there and knocked out the fish that was still biting the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the wizard wizard doing this?" Liona asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Occasionally." Kerry Ben answered, but fortunately, outside, unless it is a friend of great trust. The elves never put down their vigilance. Their weapons and equipment were collected in the pockets, and the pockets were hung on their belts. He only had to take him and Kremar's cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people, more correctly. A human being, an elf and a half elf tiptoe. One by one, over the obstacles that crossed the road, the torches on the ramp were lit, and Leona could see their faces effortlessly. "It’s my uncle's attendant." But the vast majority are people who have sworn their loyalty to her father. "...Pharaoh is dead, Long live the new king." The concept that she did not understand so much suddenly reflected in her mind in an unprecedented clear gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Princess Leona, you should be able to go back to your room after leaving this corridor," the Lich said. And raised a hand to indicate that Leona would not interrupt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who used to estimate the time, dawn is coming. Another idiot is about to control the body, and then he and Kerry Ben - oh, an elf and a half elf will try to rescue their friends from a guarded fortress and leap a whole 12 towers A huge kingdom surrounded by heavy walls. Very hard to come by. The lich prayed piously to his mentor, hoping that the new king’s confidant would not have the hobby of the undead guards. When the latter caught the prey, if the owner of the tower had no clear orders, they would be the first. Time to tear off his limbs (or more limbs), dig his eyes and cut off his tongue to avoid accidents - they don't need to drag any more cumbersome: "The people we are going to save are being "The thief who controlled the killing of the pharaoh," he said in a warm tone. "Princess Leona, you are the daughter of Pharaoh. If you don't want people to think that you are the behind-the-scenes instigator and implement the crime of Bydwin. It’s best to keep a long distance from what you’re going to do – it’s better than anyone else to forget you. I hope that when someone asks about the matter, you are sitting securely. In your room, put on a black mourning dress and sincerely cry for your dead father.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," he added: "We still have to Washing Baldwin’s charge, but like you know , Norman king in Highland who can not speak for Bird warm, he only you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona is silent, the only place that can explain her anxiety is that she stepped on a knight's little finger in the final step, he 嗷The ground stood upright and stood upright, and the two round eyes glared at the front... But with the sound of "pong", he fell back silently, "Thank you," Liona said, one side. Returning the light but hard wand to its owner, he whispered, "Why would he wake up?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sound won't wake people who have been given sleep," the Lich said. "But shaking them or attacking them will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are quiet Going to the end of the ramp, "Maybe I can try again," Leona said suddenly and hard: "I am the princess of Norman in the Highlands - I can't forgive Baldwin, but maybe I can keep his life... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how the whole thing happened," the Lich said. "But if the king died, Bedwin was present, dear Leo." Princess Na, in view of the strictness of Tyre, he is likely to be judged to be dereliction of duty. A dereliction of duty will not be tolerated by Tyre, he will be expelled, and a fallen paladin cannot pray and receive treatment. In fact, if he is sentenced to gauntlet or other severe torture, no matter where it is, there is no hope that the place will be healed again, like the white tower of Yadel, I saw it in Thunderburg. When he was, the brand of blasphemy and kinsman was deeply engraved on his face, whenever he accidentally let the cloth, When they cover them, they will burn his face like a charcoal fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is just worried about us, Kremar." Ben kindly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she didn’t have to appear from the beginning, the lich said in her heart, but it’s not necessary, anyway, Kerry must have saved Boldwin If you don't do that, the lich will have to wonder if he has been replaced by an appendage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona still wants to say something, but the lich made a gesture - a hidden cold hand touched her lips, the princess almost Cried: "Thank you for your message," the Lich said indifferently. "But so far, we are not ignorant dwarves or gnomes, we know how to do it, and hope that you can follow I said so, I will be grateful, my Highness."
