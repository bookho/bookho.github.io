She stroked her chest, there was a keel whistle, but it was not the original That, she came back from Longhuo Island and found that she had lost her magical tools. This tool was not hers, but was given by Grenada. In order to ensure that the "fine net" guild can be unimpeded on this continent, they may Need to assassinate some casters, the original Antonio Master is their primary goal, but unfortunately this old Master has a rabbit-like vigilance, once the power of the guild has penetrated into his tower, only with a few of his trust The disciple escaped awful. She was not in the guild’s mission, but lost the instrument while doing her own work. She had to sneak a copy of her neck, but this instrument always had to The use of her brother's words is also motivated in this respect. This instrument is so precious that as long as the caster is in his hand, he will never sell it, then if they can catch the black hair of the caster She will be able to back up his whistle. ↗,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you can get more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little conspiracy." The young warlock said: "I have several contacts with merchants on the Longhuo Island. It is said that now the new side of the island The lord signed several monopoly licenses to the merchants in Bitumburg, and they were very dissatisfied. If I asked, they would help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Are they not afraid that their new lords will throw them into the shark heap?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are good people," the young warlock said, "A good kind man." It’s not going to throw someone into the shark heap, not to mention that they will pray for forgiveness when they shed tears and tell their new lords that they are completely forced to do so, um, because we have robbed their most beloved little Son or younger daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then his wives can come out and cry and cry," Ruiyite continued. "They always care too much about their reputation." Of course. It is a good thing for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"And this must be built on the premise that we are missing," the young warlock said. "You have met with them, then you should still know something about them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most tricky thing is probably the Master." Reyte said, "You may have heard. The lord of the East Crown main island is dead, and the Naga beside him is also dead. Naga and his descendants should have inherited the East Crown, and now one, "Ruiite said that she knows that her brother will know who the one is, Naga belongs to him, and he himself and Oss. Tal’s relationship is not very good. "Very annoyed, but like your mentor, he is busy dealing with Norman in the Highlands and can't get away from it for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He should take his mouth down a little." The young warlock sneered unscrupulously. The Norman and Longhuo Islands in the Highlands are just the southernmost point and the farthest point. Even if there is a high-level transmission, it is also unavoidable to consider two places. It’s too difficult. "When they die, those people are next to them"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's really weird. Naga is not a weak person, and there are more casters around the East Crown lord. There are soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not very clear about the situation, because the inherited son of the East Crown is his youngest son, the little guy is about to be scared. In the last few months, the East Crown will be blocked but as far as I know, the East crown has encountered the tower. The attack by Pastor Los, perhaps this is the real reason. The anger of Talos is not something that mortals can afford."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to get some information It is not very difficult for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Business people on the side of the island"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "I have it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this really great," said Ruiyite's look and relaxed: "You live now." """<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought White Tower had nothing you didn't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I got Respect any of the casters, especially he is my brother." Rui Yi special mouth said, in fact, she did not find the foot of the warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want me to live where"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fro's Temple. How?" Ruiyite leaned forward and stretched out his long fingers. Put it in the throat of her brother, this is the most vulnerable. But it is also the most sensitive place: "I have twelve priests of Fro, young, fresh and beautiful. No one knows more than Fro, who knows how to serve men."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds very tempting," her brother said, grabbing the few fingers that were not so safe, and biting his teeth with a slap in the mouth: "But I have already taken a fancy A very nice place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The highest place in the White Tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruiyi specializes in frowning , pull back your fingers. "Don't tell me that you have taken a look at the sanctuary in Rosada. If the mother knows that you stepped in, unless you are otherwise, I can guarantee that I will never have it on the third day of sunrise. "Brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come," the young warlock said with a smile: "The White Tower has a abandoned tower, don't tell me you don't know that. "Where," "Ah," Ruiyite suddenly realized that perhaps her brother had taken the lead: "The tower of Antonio Master, you have been in these days. It’s not right.” Because people have told that the disciples of Antonio’s death have turned into a wandering relationship around the ghost all day long. Very few people are close to it. Even if her thieves have different guts than ordinary people, they will also avoid any legacy in the mage tower. Magic or organ, and the casters are very disgusted with the mortal’s use of the caster without permission. Including his tower, if a mage who walks outside sees the abandoned mage in the tower, the best way to deal with them is to drive them all away. The worst way is to kill them all. Inside, add new legends to the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a caster can live in the tower, if the owner of the tower allows or the tower has no owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not very comfortable these days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can make it comfortable "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you want this tower," Reyte said: "You must make a request."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To whom"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner of the White Tower and the Hill, our little lord, An Zhen."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," he was stopped by his sister before the young warlock left Reyte's room. "Tell me your name."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you remember my name?" Her brother raised his eyebrows and expressed surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know what I am talking about." Reyte said: "Of course I will not want your real name, but at the very least, you should tell me your current variant name."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young warlock snorted thoughtfully. He doesn't think that Ruiyi will be so strange to him, but he also knows what Ruiyi specially means. "Ricardo, I am now called Ricardo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rika." Reyt put the name in his mouth and repeated it several times, if In the Long language, then the word is the meaning of the crow, but what is the name of a warlock's variant is only what they know, and the name that is ultimately restored is not necessarily a crow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Rica," the warlock said in a gentle manner: "This name is valid for the contract. What you want to say to me is this. Right, my sister is good, I will sign a contract with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The word contract is worth tens of thousands of vows." Ruiyite said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of the night, Rika saw the lord of the White Tower, under the guidance of his sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen is a woman who is hard to describe. Ricardo has heard that she has half of the human elves. She should have been like a lily of the valley. Pity, but Rika just walked to the door of the reception room where he saw the lord, and smelled a stench that even the goblin could not endure. This stench is like a mixture of various bad smells and vomiting mucus after drinking. The goblin of the goblin, the beast's poop, and the rotten body. The visceral garbage in the fish market, he cast a spell for himself before he walked in, and pitifully took the lord's maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he saw the maid, he understood that the maid was like a beautiful woman when he stood next to Anzhen, but he could not hide it anyway. Her nose, which was flattened, seems to have solved this problem well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen is sitting in a special seat. The reason why the seat needs to be specially made is because her body is no longer suitable for ordinary seats. Her body is still Divided into two halves, the normal half does not see anything unusual except the skin color. But the half that was not normal was so swollen that it didn't look like hundreds of pounds. Every inch of skin is blue and bright, and deep purple blood vessels are hidden under the skin like fishing nets. The wrapped muscles are easily reminiscent of a strong horse or cow, and her lower limbs are no longer able to wear shoes, and the raised parts need to be covered with ten times the other side of the fabric, her arms, if It can be said that if it is an arm, the end sticks out like a squid's wrist, and each wrist has a sucker that is full of fangs. When she sees Rica, she lifts her wrist and tiredly, indicating his seat on the other side. Sit down on the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already listened to Rui Yi Te," said An Zhen, yawning tiredly: "You want Antonio's tower"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One has been abandoned The tower.” Rika noticed the monster of this half-man and half-dragon half-elf. When she noticed that she was trembled ominously, she immediately modified her words: “But that is a magnificent building, so let it vacate. It’s a shame.” He said: “I am willing to pay 100 gold coins a year as the cost of renting it. If the Master of Antonio returns to Baita, I am willing to move away after a certain period of time.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back" An Zhen said vaguely: "No, I don't think he will come back," she raised her finger. "No, they abandoned." I, they, Antonio, Yadell, Demon" She looked at the zenith with no eyes: "They are gone, no love. Only me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;I think you have nothing bad, Ricardo said in his heart, and Demon seems to be killing you, Yadel was And let you have the most direct relationship, as for the poor Antonio Master, if he is not vigilant enough, may have to stay with you forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, do you allow it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ann, I didn’t hear what Rica was saying. Her eyes are offset from Rika, one of them has protruded from the eye socket, and Rica can see a few blood vessels at the back end of the eyeball. It is like a ripe, rotted grape that is crumbling enough to make Everyone who saw it had a nightmare for a whole month, but Rica had the exception. As a red robe, his own room and the mentor’s tower never lacked this kind of thing. He even took a bit of appreciation. Observing the strange face and the twisted body, the abnormal place may have been expanding and expanding to the outside of the normal part. The face of the ampoule looks like a half mask. Monster, and the body is like two puppets being forcibly sewn together. The intact part is tilted to one side and lifted up high. Even the small foot can't fall to the ground. It only hangs on it. There, the movement of the ampoule swayed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Aode Dear" Ruiyite’s voice gently reminded her that she walked behind An Zhen and did not mind placing her hands on her shoulders. "It's already very late, ampoule, my dear master, why don't we let this thing happen as soon as possible? Today, the kitchen grilled a calf and added your favorite spice. Why don't you smell it? It is so sweet"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
