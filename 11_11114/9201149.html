			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft prevention chapter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————“Resurrection!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They inform and confirm each other The news of the resurrection, loud greetings, flirting and amused, passing through one dark and damp street in chasing and pushing, these streets are meandering and criss-crossing, but there is no rule, no matter the order or length, its chaos is complicated. The degree is not inferior to that of a knocked goat's intestines. The layout of the Florentine city in 1478 is very interesting. The basis for the division is neither wealth nor status, but surname and blood. Family members with the same surname, along with relatives, priests and merchants, dependent mercenaries, servants and craftsmen living along a street or living around a square so that they can gather in the shortest possible time The most power and the most support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Square boulder grows like a climbing plant next to a stretch of leaves - a thick wall that is isolated from hatred and hatred, and a guarded swallowtail Passports and battlements, barriers, heavy iron bars, awl-like cage towers, large and pointed, two-color arches with shields and crests greedily compete for every inch of space and light. Their thick shadows are intimately stacked together, so that between the two blocks, there is always only one line in the sky, and the streets must be dark and dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling committee of Florence has issued relevant decrees more than once, trying to contain or correct this bad trend, but always because of all kinds of reasons. The strong family is always connected to a specific block, and it is never easy to move. For example, Albizzi Street belongs to the Albizzi family, and the residential threshold in the Piruzi Square is mostly engraved with Piruzi. The national emblem, while the base of the Baldi family is on the Baldi Street on the south bank of the Arno River... and the San Lorenzo district of the Medici family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medici family’s residence is located in the eastern part of the ruling square. The brown fort-style buildings are rough, old and square, like the tower of Babel’s forgotten in the world. The cornerstone, except for the arched windows of each layer, the only decoration is the triangular relief decoration at the position of the main entrance threshold - the two giant lions on both sides guard the symbol of Florence, and the stamens in the coat of arms are prominent. Lily) - not the ridiculous lilies and small ball-like crests of the Medici family, because it is also the office of the Florentine ruling group, the then Medici family's parents, Cosimo I, on this issue Made a fairly generous concession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His contribution has been quite rewarding in the next half century, the logo of lilies and small balls day after day, from the least The place where people pay attention to spread out and proliferate... Today, it and the power and philosophy of the Medici family it represents cover almost the whole of Florence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliano de Medici, the second son of the Medici family, covered with a scarlet sleeved cloak, slowly Step out of the Palazzo Vecchio and follow the shadow of the zigzag tower towards a straight and spacious (compared to other roads) passage. Like the second son of all the family, he is taller, handsome, strong and bohemian than his brother Lorenzo... The last point seems to make him more attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Florence give way to him, pay tribute to him, or shout "Medic" name to support, and the second son of Medici With a more humble and welcoming attitude - no matter what he salutes, he is a rude butcher, a notary public, a prominent member of the chamber of commerce, or a sculptor who wears a tight-skinned leather pants, or a hat and hair. The ** 铛 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照 按照This kind of pleasant and satisfying behavior seems simple and easy, but it is quite rare in a crowd of his age, especially when the young man has the wealth, status and appearance that ordinary people can't reach; so, Although his face was a little pale, his movements were a little stiff, and the timing of his response was not perfect, but the people of Florence, especially the women, agreed that his rudeness was not derived from the arrogance in his heart. After all, two years ago, it was his lover, "Venus in the world", the day of the death of Mrs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their inference is not entirely wrong, but it is also far from the truth. Most of the reasons for this young man to be so embarrassed are from the flesh, not the emotions, and this must be attributed to Giuliano and his brother's father, the "gout" Piero de Medici. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of phenomenon is a disease cursed by the devil. It always falls in the middle of the night, there is no trace, no way to predict, in a flash can make a healthy and strong It is difficult for young people to move and suffer. - A quarter of patients compare the pain of gout attacks to being pierced by a sword; one-fifth compares it to a bone break; one-third is like a charcoal fire, and the rest thinks this pain is fundamental Unable to describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brother Lorenzo de Medici also had the same dysentery - their father "gout" Piero de Medici gave the two sons the Medici-style high nose, The squatting jaw, narrow eyes and tough facial contours also write the eccentric disease that has entangled in his life into the heritage list; just as he gives honor, status, power, and money to the next generation of Medici At the same time, it is inevitable to put hostility, envy, resentment, and hatred together - although this is not his intention, but the world is always the case, who can do everything smoothly, satisfactory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second son of Medici breathed slightly, licking his teeth and waiting for another wave of pain in the past - he narrowed his eyes and looked up, St. Ma The red octagonal vault of the Cathedral of Leah del Flore is in sight. In order to expand the plaza, the ruling party made a resolution. The power of the tyrants who originally lived in this area was crowned with various charges in the blink of an eye. Their property Collected, houses and towers were forcibly demolished, and everyone, including vulnerable women, newborn babies and dying old people, were forced to humiliate in a few days to migrate to remote areas and even be exiled - the love of the Florentine people forever It is so extreme, not at the end of the scale, at the end of the scale - they never care about lifting a family, someone is high; never minding that he falls heavily and tramples into mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Christ is resurrected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resurrection really!" This announcement is obviously rushing With his own, Giuliano had to suppress the intolerance and temper caused by the pain, and replied with a glimpse of the canon. At the same time, he turned around as little as possible, preparing to kiss the nasty informant three times in accordance with the rules of Easter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glittering Francisco de Pach emerges from the shadow of the gallery, the eldest son of the Pach family, Giuliano In-laws, Bernardo Bendini is like a heel that follows his upper back. The two young people are wearing a gorgeous dress today, especially the young Pach, who is open with a silver-colored embossed brocade jacket embroidered with a gold-colored emblem, revealing a creamy white velvet tight-fitting blouse with a pearl and a neck hanging. The gemstone necklace, the pleated wide sleeves can be stuffed into another little Pach - fortunately today his shoulders, sleeves, and tights are not as exaggerated as the past - - Juliano remembers that when he saw the young Pach two days ago, the pleads (the shackles of the shackles) between his legs were embroidered with delicate patterns, set with gems and pearls. The filler makes it look like a baby head with a hat, not to mention the rest of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pach extended his arm to Giuliano, just like a real friend or brother, hugged him with joy and kissed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliano was amazed, but still barely responded with the same speed and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Medici and Paige have been in the face of the ruling and priests for ten times, they have sincerely repented of their sins and tried to express mutual forgiveness. And fraternity - even his sister Bianca was married to the Paige home as a collateral for a good promise, but as a dual enemy of politics and business for nearly a hundred years, the people of the Parchi family have never been in the United States. The ruling group under the control of the Dich family has obtained even a reputational seat, which makes them unable to obtain some benefits in any resolution in Florence, and may even be sacrificed; in return, the Pudge family has all the resolutions of the Medici. The most obstructive interference has recently taken away the financial management of Pope Sykes IV from the Medici family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe should remind Lorenzo to see what the Paige family has done recently, which is to catch the idiot in the 100-member group. The handle still bought an agent of a Medici family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pace’s gems and gold licked the second rib of Medici’s ribs, and Juliano suddenly remembered that he did not follow the usual routine in the coat today. Under the sleeveless chain armor, and did not carry any weapons, Lorenzo has personally reminded him of this problem more than once, but the insomnia and lack of spirit caused by gout and alcoholism from time to time always make him remember everything. may not. Giuliano hesitated and looked at the Medici Mansion, which had disappeared at the end of the street, and smashed the Giotto Bell Tower, which is close to it, next to the Cathedral of the Resurrection Sunday Mass, where he can be clear The land saw the monks crowded with the cross and the icon of the Virgin Mary pouring into the side entrance of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliano dispelled the idea of ​​going back, and he did not want to be reprimanded by his brother because he did not catch the first mass and the Eucharist. And Francisco's arm had already circumvented his neck, and Bernardo grabbed the other side of his arm intimately, and the two smiled and walked forward with great diligence and intimacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
