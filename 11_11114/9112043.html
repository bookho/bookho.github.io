Jushan never looked at him. In the tribe, the eldest son of Jushan is just a soldier, and it is no different from other frost giants. Jushan prefers his youngest son. Although the young Frost Giant can't hunt independently, he can always lie from his brother or steal the most fat piece of meat. If he changes him, Here, maybe he can understand what happened here, if not, then he at least knows how to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the eldest son of Jushan could not, he stood in the broken ice, watching the mountains of gold coins and jewels reveal their own under dazzling light. The true face - but some sporadic copper coins, shells and stones, if there are any precious things, then maybe it is a silver dragon that is getting out of the thick ice layer a little bit, from the head to the tip of the tail, it has The ten giants are so long that they are connected from head to toe. The scales around them are like a pointed shield. They are brighter than any kind of silver products that the frost giants have seen. The eyes are flashing. It’s like hiding a star or the sun – a frost giant throws an axe in panic, but the silver dragon only lifts the tip of the wing, and then the axe flies with its owner, and then it elegantly Bending the neck, biting a frost giant who ran to the feet of his feet, and when he mentioned the air, he threw him on a sharp icicle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?!" The gnome asked with a sharp voice like a child: "It is still alive!? - The bottomless abyss is down, you are not saying it." Has it been dead for a long time? Or is it... is the body moving?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible." The Elf Ranger looks at the silver dragon in awe. They have seen the black dragon in the snow cover swamp before, but the black dragon can be as strong, beautiful and full of deterrence without this silver dragon. "Silver dragons are the most abominable and undead in the dragons." For whatever reason, they are not willing to be resurrected after death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter what it is." The king is almost crazy, because after the silver dragon drives away the giants, it meets with Baldwin - Birdwin is a tall and mighty warrior in front of the giant, but in When he looked up, he was in front of a fifty-foot silver dragon. He was like a big doll. "Can it distinguish between the enemy and me? I mean... who can tell him that Baldwin is not his enemy!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows?" The gnome said: "We can also be the ones who want to take away its secrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the Golem." The woman of love only said that it might be the magic image of the owner of this island. Its body is black iron, the scales are secret silver, and the eyes are The flare may come from a rune with powerful power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said this, suddenly floated herself up and allowed herself to look at the silver dragon statue, the dragon’s golem moved uneasy It wants to leave, but the only woman who loves only raises one hand and puts it on the tip of its nose. This hand is like a silver-crown flower floating on a lake compared to the head of a magical figure. But if the Golem can speak, it will feel that this hand is as heavy as a rock mountain. It struggled to get rid of that human being, but at this time, the only daughter of love began to recite the spell, which is extremely strange to most of the creatures here, and it is only the Elf Ranger that can recognize them. Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich took this opportunity to cast a spell, the magic that played on Birdwin disappeared, he reverted to the original look, a Frost Giant thought he I found the opportunity, but when he rushed over, the arrow of the elf penetrated his head, and an arrow entered from his left eye and passed out from his hindbrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest son of Jushan also noticed that there are still dozens of frost giants around him. They lost so much to get here, but they only got a little bit. The gold and a few copper coins, the new leader noticed that several guys were thinking they were hiding their bags in a hidden way - they must want to steal their gold, the eldest son thought, no, he might give them Something else, such as this dragon that suddenly can't move - the frost giants can kill the dragon when they are on the rise. Although they are all younger or injured dragons, the eldest son of Jushan knows that he can't just return to the tribe. Otherwise he will be deprived of the position of the leader and killed and eaten. But when he was about to call the Frost Giant around him, he heard a rough and desperate cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t understand what else can make a frost giant call like an injured dog, but when he turns around, he can make no more noise than before. A frost giant is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw his father, he stoned him down the ice cliff, and ordered the priest's vulture to swallow his eyes and internal organs. No one, even the Frost Giant can survive in this situation, but He did see the giant mountain, the stronger and dangerous former leader than him, and the black flames in the eyes of the black holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also saw other people, they were all killed and abandoned by him. The eldest son of Jushan was long and mourned without a tone. He Going back, almost knocked over the frost giant carrying the priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest suffered a little injury in the chaos just now, but he is a priest and will not be abandoned because of the general frost giant, he makes a frost The giant bears him, but as we have seen before, the priest's physique is not inferior to any frost giant, and the frost giant who bears him is very stubborn, but he fears the priest's poisonous insects and curses, so when the eldest son of the giant mountain When he slammed back, he almost fell to the ground with the priest. The priest’s experience with the enemy was not less than that of the giant mountain. After the initial horror, he suddenly understood what happened to the giant mountain. The anger suddenly swept his thoughts. “This is awkward,” he cried. This is awkward, the soul of each Frost Giant should belong to the great Kaussian." He even wanted to pray for a magical spell to lift the spell on the giant mountain, but the priest had just lifted the blackened crutches. The ground under their feet cracked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only girl who loves to control this statue, she can feel that what she needs is already close to her, probably, the most critical place On this glorious and terrible golem, it guards the secrets - in the form of silver dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the gods is revealed in front of everyone like the light of the daughter of love, wanting to erase the mark left by the silver dragon, let This demon statue is a very difficult thing for her now. The power is passing fast. She even feels that she is as weak as a human being, and the curse is no longer as firm as before. It's loud, but as long as you stick to it, even if it's just a few breaths of time - the resistance of the Golem is becoming slow and soft, she only needs a final blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, a spell hit her, and the only girl who loves even has a chance to cast a spell. Huge power was thrown to the top of the dome, and the power of the impact caused the human body to immediately fall into pain and drowsiness. Only the daughter of love was unwilling to call, but her only strength could only guarantee her existing body. It will not be irreparably damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, obviously," Birdwin said. "It's very angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The geek of the silver dragon after getting rid of the control of the daughter of love Like a real, irritated dragon, it begins to wreak havoc everything that it can see. Although it is just a demon statue, it can spit out flames and acid. The color of the flame is not golden red, but bright. White or blue-white, the flame temperature is higher than that cast by the caster, and the acid flows on the ice, giving off suffocating heat—there is an ominous snoring at the foot of the frost giant. Watching the feet in shock, until they saw the crack, they ran around, but the ramp had been blocked by broken ice. Then they climbed up to the ice wall, but the silver dragon's golem began to frantically hit everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think it looks as imaginative... peace..." Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Kerry has similar questions. Silver Dragon is extremely disgusted with the undead. When he sees the Golem, he inevitably thinks The soul that must be made in the process of making a magic, but it may also be a monster or a dragon. Although it is somewhat far-fetched, it is not so impossible to explain - but some things he sees now are more difficult to explain. After all, Yinlong Never spit out the flame and acid. He really doubts whether the creation of this statue is really a good dragon, and whether the real master of the island is indeed the silver dragon they are doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Opened..." The black-haired caster said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Kerry asked. In addition to the only daughter of love and Gülen, the adventurers live behind a few icicles. When the Golem is still killing the frost giants, they get a little breathing time. This time is not very long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The door." Once the undead said that he had seen the giant mountain, even if he did not see it, he could smell the unique cold negative energy. The smell, the usual technique of the Red Warlock, he said in his heart, a group of free-spirited soldiers, plus a gray robe that is good at waste utilization, the former can not only be used twice, but if the battle is not so intense, it can be Fill it up as part of the reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without the excessive explanation of the caster, Kerry Ben and others can also see the "door". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a whirlpool!" Leona bit her teeth and said, "In the deep sea under the ice."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The things that the eyes see are not necessarily true." The daughter of love finally did a good thing, and her power might have misunderstood this small lock, thus opening a channel, black hair casters and elves. The Ranger glanced at him, the caster took the lead and jumped, the elf followed, and Baldwin kissed Liona's lips lightly - he was the third, and Leona was the fourth, tight The gnome holding the icicle did not wait for his chance to make a decision. The vortex suddenly floated up, and all the life and objects in the illusion were swallowed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire illusion seems to have restored the original calm, leaving only the vortex that continues to rotate without stopping, and finally the center of the vortex is a round The blisters, the blisters broke out and made a "squeaky" sound, just like something was awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomish McGee smoked his nose and woke up come. He lay on the ground, tired and did not want to move, the ground was a bit cold, but still very dry, and after a while, his stomach screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKe opened his eyes, his eyes were dark and there was no light. Gnomes can see things in the dark like elves, but the darkness still has light, but it is very weak, to what extent, the human body will shine, you know? But here, in this unnatural environment, the gnome can't even see his fingers. He fumbled for a piece of meat from his bag and put it in his mouth. Then he took out a pin. He I remember that this pin was inlaid with a small fluorspar, but he still couldn't see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome thought his eyes were smashed, he cried and slammed, maybe the dwarf would not cry at this time, but now, except him, everyone No, no one will think that he is not like a dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mckey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a sudden sound caused the gnome to jump up, such as In a literal sense, he jumped up and down, and his buttocks and hard grounds slammed together and hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry Ben?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
