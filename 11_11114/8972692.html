			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 139th chapter of the team (7)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the jewellery guild is the smallest The son, who was extremely honored to be an apprentice of a guild member, was receiving his training and heard that he still had considerable talents. His father and mother didn't want to know what kind of talent they had – in their plan, their youngest son wanted to be a pastor of Rosada, for which they had already offered to the sanctuary of Rosada. A scorpion ruby, a scorpion opal, a scorpion sun stone, if there is no thief guild's intervention, this year's child who just turned 10 years old would have to enter the sanctuary of Rosada, put on a white robe, morning light God offers his youth and loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, how can his father make him a thief who is despised and contempted, and more likely to be sent to the execution desk at any time, he raises A ransom, wanting to redeem his son, he had worried that the thieves’ guild would extort him endlessly, as they did to others; but no, they were terrified to reject the gold coin because of his The son was taken by a high-level guild member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your son is a double skill." The thief who asked for five hundred gold coins to confide a little bit of news told him: "Double "Hands," he added: "I understand? His two hands are as flexible." He threw six gold coins into the air, letting them sway in the air, then closed their eyes and extended their hands, easily Put each gold coin into your fingertips and show it to the businessman: "At that time, I spent three months practicing to do this, and your son only needs three days, so he is taken care of by adults. "This is a good thing." He looked at the businessman and his wife with such gloomy eyes, pulling his lips like a wild dog and smiling. "We are very caring for ourselves." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said, the guild can be said to be very tolerant, the businessman even saw his son, but what made him desperate was that his son also thought A thief is more interesting than a priest who is a Rosada. More exciting, he only stayed under the wings of the guild for ten days. The dressing party is not much different from the thieves. He is still flipping a silver coin when he sees his father. You are welcome. Snatched his father's purse. Turning to his mother's crying: "I will make you proud," he said. "My name will be sung by the bard. Everyone will tremble when I think of me at night," he looked at him impatiently. A glance at the mother. Stretching out the thumb wiped her tears: "I don't have to wait a long time, I will come back." He promised, and then he walked into the dark martyrdom without returning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman didn't know what to do, he had an eldest son, but he was weak, and according to his wife, he was obsessed with a Fro priest, almost all the time spent on her, and he and him The wife still has no children, when it comes to this. The thin and pale woman looks older than her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guild leader who bought and sold the Baita 40% drink, he has no wife and no children, but it does not mean that he has no trouble. No matter the thief would walk into his warehouse and take a bottle of wine at random, just as they did it from the pub and the hotel, and the guild also opened a list asking him to supply them with wine and honey on the list. There are many precious honey wines, rotten sweet wines, winter wines, and of course. The above goods can't be exchanged for even one copper coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His warehouse is empty like a flour bucket that has been attacked by rats, and those people are still asking him and threatening him if he can’t get them If you want the wine, mix his blood in the wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are one by one. I eagerly talked to An Zhen about all kinds of sufferings and diarrhea. The white tower and the famous owner of the hills listened carefully, squinting their brows, worrying, and slamming the arm of the chair angrily when they heard a serious crime. The men described their wife. Women’s mourning and fear. Her heart was stunned and her eyes were reddish, and she used a silky pad to wipe the meager tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half of her heart is true, the blood of the elf makes her instinctively hate evil and pity the weak; but the other half of human blood is better than the blood of the elf Thick and tough, hidden behind a layer of tulle, the real face is full of pleasure and joy, and the eyes are filled with the coldness and savvy inherited from her human father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people standing in front of her can be said to be guilty, and Anzhen said to the half of the good blood - they never supported the ampoule, even if they Swear to his lord to do all the power to make the young daughter of the latter the true master of the White Tower and the Hill, but as the people they fear are covered in mud, their vows are also wide with him. The swords were buried together in the darkness of the ground. They first succumbed to the grief of the sorrow, and they swindled and persuaded her to sign the monopoly certificate of several goods, and stolen the freedoms signed by hundreds of old lords before their death. Certificate - This can sell ten gold coins in the White Tower and the Hill; they are surrounded by Anzhen, all day and night, and they offer a compliment to the aunt without cost - but in Anzhen After getting rid of the grief and continuously denying several documents that would never be signed when they were awake, their dissatisfaction broke out. In a blink of an eye, these three people secretly contacted the former governor of Baita and offered him gold coins and loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the former governor was a stubborn old man. He was not willing to take away the position he had given up. He disappointed the leader of the guild, so they chose the ambitious Demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How ridiculous, they are suffering from the present situation, but this situation is created by their own efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the former garrison captain of Baita, he is not a bad person, so when he notices that a thief guild is invisible in his jurisdiction, he goes After tracing and deepening, he became another sacrifice of the "fine net" following the former governor - he did not like the ampoule, but the reason is very simple, like his master, he is a supporter of the eldest son inheritance law, He never felt that a woman could manage a city, a region, and he would frown when he saw An Zhen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the current garrison captain, he is an admirer of Anzhen, so when Anzhen asked him to come, he did not hesitate to agree - He did not pretend to be a woman, but broke his arm in a dangerous action. This reason is enough for him to calmly step into the alabaster gate of the sanctuary. The new Frocher is wonderful, the problem is their Therapies are only suitable for themselves. They can make scars or wrinkles disappear, and the skin is white and shiny, allowing the bald to grow back. There is no way to get an arm that is folded into a curved shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahn’s sight gently swept through the still-talking businessman, her admirer, who fell on the followers of Rosada, without the god of morning light Believers will be happy to live next to a group of evil thieves. They are solid without doubt - especially if they learn that Demon is likely to kill his father, especially after the two brothers who have framed and murdered him got the position of the consul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to get rid of yourself from this matter, but after all, Anzhen still believes that he is also an innocent, deceived victim— - She accepted the test calmly, and it is. She did not know before that the death of the former governor and his eldest son was related to Demon, although she doubted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Master, he is the first to believe in An Zhen, An Zhen is the little girl he grew up watching, although she is sometimes very stubborn, and slightly A bit stupid, but in the eyes of the old wizard, she is a good boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the new Guard Captain interrupted the words of the three guild leaders, or two current guild leaders and a former guild leader . The position of the leader of the silk guild was long taken away by a businessman who was closely associated with the "fine net". "Our time is very precious," said the garrison captain. "The current white tower is in addition to the sanctuary of Rosada. Every place is covered with the eyes, nose and ears of the fine guild. The lord and I can't be here. Stay too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s sad," the leader of the jewellery guild whispered: "You are still the Guard Captain of the White Tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the high of Antonio Master The tower," said the leader of the wine guild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not very peaceful there," said Master Antonio, his eyebrows anxiously close together: "An apprentice wants to steal my staff and scrolls. There is also a shortage of experimental materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think we already know how bad the situation is outside." Rosada’s new chief pastor said that he is the palm. The best chosen by the pastor, powerful and devout. In any case, he must re-establish the glory of Rosada in the White Tower in a short time, whether it is alabaster or in people's minds, but he did not expect Demon to be crazy to condone a thief. The guild does what it wants in its own city – and at the same time he has some ecstasy that he has not noticed. This is a huge obstacle and danger. It is also a rare opportunity. If he can expel these thieves and let the White Tower’s governor restore his sense, there is no doubt that Rosada’s holy name will once again be in the White Tower. Be praised. Being circulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we need a way to solve this problem, instead of complaining endlessly here." An Zhen worried about his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't move," said the garrison captain: "We are being watched and restricted - Demon is the White Tower's governor, he does not allow us Any action, even if it is to annihilate the goblin, also send a document to sign him, otherwise we will be treated as sinners trying to murder the lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's my fault," An Zhen said tiredly. "I shouldn't put too much authority in his hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can't Blame you." The garrison captain said: "Nobody can think of it - when Demon was a mage apprentice, I also escorted him to the Baita caravan. He is a bit gloomy, but not particularly difficult to approach, but also Others lend a helping hand, we still... that... oh, in short, he has become like this, I am afraid that his father will not recognize him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't find the former governor on the mourning wilderness," said Master Antonio. "Otherwise, I really want to blame him. How is he?" ? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp infertility and teach Demon it "<br <br /> & nbsp />;“It’s a personal problem,” the leader of the jewellery guild interjected. “It’s like a mushroom in a beautiful mushroom that contains a poison, and his soul is bad.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we not deprive him of his power and imprison him?" The former leader of the silk guild said - if possible, he would prefer to die or be exiled, but he knows that Demon is still The husband of the lord, the father of the next heir: "The White Tower and the Hill are originally yours," he said, looking at An Zhen. "You have the right to do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Fine net." An Zhen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two words made the room quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never heard of such a guild before," said the garrison captain: "so secret, so powerful, so evil, it is like never "The bottom of the abyss came out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They won't allow us to do this," said Master Antonio. "We must hit the middle or they May kill the ampoule first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you transfer her first?" said the garrison captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said Master Antonio. "But I can't transfer the entire white tower." The garrison captain was silent, and they scolded Germany before. Meng, failed to eradicate this stubborn cancer in the first place, but let it grow until it is deep-rooted, you can uproot it, but that may ruin the entire white tower - or, they have done it now Not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do they do that?" one of the merchants asked with fear, since they had their family in the White Tower, they could not imagine leaving here. What is the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone gave me an idea," said An Zhen. "Maybe you are willing to listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Little Devil Asmodeos, Demon thought that he completely controlled this servant from the bottomless abyss, unwillingness, arrogance and arrogance - An Zhen knows a lot about this, not Every wizard can get a little devil to be a magical pet, but as far as she can see, Asmodeos did not boast like Demon in front of her, and was pulled out of all the claws. With the fangs - it still knows where Demon is. It knows when and where he is doing things. It will disappear in front of her for a while, giving her the message, secrets and evidence. I have never found it once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
