Unless they want to sleep completely, no, since you know that there is a Necromancer, you may not even be able to get the last sleep... Maybe someone would think that Gülen has an advantage in this matter, but Gülen I am not sure if my own specificity is discovered, I will not be placed in a glass jar to become the most proud collection and guinea of ​​gray robes. It is said that many gray robes are for deep and long-lasting pursuit of magic. The mystery and the truth became the Master of the Necromancer. He did not want to know whether the "Black Lev" was a special one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "people" that Bydwin said are tall, and even if they have no flesh, they can still see the original Strong and fierce, each scorpion is covered with leather armor, or chain armor. These rot and rusted armor are unexpectedly new and complete, and their weapons reflect the blue flame in the hollow of the hollow. The twinkling light of the heart is chilling - Perant put his hands on the ground, chanting the curse, the stone floor and the wall of the mausoleum creaking, the vines are drilled out of the slate, they are in Drew Iraq’s command twisted and thrived, not only in the gap between them and their strong vitality, but also to the feet that only left the bones of the forest, trying to pull the soldiers who should have rested. - It is a pity that these embarrassments are not only more sturdy than the adventurers of the previous adventurers, but also more agile. They even know that the companions who hold the wide sword will go ahead and cut the unknown vines. Open, and those who hold the flail and the round hammer summoned the shackles of a group of rats in a way that humans could not recognize. The cockroaches of the house rat had already rotted, but like human cockroaches, they still have the ability to bite. The ability to break everything, the plague on the teeth that can cause any life to suffer from diseases, only a moment, the vines wrapped around Lev's ancestors will helplessly retreat and back down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The vitality here is too weak," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich shakes his head, which is of course a place where a powerful Necromancer can live, perhaps some people will be thriving Grass and the house mouse are confused, but for a lich, this can only be said to be a trick to mock the layman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the anti-theft chapter, updated around 10 am tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the Lev family is all here," Birdwin muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can't be people," said Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves only feel that they have been fighting the undead, or the magical thing for a hundred years, he feels extremely exhausted, even if there are elves Potion, he also felt that he would turn into a pile of deep red sand with the wind at any time - but even if the Druid did not make the decision to pursue the last one, they could not lie down and rest in peace.
