The face may be a magical instrument that is used by the dwarves. The girl who loves begins to fall asleep as the carriage slowly moves forward. She is as sleepy as a baby, which confirms the cast from another aspect. In the judgment of the person, Leona leaned on the other side, with a snow bear fur on her leg, and playing cards with Birdwin Glan. The elf saw that Gülen had cheated twice in three times. Oona’s gold coins creaked in his bag, but what about it, Leona didn’t care, and Gülen didn’t care – if it allowed the thief to relax the heartstrings of sadness and hatred, Perant didn’t care. However, the folding astrolabe that Kremar took out caught his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this Yi Erzhen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world nodded, star The plate was well maintained, even if it was not in the sun, but in the fluorite, the warm glow that it radiated was still like amber. Later, there was a lot of chess pieces, and Kerry was sitting on the gram. Opposite Rimal, he is keenly aware that the young half-elves are inexplicably stunned, but this situation is not only common in humans but also in elves. All they need is a conversation, a Comfort and a little enlightenment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Simple chess seems to be lacking in fun." Kerry suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair caster who is taking out the Rose Compass has paused, "How do we play?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Just take the stakes as a bet," Kerry said. "Who can pick up more than five pieces at a time, who can ask a question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems very interesting." Druid smiled. "You can ask what happened when Kerry was drinking for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" said Kerry, screaming, obviously it was not something to be proud of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I have a question I want to ask Kerry, the soul of the opposite world said to the Lich, help me, I owe you once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You have owed me enough, the Lich said sarcastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?" Kerry asked. One side will open the chart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fish," said the soul of the opposite world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I am a bird," said Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien and Kerry Ben will simultaneously reach into the dark layer of many pieces, each throwing a round piece, the Elf Ranger rotates the piece But before looking at it with his eyes, he used his fingertips to figure out the pattern on the piece: "Bird." He smiled smugly. "What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Bird." The soul of the alien world said: "It seems that you are going first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry's finger put the finger on the compass On the top, the brass pointer swung up quickly, and when it stopped slowly, the elf put a pawn in the direction it specified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took turns to take dozens of steps, and the pieces only occupied less than one tenth of the board, but they have not been given instructions by the lich. The soul of the opposite world has already proposed six pieces at a time. He took the lead and won, but Kerry seems to have no unhappy look. On the contrary, he just can't wait to click on the star: "Very good, my friend," he said: "You won. What do you want to ask? Can you ask me what happened when I was drinking for the second time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This is a black whistle, the sorcerer said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world looks up, he looks at the eyes of Kerry Ben, under the pink fluorite light, the color of the eyes that are like the blue water Deepening, it looks like a coniferous forest in winter, it is a kind of deep and rich dark green, this color can not only make people feel the joy of being alone, but also inevitably fear the deep The harshness of winter, "I want to ask Fenway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry's smile involuntarily brought a bitterness. "Why did you suddenly think of him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I watched him go to death," the soul of the other world Even if you don't close your eyes, you can recall that time - exactly, Fenway is the first person who is really full of killing and revenge after he came to this plane... Maybe Fenway doesn't think so After discovering that Fenway was the chief culprit of the disaster, the soul of the outside world did not think so. The moment when Ilva’s head rolled off his shoulder was his eternal nightmare, and he whispered to his death. Fenway informed that Irving’s death was often interspersed with him—he was not jealous. He could stand in front of the wall of the god of death, Clauwo, a thousand times, ten thousand times, telling Fenway 100 million times. How stupidity and greed killed the elf who loved him and his favorite: "His sin is unforgivable, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Kerry has raised his eyebrows, and he doesn’t understand why Kreima would ask him today. Question, what affected him? Perhaps the priest of the dwarf should be treated again for him. He can almost see that the evil forces belonging to Medusa are pushing the black hair's caster into an emotional dilemma. Iil, who is dead is not someone else, it is Kremar, but to be exact, if the person standing in front of Fenway is not Kremar but he is, he will do the same - regardless of Fen Where will the soul of Wei go? If he is not completely swallowed up by the fire of negative energy - the wall of the city of lament, the cage of the devil, or the storm crushed on the plain of mourning, he should know that he What a beautiful and precious thing was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, is Kreima feel guilty? Kerry thought, but it was absolutely unnecessary. Everything he did was correct. The spirit of the Elf Ranger couldn't help but soften it, even though he had been warned not to interfere too much with the life of Cremal. But he never felt that the whole young half-elf was burdened with a heavy burden because of its pure goodness. It is a development trend worth encouraging. He better understands that he has never missed it, especially in the face of crime and When evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Kerry said categorically: "Fenway’s sins are inevitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Because he trades with the devil," the soul of the alien world muttered: "But he may have been misled or deceived. It is also possible that he could not help himself from the beginning..."<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "the fact is better than all the eloquent," elf Ranger said:. "he almost destroyed the entire gray ridge" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp ;&nbsp;"So," asked the soul of the alien world, "If it was before this, nothing happened - when he had not hurt anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You have never seen a devil or a demon," said the elf. "He was wrong at first, like a parchment stained with ink. No, it is worse than that, because the filth is any magic or The knife could not be cleaned.” The elf tweeted the pointer on the compass. “His crash is his final and the most deserved ending.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I thought that sin can be redeemed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So how do you think he can redeem his sins against Ilfa?" Ruiben said sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world did not answer, but put down another flag: "So you think he is compared to a lich..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Kerry book thought back, as if they had only recently encountered a lich, or a lich's failure. "I can't answer this question," He said: "The two cannot be compared at all. The lich is evil in evil. If Fenway is just a worm crawling under the claws of the devil, then the lich is the embodiment of the bottomless abyss. You don't have eyes. See how Lev is prepared for those sacrifices, but I can tell you that to be a lich, in addition to the wealth that allows a dragon to tremble, all that is needed is countless life and Soul," he looked at Kremar slightly with blame: "You should have deeper experience than any of us, your mentor, his wife and unborn children, their death and misfortune are Brought by an evil lich." Maybe it feels too harsh, The Ranger slowed down again: "Remember what I said at the Bituminburg? You can be a good person, but remember that your kindness should be delivered to those worthy of your blessings. And tolerant people - if there is anything in this plane that can never be forgiven, except for the undead creatures and their enemies, there are probably devils and demons... Kremar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry," said the black-haired caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is a little bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...understand what you mean, but I...I just want to get an answer." Kreima whispered. And I have got it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... The silence at this time is simply unbearable, and Kerry has felt that he has done something wrong, but he can't find the problem anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...then..." The elf who finally decided to end the whole topic bowed his head and hurriedly glanced at the chart: "It seems that it is my turn to ask questions." He lightly proposed five pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately waited for a while until the eyes of the caster who saw the black hair finally had a look of doubt: "The piece you carved on What kind of bird is it?" He looked at the piece, "like a white-feathered bird without legs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ah." The soul of the opposite world said : "qq employees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This name sounds like a nickname, not a formal scientific name, the elf shows a skeptical look, "Is it special? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it can be used for communication," said the soul of the alien world: "But it will chase you for anything... If you don’t need it for a while Missing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really incredible." Perant said: "I have never seen such a bird."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are in another plane, the soul of the opposite world says. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s a bit regrettable, the Lich said, the answer we got was not optimistic, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty dwarves accompany the carriage, along the Longdong Tunnel in the black hole, all the way The song is sung. The problem is that although the Longwei Tunnel is one of the fastest roads through the Longji Mountains, it still needs to take a carriage of twelve ponies for a whole day, but it is always more than a long ridge. The mountains are 30 days or longer, and there are no blizzards and hurricanes in the tunnels. The only rock monsters worthy of vigilance, the cavemen and Medusa have also been driven and killed. Nothing has happened in the entire journey. misfortune. When the people in the carriage finally got out of the carriage, they were surprised to find that the Longji Mountains covered with white snow had been left behind by them. Leona noticed the rear of the carriage, no roads and no flats, only Steep mountain walls, I don't know where they came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have been here." A dwarf said, "We are going back, friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the carriage?" Birdwin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The carriage and the pony are gifts," the dwarf said. "Thank you for driving us away."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Perant said. "This is exactly what we need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf gave him an eye," May the starlight shine on your way." He said in the favorite farewells of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the flames in your furnace will last forever." Perant said, then he turned and the dwarves did not hide from him. The secret of the tail tunnel, but if he watches them leave, then the secret may no longer be a secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan patted the pony and then first opened the carriage's trunk: "Wait," he shouted. "Did the dwarves go?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Perant said: "Is there any problem with the carriage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The carriage should be fine," the thief stared at the "thing" in the trunk: "The problem is this." He reached out and grabbed the gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome is curled up in the hands of a thief like a frightened mole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you are here!?" Leona asked: "Don't you wait for the dwarf to go back to the Long Fire Island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I...I..." The gnome stuttered: "I think...I am still...and, and, with you." ... than, better..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone threatens you?" Perant asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, hey, yes, yes, someone threatens me." The gnome said that a pair of blind eyes turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is lying," the thief said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
