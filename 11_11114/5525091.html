			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire was extinguished at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not as cold as the rain in the port of Hong Kong, but it is more violent and vigorous than it is, and the entire hill is firmly held by it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenaries were huddled in a sheepskin tent, the youngest of them fascinated to look at a malt-yellow rabbit skull, which The scent of ginger and salt and the heat of the broth, the incisors and the upper and lower jaws form a bird-like bite incision, the lower incisors are flat, appearing two layers, and the upper front teeth are pointed and long, he reaches out and touches, then A dirty curse was heard and his fingers were cut open for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should go out and see." The old mercenary said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rain is so big," the young mercenary smothered his fingers and confusely complained: "Will someone run to steal the horse?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomes will," said the old mercenary. "They will appear under any circumstances, and they will steal the horse. They can also dig up the stomach and eat the internal organs." "He stood up and pulled the hood of the leather cloak up. The young mercenary looked down at the water that continually slid down from their boots. "I don't think it is necessary," he argued. "We only take it." So little money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged mercenary sitting next to him shook his head: "I am going with you, one-eyed." He called the old mercenary The nickname, while the other mercenary was always snoring in the process. They are all low-cost, scattered mercenaries. There are no fixed groups. Of course, there are no strict classes. Generally speaking, strong or experienced mercenaries will become temporary leaders, but you can not eat them at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world outside the tent is so dark that everything that can be touched is soaked, as if they have been sent to the bottom of the river by some kind of spell, one eye from the arms Take out a silver-white, small-necked stick, rubbing hard on the big nails that hold the tent. When a large group of golden red flames swelled, his companion was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-eyed swaying the stick, the flames become smaller and brighter, "Reassured," he said to the middle-aged mercenary: "This flame can't burn." Tent, but it will not go out in the rain."|<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just a small light source, they followed it through other people's tents, the horses of the hauling were concentrated, and together with humans were protected in a defensive circle of four-wheeled caravans, but the dwarf goblins were able to Drilling in from the bottom of the caravan, they can see things in the dark, the claws are like daggers, and they move like a big mouse, and when people hear the painful hum of the horses, the horse’s belly They have long been hollowed out, so in order to avoid the horses being victimized, people will remove the baffle on the inside of the caravan during the camping and fix it on the outward side of the wheel as protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what this one is going to check. He grabbed the ropes on the car, trying not to let himself fall on the slippery ground, and it will be a small flame. When he reached the bottom of the carriage, he hoped that he had not found anything. Unfortunately, he saw a hole when he checked the fourth car. The raft was still fresh, only a little bigger than his fist. Even a goblin cub can't climb in along with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, there is something coming in, but I haven’t heard the roar of the horses, and there may be room for recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You continue to check these boards," said one eye to his companion: "I am going to Hummer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The merchant's horses are all of a variety, with thick, thick shoulders and mottled Moorish horses. They are characterized by silky hairs growing from knees to ankles. They are so thick, even if they are thick, even if they are thick, Being wet by the rain and clinging to the hoof also brought a lot of trouble to the one-eyed - he couldn't see anything between the hoof and the hoof, so he moved the light up, illuminating the drooping belly of the Hummer, the rain Washing the eyes of the horses, bending their long black eyelashes, the horseshoe moved slightly because of the abrupt light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one mare is still motionless, it gasps, tired and squatting in the rain, the hoof curls under the body, and the belly bulges a strange shape. Black markings, mercenaries move closer to the light - it is not a marking, it is a layer of film wrapped, the internal organs that are about to fall out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is the first to arrive, more accurately It is his arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in such a torrential rain, his arrows still run through the eyes of the monster, and the one-eyed old mercenary is struggling to stand up. The little stick ignited a white flame in the rain. His face was torn off with a large piece of flesh, almost hurting the only intact eye. The rain washed away the blood. Through the hole, he could see him being jagged. the teeth of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a goblin?!" The middle-aged mercenary asked uneasily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Kerry tweeted the little body with his toes: "It’s a rabbit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and listened intently, the rain covered almost everything, except that it was the sound of a rabbit, the threat of awkwardness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of rabbits." Kremar said that he climbed the car in agilely, standing on its tarpaulin hoop and looking around, black and heavy. The rain is shining with countless red dots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kerry Ben arrived at his side, he found that he had entered the state of ecstasy required for casting. He had wanted to stop Kremar, but his talent. The experience accumulated with years of adventurous life tells him that the caster's behavior is correct - a tiny electric spark is emanating from Kremar's fingertips, and in a flash is interwoven into a conical net in the air. It fell to the dark ground, and the rabbit jumped like a fish, making a scream like the human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electric light illuminates the faces of merchants and mercenaries. They still don’t understand what it is all about, one-eyed gestures to middle-aged mercenaries, rabbits The saliva seems to have an anesthetic effect. He doesn't feel the pain. Fortunately, no one in the rain can comfortably lie down and sleep. They are awake and well-dressed, not the rabbits who were not drilled into the camp. But it is not fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only tricky thing is the young mercenary, who was bitten by the calf and the rabbit's teeth deeply embedded in his muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to leave here!" The middle-aged mercenary shouted instead of one-eyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without him, the merchants have begun to unravel the reins of the horse, a businessman screaming suddenly and screaming, his feet caught in a time when he did not know In the soft cave, when the person next to him pulled him out, he had lost one foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Forte said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rabbit spurted out from the cave, covering the businessman who had no feet, and two people trying to help him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry Ben jumped onto a caravan and waved a machete to break the rope holding the dye jar. The clay pot was pushed down by him and thrown out of the car, smashing and smashing, and even standing on the top of the caravan. All smelled the smell of oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fut painfully grabbed the placket on his chest, his dye, a rare coral from the southern sea, after they were ground The most beautiful and pure scarlet is presented, but the dye needs to be dissolved in the whale oil to ensure that it is not degraded - the most expensive of all goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was looking at Crimall, and the caster nodded to him and gestured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flame accurately hit the cracked can, the broken jar burned together with the caravan, and Kremar joined the wind in a timely manner. The raging flame pushed outwards, forcing the rabbits to retreat. The rabbits couldn’t be involved in the fire in the fire, and their companions who could not escape gave another kind of screaming—the flames were full of fur. The smell of stinky and meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is now," Kerry Ben said loudly: "Run!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Rimal shredded a scroll of flying. At first he thought that someone would be in love with his goods and would not go, but he really underestimated the merchants who walked around this dangerous continent. They ran. Almost faster than a rabbit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s just “almost”, the tide of the rabbit can be said to be rubbing the heel of the human being, and the last one is not fat, but the one. A mad young mercenary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar is the last to leave the camp, he is preparing to help the mercenary, but he saw that he pulled out the dagger and cut the fat man Legs. Foght screamed and fell to the ground, blocking his face with his arm. Kremar lowered his height, took his hands, and lifted him up in time—his boots and cloak were full of jumps. rabbit. The mercenary, who was dragging his legs and running hard, looked angrily at Foght's head and flew over everyone's head. The old mercenary turned his head at this time and made a throwing gesture to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of a young mercenary in a small bone, he was only delayed for a time when the heartbeat was not, and the rabbits rushed in a shorter time. His body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed eye has never stopped. He raised his eyes and observed the caster flying in front of everyone. When the dark-haired mage was suspended in the air but did not leave immediately, he guessed that this white robe was also very white. The young people with the taste of the robe will definitely watch them all leave, maybe they will help one or two of them, he guessed it, and the newcomer of the donkey did not expect this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry's direction to humans leads to the metasequoia forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf is as sensitive and light as a slender squirrel, climbing a cedar tree about 50 feet, followed by humans, hands squatting The attacker of Forte couldn't wait to throw him on one of the thickest branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rabbits rushed under the tree and looked up with their heads up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Too shame! That's just a rabbit! Once the undead have snarled in anger, even if they eat meat, it has only one level of monsters in your game! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Compared with the game, the soul of the outside world is out of breath, or you should look at our horror movie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-No matter what I should look at, what you need now is to hurry down and look at it, the Lich said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage bowed his head and immediately widened his eyes: "I bought a watch last year!" He swears unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white rabbits gathered under the tree, and the sound of screaming was endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are in the banyan tree." The elf said that he was standing at the highest place, and the diameter of the branches under his feet would never exceed the wrist of a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you so much," the merchant said. "We didn't find this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "We have to change a tree," shouted one-eyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then try it!" The mercenary who had been sleeping in the tent before shouted with a louder voice, the person climbing the tree I am willing to take these two people together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
