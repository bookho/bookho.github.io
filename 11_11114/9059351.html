It is not known why this strange name is called. The most common saying is that they originate from dwarves, and dwarves always load ore and cargo. In a wooden box that is smaller than the ordinary wooden box, this box that looks a bit like a square is more suitable for their height of four to four feet and a half, and they never say that this is a small box, they only say that it is a short box over time. Occasionally, people use short boxes to suggest that there is a dwarf. The dwarf's beard style is also called short box Hu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnomes are less reserved for beards, or unwilling and unwilling, the hair on them is light and sparse except for hair, some places even It’s just like a child, just like a child. If a gnome unfortunately grows a few unsightly hairs, he will immediately find a small scorpion to pull them out, so as not to be laughed at by other gnomes. It is like a dwarf. The relationship between the dwarf and the dwarf is not good. The dwarf is mostly tempered, temperament. Rude, they don't like elves, because elves often ignore them (but maybe because the dwarves are too "short"). Elfs don't like dwarves, because the dwarf who treats bathing as a punishment is really stinking, but you You can still see the elves and dwarves walking side by side in an adventure squad, or seeing dwarves and elves trade ore and snow honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you will never see a dwarf sitting on a table with a dwarf, they will even avoid appearing in a pub and a street at the same time, they The attitude of each other can be said that the other party is a pile of unspeakable feces for them. Even the enemy is an unbearable thing. The experienced mercenaries and knights know that if you want to enter one In the dwarf's blacksmith shop, look for a satisfactory dagger. It is best to check all the equipment in the hotel room before you leave. If there is something made by the gnome, you should immediately put it in the room and never carry it with you. If one or two of them are uncertain, the dwarf's gaze is far more sharp than that described in any poem written by a bard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relatively, if you want to meet a gnome. It is best not to bring anything related to the dwarf. If he is like a dwarf, it will be good if he thunders you out. More often he will sell your detailed information to anyone who is willing to be against you. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar also passed the examination of Kerry and the Lich, lest there should be something that should not have touched the little heart of the gnomes. There are many evil people in the gnomes, and their craftsmanship is really ingenious. Even Kerry has no guarantee that he can see every hidden danger they left. Krymall’s equipment is basically out of gray. Ling, the hand of the elf. Only the buckle of the Dimensional Bag was replaced. This Dimensional Bag was given by Master Alva. The buckle was attached with magic to avoid loss and theft, but this Mithril buckle was given by a dwarf friend of Alva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now they see a dwarf gnome standing in the dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason they know that this height is only about three-fifths of the small people of Kremar is not a dwarf, but a dwarf, or because his skin is too white However, although he is like a milk mixed with chocolate, he looks far worse than the dwarf's lava-like rough, dark black skin. There is the most eye-catching beard. They are thick and curly, and they are braided like a dwarf, but as long as they are observed, they will be found to have no life. Gloss and color are all given by oil and pigment; except for the fact that there are no wrinkles on his face, it is one of the failures. Wrinkles are also one of the characteristics of dwarves. When the dwarf's cubs are over ten years old, they will accumulate layers of wrinkles on their faces. The faces of the gnomes are always smooth as if they were polished by porous stones. His hands and feet, the hands and feet of the dwarves are like square stones, and the gnomes' hands and feet are intricately carved from ivory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did his best to dress himself up on the dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Crimmar asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"McKe." The gnome of the East Crown lord replied. "Respected Lord of the Side Island, he is a gnome, not a dwarf. He just wants to dress himself up... that way..." He sighed long and his little fingers were together. "We don't know what to do. He did it a long time ago. Maybe he is a little crazy, but he has good craftsmanship and mind." He turned to McGee: "Mckey, take your work to you." Look?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mckey blinked slowly, his lips squirming behind the beard, and Kremar failed to read him. What are you talking about? Maybe it was just a meaningless short word. He raised his thumb and wiped it on his beard. He pulled a cockroach out of the oversized sleeveless robe. He put it on the ground, the cockroach. I immediately swayed the pink long nose and ran wildly. Maybe a poorly-sighted person could see that he couldn’t find anything in a short time, but standing here is Kremar, his sight. Only one pause condensed on the hind legs of the donkey. Although the hind legs were covered with fur, the inside was a metallic luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin leaned down and grabbed the cockroach just in front of him, even if he had only one hand, he had two more than many The man of the hand came to be flexible. He turned over the gray-black little animal. They saw it more clearly. It was a steel claw with a gear and bearing that was not as small as sesame. There are so many components that he can't understand, there are dark red and white "ribs" connected to them, the ends of the tendons pierce the smooth residual limbs, and they are still making their movements, so they can clearly Seeing how the ribs are driving the gears and the bearings, the knights facing the tens of thousands of orcs can also face the caster with uneasiness and glance at the caster around me: "I want to do this too?" It seems that Doddwin, who is more terrible than healing or potion, knows that his arm can't recover before Tyre's forgiveness, but he only thinks that his prosthesis is just a wooden one, or It is a hollow thing made by Mithril, after adding magic Finger width life can seize the sword or hammer, but now it seems that he seems to have become guinea pigs a crazy warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of the alien soul is very natural. His memory is like an explosion-proof glass that has been dropped from the twenty-seventh floor, but he still remembers that in his plane, humans have developed Bioelectronic devices, that is to say. Try to connect the human nervous system with camera equipment, recording equipment or motor-driven, 3d printed prostheses, so that blind people can be seen. He is audible, and people who have lost their arms or legs can enter ordinary life. He doesn't know much about the specific details, but he still remembers a small video explaining to the audience the latest developments in this technology. As far as the soul of the opposite world is concerned. What the gnome McGee came out is probably not likely to be based on "science," but it still inevitably makes it feel close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me see your arm." McGee asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin took another look at Crimal, making sure that the black-haired caster wouldn’t stand up and watch him being sent to the altar by these gnomes After the split is clean, the shirt is untied, and the broken arm and shoulders are exposed. McGee puts his finger on the place where his right arm has grown. His nails are thin and sharp, and the fingertips are cold and the feeling of piercing the skin. Almost let the former paladin jump up, McGee looked and checked more carefully than he did at the East Crown Island, and then he retired without a word. Let the other gnomes observe Bird's arm, then they get together and discuss it awkwardly (seeing that McGee's tribe is somewhat degraded), and let Baldwin take off his shirt. Go, walk around in the big room, let him wave his most used weapons, sit down, stand up, lie down, roll left and right. Rolling back and forth...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think they are really checking, not..." Happy with a nasty big man? Bydwin finished the last request (he didn't understand why he had to put his feet on the top of his head) and asked breathlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered his voice, but Kreima felt that the gnomes could still hear. “They are just observing your body and habits,” he explained. “This will make the best arm for you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As a respectable lord Said, "The gnome of the East Crown lord said that he looks like the leader of the gnomes: "We need a lot of information, many, many, we must understand you. Instead of installing the head of the squid on the peacock's neck," he With a bit of arrogance, he looked up and down for a while: "This is just the beginning, the soldier," the gnome patted his parchment scroll, which was a small circle of people who had a headache and was used to dry it. The sand of the ink leaked from the interlayer of the paper, and it was half-circular on the side of the gnome. "We probably need a month to measure various data."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“One month?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s already very urgent,” the gnome said unhappyly: “If it’s not the owner’s order, the time you wait for is more than that, we What you want to build is an arm, not a stool. Of course, if you are willing to install a foot on your arm, then we will be able to finish it tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please forgive me," Birdwin said. Of course he doesn't want a stool. "But I can tell, how long does it take to complete all work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The next hurricane season." The gnome said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"September next year." Kremar said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin couldn’t help but want to make a face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter," said the black-haired caster: "Now the island belongs to me, I think... this may still be a good thing. "When the soldiers expelled by the New King of Norman and Dylan Donkley came here, Birdwin allowed them to settle and calm down as quickly as possible. He was their father, their brother and they. The lords are also the ones most worthy of their trust and love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we go back to our room?" asked the gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," said the soul of the outside world and said: "Whenever you want to go back to your room, you can."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides some necessary moments, it’s like discussing Arm's arm together, other gnomes don't like to be with McGee, they walked out of the room with their arms in twos and threes, Mai A gnome walked alone in the end, but it seems that he does not feel depressed, but rather happy, if he wants to describe his expression, it is probably "not dealing with idiots can be really refreshing" He looked at Birdwin before he left the room, as if he wanted to stay and study it deeply, but Birdwin immediately became alert, and McGee grabbed his fake beard and lifted it around. He ran around and slammed it into his short robe and walked out, his bare feet leaving a wet mark on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When is it now?" Birdwin put on his shirt, the window of this room is closed, the gnomes don't like the sea breeze, so he can't directly see the outside The sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
