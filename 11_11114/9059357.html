It is a quirky fruit that I made based on the reality of the plant, but the reference object is almost no different from the imaginary creation, but the peel is changed from golden yellow to white. In reality, this fruit is called golden bell, also called 癞 grape. Going to Taobao, I can only find the seeds, but there are pictures. The flesh inside is really bloody. The sweetness is also very weird. It was occasionally eaten when I was a child. It is always unforgettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: The Silver Golem is derived from the liquid robot in the lucky e-servant group in the fz, and the liquid robot in the Terminator. The paw is Wolverine's correct, as for the shooting of the arrow, that is the full-time hunter of the Miracle Brigade Franklin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Text:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year of chaos, September, Yulong Fire Island side island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the King of the Silver Crown, the respectable Ingewell:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;前略<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just yesterday, my dearest father, Longhuo Island, entered the hottest and violent month. When I wrote to you, I had to rotate the louvers of the long windows so that they could not be tilted any more, leaving only small gaps, instead of opening all the windows and doors as before, the sea breeze was still strong. But it is burned by the red sun, just like the air that floats on the lava. When it comes to your body, it is like a group of colorless flames that rush straight into your throat and the sea warms, or More correctly, it's a bit hot, the surface is suffocating with a suffocating mist, and I have to sneak into the place below 20 feet to feel the shade, but here people say that this temperature is suitable for coral growth, now it is A good time for coral reefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will mix volcanic ash with sand, and add gum to shape the base of the coral reef. The pedestals are almost all grayish white. They will be square or round, but now they will shape them into a variety of animal and plant shapes, some of which have statues. Father, I found a statue base that is said to have been fabricated according to your image. It is about three times as tall as the sea cedar that is full of shrubs. The cypress is pale purple, but the tail of the "you" robes has such a small group of bubble corals with golden dots. Although it is only so small in my arms, there are already several colorful fish and one hidden inside. Puffy juveniles, and a brown squid hides under your feet. After I was alarmed, it spurted a big black smoke. It should be glad that I didn't need to survive on the sea. Otherwise, it might be caught. The squid is the main material for dyes and inks. It tastes very much after baking. A good statue can be said that there is no place like you, but it is so vibrant, but unfortunately you have no way to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deeper part, I also found some scallops. This shell seems to be only visible on the Longhuo Islands. The slaves here can extract thicker silk from the tendons they use to connect the two scallops. Come, this silk will shine like gold. It is as light as air, more tough than iron or steel, and only Mithril can be compared with it. The lord and the lord's son will cover the loose robes made of them in formal occasions, Dada, that is Kreima’s eunuch called it a tradition, and now he is busy urging the slaves to make up the clothes of Kremar, which are all done by the “skills” of the slaves. The work of cutting the tendon on the shell is unimaginably difficult, and they often have blood in their hands. Because the extracted silk must be long enough to be spun, they must cut the longest tendon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these slaves can be considered lucky because they can hold the cold canals and work in the sea (because drying and high temperatures can cause Canal death). Other slaves, which they call "bovine horses", still need to sleep without sleep in the hot summer climate that allows blood to boil. Every moment, slaves die, Cray Mar has tried to change this situation. But he soon said that slaves who were ordered to stop working would bite each other like sensible creatures, causing even more casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frustration is inevitable, but it lasts for a long time. After coming to the side island, Kremar is preparing to ease or treat the "tobacco" As well as the adverse effects of secret medicine on human beings, he is busy all day, even the chances of dining with us are few, and now the people he contacts the most are the gnomes and eunuchs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(After a trace of being scraped, I can see that Kerry has made changes here)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how I should tell you, because Kreima's behavior is entirely from his sincere and pure heart, not other ulterior or evil purpose, Kreima never What is hidden from me, so I know everything he does, father, if you are not standing there, but a red robe or a gray robe, I will not Surprising his behavior, it is their duty and hobbies to play and play with life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that is Crimal, and will never get used to looking at an innocent life, Cremari, who died quietly, even his enemy, he They have never tormented them and laughed at them. He is full of respect and love for life. This is the consensus of all of us, but here, the other side of his performance makes me feel scared, dear father, my guidance. I am not afraid of Kremar, but I am afraid of those gnomes. They are more willing to be dark than the light, and they are not afraid to engage in any evil things, but they do not have the ordinary casters. Knowledge and experience, they can use the flesh and blood to create magic images, but also to use the soul to cast weapons. The stone of wisdom they master can make a powerful mage such as Antonio or Alva fascinated. To see <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I fear is that they will let Crimare sink into the trap they made. I can't even isolate them because they are working for Kremar and making a better than our original friend, Bywin. Some arms are more dexterous and sturdy new limbs. I don't know if they should stop them, but I also hope that Baldwin can regain his arm. He is a warrior, a woman whom the king loves, he will eventually be To go to Norman in the Highlands, to Thunder Castle, and even worse, he may stand in a more noble position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, sorry. Father, I can't leave here for a while, and Baldwin's prosthesis will be completed in September next year, and I will be in the limestone with Kremar after that. I hope that Gray Ridge will calm his heart again. Maybe add a white face? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the rest of the team, Baldwin recovered very well, except for the arm that couldn’t grow, just a long and cumbersome check and test for him. A little anxious, but the daughter Li Naina has been with him. There are also soldiers and knights whose soldiers and knights were expelled by Dylan Donkre and Norman New King. There are no elders over the age of 50, no children under the age of ten, even women. Rarely, Kreima placed them around the fortress. When they were familiar with the environment and climate of the side islands, some of them would be stationed at the three ports on the side island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, we were attacked five times again. Three times were pirates, two were mercenaries, and fortunately there were Norman soldiers with Gavin and Kremar. These attacks did not cause casualties. In the past two months, they seem to have died down, or they are tired of this tentative attack, perhaps tomorrow, or perhaps next week, we will usher in a real enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our thieves, cursed by the god of death, have been wandering around the pubs and inns of three ports since last week, with Crema The seal of the rune given to him, if not. He may have lost his life long ago. Gülen is a sly and agile thief, but as a mixed dragon, he is hard to say is the strongest. Moreover, sometimes he has to face more than one enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let's talk about Fro's pastor, Plum, Cremaar promised to build a Fro's temple for her, the temple has been completed, Crema And Gavin used coral growth to create a coral floating island that was glued together by nine round rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pink Coral Floating Island<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry suddenly put down the pen and stood up. He could feel a strange and cold wind blowing through all the rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really," the caster said softly: "I was really surprised. I didn't expect the first one to notice that this little secret would be you," he said at random, the burning flame instantly extinguished, the glass test tube. The liquid stopped boiling, and he pinched it at the top (not minding the high temperature that could burn ordinary people's skin) and inserted it on a metal shelf. "I thought it would be Kerry." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The genius of the elf's gaze is unparalleled in this plane," the thief stared at the mage and re-opened his hands in his sleeves, trying not to let himself back "It's a pity that they are always blinded by their own hearts, or have ears. They can't face the darkness, and public opinion explores the roots of the darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it's wisdom," the lich said slowly. "What makes you dare to come against me? I think it's only stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" the thief shouted. He took a step back and raised his hands and showed them to the lich. "I didn't want to disobey what you mean, adults, my master, I just want to work for you better! The power of a mortal is meager, but a guild is different! Gold coins, intelligence, casting materials and all Everything you need will flow to your hands, and you don't have to spend a little energy and time on it. You will have more sophisticated and docile tools. Gods are on, gnomes and slaves can't. Walking and doing things outside the Dragon Fire Island, and those knights and soldiers are loyal, but they are not loyal to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔噢噢噢"The once undead sneer sighed: "It's hard to imagine, there will be such a fascinating guy around me who do you think I have to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I just want to make you satisfied, my respected master." The thief said humblely: "But I can't fully understand your wishes, I can only guess," he said softly: "based on your previous actions." Birdwin, there is another The needs of adults are not worth your attention." He sneaked his eyes and peered at the caster's look. The light in the room was very good. Gram could have seen the caster's face in this situation, but he could only Seeing a white mandible, most of the caster's body is covered by shadows. It may be a shadow caused by magic, which makes the mortal's line of sight impossible to penetrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to say," said the undead. "Your guess is not without foundation. Dear Gülen, my little thief, you are really smart and good at observation." He moved and sat down. Down, an invisible servant gave his master a glass of bright red drink. Then, under the direction of the caster, Gülen also got a cup of dark red drink that was smooth and thick, and the cup was lingering with sweetness. The aroma is like semi-coagulated blood, but Gülen only sniffs and knows that it is just a melon of white-skinned melon, accompanied by crushed ice and accompanied by delicate smoothies, with lemon juice and basil. The powder tastes sweet and sour, and it is extremely delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you almost have to say that I am moving." The lich smiled softly: "What a lovely ambition of a thief guild can indeed satisfy many Human needs, including a caster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It belongs to you." Ge Lan hurriedly said: "I am also yours." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nominally, Gülen," the lich picked up a bunch of blue-purple berries and placed it in the light carefully: "No, even Nominally, I can't have a thief guild, so say Gülen, if you don't be a thief, you can be a good businessman because you are trying to make the most profit with the least cost and you will get a thief. The guild, and you don't have to pay anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then a very short silence, maybe only a few breaths, but Gülen feels that it is difficult to breathe He squeezed the silver cup and left a deep and distorted mark on the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," the Lich suddenly clap his hands. "As you wish, Gülen, you will have a guild." The juice moved to the lips, "as long as we can solve a small problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ecstasy of a time occupies the thief’s thoughts, he knows that this adult is not like another An adult is so weak and affectionate, but he will not scream at the thief's ear, such as Gülen, who screams in his ear. He managed to hold his tongue: "What problem?" He asked, guessing. Maybe you have to sign a contract or something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when a silver string is wrapped around his neck, the expression on his face is still full of joy, and he turns this joy into pure The fear, the string was eagerly tightened under the command of the master. It was so slender and so tough. At that moment, Glan’s neck was completely broken and the thief’s head fell off his shoulder. Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
