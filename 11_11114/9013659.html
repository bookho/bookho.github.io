Some villagers saw her as a woman sincerely and fearfully, and gave way to her and bowed to her. Mei Mi has never been treated like this in other places, but she knows that it is because the bodies of the deformed monsters that have not yet been buried, but are sprinkled with straw ash and salt to prevent them from decaying - sweeping a group of people who are not high enough for human knees Goblin is still within the understanding of these stupid people, and the distortions are far beyond their imagination. Although these villagers do not understand how horrible and abominable creatures are, it is indeed in the tiny war. Want to fight with them - they are just injured and not dead, thanks to the quick response and subtle skills of the adventurers. Like a gingerbread-like gray-white monster that has never been baked, it is tall and strong. You can bend an iron fork or break a wooden stick with your bare hands. When you act, it is like a cat or a bird. You can't use yours at all. The eyes capture their shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, it is said that they will slowly eat an entire village, and your friends and relatives will disappear inexplicably one after another. As a mortal, you can’t find it. They can't get their news until they are traced. You can only squat in a room with other survivors, thinking that you can save your life, but you don't know that the most dangerous monster is by your side, just waiting for you. When you fall asleep, it will bite your neck and pull out your internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the taste of the delicious mutton soup, Leona also discussed this issue with Kerry Ben and Bedwin. The objects are not untargeted, and those who are unfortunate have almost certain prestige and power in the village, except for the daughter of the village chief, Abby, who finally decided to replace the village chief because of those damn goblins, if Ilmot or It was Rosada, and even the temple of Tyre really sent white robes to the village to investigate and cast spells. They and their "flowers" might be discovered. But if the village heads are no longer the village heads, they can delay the time without limit, and tell the villagers what they are doing, but it is not necessary. The villagers will not leave the village without rushing to the village. The road to the town is not so safe, and who their children and sheep should be handed over to, not to mention the food and shoes consumed on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the final analysis, they are still too lazy." The king said ridiculously: "If they pretend to be pastors in the beginning. And drive those goblins away, then no There will be something behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry Ben shook his head with a smile: "Sometimes people actually see orcs, deformed monsters or other monsters and goblins, but unless the former is very weak or fatally hurt, you will not see them. Killing each other, these evil creatures will only collude with each other to attack the weak in their eyes - for example, human caravans and villages. If you think you can use some means to drive them to fight for humans - like Human domesticated eagle or dog, but that is impossible, human beings are their food. When a steak and a tricky enemy are placed in front of you, will you attack the tricky enemy for that piece of meat? Even if it promises to let you bite?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those devil fingers can already be harvested," Birdwin grabbed his unkempt beard: "If We didn't show up, maybe these two days will be held in an unprecedented celebration, and the meal at the party is all the people in the village - then why should they go for food? The food goes with a group of stinking goblin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only evil creatures that can be used by humans are probably only the devil, and perhaps the devil." Gülen said : "As long as it can be handled properly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible," Li Oona said without hesitation, as the king of Norman, she has the right to look up Books that some people cannot reach, in the history of Norman in the Highlands, there is more than one noble and brave soul in order to win undue power and glory and finally fall into the devil's claws, they cause more disaster than any monster It’s going to come: "The devils are more greedy than the monsters, they only want more, not less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never believe the devil If it's just a word, a syllable." Kerry Ben said: "Forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time Mei Mi also wanted to say something, but she found I can't insert it at all - after the Elf Ranger has finished the last topic. They began to discuss the employers of the deformed monsters - possibly a thief guild, an evil red robe or gray robe, or a lord of greed... those complicated relationships and professional words even Gülen I also heard it very hard. Since the birth, public opinion has only learned from Pastor Fro, who dances, sings, and prays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile that comes to her lips evaporates in the sun like the dew in the morning. The mood was heavy and another dark plum almost didn't see the person waiting for her - the little daughter of the village chief brother waved her: "Your companion went to the stream," she bit her thumb: " That was the place before, they said so... Where are you going, madam?" She licked the robes of Plume, Asmodeos was looking out from the robes, surprised at the human girl. When looking at it. The little devil jumped out of the robes and turned a somersault in the air, and the little girl immediately giggled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mi impatiently grabbed the restless "little monster" and rudely stuffed it back into the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?" The little girl asked, "Is that your pet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No." Mei Mi replied less politely: "What are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little girl pouted, "Goat milk and bread And there is some lamb," she retired and let Meimi see the basket behind her: "My father asked me to send it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should take it Put it in the room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to go to the ghost place." The little girl said, she ran away when she finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priest Froe had to arrogantly bring the heavy basket back into the house, she sat down on the hearth, that is Leona yesterday Sitting in the late position, holding my knees and imagining myself is the woman who looks ugly but has another invisible charm - just because she is the king of Norman in the Highlands, so she can get Mei Mei at all costs. The things - pure and noble love, as well as respect and trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the use of tears in your breath here?" The little devil said bluntly that he was not trying to accompany a human woman. All the way to here, "Dear, this is a war," it swayed with a spiked tail: "Let me go to marry that person," it said inductively: "Maybe I can give you A good idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei looked at it stupidly for a while: "Ah," she said, "but I’m not sure I can find that place. "They went on the starlight and stepped back on the starlight." If there is no elf leading the way, she can't even come back to the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil stunned his head with a headache: "Well," it said: "I think I can find them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding Kreima They are not difficult for the Little Devil, let alone the caster casts one or two spells. The magical energy that permeates the air makes the little devil painfully want to bite his tail. After getting rid of the useless Demon, Austal can't sign a contract with the little devil, and Anemos laughs at it. It has been a long time, now it can only be said to be hired by the Red Warlock, the reward is the soul stone. Austal is not too embarrassed, relying on the soul he gave to the little devil can still persist for two years, the problem is that the soul stone is like a zero mouth for the devil in the main material plane, you can of course It’s too cruel to use it to replace the staple food all day long. It really needs all the magic power of the caster, but only if you sign a contract with the little devil, you can enjoy one or two of them. In the case of association, it can only comfortably suck a little bit of free magic to comfort yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mei Mi suddenly stopped, and when she did not take a step forward, the little devil did not urge her, in front of the Elf Ranger and the Master. It feels better to be a bit stupid—perhaps because the wizard has just cast a spell, and the air contains more magic than it thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mei Mi suddenly stopped because she saw Bedwin and Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun on the stream is particularly bright and bright, and Birdwin sits on a fallen tree, his legs are slightly separated, his left hand is on his knees, and he is leaning up. Head, eyes closed, look relaxed, lips slightly tilted - Mei Mi is the first time to see him like this, in the past Baldwin even frowned when she was warm with her. Straightening the lips, the eyes are full of uneasiness and pain - his wide sword is placed far away from him, and the secret silver chain hangs between the branches of the dead tree, emitting a warm and soft light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona stood behind him. Holding a small dagger in his hand, the length of the blade is only the palm of an adult male, probably used to take a meal - but this is not that it is not sharp, on the contrary, in order to be narrow from the bone Cut between the gaps to connect the fascia of the meat or cut off the tougher bacon, which is sharper than the real weapon. The Norman king of the Highlands flipped over, letting it shine in the sunlight, and then said something with a smile. Mei Mi guessed that she might be saying that she might accidentally cut Bob Dewen’s neck because Birdwin's smile deepened and said: "I believe in you." - This sentence is very simple, Mei Mei can read his lips and read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not something you can decide." The woman said, naughtyly put the thin blade of dagger in the ear of Baldwin. Grinding and grinding: "But your beard is really going to be scraped," she squeezed a Baldwin's jaw and found that this should be said to be a very soft place, as hard as a wild boar, or a The wild bison with only the thorns and bristles: "I can't see your face quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin moved his head invisibly: " So everything is handed over to you, Dear His Royal Highness, I will let you deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So don't say a word from now on." Li Onaqiang I smiled and said, "I don't know if I have time to remove the dagger - when I laugh too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," Kerry has walked from one side: "I still have a lot of therapeutic potions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona and Baldwin laughed together, and the Queen trembled for a while before taking a deep breath and continuing her work – she was not skilled, and she was careful, she looked at Byrdwin, It’s like looking at the only remaining treasure in the world – and she is removing the dust that covers this treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She shaved." Kreima whispered to Kerry Ben, the half-elf's sharp vision made him see two places at once. No, three, or there are more places for small wounds - imagination is good, and reality is always cruel, you can't expect a princess who has even manicured nails to be carried by the maid to change overnight. Become a skilled hairdresser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry," said the Elf Ranger: "Bedwin's skin is very thick - go with me to find some berries? The night before I saw bilberry and gooseberry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From another The soul of the plane answers without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a hand was silently placed on the shoulder of Mei Mi, Mei Mei almost jumped up like a literal meaning, and she also sent out A scream, if it wasn’t for Gülen’s other hand that came round from behind and held her face tightly, the sweet little lover would be alarmed – perhaps already alarmed. Bydwin’s hand caught his side and grabbed his wide sword, and Leona removed the dagger and watched the bushes that Mei Mi borrowed to watch, but her hand was still in Bedwin. On the shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing." She bowed her head and said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German towed the plum, and dragged it until the place where Leona could not see or hear them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first he needed to grab the priest of Fro, but it didn't take long for Fro's pastor to follow him, although he was not so willing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have enough fun in this game?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't understand what you are saying." Mei Mi said, she lowered her head and pretended to sort out her long, crumpled robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lonely knight is loved by a sloppy beggar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei shuddered, the thief’s words were like a needle that was venomous Piercing her heart: "I am not jealous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s worse than 娼妓." Gülen said: "Hey at least worth more than you." He stared. Mei Mi suddenly changed into a strange look: "The bottomless abyss is down," he whispered. "You won't be serious. Mei Mi! Tell me, you are not serious, you are just... Just like every time before, you are just playing on the spot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I will remind you that you are already crossing the line! Although Gülen didn't know why he did it, he always thought that he hated Mei Mi before. If he could send her to death, he would never hesitate for a minute or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am serious." Mei Mi said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that is impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know that it is impossible!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bedwin never thought of you as a woman!" the thief shouted: "You are a priest of Fro to him! Mask is on You and I said that your mother is also a priest of Fro, you grew up in the temple of Fro, your destiny is desperate followers, you want men to see you! The curse The reason why he does not reject you is not because he loves you, he likes you, he just accepts a show of Pastor Fro! He thinks so, just with him from the priest of Ilmot There is no difference in taking a bottle of therapeutic syrup! No, Mei Mi, you stupid, you are not as good as a bottle of healing syrup, at least he still keeps the bottle of syrup!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are an idiot." The thief said incredulously: "In the tip Girls under the age of three will not make such a ridiculous dream again - the gods are on, and Baldwin is not even your first man. You have been offering Froh no less than three years, or more? How can you still be so naive? Do you really think he will allow you to be his wife? Poor plum, I am really worried that he will vomit after he knows what you think!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
