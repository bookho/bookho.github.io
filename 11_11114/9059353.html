After her limbs are interrupted, she has only undergone simple treatment. She can’t use her strength at all. She uses the top of her shoulder and kicks with her knees. Biting with a tooth, her teeth squeaked on a round iron bar thick like the thickness of an adult man's thumb. The guard guarding her guard was shocked and raised his sword from the gap between the cages. Cursing and screaming loudly in the cage.壹Reading ·1k want a ns to see hu·cc<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guards can be said to be one of the most frequently dealt with the most criminals in Bituminburg, insulting Naturally, there is no need for others. If the sea devil is still free, or a group of cruel and cruel pirates, then every word he says means death, and it is the most painful death, but Now the sea magic can't take care of this. Once it caught the guard's attention, she shouted loudly: "Look, look there, Drake! A pirate, Captain of the Golden Lady! He is here too, just in the crowd. Inside, grab him, good people! Pick him up, I am very happy with a number of companions! Hurry, the one wearing a wide-brimmed hat, he wants to escape!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after throwing the kiss, Drake, who had been disguised by the spell, has quietly mixed into the crowd and disappeared. But instead of leaving Bibi Dibao, he rented a small attic in the price of ten gold coins in a small hotel. This loft is nothing special. It must be said that it has a triangular window and windows. About 30 feet from the ground, facing the square, overlooking from here, you can clearly see the temporary construction of the prison. People have already ridiculed the water around the punishment platform. After all, in this plane, the execution of criminals is also a fun program that can be talked about for a long time, but the governor and master Alpha of Bibi Dibao are not the kind of people who like to The aristocrats and casters in the usual sense of suffering and life. All the arrested criminals were only hanged or jealous, and the execution place was often placed in the abandoned courtyard next to the official's residence. If the criminal was not so sinful, the consul would hire the pastor to pray for him. Or allow him to see the last side of his loved ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea magic is not in it. Only a small number of pirates will leave the victim’s life and freedom after the looting, but they will at most sell the latter as slaves or throw them into the sea to feed sharks, and the sea devils are the evil ones. She not only ruined human life. At the same time, they are willing to torment their souls, such as the "balance bar" game that is now popular in the pirate community. She created it - she selected the father and son, mother and child, husband and wife or brothers and sisters who are similar in weight to the victim, and then Put a noose around their neck, the noose through the cross, only one of the two people can touch the ground on the tip of the toe, on the rickety ship, do not want to be hanged by the noose or the other side is hung up To suffocate and die, you can only sacrifice another person or your own life - no matter which one, the process is extremely fierce and painful, and the pirates regard this as a rare pastime in a boring journey. I want to read the book w book ww · 1 k an shu·cc laughed aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the ultimate winner can't escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sea Devil also has a hobby that even her crew will be awkward. Although she is a beautiful woman, she never confesses her own orc. Even faintly proud, so after the Sea Monster captured a boat, the young children, girls and teenagers in the boat will become her intraday meal. And many of her collaborators have been criticized for not only this, the Sea Devil is a guy who never complies with the promise, as long as it is profitable, there is a gap. She never minds tearing up the contract anytime and anywhere, and her prey is not only a merchant ship accident, but other pirate ships, as long as there is a chance. She doesn't mind taking a bite, just like Drake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why she is able to go so far, there are many reasons, the sea magic is willing to do any dirty work that others are not willing to accept, which allows her to It is the tolerance of many people; her suspiciousness and fickleness are the second; third, she shelters her people and accepts the shelter of her people--on the island of Yar. The orcs and the half-orcs are also vaguely a force, as long as she can escape into the waters of Yar, even if there are reliable protectors - Bijiedi Fort and other Berbers such as Cobbert have been on the waters of Yar Island more than once. The pirate ship that wants to destroy the black hull and white sails is always defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, although the Sea Devils were not caught by Betty Duke or Cobbert, the Archon and Alva would not be too careless. This, what they need to be wary is whether the sea demon will escape before the execution, mobilize all the guards for this consul, and hire some trustworthy mercenaries to exclude suspicious people in the crowd, but from the beginning, Orcs and half-orcs are not allowed to enter the Beitburg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they can drink potions to disguise humans." The Archon said that he and Alva Master sat side by side on two purple high backs. On the chair, to be honest, this kind of hard wood is a raw material that can be assembled and carved out. It’s really uncomfortable to say that the person sitting on it can make people feel that he is majestic, so it’s still necessary to use it when charging the scene. In addition, their clothes also made them less comfortable. Alva's black velvet robes with gold dots absorbed every scorching sun, giving his owner enough heat to burn a pancake, but Al There is at least magic in the tile, and the woolen robes of the governor's slabs are like a gorgeous steamer. He also has a hat decorated with feathers and a silk scarf. He doesn't dare to act rashly when he sits in his seat. Lest people see the wet marks on their buttocks and back, let alone pull up their robes and blow them. A reading book · 1kanshu·cc<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea devil shouted on the way to the square. Drake was also here. The Alvara was looking around, and there were crowds of enthusiasm everywhere. There was nothing unusual about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think Drake will really be here?" asked the governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most likely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has a good relationship with the Sea Devil?" The pirates hanging on the outer wall of the Bibi Dibao did not know how many people, even those who helped them to converge on the bones, not to mention helping them escape the birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva smiled a little, and there was a detail about the battle. Cobbert was already snoring and smoking a hookah, not a little bit of discount with him. Say, the sea devil can be said to be forgotten. She played Derek, took his crew and boat, and extorted dozens of pounds of gold from his mother, Yar’s female grandfather. She actually dared to cooperate with Drake, Drake did not feel surprised at the end of stabbing her a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out to be like this," said the Archon. "So, if he appears here, he wants to marry the female orc."喽."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he can take the sea magic from our hands," Alva said, "he will definitely want to personally saw the sea magic. Body, but if he is ready now, then he will feel that it is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will really be here?"<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master raises his gaze, and the consul of Bibi Dibao looks through his sights - all around the square<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a hotel and pub, as well as shops, most of them have pointed little attic, the loft is not crowded with the body of the excited crowd, it is flashing silk, woolen cloth from time to time With the brilliance of the jewels, the wealthy and powerful people will certainly not be willing to huddle with the civilians, and the vision there is not broad enough. When this happens, these small House always sell at a good price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean Drake might be looking at us behind a window?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a moment. The consul wants to ask Alva Master if there is a way to find Drake, but he changed his mind in the next moment - Drake is not a sea demon. He got a knight in the female grandfather of Yar, and according to reliable news, he may be the illegitimate son of Yal, and he is quite favored by him, even if they caught Drake, just like before. It was only the ship that confiscated him, and then asked for a ransom from the Alexandria, who could not hang Drake on the outer wall of the Beitburg. Even if they knew that Drake’s crimes were equally difficult to count, as the governors and mages of Beitburg, they had no right to provoke war between the two regions for their own ideas and ethics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to be sentenced is not the sea magic, but the red dragonfly. The pirate was sentenced to blame for all the crimes. For him, such death is a reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was later a sea demon, two thick wooden poles passed through the gap of the iron cage, which was lifted by four people from the caravan. The execution officer paused. The half-orc female’s threatening voice in the iron cage, a guard stabbing her with a stabbing sword, she slammed her head, bit the sword, the guard yelled angrily, and the foot reached the cage and wanted the sword. After pumping back, the sea magic slammed the ankle. Only one moment, his leg was dragged into the cage by her. The other leg and body of the guard were all outside, and the bent foot hit the most vulnerable place of the male. He gave a curse in pain. If he was in peacetime, his companions would sneer at it, but what they could not predict was that the sea magic did not hesitate to rush up, in the silk pants. The wrapped leg took a bite in a sullen manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captured guard screamed, Alva’s spell arrived in time, it hit the sea magic, her muscles suddenly became slack, sharp Both the fingers and the teeth lost their strength. The other guards rushed and dragged the careless unlucky one out. Fortunately, Master Alva reacted quickly, he only lost half a pound of meat, just For the next few days, he could not walk well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The executioner glanced at the mage, and the mage nodded to him. He and his assistant cautiously stepped forward and opened the cage. The sea devil snorted. Gasping and staring at them with resentment, several guards assisted the executioner to kick her feet while hanging the sea magic on her shack. Her head rushed to the ground, bloody and oily sweat on the dirty gray-green skin. The mixture, the fangs were broken in the prison, and when she bit the cage, she broke two, and the only one was smashed at the bottom of the hard boot, leaving only the bloody roots. Even so, she still looks so terrible. A young boy has a hot smell in his pants when he sees her yelling at herself. The people around him are taunting him, even though they There was also a trace of fear in the laughter, which made them start to be anxious and upset. People shouted loudly and demanded that the executioner be executed as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drake Anan was sitting in his small attic, the sea monster's fat body, the tumor-filled skin, the thick palms and soles of the feet, was once the most nightmare for him to vomit, but today, they are hung on the shelf On the other hand, Drake felt that it had never been so pleasing to the eye when it was swaying in the sea breeze like a piece of pork that could not be cleaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is worried that if the consul or the executioner is kind, they may drink alcohol or ask the mage to cast spells to reduce her suffering. Fortunately, these two people are not crazy today, the sea devil is awake, Drake's vision is very good, he can see that the little eyes are full of fear and despair like her prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Drake whispered. "They haven't put oil on you on the charcoal fire."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistants of the execution officers stood behind the sea magic, and a saw with a height as high as an adult was placed between the legs of the sea magic, and pressed hard, only When the executioner ordered, they would start to slowly and forcefully cut the abominable female pirate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea devil has screamed hysterically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drinking this bottle of potion "McKee said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berwin was skeptical that he had taken the potion and it didn’t look like he could drink it in the stomach. It looked like mercury. It may also be that in the bright sunlight, the light of the spurs of the former Paladin eyes can not be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich took over and smelled it, and tasted it a little bit, "Drink," he said to Baldwin. "This is a color developer, I I think it is used to check blood vessels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this drinking good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Lich hesitated, "No big problem," he said, although it was almost always used on animals or corpses: "It is insoluble in stomach acid and insoluble in blood. It will be naturally discharged in a few days. , just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
