			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, forget to mention that the riddle of Chapter 547 is from the Internet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the black-haired dragons leave the human lion's body, the scorpio has turned from a grayish white with a reddish-brown edge to a deep gray-blue. Soon, it will turn into cobalt blue and black. As the light dims, the temperature of the desert also drops rapidly. In the middle of the night, it will drip into ice. Krimmar will certainly not fear this, his fire element. The waiter has been summoned, and it squats on the shoulders of Kremar, not only to bring him warmth but also to deter. In addition to those wild animals and monsters in the desert, there are many creatures that are used to hunting at night, although in the daytime they are It is not so quiet. Among them, there are desert giant spiders that play an important role in the breeding of the spider beast. They do not net, but hide under the shallow sand layer, waiting for the presence of prey, or using the cheating Capture, or bite with the upper and lower jaws, or spray a thick group of silk from the tail, stick the prey and there is a giant wolf, the giant wolves that live in the desert around Grenada. The soul with the opposite world is in the sea of ​​the extreme north Different winter wolves, their body length can be comparable to the winter wolf, but the body is much thinner, the fur is not thick enough, the body has mottled spots, and the ears and long kisses are surrounded by long hair. They can make them keenly aware of the changes in the direction and humidity of the air, but one thing they are similar to the winter wolf is that they will not let go of the prey that unfortunately falls into their sights even if they are full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for some other "small" and "moderate" creatures, we don't have to rumor, in short, a human being alone walking in the desert Eager gaze may be more than any big man or king, but the heat radiated from him makes the monsters with wisdom hesitate to stop, and the ordinary beasts have their own instincts, especially They saw a red snake that might have been stunned by hunger suddenly jumped from behind the sand dunes and sprayed the venom to the human being. Together with her venom, it turned into a dazzling fireball in midair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," the soul of the alien world said: "I hope we didn't disturb the one we were looking for." Fire Elemental Waiter, Red Scarlet Surprisingly patted the cheating. Obviously, it did not anticipate this. The slight depression and confession were conveyed to his master's mind through the trembling telepathy. The soul of the outside world immediately reached out and touched the little. Spider's head, "No, I didn't blame you," it explained: "I just worried that he would think we are his enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with words, the emotions conveyed from the connected thoughts are faster and more realistically calm the waiter of the fire. It is like a cat licking the owner’s fingers, and then continues to climb on that piece. On a white robe, a careless person might think that it is a delicate rune collar, and its eight eyes shine in the darkness, like a charcoal fire without burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world stops and estimates the distance that has passed before. The wisdom of the human face lion body ensures that they will not miscalculate the distance, and their camp guarantees that they will not lie, even if the leader of the male lion beast does not want to see a family become a human mount. The place they said is not far from the current position of Krimal, maybe only a few hundred feet, and the flame of the genius can alarm creatures hundreds of miles away. If there is a male lion body beast there, He really should find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortal, and the star of the caster, have traversed the sky, but its starlight is always so dark and unclear in the Greinada, the desert is covered with a shallow layer The red light, the dunes undulating, the shadows were shrouded in shadows, and then they heard sand flowing down the sand dunes, and the sound of the sounds made the black dragons stop immediately, and the temperature of the spiders suddenly rose. Its claws pierced the skin of Cremal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tallest dune trembles, the sand continually slid down from above, and in a short while, even in the weakest light, it can be clearly identified. The eye recognizes the true face of the sand dune, a male-faced lion beast, which is bigger than the leader they saw before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the soul of the alien world wants to say something, the male lion body suddenly opened his eyes, his eyes and all the night action In the darkness, they look like floating flames. He raises a paw and makes a gesture that is common to both planes. "Quiet." He said it in sign language and then continued to return. The original posture, watching a place motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gave the soul of the outside world a good opportunity to observe him. The little spider climbed out of the owner’s shoulder and grabbed his hair and climbed to the top of his head. The change of light made the soul of the alien world surprised to find that this is a nearly black male lion body beast. The bright black fur has no variegated color, smooth and smooth like a satin, only the claw tip and the eyes are different. The color, as well as the tail, is a little reddish, like whoever holds his tail and put it in the cinnabar powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said," the male lion body animal endured for a long time before finally saying: "Don't believe the nonsense of the bards." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing that only wise creatures will be eaten by some novelty If you are attracted, you will not be willing to be a slave to human beings for something you eat." The black male lion is not so happy to look at the scones that people have in their hands. He has eaten that kind of roast. The cake is not good at all. The damp is like mud. The hard one is like a stone. It is mixed with all sorts of messy things. The smell in the middle is a few sneezes. Although today's scones don't seem so bad, their smell is monotonous, but because of monotony it becomes extraordinarily pure and rich, like oil, but not like the fat of goats and gerbils. There are also some smells of nuts and salt. He glances at the little ones. Those things look as good as scones, yes, but the smell is a bit tempting, nothing more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is just a little curious, maybe he can taste it, but he just tastes it. He will never be stupid with those poets. Like animals, just to eat barbecue or cream, they are willing to sign a contract with humans. If you put your claws on the human neck, he will offer all the things he can offer, even his children’s parents. No exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it disturbing you?" said the soul of the alien world, apparently with the black male lion and the beast that was not so hearty, he collected the food. The smell was immediately isolated by the pocket, and the male lion body turned his head regretfully: "Yes," he said. "You disturbed me." He said seriously: "I am enjoying my silence." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, sorry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," said the male lion and the beast: "Then The cloud has changed its shape," he said to the soul of the outside world. "It is no longer what it was."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was it originally? Look like?"dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like my favorite buttocks of a female lion," said the male lion and the beast: "The shape of it just made me really want to get together to sniff it." He looked at the sky: "And now it is like a pile of droppings from a bird's head." He said that he showed a side nausea Expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to say," the male-faced lion beast continued: "The choices you made are quite correct. The birds are really not a good thing, they are like It’s the orc’s jealousy, or the kind of beggar’s embarrassment”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that the soul of the opposite world said that I came to this plane already has a paragraph It’s time, but I’m the first time I’ve encountered a vocabulary that needs to be silenced, and it’s in <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I need the help we’re trying to get, I’m from him. The mouth, the Lich followed, no doubt, we met a very special male face lion beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these are some minor issues that are not worth mentioning. The Lich’s concern is that this male-faced lion beast seems to have already known their intentions, since He did not show hostility, then they still have a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be surprised," said the male lion and the beast. "Before you come, my good baby came in and told me that I had something to do." Your thing." Just as the soul of the outside world tried to guess who the so-called good baby was, he continued: "Of course, the damn bottomless abyss, you seem to scare him, let me see, he I just stuffed the tail in the shackle, and I guess he had wet a couple of stones before coming to see me. It’s a damn jealousy, deserving the sly baby, I said, He is not very suitable for being a leader. He lacks some self-motivation and determination, but my wife and her sisters have never thought so, okay," he shrugged with great humanity. "Look, see, at When he encounters a big event, he will only roll his eggs. I should probably crack his face in the final duel, so that we can all be better. Oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is yours"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son, yes." The colored male lion body beast said that while scratching his ears with his claws: "He is my son, I am their predecessor, I must say that I am quite competent, but my wife is angry with some of my behavior. But I don’t think that’s what it is, even though my sister and her sister, and her niece, and her friends, and her gerbils, but at least I have not been with her mother. And I swear that my favorite is her, but unfortunately she does not seem to be willing to forgive me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
