			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple of Dinar is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests of the literary gods stand outside the temple, and they have piles of documents that may be carried out in the near future, but these can only be said to be in the original stock. The nine cows and one hair, they prayed, and cast the magic, but to no avail - the spells even contributed to the spread of the flames, some older pastors, or pastors from the royal family could not help but think of the big more than a thousand years ago The catastrophe, the priests at that time also faced the same problems as them. The magic is not a failure, it is a mutation. They bow their heads and silently pray that this is only temporary and occasional, but everyone knows that fate always tends to Unfortunately, not lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the burned-out papers, there are brothers’ bodies at the foot of the priest, and these unfortunate people, one of whom is coming from the far north With precious records, I intend to work with them to study the songs and longevity of a human tribe living in the northernmost land - he died, and the instruments he carried with him were swallowed up by the flames, and the priests of Dinar What I don't know is that, thousands of miles away from them, a group of giants are consuming fresh flesh and blood – it is the tribe that Pastor Dinner has visited, they are buried in the mouth of giants, and there is no survivor. Their tents were filled with pockets by giants, and fur, wood chips, and anything that might be used for writing and recording were thrown in place, and only one summer, they would rot without anyone knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of literature, Diner, runs and screams wildly in his own kingdom. He drives his own power to kill those locusts, but always In vain, after another piece of bookshelves collapsed, he gasped and stood in the same place, listening to the sound of locusts biting bookshelves and pages, and suddenly realized that these locusts were not alien enemies, but belonged to him, the polluted power, So the spells he throws will only become their nutrients, although he doesn't know how his power is polluted - Diner lifted his hand and tore his body, only to find it was like a worm The black core of the tree, he checked his essence, it is a bright milky light - it should be, but now it is gray, like a spoiled human heart, aphids The source is constantly crawling out from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinel looked up and finally glanced at his godland. He closed his eyes and could feel his avatars rushing back, but They are destined to be unable to return to the kingdom of God. Dinar closed his own kingdom of God and then ignited his own nature. The locusts, the dark side of the first nar, screamed miserably in the flames, and fled, but God The country is full of flames, books on bookshelves, scrolls and drawings, trembles, many complicated images and sounds are born in the flames, and they are dying in the flames. The dragons are long and the knights are wielding swords. The horses fluttered with their hairs, and they jumped out... The clown patted the tambourine, the graceful girl unfolded her arms, and danced... The ancient scholars held the scrolls, and the eyes were deep... The children played and screamed from the hot The air ran away... The king sat on his throne, and the devil whispered in the shadows... not only humans, but also dragons, elves, dwarves and gnomes, and treasures created by all wise creatures. They seem to be a harbinger of destruction can be said to be a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just before the complete destruction of the kingdom of Dinar, a mysterious and pure power came here, flames, images, sounds, locusts The ashes were all frozen at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wise god of knowledge, Ogmar, appears outside the kingdom of Diner, full of pity and sorrow for Diner, Dinar’s Hundreds of people were rejected outside the Kingdom of God, but in the next moment, they burned up, and Ogmar did not stop them. This kind of pollution and distortion of the nature of the gods is unbearable by any god. And just like the plague of human beings, they will also spread through the exchanges between the gods - this has been proved by the poor Li Erla and the singer Miriam, when the god of knowledge, Ogma When the gods of the two gods and other gods collapsed and rushed to arrive, everything was irreparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must call Aiou!" Sheenz, the goddess of the nobility, said with a slap in the face, "Isn't it enough? Lierla, Milil, Fro (when she mentioned this name, she glanced at the male gods present), Ilmot, Tell, Rosada... Degraded so many gods, should we not let God Is God aware of this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe we are worried about this." Ben Baza said that she is the goddess of doom, the hoarse voice is like a crow In mourning: "Aiou is not so friendly to us. Think about the last battle of the gods, we fell into mortals, and the three mortals took away the position of their companions. Isn't this all Aio in one hand? Manipulating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Mistral?" asked the goddess of doom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the gods are silent, and Mistral is a clue to the slate, so he wants to return to the kingdom of God, but he is ironed by the iron. A blow to death, when she fell from the sky, every god could not help but screamed in horror - when it came to this, Tyre was the faithful servant of Aeo, the god of God, but he did not seem to Tolerance, his wife died in the catastrophe, and he was alienated by the gods because of the hunchback of the return to the road of the kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, who knows exactly what kind of enemy Teres and Rosada have, and other enemies?" Hall, the god of revenge Asked: "Who should we avenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lushen Sulun took his bow and bowed for a while, she is the god of the Rangers, So the situation of the main material plane is better than some gods, but before she spoke, there was a voice that answered the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aliman." The voice said: "You, the chaotic snake Aliman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The gods turned their heads and saw Sirrick not so surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's you." Su Lun said disgustedly, raising his bow and arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hirick looks around, almost all of them are gods, elves, dwarves, gnomes who need to rely on humble human beliefs to ensure their power The gods are not in the list, even the elemental gods are not seen, and his lips are floating with a light smile. Although there are still his enemies here, but after the hypocrisy of Tyre and Rosada, the stupid guys seem to be pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of wealth, Woking, puts his hand behind Su Lun. She is a goddess who is good at collecting money. She is not good at fighting, but as a god, she I can always feel that the power of Siric is different. I want to know that the god of conspiracy was originally in the ranks of powerful gods. After the fall of Tyre and Rosada, almost no one here can This evil and despicable god is confrontational. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you do?" Ogmar asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I," Sirrick put his hands on his waist. "What else? Just like the last time, when you tried to frame me, I only I can give you the same answer, I am fulfilling my duties and duties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is you calling Ariman?" Hall asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hirick shook his head: "You should know that this is a revenge," he said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To whom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?" Hirick raised his finger From the self to the end of the doom goddess, draw a whole circle, "all the gods, each one," he said with a smile: "From the beginning to the end, you are born from the battle between him and Jie Yanen, But they abandoned them, letting one indulge in the abyss, and one empty in the void."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't get away with this thing." Su Lu said with disgust . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The priesthood," Herick said with sincerity: "I am the god of conspiracy and war. Everyone, all conspiracy must be rooted in me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the god of love and marriage being manipulated by you?" asked the goddess of strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to ask if Alibaba’s engulfing and pollution is from my planning?" Chirac said: "No, no, no, although I I know, but the invitees of the banquet are Tell and Rosada."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They fell because of you." Su Lun asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have that much ability." Herick followed: "They fell because of their desires and doubts. - Please pay attention to listening." I will swear, yes, I will swear, swear to my throne, please, look at yourself, do you have no desire in your heart? Do you not want to be strong, wise, omniscient? This is not a sin, whether it is a god or a human being. It is natural, natural, and logical... and our leader is not fair, he is tyrannical, ruthless, selfish – he never cares about the main material position. Nothing, he has no temple, no sanctuary, no pastor, no attention to those human beings, giants, or orcs... he only enslaved us, forced us, and we want to ask When you return a little, you are pointing at your feet and interfering with each other? Isn’t it? At the beginning, you, right, you are, do you have a little value for the main material plane? It was originally yours. A courtyard, a playground! You should have been free and unscrupulous. Who gave you a shackle? Isn't it Aio?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
