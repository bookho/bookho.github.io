			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry's companion has returned to the jungle first, but he is not prepared to walk alone, a small caravan will go with them to the White Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small caravan with less than 20 people certainly welcomes a Ranger and Master to join them. They are doing the dye business, only four accompanying agents. Soldiers, but there are eleven two-wheeled caravans, four of which belong to the same person. He is the leader of this small caravan, called Forte, a vulgar name with two apprentices and one servant, just like covering The brownish hair of the dust, the floating fat, makes people think that he is not doing the dye business but doing the oil business - he seems to be a good sign on the block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master has turned one of his apprentices into a bird, so that he can appreciate the magical beauty, he is above the Beitburg After a sneak peek, telling his mentor that he was most impressed that the place where he lived was like a strange face – the four-storey wall of Bibi dike is located at the tip of the nose, and the shoal is among the people. The seawall is the lips, the mountains on both sides are the green cheeks, and the straight road that is straight and gentle like the bridge of the nose starts from the north gate of the Bibi dike, and finally falls into the continuous low hills - it is in the hills and seawall The dividing line broke into countless messy narrow paths, and the caravan of Biyindi Fort spread from there to every part of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked along a narrow road for a whole day, and when the light was still bright, there were three or four caravans leading or trailing them. But very quickly, they didn't turn left or turn right. In short, they all went on other roads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s weird," said Futman, snarlingly, whispering to himself: "They all went there?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is more than one way to the White Tower," Futt's apprentice said: "Why do they have to be huddled with a chubby pesky?" He almost put his tongue in his mouth. However, he was still heard by Forte, so he exchanged a not-so-heavy whip. He shrugged indifferently and ran to the back of the carriage. He even broke the whip with his clothes and beat him. It is simply caressing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freth has no intention of pursuing, he is a tolerant person, but this road is indeed the closest and flattest one to the White Tower, the businessman is not an adventure They will never choose a new road when there is a long way to go. He turned his attention to the Ranger sitting on top of the caravan, hoping to get a bit of reliable information from the latter's words and deeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A raven who is returning to the nest brings a signal of storm to Kerry. It comes from the sea, but it will soon hit here. Kerry has given the bird a venison as a reward. The big-eyed big bird fluttered away. He leaned over and found the apprentice of Forte: "Go and talk to your master," said the Ranger. "We need to set up the tent immediately, and the storm is coming."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will doubt Kerry’s words, the caravan stopped, they chose a north slope of a higher and wider hill as a campsite to defend against The coming storm, the caravan was dragged onto the gentle slope, the horses were untied together, and Futer had a strong cowhide tent, while other merchants had sheepskin or tarpaulin, which was also able to be worn in two awning workshops. It plays a role in sheltering the wind and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is getting more and more urgent, they almost can't even rise the bonfire, the mercenaries go to investigate a metasequoia forest not far from them, so that there is no big beast to disturb The horses attacked humans. They came back before the darkness came. Everyone carried and carried many fat rabbits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No wolves, no bears," said the mercenary leader. "Only rabbits can jump directly into your pocket." His words triggered Other people's interests, in addition to the inconvenient Foster, Master and Ranger, they went to the woods and returned with the same full load. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are fresh rabbit meat, then the dry food that is not good can of course be shelved. They eagerly cut and peel the rabbit, and the fat meat beats on the flame. At the same time, their skins are stretched on the tree stalks, and there is no time and utensils to make fur on the road. After the fur is roughly dried, the fat and dirt can be scraped off like a wooden board, and the conditions are met. The place is then managed to soak in order to restore the original shape for easy processing - now is the season of rabbit hair change, the fur is a lot bald, can not sell a good price, but they can at least keep their own use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the mercenaries don’t see the gray-skinned fur, and the rabbit meat with the eccentric smell is not so good, a young The mercenaries complained that without the pheasants and deer, they stabbed the rabbit's body with their own swords. They brought back more than they needed. They didn't want to use the fur, and they didn't want to make the dried meat. The merchants didn't dare or I don’t bother asking them to ask, most of the prey is thrown into the stalks higher than the human knees after the flesh and blood is shattered. This hard and slender grass covers most of the hills, which is why this piece The place will be called the sake of the hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher mercenary who stabbed the rabbit's head and threw himself to throw it up suddenly stood up, and he grabbed the short beggar around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is something towing the rabbit." Young mercenary Answer: "Maybe a fox."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fox has nothing to do with you," the senior in the mercenary yelled, immersing his rabbit meat In the soup, I want to make it softer: "You don't want to eat fox meat, and it will change hair in spring, its fur is broken and rotten - it is not good for your blood to be poisonous, young people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mercenary is indifferent, the older man has one eye, his face full of deep gullies carved out of the wind, compared to the energetic Young people, he walks slowly, ishave slowly, and his equipment is not new enough. He is not admired and trusted by young people. The young man who is no longer interested in the rabbit head shoots him when he scribbles again and again. The square arrow - people heard a sharp scream, almost exactly the same as humans, the mercenary ran over, "it is a rabbit!" he shouted dissatisfiedly, and His companion was laughing at him. He didn't pick up the rabbit. Instead, he pulled out the carry-on dagger and cut the rabbit that was still alive. The scream of the rabbit and the more intense blood smell were enough. The wind that smashes a weak human can't completely cover up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is leaning against his bag, with inlays The soft white light from the fluorite on the collar reads a travel note written on papyrus, and the scent and sound that Kremar brought in made him slightly frown: "You didn't eat." He said that he knows that half of his relatives are both obsessive and professional in the taste of food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to eat." The dark-haired mage simply said that he sat down in front of Kerry Ben, crossed his legs and leaned forward like a child. Press your elbows on your knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranger sat up, taking out a few pieces of emerald green pie from his skin, and a small mesh bag: "What about your little ball?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar took the water polo from his purse and put it in the silver jug ​​provided by the merchant. The water in it boiled almost before the blink of an eye. The elf put the wire into the silver pot. After a few breaths, the citrus and rose scent filled the tent with white steam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a wonderful sense of familiarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dew rose and cream citrus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never thought that it would be the best way to smash them and mix them in tobacco." Kerry said bluntly, while on the other hand Rimal blinked. Kreima snickered. When he lived in a smog lodge, as long as he could see Master Alva, he always had a shot of a hookah filled with smoke. The time when the smoke haunted him was probably second only to magic. I have shown off my collection, tea, dried flowers and fruits to young wizards, and Elf Kerry has always invited him to play chess, and then he used his winter honey to make a bet to win his various collections. In just ten games, you can only win one game. Obviously, these two precious materials are the latest spoils of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the water polo from the silver pot, and the water stained on the Mithril ball was done for a moment. He stroked the ball and felt the above. Temperature and the direction of the magic: "This is the work of Alva." He returned it to Kremar, and poured two drops of winter honey into their silver cups - snowy honey, but Kremar did not Can smell the smell of honey, the smell floating in the air is still only citrus and rose, but these two odors become more vivid and vibrant in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar tempted a small sip, and the hot tea brought a sweet and refreshing taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold, clear breath is so rich and long, it stays in his mouth, passes through his throat and stomach, and diffuses into it. His lungs, his spirits are gathering like never before, the young caster closes his eyes, but he can see how the clouds in the distance roll forward and how the worms can reach dozens of feet. The soil shivered in the mud, and the palm of the hand accurately re-enacted the lines, imprints, and gemstone shapes on the Mithril ball. He pursued the memory, and everything in the memory was as clear as ever, as if it was washed by heavy rain. Over the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world made a small face, he knows, why the Master Alva will insist on his gambling with Kerry Ben again- After a painless number of failures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shared a few pieces of cake made of wormwood and glutinous rice, which is bitter, but it can only be said that it is a match with winter honey citrus rose tea. . Its raw material comes from a wide-ranging vine grown in the silver-crowned jungle. It has red fruits, and the yield is very small, but it is very sweet. The dark black skin is tough and smooth. The inner core is dried and ground after being drawn out. After the powder is milky white, steamed will turn into emerald green, energy is sufficient, a large palm can maintain an adult male day needs, is the common snacks and dry food of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rainstorm is coming." Kreima suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said the Ranger, the bird plunged back into the woods, and the worms folded their wings and hid under the blades of grass. The female wolf stood and called her child. ...the air has become stagnant, the thick clouds cover the moonlight and the starlight, the humans on the bonfire have dispersed, and the rabbit skin stretched on the forks is scraped and scraped together, hiding with the merchants. Sheepskin and tarpaulin create a cramped space. Only the rabbit is still jetting and gnashing in the grass. The rabbit jet indicates that it is angry, and the teething indicates that it is suffering from pain. They may be scared by human cruelty. The Ranger walks out of the tent and considers whether there is any way to urge them to return to the cave as soon as possible. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But quickly, the rainstorms poured down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author has something to say: I saw a very unpleasant book review this morning. Therefore, the purpose of this book is to follow the rules and settings. It is a pure Western fantasy adventure novel, but it has never used D&D as a signboard and propaganda method, nor has it ever thought of a rigid template or a treasure book. If a reader is unfortunately mistaken, please leave as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for my style, each author’s style is different. An adult, you have to say how I want to be a gorgeous rhetoric, I I can only say that each of my adjectives is not targeted. This is a strange world. There is no description. How do you let the reader understand the people, scenery, social concepts and others inside? Even so, after each chapter is completed, I will read it again and again to ensure that there is no uselessness inside, even if it is not a vip chapter, of course, I am more cautious in the vip chapter, sometimes it seems to be in this chapter. When the association is indispensable, I will also intentionally shorten the chapter to less than a thousand words, lest the readers consume the starting point of money - the unwarranted accusation of some people is really cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are readers who want to "point" in the future, it doesn't matter, please come up with evidence. For example, if you think that the description of the place is superfluous, it can be in the book review. Copy it out, I will tell you why this description is indispensable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including another adult who said that the confusion of writing, etc., also pointed out that at least I can argue that the confusion is generally contradictory. The idea is unclear or unclear. Where do you correspond to these two points? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
