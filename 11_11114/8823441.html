			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich recognizes his former pet, it is a little devil, the name is Asmodeos. When he summoned it, the other students of the instructor were laughing at him, because it was too small, and from the outside it was just a cute and harmless little hairball, neither huge claws nor sensible. Tooth decay, although hollow hair with venom can also play an unexpected role at some point, but the little devil has no poison capsule? But in a very short period of time the Lich and his little servants reversed their view - the devils that can be summoned from the bottomless abyss are more mortal, but Asmodeos is the most What is commendable is that it can suppress its own **, acting like a big devil with reason rather than instinct, which makes it impossible for the average devil to do it or even to do it. Things that will fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time it even put away its wings and tail, leaving only a deceptive appearance, acting as a noble daughter’s pet for twenty days, just for Going into her father's guarded bedroom, stealing the same crucial treasure - of course, the last girl was given as a food reward to Asmodeos, but no small devil can be so patient, especially Endure a fragile low-level creature, and change the violent double-headed snake, Animos, to dig up her eyes on the second or third day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devils are squinting that Asmodeos is a waste of inferiority and humbleness that is not worthy of being crowned as a devil, but evil casters do not In this way, they certainly love to taste the pain of others, drink the blood of the victim and lick their bones, but more of them hope to get an obedient and effective assistant to complete the bitter wine that can make more disasters. And Asmodeus's attack power is not so strong, but it is not as weak as its peers think. As a result, more and more sights fell on Asmodeos. Many people thought that the Lich would use his contract with the Little Devil to exchange some benefits with a more powerful Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows what happened to the master servant, only a few people knew that the lich unilaterally terminated him with Asmodeos The contract, but only the lich knows that he ruined the little devil violently, and when he wants to completely destroy it, it escapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time he summoned Asmodeos, he became an undead, a shackle wrapped in a gray robe, and his eyes flashed like Needle-like red light, he didn't know that today Asmodeos found that he just wanted to drink a good priest or a wizard's blood or he already recognized himself. The only certainty is that it is dangerous. Today, he is much weaker and incompetent than the master of Asmodois. The little devil may find a chance to kill him or detect his fault, so he is catching it. He did not hesitate to cast the strongest spell he could cast - he has been cautiously retaining this spell since he came from the White Tower, which can forcibly return the creature to its original plane, just to guard against morality. Monster or other demon or demons summoned by the wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If forced to repatriate, Asmodeos will sink into the bottomless abyss for a hundred years, and a hundred years later, if he still exists, even the devil lord in the endless abyss will also have a battle. Power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What disappointed him was a trembling wave that confuses his spells - the volatility comes from the bloodsucking of the blood, which can be produced when the anti-death is undead. The influence was reduced to a minimum, but now... the lich’s body is filled with the blood of the curse, he is not defeated by it, but the expulsion he casts undoubtedly fails, the little devil from his palm The middle is turned into a group of shadows that cannot be captured, and disappears in the blink of an eye without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who once violently pulled off the blanket that entangled his legs, put on a white robe, and went to the window to observe the situation outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the window of his room, you can see the entire vestibule of the castle. Last night’s wedding banquet was held in order to accommodate a large number of guests. The lobby of the fort was held, but it was placed outdoors. The servants of the castle set up a square-walled tent with no walls. The tents were made of white thick silk cloth rented free of charge by merchants. The ends of the silk cloth were tied with golden ribbons. On the smooth pine poles, the wizards used the trick to leave a lion paw print on behalf of the lord and a tall tower on behalf of the consul. The sun shines from the top of the silk. The two prints are thick. Wooden tables, dumped benches, shadows cast on the faces and bodies of people who slept on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extravagant banquet started from the beginning of the magical star river and continued until now, the magical star river disappeared completely, and the burning sun almost dried the leftover cup of the cup. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servants are slow-moving, yawning and returning important guests to their rooms, and several maids are dragging their steps and swaying the desktop and The ground - yesterday's dishes are too rich, even the dogs are full of belly, and even the bones are not going to smash, the maids complain, put those stinky wrecks into the need two The big scorpions that people mentioned - Kerry Ben and Kreima retired when the banquet had not really begun, but the lich could still find one or two dishes that he was familiar with when he was alive. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the keel with a long arm of a woman, it must have been left by a large male peacock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chef twisted its neck, carefully pulled out its internal organs, and used the soldering iron that reached into its stomach to burn the meat inside to a half-baked. Fifty canvas, two hundred larkes are plucked and cooked in the kitchen, chopped and smashed, mixed with salt and spices to make a delicious meatball, cooked and then stuffed into the glass with eyeballs, feathers In the belly of the peacock, which is not lacking, when it is delivered to the table, it is even more beautiful than when it is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the use of it after it has been hollowed out? The priests have eaten its flesh, the maid took its feathers, and the dog has lighted the oil on his bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a large skull that can’t be loaded with a scorpion, and there is still a gap left after the horn is removed. It should belong to one The narwhal, people eat its brain, the chefs scoop them out and harden them with frozen lemonade, then dry them with flour with saffron, cloves and cinnamon, and then fry them with cream and butter. Cook and pour the mushroom sauce and honey and put them in the old container. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grilled chicken, pork, meat sauce pie, marinated herring and squid, fresh dolphins and halibut, whales, soup made with vegetables and fruits They are all eaten clean, nothing left, and they are comparable to the wooden barrels of various kinds of alcohol. The two servants are dragging a drunken and comfortable sleeping apprentice from one of them. The sun irritated him. He waved his fingers and knocked out one of them. The unlucky man ran into two maids and fell in the scorpion that they were carrying with debris. The apprentice laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mei Mei turned his eyes angrily: "The caster," she said disgustedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not every caster is like this." Birdwin’s aunt said that Thundersburg also has his own mage, so he is the lord’s follower. Very familiar with them, the relationship is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think so." Mei Mi said, touching her nose, although it has already healed, she always felt that it would still hurt from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;扈 From wisely shutting up, he reached out and hugged Plum's soft waist. "Let's lie down for a while," he pleaded: "Don't care about things that are unpleasant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So tell me about Wang Duo." Mei Mi said, her white fingers Inserted into his curly hair soaked in sweat, slowly and seductively stroking, her plump chest against the chest of the cockroach, the golden sunlight from the branches between her alabaster-like skin makes her shine. In the eyes of the young man who is not deeply involved, this Fro priest is simply her incarnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Tower is a rich and calm place, Mei Mei originally wanted to stay here for the time being, both for making money and for rest - if not for the caster - - In Jianjian Port, he broke her nose. Although she treated herself, in the next few months she never dared to let others touch her nose, because it would bleed when touched. Nasal, and she always felt that it was a bit awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it finally healed. Mei Mei didn’t want to meet again with the guy who had made her a good sin. She inquired about his business and knew that he would go back to the gray ridge where the elves and the half elves lived, but It is possible to come back at any time, here is his house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mei Mi changed her original idea, she had to run far, but she didn’t want to go to those places that were inaccessible or poor and desolate. Fro's pastor needs to give to their gods. The civilians and slaves can't get the gold and jewels that the goddess loves. She wants to go to the south, but now the country of the south has too many priests and sluts, she It's not the kind of fresh stuff that makes everyone fascinated - she knows her worth, and when she gets there, she may still have to hook up with the thieves and make money by robbery - she doesn't want to give another half The ogre or the halfling is free to enjoy - the goddess of Fro is on, they are stinky, dirty, rude, unconscionable, and the sale is too dangerous, this time she just broke the nose, next time maybe Will break the neck or be guarded by a gallows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her companion was amazed at her choice of this little girl, he was not very ugly, and he was not like someone who could come up with an expensive gift, but Mei Mi After talking with him, he found that although he was only a squatter who could only share a room with others, the Sir Alex Ferguson he served was Birdwin of Thunderbolt. Meimi certainly would not be able to be attacked by an orc at any time. The place is interested, but they will not immediately return to the Thunderbolt after the wedding banquet, but will go to the kings of Norman in the Highlands to see their king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of Norman in the Highlands is at the center of the northern part of the mainland. It is not a distant distance from the White Tower. In addition, since it is the king, it will not Lack of power and wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei feels that she can definitely find a place there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your reward! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point of hard work, the reward is small, a little heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small one to reward the Nine Fish 100 starting point. This book is very good, and I hope that the follow-up will be more exciting!<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
