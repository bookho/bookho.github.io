It seems to others that the time spent on the process of resurrection is negligible, but in Gülen’s eyes, time is Like solidification, his soul was smashed into the air, like a hook with his spine hooked, and the body stranded on the ground dragged him down like a whirlpool with great gravity, his The whole person (or the soul) is stretched and thinned, just like when people make parchment, they will pull the sheepskin as far as possible and then nail it on the stretcher. The sorrow from the mourning wilderness passes through the twitching. The thief, plundering the last bit of light and moisture, he is cold and hungry, his abdomen is dry, his eyes are blurred, and he is no different from the solitary ghosts who are mourning the ruins of the wilderness - he is not allowed to see his body, but the body collapses Every pain in bad times He and the emptiness can feel it without any omission, and when the power of Klanwo re-bonds them, the soul of the thief only feels that it is all crushed and crushed, and he even screams and struggles. No rights. △↗,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An icy hand was placed on the thief’s forehead, and the thief couldn’t help but shudder. If there is anything that can be colder than the wind that mourns the wilderness, probably only this hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am really surprised," said the Lich, and Gülen heard a satisfaction from it: "Although this is just a small conjecture, but it is not a conclusive guess. I almost always wonder if your mother has had a close relationship with the god of death, Klanwo... Oh, don’t be nervous, your body does not hide his blood, otherwise you will grow up. It will not be the thieves' guild in the port of Mindanao but the temple of Klanwo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who used to seem to be pleased by their own discovery, can be said to be Very rare. He added with little patience: "The blood of the gods is a wonderful thing. The fallen gods can break weight from the body of their children and grandchildren, so it is sometimes very difficult to completely kill a god. "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan wants to hear more, but the lich’s kindness ends here, he only doubts the death god Clavow Why does the curse mutate and follow the rules he knows. This curse should end in the death of Gülen. When he dies, the body turns into sand, and the soul is not accepted by the mourning of the wilderness. It is desperate, helpless, day after day, drifting in the gap of the plane until the fate The god is willing to give it an end to kindness - see which little devil will have a snack. Rather than what we have seen, Gülen can use it to escape established punishments and disasters. As he did in the prison of King Norman, this is no longer a curse. To be correct, it is simply a follower of the generous Rosada or Angus. It is also a very rare gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who should have distorted this curse, but who can play these interesting tricks under the watchfulness of Crawford? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is very sorry. If he is still the original undead, he will have many ways to figure out this cute little secret. "You should be happy." Thieves," he retracted his hand. Standing up, the slender figure shook slightly under the brilliant light: "Before Crowworth's sight falls on you, you will no longer be under his control," the black-haired caster walks back to the long At the table, the stuff in the test tube produced a dark precipitate, and he picked it up and licked it. He did not hesitate to throw it into the double-layer box for loading waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan climbed up from the ground, his body was still very weak, and it took him a lot of strength just to stand up - he remembered that he was in Norman Wang Dung’s dungeon consciously managed to turn into sand, but perhaps because he ended his life on his own, and he quickly returned to his original state—he held the wall. Leaning your forehead against the cold stone, it took a while to get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any questions? Glan?" Wait a moment, the lich raised his head curiously, even if it was Gülen, he believed he could see The memory of his own back is also deep enough, not to mention that he has already achieved his original purpose: "If you want to ask me if I have done something to your body, my answer is no," the former undead calm Say, "As for the contract between us, I prefer to use your soul to protect it - Gülen, when it is out of your body, I can catch it - for a while, I do I really want to satisfy my curiosity, for example," he said with great interest: "If your soul can never return to your body, then your body will be sanded again or rot, but remain the same - - My friend, I hope that you can be as loyal as you said, don't give me this opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he succinctly One finger, Gülen hesitated for an instant, but still took a deep bow and walked Out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right." The Lich suddenly said - the thief who had put his hand on the threshold immediately stood and turned around: "Maybe you are walking into this The room has already considered how to perfuse another 'I', but dear, please remember that he is also a caster, he may be a little naive, weak, but this does not mean that he is not smart, or not strong enough, and he Still very stubborn, if you let him find out... you have anything wrong," the former undead crosses the index finger and makes a veto gesture. "Our contract is only a void."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Gülen’s request, the soul of the opposite world consulted several other companions, which was unexpected to the thieves. The most recognized figure was actually Leona’s daughter, Leona, but he immediately thought that he needed one more than others. The guy who the thieves union is working for is not someone else. It is Baldwin. He and the daughter Liona are going back to Norman in the highlands. They now have nearly 3,000 soldiers. Of course, these people are far from able. To compete with a kingdom, they need more support and strength. Although Baldwin has a high prestige among the people and the knights, these people are in the Norman Highlands, far away from the Dragon Fire Island; there is a clear need for reliable and unobtrusive messengers. And contacts - and, indispensable, detailed and accurate maps. The conditions of the villages and cities that may pass through the march, the number of soldiers and the attitudes of the knights and lords, and perhaps some hidden things that are unknown but fall on the parchment... so that there can be Who is better than a thief? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is that today’s thieves’ unions can be said to be evil, smuggling, looting, stealing, kidnapping, extortion, murder... otherwise where are they from? Get so many gold coins? No scale can know how to extract rich fat from the prey than their dagger. When they do this kind of work, they are always handy, clean and neat, more skilled than the cobbler's curl on the sheepskin, and more powerful than the metal on the ironsmith's assault. No one can compare them with evil. Do it better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But neither Kerry or the soul of the outside world will be happy to see such a dirty stain on the side of the island, Gülen had to Committed to many conditions that he did not want to answer, these conditions are like the shackles bound to him and the future guild. But in any case, it can be said that Kerry's acquiescence can be said to be a success worth celebrating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will have a banquet to attend tomorrow night," said the soul of the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan pointed to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said the soul of the opposite world: "The invitation letter indicates me and my friend."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This banquet was prepared by the big merchants on the side of the island to welcome their new lords and to beg for his forgiveness (before the scorn), because the merchants have no right to enter the inland relationship, this banquet On the fifth day after the preparation, the passer was passed to the black hair by Dada. The place of the banquet was at the Blackfoot Square in the port. It was named because it was not a square when it was a large black-footed albatross. Habitat. There are three hundred Norman soldiers, and Master Gavin arrives at the largest port before them. To make sure this is not a dangerous trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Repair and Yadel." The soul of the outside world replied that Yadell was in the right place, and the Cavaliers repaired it because of this. In a few months, for the side island defenses, I have seen Philippe many times, so I have become quite familiar with the relationship - although in accordance with unwritten practices, as the deputy of the army leader. He shouldn’t have faced the lord directly. Only the leader had the right to talk directly to the lord, but because of Baldwin’s inability to move – he couldn’t even participate in the banquet because the gnomes and wizards sorted out his transformation. Atrophic blood vessels and nerves, and use the medicine to make them return to their original appearance. To meet the need to attach a silvery prosthesis - it is said that his prosthesis will be able to feel the pressure and temperature of the outside world like a real arm, or if he needs it, the caster can also give his new arm a taste or have Smell (the last one was vetoed by Byrd, the soldiers were not very particular about it, he didn't want to taste something that shouldn't be tasted, or smell the smell he didn't want to smell - he could pinch Live your nose, but how do you pinch your entire arm?). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants originally wanted to continue the banquet for about seven days, but Kremar only decided to stay for one day, on the one hand based on security, on the other hand because of Devin's arm, though, said that there are gnomes who pay close attention to it, there should be no accidents, but the only casters that Birdwin trusted were Gavin and Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They entered the Blackfoot Square at sunset, and the merchants who are worthy of the side island are proud of the fact that they built a black sandstone as the main material. In the column hall, there are 120 pillars in the pillar hall. Some of them are for supporting the walls and domes, while others are just for the sake of beauty. The base of each pillar is covered with a bell-shaped seat of the laurel blades. The body is engraved with vertical grooves, gold lines inlaid in the grooves, and vine-like vortexes are adorned around the head of the column, which are decorated with countless birds. The birds are carved of sandalwood and glued to the color. Brilliant feathers, obsidian inlaid eyes sparkle under the illumination of cetyl lamps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sumptuous food is estimated to be available to all the soldiers on the side of the island for a day, but there are only a few dozen people in the hall, maybe even ten times The slaves, merchants from the side of the island of beet sugar and sugar can almost accumulate a island of gold coins, so that for those who can directly affect their masters, they are both extremely generous and unimaginable humility, As far as the souls of the outer world are concerned, any of the items they offer may be slightly worse than the lords of the East Crown, but they are already extravagant – they may have obtained some information from Dada and know them. The new lord is not the kind of person who likes to see blood and pain. Therefore, the life-and-death fight that usually occurs at the banquet is cancelled. It is changed to a dance and a funny juggling, but it can be seen here that the slaves of the merchants are not as good. The slaves of the East Crown lords are flexible. They are more like beautiful dolls. There are some traces of stereotypes between them. However, the squatters who are leaning against the merchants are much better. They have no scruples. Throwing a wink at the new owner of the side island, revealing their body and posture, and their owners do not seem to feel angry or ashamed of this, they even have some expectations, maybe Krimaar chose that They can be taken away immediately, but what disappoints them is that the black hair caster is not as close to his kind as he is. He loves food more. At the banquet, only the ranger and the queen sitting next to him have a chance. And he occasionally said a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
