			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skill of the poet playing the sitar is outstanding, even if it is not comparable to the elf, it can be said to be quite close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slight difference between the elves and the half-elves who love music. The soul from another plane is more focused on the food of the ** than the food of the spirit. After all, in his world, he belongs to a country that can turn food into supreme art and pass it on for thousands of years. The elves are accompanied by music, only this small black hair. The guy was accompanied by music. He ate everything that was on the table and drank a lot of honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connected to the six-day and six-day Mercedes-Benz, even the elves who are far more powerful than humans can not help but feel tired, they whispered to lover, friend or some more The spleen-like companions, in twos and threes, greeted Kerry Ben and Birdwin, and climbed the stairs lightly and darkly, rotating up the stairs, and the hall could hear the sound of their opening and closing. The voice went all the way up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bard retired from the warm hall at the right time, and Bedwin stood up, now there is only Kerry Ben and sitting on the hearth because Full of alcohol and drowsy Cremmal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry’s eyes have been following the bard, and after his figure disappeared with the collision of silver coins, he turned his eyes back. Birdwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that at this critical juncture, it is not appropriate to let a stranger enter Thunderbolt," Birdwin said casually and easily: "But he is really Interesting, I can sing, play the piano, and play some tricks. My soldiers and I like him very much - well," he shrugged. "I know what you mean, I will send him to the inner city tomorrow." There are hotels and businessmen there. With his skills, I think it will not be too difficult for him to spend this winter safely and securely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The trick?" Kerry Ben asked: "He is a mage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..." Birdwin thought: "That's just relying on it." A common trick that can be played with agile hands and sharp eyes, like taking a silver coin from your ear, I don't think he is a caster, maybe he will be a thief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope he is not one of the two." Kerry said with a pun: "The dark winter is coming. ., We can not afford it additional losses "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"I will arrange for him to live in a hotel opened by a reliable person," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima yawned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So good night," Birdwin said: "I hope that the light of Su Lun will always be with you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It never disappears," said Kerry Ben. “Like your courage and wisdom.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is from a thick and thick Wake up on the soft and hot white bear skin. The facilities in the tower can be said to be simple or extravagant, perhaps because it is only for wartime living, there is no excessive decoration in the room, no tapestries and carpets, no Oh, there are no exquisite sculptures and non-essential tools - there are no patterns on their beds and storage boxes, they are wide and large, just as bulky as a giant without legs, but the material of the bedding is silk. Wool and bearskins - although they don't see one-and-a-half-point embroidery, they are really comfortable; copper lamps are filled with whale skull wax with a light scent but no black smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was leaving before dawn, the Lich knows, but it has nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who once observed the condition of the soul of the opposite world - it is still asleep, floating, like a large translucent sol; He walked to the front of the window, and the innumerable wide blades obscured his view. He gently reached out and pulled them away while seeing the dense spikes protruding from the vines. They were small and large, and they could be used small. Embroidering, and the big one can be used to break a wild boar. He saw this thorn in the silver-crowned jungle. It takes nutrients from the water and the sun, but is also very good at catching and twisting it with its prickly tentacles. Dead prey, then quietly waiting for them to stink and rot, add a special meal to themselves - but when the lich touches it, it is as docile as a newborn kitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they entered the tower last night, the Lich noticed that two Elf Masters left silently, no doubt, these thorns are theirs Set a ring in the magic protection chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not the most concerned about this now, the evil and unfortunate local residents want to master is not a boring thorn - he has never He has been to Thunderbolt, like the power of the king of the jungle, he only swept past his name and brief introduction in books and memories - he is still a dead person who is busy with experiments and research in the tower. At that time, of course, it does not have a relationship with him even a copper coin, but he is standing here now, the war that is about to happen here may be only one tenth, he must understand this place as soon as possible, the deeper, the more complete it is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower where the elves live is located between the inner city and the fortress, and its height ensures that the people standing in the top room can easily overlook the entire Thunderbolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbolt is different from the castles in other places. It is built in the cornice, and as we have described before, the cornice is curved and narrow. The passage - but this narrow is compared to the Longji Mountains, its narrowest place is also 1,500 feet. The Norman ancestors of the Highlands created a huge and honest main fort, followed by the shelter and the mountains on both sides. The smaller wall of the second fort, the three are connected by the inner and outer walls that can accommodate the four knights. The inner and outer walls are hollow, leaving a passage for the soldiers to walk and pricking the spears, shooting the arrow's throwing mouth, the middle of the wall It is a dark passage that people usually call a barbican. Even if the enemy has captured the outer wall, as long as the defender removes the temporary bridge along with the inner and outer walls, they have to crowd in the outer fort to bear the attack of the inner wall and the soldiers on the tower. To get rid of this painful danger, they only have to go forward desperately, or give up the attack and retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not so easy to break the inner wall that is taller and thicker than the outer wall, at least for centuries when it was built, the orcs failed to attack Enter the Thunderbolt once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner city of Thunderbolt is located behind the Mie Fort and the double wall, and then used to guard against the single wall of the sporadic orcs and thieves. It is in the inner city. The main fort and the inner and outer walls were built. The width and internal structure are similar to the double walls. The inner city is home to merchants and knights. Outside the single city wall is a moat from the underground undercurrent. The moat is outside the city. Living in servants, serfs and displaced people, low houses and mud sheds are surrounded by a half-stone high stone wall that can only be said to be comforting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to describe it, the overlooking view of Thunder Castle is like the lace of your wife, the triple castle, the double city wall, the inner city, the single city wall. The moat, the outer city layer is layer by layer, gradually becoming solid and stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading these, the lich looked at the hills on both sides of the castle, they are nearly as high as a thousand feet, steep like two The handle is deeply inserted into the knife of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is willing to continue to observe the Thunderbolt, he will see several coherent carriages passing through the outer city, they are not carrying goods, but It is a cage high in one person, filled with naked humans and thin humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
