I didn't realize that my image had destroyed the king of the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world stunned for a while, and found that his sight could not pierce the face that had accumulated thousands of years of wind and frost, and he really felt very Sorry - for Kerry Ben, so he had to take a sigh of relief and find the golden thing from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"骰子?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like getting key and important items like playing games The Lich doesn't think that the Dragon Grammar Book is just a spell book. He got the inheritance of Metal Dragon and Quentin Elvis from his mentor, and the knowledge of another plane was fortunate. The mystery is opened, and his result is this scorpion-like hexahedron. Even the rune above cannot be dissected and identified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of the jungle picked up the golden scorpion from his palm and observed for a while: "I can't answer your question," he said, adding a sentence: " Even if I know, I can open Wan Welin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien can feel his heart jerk, this is not his feelings, But the lich, no one can know how grand and precise Wan Weilin is in the silver crown jungle than the lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Berlin," the king of the jungle called: "Berlin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burling After a few breaths, the souls of the outside world can't help but worry about it. This distance is based on the excellent hearing of the elves, and the outside people can fully hear what they are saying. But looking at Berlin's expression, he didn't hear anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Relief, the king of the jungle is not stupid to this point, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Berlin went to Wanweilin with the soul of the opposite world, the soul from another plane had the opportunity to observe and appreciate the Elf King of the Silver Crown court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since coming to this plane, the buildings it sees are not too small, from Jianjian Port to Bibi Dibao, and then from Bibi Dibao To the White Tower, from the White Tower to the Grey Ridge, the Grey Ridge to the Thunder Fort, and the Thunder Castle to the King of Norman in the Highlands. The king is multi-lingual, and the multi-lingual to the dragon fire island. In humans, the civilian residence is made of mud bricks. Only the foundation of the stone, the fortress of the nobles, the palace hall of the royal family, and the sanctuary of the gods are almost all made of stone, except for the Longhuo Islands. The outer wall is dominated by rough gray, yellow and cyan stones, and the inner wall and the ground are mostly alabaster. As long as there is manpower and wealth, these buildings will be built as tall and wide as possible - silver crown The same is true of the royal court of the jungle, but its height and breadth are only relative to the architecture. Its tallness cannot be compared with the silver crown wood, because the elves built their own royal court above the water of life, surrounded by The silver crown wood is more robust and dense than other places. Some silver crowns can even grow to two hundred to three hundred feet, and their branches cover the sky. The flowers are like stars, and the entire royal court is completely covered. The elves build their homes, and they will not cut down the trees where they are, as the humans rise. The beautiful beams and columns rise from the gap between the silver crowns. The silver crown supports and surrounds the steps and walls. Numerous vines grow under the doors and windows, entwined with exquisite railings, adding a lively interest to them. The rooms and rooms here are not as common as humans. The rows are arranged in rows and columns. High and low, different sizes, sometimes one room is next to the other, and there are rooms above and below. But sometimes you can also see a solitary room high up elsewhere. To see the souls of the outside world, they are like birds that inhabit the silver-crowned jungle, with their own habits and hobbies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any agreement, then it is probably that their colors are as white as a silver crown, and the walls of the room will be carved into a row of round holes near the zenith. There are no glass and no wooden windows. Lavender vines and yellow roses can walk through them. If birds and squirrels are used, they can also escape when the rain falls or the snow covers the jungle, or curl up in the elves. Keep warm in shoes and hats - this is what Kerry Ben told Crimmar, because the soul of the outside world had wondered why he always checked the inside before wearing the shoes and hats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Wan Weilin," said Berlin, showing in an elf, in front of a half-elves, a rushing waterfall, it sends out Suddenly, the loud noise shook the Elf’s Wang Ting, and the tiny drops of water rushed to the surface, soaking the cheeks and clothing of the two. They were standing in front of a narrow suspension bridge. The bridge deck could only walk one person: "I can’t Going forward," Berlin said. "Go ahead, Kremar, you get the permission of the king, and Wan Welin will open for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If it... um, I mean, didn't recognize me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berlin looked at his feet, "This torrent can go straight to the starlight River."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world made a grimace in the heart, this narrow suspension bridge has been extending into the waterfall, there are four or five in the distance from the waterfall In the place of the step, Kreima could not hear other voices, and the waterfall that climbed hundreds of feet from top to bottom was also fiercely pushing his body - not waiting for the Lich to urge, it again Take a step - the sudden change makes the black hair caster unable to respond at any time. Of course, he knows that the waterfall will not be a hard and slippery rock, but what he didn't think is - it is an impossible Looking at the marginal lake, the lakeside grass is continuous, the sky is bright and soft, but it is impossible to see whether the sun or the stars are hanging. He walks to the lake, and the lake is clear like air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a faint mist on the lake, a little bit moist in the breeze, just a few steps away from the black-haired caster, moored A boat, no wooden paddles or sails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world took off his boots, pulled up the tights, barefooted, wading toward the boat, it was really small, the small only allowed A person sits or lies inside, and after the caster enters inside, it moves on its own and drives toward the depths of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you want to find the rune information related to this dice? The soul of the alien world asks, what should we do now? He looked around and there was nothing but fog. We seemed to be thrown here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Let me think about it, the Lich said, since we have not been thrown directly into the Starlight River - I have heard of some things, put your hand into the water to try? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The water is very warm. The soul of the alien world said, then? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Try to think about the book you want to read? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The book I want to read may not be here. The soul of the outside world said, the thirty-fifth chapter of "Hunter Hunter" is finished. Almost at the same time his voice fell, the same thing touched his fingers, not fish, nor algae. The soul from another plane is eccentrically picking up something that touches his finger. It is actually a very thick book. Parchment, no matter whether it is the cover or the inner page, there is no sign of dampness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What is this? The soul of the alien world asks. He can't read the text above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The work of a dwarf druid. The lich only took a glance and came to the conclusion that he insisted that many creatures in the world have not yet been discovered, the most famous of which was named grass mud horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Are you laughing at me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Yes, I’m so glad that you can find it so quickly – put this book back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What does it have to do with hunters? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- One thing, written by a follower of the orc Kayu luxury. Orc language, the wizard's Wan Weilin is really all-encompassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Can it still blur the search? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--No, it’s really amazing, well, surprise, let’s find what we need – what are you thinking about? I don't need the Gossip Daily, or your plane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--I know that you need some reading that matches your IQ. But what do you think can be solved by the gray robes written by a red robe? I certainly know that what you want is not this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What is this? Is your brain? Isn't it, even the lack of goblin may not be willing to read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- calculus? Ah, is that the thing that made you countless times? Yes. You forgot, but I remember. This is not a calculus. You can call it an introduction to the puzzle. It's a pity that we can't stay here for a year, or many years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said," the young warlock said patiently: "We may try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reiite suddenly smiled: "I don't believe you, dear brother, your lying skills are regressing too much, how do you think I will believe one? The powerful warlock's disciple will betray his mentor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't betray my mentor," Ruiyite's brother said: "I am just I want to fix a small problem. Sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You were accusing me of trying to take away your preacher’s prey the night before," Ruiyite was annoyed. The whip around the hand: "And you come today to ask if I would like to peek into the secret with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most valuable secrets." Male Warlock said: "My mentor has Completely forget these human beings, don't you think so? Otherwise you don't have that much courage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My guts have been great, but I I feel that it is not worthwhile to continue to use my power for these things. Baita can accumulate enough credit for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s just gold coins.” The young warlocks of course said: “They have a big secret hidden in them.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t want to know.” Ruiyite Station She is going to go outside the door, but her steps are not as firm as her tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? Reyote, I heard from the mentor that they got a rune that helped a screaming priest, Sir Hermoth, repel the bat group of the semi-dragon magic several times in a row - - You understand what the bat group of the semi-dragon is. Right? At that time, he seems to be a powerful mage. But that is not all, the rune is said to still hide a secret, the degree of this secret can be A country is comparable.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rei is telling himself that a warlock never brings a good news to another warlock for free, the price they ask for It is higher than you think, so high that you can't afford it, but Ruiyite also has its own weakness, that is, her blood is not pure enough, but also a woman, although in Grenada, women are born to Grid Pastor, but her strength can only be said to be flat in both men and women. No one with a dragon's blood will be indifferent to power, especially. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I heard that your tutor has taken the rune."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, he may have got it, but it is not true, it is still in the hands of those people - he has made a mistake once, and it is not surprising once more."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can you get?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All." Ruiyite’s younger brother said, "But I am willing to share with you, my sister. He smiled, and the shadow below his eyes was deeper: "My dear sister, you may still wonder why I am doing this, it doesn't matter, I will explain to you in detail what is going on now - mentor." It’s not just me, a disciple, and almost every task he accepts now is done by himself, or by using human apprentices who know nothing about the inside story, he doesn’t even have me, and other disciples. I am willing to divide it out. Why? Have you not found it yet? The plan of 'Mother' has reached the last one. Now, you, my mentor, and others, they are all working hard, now if we don't do anything, then never do it, you, my sister, you are just a thief. The leader of the guild, and I, at most, can only become one of the many warlocks of Greinardari, only a little more noble than mortals, but in front of our blood relatives, we will always be the most despicable servant, are you willing to do this?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can tell this to your mentor." Reyt hesitated to fiddle with his hammer: "That was his prey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
