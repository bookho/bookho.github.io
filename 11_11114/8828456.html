			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the real master of Asmodeos doing now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is comfortably immersing himself in a pool of hot, clean water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray ridge that hangs on the branches is certainly not equipped with a bathroom with hot and cold faucets. The elves are the darkest in the world. With the invading creatures, no matter the mind or the body, there have been humans who have concealed and maliciously called them the most subtle creations, because in addition to softness and warmth, the elves' skins are as smooth and white as the alabasters. There is almost no disease that will spread to humans and will spread to the orcs. If you are injured, it will heal quickly and will not leave scars and spots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how long it takes to stay in the outside world, the battle is fierce, they will not sweat or give off an unpleasant smell, dust and dirt are like It is consciously rarely staying on such a body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the elves and half-elves will often sneak into and sneak into the rivers and streams, sometimes just because they are splashed with enemy blood in battle, or Squirrel birds make a leaf or hair, or they are stained with maple sap or spider's spider silk at work, but more like the rushing water that hits the skin muscles. Feel or enjoy the fun of drowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some elves and half-elves like hot water baths, they learn from the otters, and use their fallen trees and stones to surround their pools at the Star River. Then throw a pyroxene or fireball into it - the problem is that the pyroxene that needs to be purchased from the dwarf is distributed in limited quantities in the Grey Ridge. As for the fireball, when a rash apprentice apprentice puts too much into the pool for him and his companions After the fireball, which caused an explosion and burns, the manager of the Gray Ridge, Elf Perant severely punished the initiator and banned this practice. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they found that Krimerar could make the plumbing hot and even boiling without igniting the fireball, and there was one more thing that Crimmar could exchange with. Kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time enters the fall, the temperature in the morning and evening in the gray ridge is significantly reduced, and the elves who are not so sensitive to the temperature have already wore velvet coats, which can be busy and busy. After work, enjoying a happy and lively hot bath has become the choice of many half-elf and elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for why it is called happy and lively, because they do not like a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to turn a arguably quite private act into a party, except for the Greeks in the world where the alien soul is located, probably only the elves - really Wonderfully, the thoughts of the elves are even coincident with another plane, the humans in another period of time - they think that the perfect body and the clean soul are the most precious possessions of a living being, the latter Important, but the former can also get their quest. An elf removes armor, weapons, and cumbersome clothing and accessories in front of a trusted companion. It is the most straightforward expression of love and friendship, as well as self. A kind of appreciation, recognition and love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... Simply put, it’s that the elves and the half-elves who are deeply affected by them are not blind to each other, regardless of gender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gathered in the transpiration of mist in twos and threes, cuddling with close friends or lovers, and tasting the light wine made by pine branches and maple sugar. , nuts and small bunches of black grapes, this grape skin is thick, but very sweet and has no seeds. The result is very long and can continue until the snow is not full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to play the sitar in the thick water vapor, the flute does not work, but this does not mean that there is no music in this special party, one elf is easy Catch a piece of fallen leaves floating over the embankment of the stone and put it on your lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye Di's voice is long, bright, simple and beautiful, but more intoxicating is the song that follows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is free and desolate, like a sharp arrow, breaking through the sky and breaking the soul of the living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be patient with the heat, not far away, eat and drink the elves in exchange for the various fruits and honey brought to Cremari. Under his own movement, it erected the more fat body that was fed by the fish in the Starlight River and the honey in the gray ridge, standing with two round and small ears, listening attentively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world quietly lie between the warm pebbles of the water, the lower jaw is pressed against the arm, and the hard pebbles will be in the near future. The color, leaving a deep trace on his arm, but he did not care about this at all - he is learning Elvish, although he has not yet reached the level of use, but still can recognize that this is a genie song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf’s Wang Ting is vast in size, not inferior to the kingdom of any race, the architecture is complex and yet majestic, and the space is high and wide. To be able to allow an adult dragon to walk in it; those gorgeous windows and columns, vaulted domes, making them neither stone nor wood, not the material that can be found anywhere in this world, you are among them It is also impossible to find traces of splicing, adhesion or masonry - they are like condensed lava, or precipitated from water, and sprouted from the soil, all components are so pure Bright and vibrant, you can even hear them breathing gently as you walk through the halls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorporating into the dome of the wall, the silver-crowned tree that covers the sky is stretched out as hard as the branches of steel, spreading the dark green needles, blooming like The bright silvery flowers of the new moon - the closer to the center of Wang Ting where the fountain of life is, the more the number of flowers - the fountain of life flashing countless stars from a silver that has stood for thousands of years The roots of the crown tree overflow underneath, and the flowers above are like dense clouds. When the breeze gently smashes, the translucent spoon-shaped petals fall and fall into the spring water, turning into a bend. boat. The boat is bumping all the way, the spring of life with a variety of miraculous effects is gradually assimilated with other water sources, gradually diluted to approximately no, when it is once again sneaked into the ground, or when it rushes to the ground, it is already common with ordinary spring water. Nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden bees, which are similar in size to the thumb, are busy throughout the year. They absorb the sweet juice of the silver-crowned tree flowers and drink the water of the spring of life. The honey that is brewed is the snow scent that the casters are eager to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand holds a mysterious silver goblet inlaid with colorless zircon and emerald, gently pry open the silver petals on the water, as if In the fountain of life that never dried up, a cup of cold and clean water was drawn. The king of the silver-crowned jungle walked down the steps and handed the glass of water to Perant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant took the cup, took a sip, and handed it over to Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the Elf Ranger, or the manager of the Grey Ridge, has been replaced with the usual costume of the Elf - white silk long underwear, silver belly spider Silk-knitted knee-length gray outerwear and leggings, dragon skin booties, and secret silver belts differ only in some subtle places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry," said the king of the jungle: "This time the people who went to Thunderbolt were chosen by you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is there still three hundred?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No,” said Wang, “five hundred.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Both Kerry and Perant have amazed expressions. The king of the silver-crowned jungle is a sly and harsh elf. He loves his own people as if he is cherishing his own eyes. The signing of a covenant with humans is nothing but a dragon. The abdomen is just in the human domain, and the dragon's abdomen is the only important point for the orcs to invade the silver-crowned jungle. In fact, Kerry knew that his father, the king of the silver-crowned jungle, had moved. After the idea of ​​including the dragon belly mouth into the range of the Elf Arrow, humans should really thank the gods of life, Angris, who carefully and carefully calculated the money, energy, and time spent, especially the people. After the casualties and the reaction of neighboring countries and city-states, it was quite regrettable to give up the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this way, there are four hundred and sixty years, and the elves and half-elves he sent to Thunderbolt will never be less than two hundred, and once even only pitiful Forty, when the emperor of Norman Norman sent a letter with anger, he just replied to a simple short message like a message - nothing can be more worthy of his cherish than the lives of the people. He is the reason Forty angels were dispatched, only because in his predictions, the orcs attacked Thunderbolt that year, even if only humans could cope with them. If it was not for the covenant, an elf of Thunderbolt would not see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the jungle is right, the fickle and vain goddess of Oulu has set off an unprecedented blizzard two months later, covering the entire dragon ridge The mountains, even if the orcs' priests sprinkled a quarter of their property in the snow as a dedication and pleading for her, their ranks still fell into the white endless abyss, only a few lucky little tribes arrived. At the foot of Thunder Castle, but without weapons, what can they do without them? Even women in the fort can beat them with boiled water and urine, and they will soon be killed and wounded. The people of Thunder and the elves spent a rare serenity (although a bit cold) in the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of kings sent by the jungle this time is five hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves, or half-elves," he said quietly. "You can pick any one as long as you think he is right, even my guard or It’s a mage group.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Apologize to you – our king,” Perant asked questioningly: “I know we may face a rare warm winter, It is also known that it will force the orcs to launch a large-scale war, but five hundred..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
