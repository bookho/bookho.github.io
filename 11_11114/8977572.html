			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The...the soul of the outside world said that it seems to have noticed us – how are they related to the same kind? I mean, is it good neighborly friendship or what kind of jealousy you are? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The glue is not a very powerful creature. The Lich says that their attack methods are extremely poor, moving slowly, and intelligence is equivalent to human beings one year old. Two-year-old children, all following instinct action - it often appears in swamps, but because of the too large body relationship, a slightly alert adventurer can find it in time, only some stupid even their own fingers are looking for Less than the guy will go straight into its belly like a donkey, it has no blood, no internal organs and bones, the body is a very corrosive solution - the solution is often used by the caster Used to destroy the dregs left after the experiment and the war, it can dissolve a lot of things, including steel, but the duration is different... Remember the small goblins we encountered in Jianjian Port? It is said that its stomach that never succumbs is taken from the little monster of the endless abyss, but the gastric juice is a mud monster taken from the main material world. We all think that the melting glue is the most likely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world did not ask who "we" have it, it has always been careless, and it has no time to take care of others - "Jelly" is trying to zoom in The distance from the new mud monster, the creepy posture is very cute, with a little chic joy, the speed is slow, but the road between the two can not be described by the distant word - with the shortening of the distance The light brought by the "jelly" is brighter. It is a kind of green light without temperature. It is very similar to the light emitted by another fiber optic light that is often used to create a romantic atmosphere. It illuminates the surrounding area. Scenes - alive and dead, the number and variety can make any ordinary person suffer from intensive phobia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I just want to know if the same kind of recipe in the recipe is based on the top? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——...Yes, the Lich said that they swallowed each other and couldn’t say who ate, no matter what, they have no brains, and they are one Only new melted monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——呃. If we can't cast spells or attack now - but at least we can run away... is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We have only got a cup of hot tea for a soft mud monster, the Lich said, I don’t think it would be a muddy monster for hundreds of years. The guy did a better job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I think if this is a book, then the author tells the reader. The protagonist who had been playing soy sauce was killed by a jelly slime in a swamp in a small village - not a dragon, not a demon, not a god, not to mention that even the name could not be lifted. People, in short. He was so game.over, and then the author happily wrote "End of the book" at the end...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- What will happen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I don’t know, but at the very least, it will be cursed by countless people...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;——Like you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Yes, the soul of the opposite world admits, but I think we should not care about this now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is right, compared to their clumsy squirming, dear "Jelly" (Ms.?) to be smooth and free, it In a few words, they caught up with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it walked side by side with the mud monster that the lich changed, the alien soul found it to be half the size of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of "Jelly" has become more intense and distinct. Although it has no eyes, it is just like the soul of the alien world. It carefully looks at them carefully and meticulously (the width of a human arm is kept different from them), and the breathing is expanded several times. After shrinking, its interior suddenly violently tumbling, a helmet that was corroded, but still visible, was spit out, and then the rubber melted out two soft fingers, dragging the helmet to them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What does it want to do? The alien soul asked the helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Don't ask me. I am not a soft mud monster expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helmet is close to the chocolate ooze, and the original owner has pushed it in. Of course, no matter whether the lich or the soul of the outside world will want this. The helmet did not enter, and the "jelly" took a while and took the helmet back. It took a long time to send out a terrestrial footworm, like its relatives in the sea, the crustacean that grew deep in the land. It grows a hard, thick outer casing. The dwarves will catch them, put them on the fire, and bite them with their teeth, like squirrels licking nuts, then peeling the meat out of it to accompany the ale, the bard who was served by the dwarf said this The meat is similar to crabs and lobsters; humans or other humanoids are not interested in this. The nautical and terrestrial footworms have fangs. They have to use an axe to cut their shells, and they are not used properly. The meat is crushed together and there is no way to get it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the "Jelly", it is a candy wrapped in glutinous rice paper. It has been melted by a third, and it has a flat head like a worm. The "jelly" is washed away with the water in the swamp. Your own stomach juice, the rest is the shiny translucent meat, looks delicious - only strange! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich and his cohabitants are determined not to this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gift was returned for the second time, "Jelly" made a strange cry, the soul of the outside world could not understand - a jelly can hide the vocal organs there? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More little fingers split from the "jelly", they spread gently in the mud, quite rhythmic stretching and shaking, constantly changing attitude ... so that this "jelly", which is already huge enough, expands rapidly and visually. Simply put, if this "jelly" was originally shared by only a thousand people, then it is now possible to add another five hundred. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little fingers moved over and gently stroked the "chocolate mud monster", even with the huge body behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene makes the soul of the alien world familiar without any reason, especially its ear to think of %%¥¥...the teacher's mellow and low voice—— Spring blossoms, everything recovers, and the season of *............¥.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I want to ask, the soul of the opposite world says, Do you think... ah, is it... in... you know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Yes, the Lich says it wants to eat us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is Demon?" asked An Zhen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In his comfort zone." The leader of the "fine net" guild, more correctly, the thief leader of the Baita branch replied briefly, she Walking around in the room of Anzhen, the fluffy and gorgeous red hair plate became an elegant hair bun, and a few short hairs were not gathered by the comb with fine comb teeth. They swayed around the honey-colored neck and bent like a little fish hook. If you saw it all, it was a man. His heart will be hooked up at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Anzhen has the same gender as her, there is still blood in the body, except for herself in the mirror, she can see more elves than ordinary people have seen in her life, even so. She still has to admit that the female thief who suddenly appeared in her room has a convincing beauty - or that her attire is a thief, but she does not always dress herself as simple as other stalkers. Try not to attract the attention of others - her hair comb in the thick hair, the necklace on the neck, the ring and the belt on the hand, all pure gold and inlaid with a gem like a star, a handle The dagger wrapped in the sheath of the dragon skin was hung in her waist, and the handle of Mithril was cast into the head of a dragon, which opened its mouth wide. Biting a pearl with the size of a thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a fine gold pointed hammer that is as small as a child's toy. It is cast into the shape of a demon's head. Out of the corner, the closed mouth sticks out the cavities, forming two small, downwardly curved tips, which can be imagined how much pain and miserable wounds can be brought when it hits somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen can feel the magical power floating above these weapons, magic weapons, she said to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes are black. Glittering with golden light, she walked around the room and couldn't hear anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stopped in front of the cradle covered by the tulle and lace that was worth the price, for a moment. An Zhen thought she found that she was lying on the puppy whose shape was changed by the spell. Maybe she did find it, but she just inadvertently extended her finger and touched the face of the "child". "It is warm," she Say: "Children are always so hot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said Angan dryly. "Baby are like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be so nervous..." said the leader of the guild. She gently patted the high bed of Anzhen, still covered with fur, and stretched out a graceful lazy waist. Without the permission of the owner, she lay down comfortably, her hands folded behind her head, and then slowly swallowed. Put a straight long leg on the other side, she wore boots, but the bottom is not stained with a little dust, and the shiny leather surface is hollow, the edge is inlaid with gold rim: "I just came to talk to you, not Do you want to talk to us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stunned her head: "However, I seem to hear that you are preparing to use force Threatening us," she snorted. "This is not a good, respectable lord. It's not a good idea - you know we can cut your hand or cut you before you issue the first order. The tongue, or simply cut your head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you can do it." An Zhen said: "I won't do that." Unless you force me to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good," the female thief nodded with satisfaction. "So what are your chips? You know, Demon is an idiot, but he is stupid. Very satisfying, he doesn't care about anything, we can do whatever we want, I don't think it would be a good thing to change someone who is disobedient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this way, The White Tower will collapse, you can only get an empty dead city - no one will be willing to come here, no one will want to continue to live here, neither can produce gold coins, nor can they give information."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the thief’s division squinted dangerously: "We have our own merchants - well, don't say these are useless, my time is precious, come out Come on your last card, half-elves, what can you do without Demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like you said," said An Zhen: I am a half-elf - and the most precious goods of the White Tower are all from the Grey Ridge, where the elves are in control - after Demon became the consul, the elves closed the deal between Gray Ridge and White Tower, still not yet Recovery - the trade of the White Tower has shrunk by more than half, and then you are here, you are destroying the rest, but you want more, aren't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Restoring the relationship between the Grey Ridge and the White Tower." An Zhen said: "The White Tower will re-emerge. People everywhere will go desperately for the output of the elves, as before - gold coins and intelligence will flow in here like the river of the Starlight River."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female thief licked his lips and thought for a while: "But I have a document here - it is Lutheran Grand Duke, yes, it is signed by your master and elf, the elf is building a new city, Don't tell me you are the first to know about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The life of the elf is much longer than that of humans," An Zhen said with no emotion: "I only need ten years, so that my people can get a breather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
