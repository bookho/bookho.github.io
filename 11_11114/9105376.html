Only Fukai's eyes are reminiscent of people. The emerald stone without flaws and cracks, cold and gorgeous, a rich green as if it emerged from the darkness - Dylan inherited the color of his eyes, but because of the light color, it is much less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eyes are magical, even Dylan Donkley will subconsciously remove his eyes when he sees these eyes, as if he has been watching for a long time. Will fall into it and can't extricate themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you have to do with me, sir?" Dylan asked, they never matched their father and son, they didn't want it, they didn't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you will need these." Fu Kai said that he pointed to Dylan to see a few small boxes stacked on the table and flipped open one by one. The box, the box is filled with emerald stone that is as deep as his eyes, and then he took out a few small pockets. The pockets were made of dragon skin. In terms of the size of the scales, it may have belonged to the original. Some important hidden parts - but this is not something that Dylan cares about, the Master released a small spell, opened the Dimensional bag and found it filled with the much needed secret gold Mithril. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan showed some amazing looks, because Fukai’s Chamber of Commerce and caravan are still here, so where did he come from? These precious things are worthy of being treated seriously even in the inner Mongolian of Norman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, compared with the things that Fukai finally took out, these gems and precious metals are nothing - it is three one-foot-diameter rune plates, two secret silver bases, and a fine gold base, which is inlaid with stars. The gems, even the sun, are eclipsed in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should I thank you?" Dylan said that his caravans and chambers of commerce can also find these for him, but it may take three years, five Years and even ten years - Fu Kai's generous gift solved his urgent needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no need for this." Fu Kai said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Dylan left, Fukai did not say goodbye to Princess Chang’an and returned to his house. In the same late night, the messenger of “Mother” sent An fennel wine with dragon's blood is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the adventurers are still floating on the sea, in order to maintain sufficient energy In response to a possible sudden change, they fixed a sleep of six small squares for every twelve small cells according to the time given by the magical device in the black caster's hand, but if, for example, like a pygmy McGee or Leona It is okay to sleep more for a while - in order to avoid the sea and the light, the elves also spawn a vine, their leaves form an awning at the end of the ship, white light is drilled through the gap between the leaves, thin Light spots are spread over sleeping humans and gnomes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair caster sinks into meditation, and Kerry Ben and Perant alternately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, McGee woke up, he slept eight times, but not for the gnomes, Longhuo Island If the gnome can do it, he can sleep in the night with the night, unless forced by hunger, someone is disturbing or dangerously approaching. This time, McGee was because his stomach had dried up and he could almost fold himself up. He sat up and looked around with a blank look, as if he didn't understand why he would come here - he was awake after a moment. I started eating small fruits from the vines, but these sweet and sour little fruits made him even hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wanted to yell, the black-eyed caster raised his hand and made a gesture, when he noticed that the human beings had been replaced by elves. Perant and Kerry Ben are lying together. When Perant falls asleep, he is also serious and correct. Kerry is going to relax. He leans sideways, bends his knees and puts an arm under his head. As a pillow - the gnomes slammed away from them, and Leona took a fresh pomace meat to him, and the gnome immediately ate happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does this not disturb them?" Birdwin asked, the gnome's crunch was no worse than the sound of the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My spells shrouded them." The soul of the outside world said, "They should take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't object to this," if there is anyone who is as ordinary as the elf, the caster, and the priest of Fro, the turbulent sea surface is probably only a thief. The thieves often visit the pirates, "but if something happens..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I will perceive in advance," said the soul of the alien world: "Although I am not Druids - but I won't be tempted to let my companions fall into danger without knowing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief immediately lifts up Apologize for both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Aona stood up and looked into the distance. The place where they came was long gone. In the distance, it was a long silver-white line. I don’t know the reflection of the sea. Still like the white plains of ice and snow - the brown islands pass through them, very wonderful, they only reveal a small group on the sea, the smallest may not even gnome McGee, the biggest can only accommodate a group of fat piers The seals, they look like they are covered with a layer of glass, sparkling, at first Leona thought it was the result of sea water wash, and later realized that a layer of hard and transparent ice shell, a crab wants Try to climb up, but only once and for all, fell into the water in a clumsy and ridiculous gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still some islands that rise above the surface of the sea. They have very little dark green on their bodies and look like piled up wood. The lines are also very similar and clearly legible. The prominent narrow platforms have become the paradise for the birds. They are crowded and huddled together, combing their feathers. When they are unhappy, they are smashing or beating with their peers. The shadow of the ships is from them. When they wiped it, they stopped all the movements and stared at them with the bright black eyes. The Akatilites were very good at pickling puffins. Without the puffins, they wouldn’t mind the seabirds. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the food is sufficient, the elves will not kill for no reason, the thieves deeply regret this, he glanced at the "girl of love", Even in this rudimentary boat, her posture is still beautiful and noble - the young woman sits diagonally on a strong bush, her elbows on the ship's side, the sea breeze stroking her hair They fly like a roll of silk when they are scattered in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome stopped after eating three servings of fish. "It seems that we don't have to worry about the corruption of food." Birdwin said, shaking his head again and again. Then they didn't talk, except the sound of the waves hitting the hull, the sound of the seabirds and the occasional snoring - Birdwin thought it was a fox, and Gran insisted that the dolphins were calling, they I also bet on this. After all, there is no other entertainment on this ship. If they are alone on a ship, maybe they can try more seabirds who shot them, but now they are fast. Bored to play with my toes to play count games. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's so quiet." The gnome said. Others have a similar feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves sleep very short, they wake up in just four small compartments, and the caster has taken back his spells one step earlier. Perant and Kerry Ben may have noticed this, but it was not from malicious behavior and there was not much to be blamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant looked at the sky, the light gray sky could not see the sun, the moon and the ordinary stars, only a bright light could be seen at the junction of the sea and the sky. That is the magical star river that the casters can see. He closed his eyes slightly, the sea breeze swept over his cheeks and eyelashes, there was no iron and blood in the wind, no heat and smell from magic, the whales pulling the ships, and the dolphins jumping and playing at the side of the boat There is no such thing as an abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to observe the situation ahead," Perant said. He took off his cloak wrapped around his body, untied his coat, and unloaded his belt. The gnome held his mouth with his little hand. He saw the druid begin to change so close to him for the first time. The ground is stretched out, the cheeks are covered with tiny fluff, the arms are pulled out of the clothes, and the sky is stretched out. The long flying feathers stick out from the fingertips... When a huge albatross appears in front of everyone, the dwarf has not had time. Give out the exclamation that should be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Albatross turned his neck and calmly arranged the feathers on his back. When they just got out of the shirt, they were a bit messy - Kerryburn Holding it up, the albatross is a large and heavy bird. In the absence of running flats or towering cliffs, they can only float in the second letter of the sea, "give a little wind. "The Elf Ranger raised the big bird and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world can't be lifted with both hands, a strong whirlwind lifts the wings of the albatross high and sends it to the sky Without waiting for the spell to fail completely, the black-tailed albatross was looking for a rising airflow that gracefully slid into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
