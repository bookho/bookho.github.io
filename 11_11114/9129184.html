His attendants are all Grenada people, and even some of them have a thin red dragon blood. No matter where you judge these people will not be willing and can stand in the good camp, Asmody Oss and Ferry Hill are the devils, one is the devil, oh, and some of the people of Kreima - before he left Grenada, he was half-hearted and carefully sculpted. Chess pieces, once the undead think that they have not used their day again, but let him not be so unexpected, their children and grandchildren have returned to his knees, of course, although some of them have quite a wrist The characters, but in Grenada, there is no dragon to support behind, even the voters of Woking may not be able to expand their powers as they please. After all, a dragon with a strong blood can always take you on various charges. Go to jail, kill, and then plunder all your family and property. So these guys can only be cautiously, quietly and carefully hidden in the shadows of others... Their ancestors told them that they had served the direct descendants of Gredi, but no one dared to say it, especially It was after the dragon was missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, it was just a person. He submitted his sincerity through the attendant of Kremar. After he was allowed to see the dark-haired dragon, more people Going out, there may be spies or idiots that are not greedy, but the Lich does not have the interest to go all the way, he just wants to add more spices in this mouthful of miscellaneous soup - When people's sights are interspersed around them like steel wires, the only correct correspondence is to force them to change their attention to others, such as their own advantages and disadvantages and safety, so that the former undead and his cohabitants It is possible to get a bit of breathing space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind on the desert is always dry, the white is hot and dry, and the night is cold and dry, the water is precious here like gold. But the strange thing is that here is still alive and vigorous, except for the lizards and winged snakes that appeared in the previous desert. The souls of the outside world also saw the gerbils, which are as strong as the hillocks, may be taller than the Hummer. The giant wolf, and the big birds covered with scales, they have no feathers, their wings are short and small, and the meat on their bodies is very firewood, but it is used to cook soup with unexpected taste - just like another plane Chicken, the soul of the other world has a lot of salt and spices, the lich complains that the smell of the soup will attract hungry predators, but the next day when he turns to control the body, he did not think about the elves. The rattan powder cake - this kind of food is in line with the human imagination of the elves, and it is light and hard. It can't satisfy the more sensitive sense of the body, both in terms of taste and texture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They encountered a skeleton of a gerbil on the evening of the fifth day. After the lich was studied in detail, they thought they were not far from their goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The lion hunting of the human face is different from that of the wolves. The giant wolves will shred and separate the gerbils, so it is impossible to leave a complete Skeleton, but the lion beast will swoop down and grab the gerbil directly from the sand, either twisting its neck with its claws, or bring it to the sky and then fall on the sandstone - look here, the Lich says Here is its cervical vertebra, a few cuts, but we can't see its skull. It should be because the lion's body does not eat the head, so the gerbil's head is taken away by other animals, but its other bones are Stayed here, and soon after, they still have some connected to each other. The undead who used to put their fingers on the curved leg bones, where the ligaments have not been cut, have become catalyzed by wind and sand. The ugly black, and the gray-white bones have a smooth scratch, because the human face lion can flip their claws like a human dagger, they can strip the meat from the bones Down, not like an animal Can be used tongue and teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——And this human face lion beast may have one or two little babies, the lich checks and analyzes, the gerbil has a bone, is located A ball at the end of the caudal vertebra, with a layer of tissue on the outside, is not tolerant, flexible, and can be used to grind and slap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world squats down and looks at it. The bones pointed by the lich look like a broken bowl. It tries to reach out. Try, the ball may have to be held with two hands, but from the "bowl" fragmentation and the apparently torn edge, this ball is not purposely taken, it will never I dropped it myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there still toys?" The soul of the opposite world said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They." A voice reminds it that the alien soul thinks it is the lich, but it immediately finds that the voice is thick and magnificent, definitely not The low and soft voice of the wizard, which is unique to the wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world has seen the lion's lion body before this, and has had two close encounters with their heads (although Griffin doesn't like this at all), the male face The body shape of the lion beast was also expected under the lich's reminder, but it did not expect to see such a huge and gorgeous creature - he just stood there, and the shadow cast cast over Crimdale. The skeleton with the gerbil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The super large male lion body beast, the lich said calmly, our luck is good, yes, I think we directly saw them. The leader. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This male lion is about one and a half times as long as Griffin, but because it lacks the long neck of the eagle, it The size of the head from the ground is similar to that of Griffin. Even so, his feelings for the soul of the outside world are still like a person standing on a two-story building and talking to him. He has a beautiful and majestic face for the human face of the lion, so that the soul of the outside world thinks of the kind of marble sculpture and oil painting. Similar to the eagle lion body animal, he is from **** All of the above are the appearance of a strong human male, with a chest muscle that makes the wings feel reasonable, wide shoulders, thick neck, long hair like a mane, round and stuffed ears. Standing up from his hair, his eyes are amber like a lion, and the expanding nose is almost one-third of the face, but with a wide mouth that speaks sharply between the words. It can be said that the match is incomparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wings are the kind of golden yellow with gray, like the fur, in the desert is no better than the hidden color, but below the wing The fluff is soft milky white, looks like a cloud and a claw book book house - if his temper can be as good as the first two, but the soul of the outside world has already heard, the human face lion beast though Kind, but after all, they are fierce monsters. They will not attack humans actively, but in the face of enemies, their violent anger will also make those poor worms who are lucky to escape tremble every night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they are different from the lion's lion, and the male lion beast can also be used as a high-level priest to cast spells for healing and defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Simply say that the soul of the opposite world says that it is a violent dad like a paladin, right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——There is no more correct, the Lich said. I suggest that if you can, you better not be positive with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male lion body coughed a cry, apparently surprised that someone was still absent-minded when facing him, he raised a paw and took a shot Sand surface: "Why are you coming here? Human?" He sniffed the air. This human smells a bit like a dragon, although the smell is very light, but because there is a red dragon city not far from them. Relationship, male lion body beast has always been very vigilant. The leader looked down at the uninvited guest. He didn't wear the red robe of the warlock, nor the gray robe. He didn't have the cold air that the dead spell would inevitably leave. He wore a white robe that only went to the knee. , boots, draped in a black cloak, and an ordinary traveler is generally no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Answer me," the leader of the lion beast urged, its wide claws continued to press two paw prints on the sand surface, and the big one could allow Smedeos went in for a swim: "Are you a dangerous sentinel, or an innocent passer?" He said, the sound of the rumble is like the sky is thundering: "If it is the latter, I will send you away. This desert, if necessary, can even let you go further if you are being caught and captured by Grenada."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half and a half "The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say?" The male lion body beast asked with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before I explain," the soul of the opposite world raised a hand and said, "You must first promise me a small request."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter what you hear later, as long as the conversation is not over, you will Don't treat me as your enemy."dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you have a very dangerous identity." The male lion beast said that he The breath gently blew his hair down on his face. He didn't care so much, and revealed his face in the sun: "I probably shouldn't promise you, but I really look forward to seeing you." My answer, okay, stranger, I promise you, I will treat you as a friend before you are silent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the pause, the soul of the outside world sat down, the sand was soft, he put his knees on his knees, and then put his hands on his knees, just like the male lion body beast, for a caster. In fact, this is also a hostile posture, the male lion body animal slightly reveals a smile: "You can say," he said: "I hope it will not be too terrible secret."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Kremar." The soul of the alien world said that while he was staring at the eyes of the male lion, his name may have been a copy. The precious information is conveyed to many places, but he is not sure whether the lion beast will care about this, but if they are related to the barbarians in the desert as the lich decides, the leader should have heard his name. Sure enough, the amber round eyes were suddenly occupied by the blue-black coix, and not only that, the tail that had been gently twitching was also stiff in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, when it’s not a cat, the soul of the outside world quickly goes down and says: “I am the direct descendant of Red Dragon Gredi, the new king is the youngest. One of the sons, the newest owner of the Grenada Longya Legion, their commander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men's face lion body moved his lips, each of his The muscles are tight, and if possible, he will jump at any time, but this stranger with amazing identity still maintains the original position, the male lion body listens to the surrounding sound - his ears can capture The gerbils quietly squatting in the sand below one hundred feet can also catch the gasps of giant wolves hundreds of miles away, but he did not hear the sounds other than this person, nor did he smell the fear claw dragon. Or the smell of the lion's lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what are you looking for for me?" said the male lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I don't want to choose an eagle lion as my mount." The soul of the outside world said, "I hope I can get a person." The lion body beast is a friend and comrade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the male lion body animal has not encountered such a thing even in his most absurd dreams. For a time, he was not sure what kind of expression he should show, whether he was angry or contemptuous. Finally he chose to laugh and laugh, and shook his head heavily: "This is impossible, ha," he said. "This is impossible, even if you are a Knight of Tyre or a white robe of Rosada," said the male lion and the beast firmly: "We will not allow a human to ride on us. We It's not a horse, nor a winged snake. We are not mounts. No matter what the guys with sheep's heads or bird heads think, we definitely don't want to be a slave."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I just need one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A friend, or a comrade-in-arms," ​​the eyes of the male lion and the beast became ridiculous. He stood up, patted his wings, and raised the sand to cover the black-haired dragon: "Maybe, this sounds It’s beautiful, but we know that it’s the same meaning, human, or dragon. Do you have a human face and a lion running around all day? Of course, you won’t, then you can’t say equality. - Or you really just want to get a slave, then come to fight, and me, and my people, maybe you have a legion, but I promise, you will only get our body or your own "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outer world grabbed the neck with annoyance. This trend is the least desirable, but it also knows that there is no chance of this trend. The question is the biggest. Dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grenada wants to start a war again." The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you need to," The soul used a fairly famous phrase in another plane: "Be sure to be inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak more clearly." Male face sphinx The beast said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grenada’s war to be launched this time may be comparable to the founding period, and Greed has lost patience with those countries. Before, she wanted to completely calm down the Grenada, lest her army be disturbed by some unnecessary bugs - you know that all the lives that do not obey the red dragon begin with the barbarians and the displaced in the desert. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care about things between humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the settlement of those barbarians After that, the Dragon Tooth Legion will have a big expansion," the soul of the alien world said: "How many eagle lions and beasts are there in the desert? How many sheep lions and beasts are there? There are also female faces and male lions. Body beasts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
