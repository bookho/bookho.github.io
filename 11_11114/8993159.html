			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona was escorted to the two directors (Cranvo and Ilmot) and went to Bedwin’s room, she was wearing blue Pastor Wo’s full costume, together with the priest’s magic, guarantees that she will not be easily invaded by the disease, but she can’t stay for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess took out a ring with fluorite, which gave a blue glow, illuminating the sleeping face, Birdwinby Leona’s memory is thin and pale, but Leona can’t be sure if it’s because she’s stuck in her eyelids and makes her feel uncomfortable. Crystal lenses must be pure and flawless. It is a white crystal like spring water or air, and it must be made large and thin. Otherwise, it is easy to make the things you see distorted. This is the characteristic of the crystal dwarf, the gnome and the experienced businessman are lacking. When testing instruments, the crystal beads are often placed on parchment paper filled with small prints. The letters will appear double under the crystal beads, while the glass beads cannot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stepped forward and wanted to touch Baldwin, and the priest of Ilmot immediately stopped her and shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was well cared for." The priest of Ilmot said: "Although we are understaffed, respected His Royal Highness, there is still a pastor moment. Looked at here and there is one of his companions, she is also a pastor, she has been taking care of him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Priest?" Li Oona asked questioningly, then She saw Mei Mi standing outside the door: "Oh, it's you." She suddenly realized that this is not to blame Liona. There are too many people who don't treat Fro's pastor as a pastor. There, it was like a cat who had been invaded by the territory. She had a large copper plate in her hand. The copper plate contained a delicate silver pot, clean cotton cloth and some soft shredded fur. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think I have to thank you very much, Fro's pastor," said the princess and said: "I am so happy that Birdwin has friends like you... ... I have been worried that he could not get the care he deserved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey stared at the woman who suddenly appeared in Bedwin's room. She is tall and tall, even the wide black robes that can be used as tents by the clerk of Klanwo can't completely cover up. Even if she can only hear the sound, she can know that she is a person who is completely different from plum, she takes it for granted. Thanks to myself, Mei Mi thought resentfully, just like she was the hostess of this room, and the man lying on the bed was her husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastors called her the Highness, and the attitude was respectful. The attitude towards them was exactly the opposite. When the priests were now hiding in Bedwin’s room, they yelled and wanted to detain her. . If it wasn't for Byrdwin's insistence, she wouldn't even have the freedom to get out of the room. They wouldn't talk to her, nor would she be allowed to go outside this corridor. Fortunately, it was originally the residence of the consul. The room in this corridor was originally prepared for the guests, many of which were empty, and Mei Mei found a lot of things he needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness..." The priest of Ilmot confessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Leona said before she turned and walked out of the room. Mei Mi moved her lips. She wanted to ask the woman if she would return, but the priest of Klanwo turned in time. Give her a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about Kerry Ben and Kremar?" asked Leona after an empty court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are resting." Perhaps it was the amazing wizard who saw Leona’s surprise. Of course, she needed a quiet room to rest or meditate, but according to her. Knowing the Elf Ranger, he will not be too far away from his injured or sick friend. The chief pastor of Ilmot explained: "We need their help. It is an extremely dangerous task. We may face a demon. Or the devil..." He simply told the entire situation to this distinguished young woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," said Leona: "This disease is a root cause."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Should be," said the pastor, "What we have to do is to confirm our guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If your guess is wrong... "Then, the practice of Lord Dylan Doncre is correct." The chief pastor said: "This is why I am not willing to let you enter the multi-spirit Reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you still let me in, Leona said in her heart, she didn’t doubt that it was Ilmot and Cranford. The selfish actions of the priests to preserve their lives, if they really cherish their lives like mortals, then from the beginning, they do not have to come to Doring: "How many survivors?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Doring is a small town,” the chief pastor replied: “There are only 3,720 people registered with the consul.” He gave a tribute to Leona, “Please forgive me for being rude,” He said that the cloak of the priest was already taken away, and the two priests put on the silver cup. Leona cut the finger with the knife she carried, and the chief priest took it to observe the spring inside. It was still clear. It was only a trace of blood, and then he concentrated his thoughts and cast a magical spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a cold and pure spell, like in a harsh winter, you open the tapestry and push open the window that closes the night. The wind coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Purification," the chief pastor smiled and said: "The kindness of Hermoth gave us."<br /><br />&nbsp; The bureaucracy of the Doring Archon was originally a square fortress-like building surrounded by a tower of narrow inner walls. As the spirit became richer, it was expanded into the present shape to the original fortress. For the main body, a pair of wing-like wings are stretched out, and the outer wing is the outer court, that is, the central square. When the governor and his deputy die together, the disease spreads to the point where it cannot be easily restrained, Ilmo The special pastor asked people to send the patient here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The later the disease became more and more mad, the dead in the city has surpassed the living, and the priests of Ilmot and Cranwo are the only nets in the city. They were forced to escort the poor people to the fort. They had the potions and their magical techniques of the priests of Ilmot, in order to resist the invasion of the disease, but They also don't know how long it will take for the priest to take a break, and the medicinal herbs needed to modulate the syrup are almost exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please look here," the chief pastor quietly pointed to Leona: "All. The uninfected people who were infected by the disease are here, in total. Three hundred and sixty-seven, of which ... only twenty-three young men, as you can see..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona stopped. They stood on the wall of the fortress. The narrow walls allowed only two people to walk side by side. Those who lost their loved ones, even those who did not know when they would die and died, were temporarily settled in the inner court surrounded by the wall. In the past, the priests found dozens of cowhide tents from the armor of the consul, and they were willing to let the residents of Doring live in the room, but the rooms that were cleaned and arranged were only enough to give a few pregnant women and weak bodies. The elderly live with young children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is food and water enough?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We found unpolluted flour and rye. There are also some marinated meat,” Director The priest said: "Their bodies are able to get full, and it is their inner heart that can't be comforted... they are just mortals, they fear death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's why you allow me to enter the Spirit, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They need support," said the pastor. "From a person who deserves their respect and trust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just a princess," said Leona. "I can't inherit the throne and have no power." "With the army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of the throne and the army are not what they need." The chief pastor gently made a push gesture: "They need it. Your love and encouragement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't do anything except my scrolls and runes," Leona said: "You can get from my dimension. Take away everything you need in your bag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can give more than this."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They won't believe me." Li Oona muttered that they had reached the crowd. A little girl, only two or three years old, stumbled and ran into Leone's lap. Liona immediately leaned down and reached out to hold her little shoulder. She was like a cloud of sugar, and the little girl curiously looked up at the stranger, put her thumb in her mouth, and pulled it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you?" she asked, her tongue curled up in a lovely way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am...I am." Leona took a deep breath, "I am Leona Hyde."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman chasing the little girl ran over and heard the name she wore silk clothes. There was a silver amulet on the chest, and a small coat of arms on the amulet, indicating that she was a nobleman. She was surprised to see Liona Leona slowly standing up straight and stretching her short cloak. The hood, she made her head into a scorpion before leaving Wangdu, and put the scorpion up, but even so, the Fengmei show that envied countless noble ladies still shed the most beautiful in the midday sun. Ray,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman stared at Leona. She was just a baron's daughter. She had never been to the king of Norman. She had no chance to see the king's duke and the princess, but her uncle was an earlord. He loved doing things most. It is in the presence of relatives and friends that the months that I spent in the kingdom, and every day, every place, every detail has been repeated thousands of times, and there are things that impressed her. Such a unique color of the royal family members, her uncle described it as a solidified lava, and said that it is red gold, she repeatedly thought, how can not imagine that color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until she saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hyde, this surname can only be used by the king and his immediate blood relatives. In Norman, it means "collar." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She unconsciously grasped the skirt, slowly, slowly, and squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona's Dimensional Bag Reduced for the team that is about to enter a dangerous journey Less stress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They leave quietly, without alarming anyone who is ignorant of the action still does not need more pressure and uncertainty Hope, if all goes well, then they can save hundreds of innocent lives, if not, then the latter may be able to get a peaceful peace. The priests of Ilmot have already prepared the potions that may be needed. The main ingredients are mandala and aconite, and many honey and brown sugar are prepared, so that the medicine becomes sweet and easy to enter. After all, there are so many children among these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of devil do you think it is, mentor," a young priest asked curiously: "Is it a demon?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to say," said the older priest. "The disease is a lot of tricks that the devil loves to play, but the devil sometimes comes up with a deadly potion at the request of the summoner. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the benefits of this disease?" The priest said: "Can anyone still convert the rancid bones into gems and gold?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disease will be in despair and panic, in order to seek a chance to survive, the fall of mankind will be faster than the spread of the disease, and they It will inevitably die. After death, their souls will not be accepted by any god. They will wander around the plains of mourning, waiting for them to be collected by demons or demons. The energy squeezed from their souls is endless. Food currency and decorations in the abyss, and after the soul energy is extracted, stay The empty shell thrown into the abyss, will be able to generate new poor devil, that is the origin of all the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich said in his heart, while slowly moving his fingers on his sleeves, gently stroking his reel belt, and a variety of potions,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pastor did not go on, the child around him was still young, and he had not reached the age to understand this harsh fact and their destination had arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a seemingly ordinary house, empty, like other people's houses, black blood everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation before the birth of Ilmot’s pastor has been described in detail, the people who entered this mansion did not come out, the chief pastor tried to summon Their souls, but mourning the plains, they are completely unable to find their tracks. In the worst case, they are imprisoned or thrown into another plane. The worst is that they have died and they have been drawn out of the soul. So they will think that there may be a devil in this mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, powerful warlocks and mages, such as the Lich can do it, but most pastors believe that this is unlikely to be the hand of the undead. Undead people always have strong performance desires, while the devil does not.
