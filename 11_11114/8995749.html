A loud, harsh voice sounded because of the sharpness: "If she really loves Birdwin, then she should Stay, guard in front of his bed, not to get a good name and leave him with the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin and Ilmore The special priest frowned at the same time. The priest of Ilmot turned to look at another follower of the gods. Fro is a god who is hard to be classified as a god of goodness or evil. She is too weak and her position is too difficult for many people to speak. One party - does not mean that normal desires are sinful, except for a few gods who have special requirements for followers. In general, pastors and priests may not be allowed to enter into marriage with mortals, but they can still have a lover - - But almost all of the women who are going to worship Fro are uneasy in the room, and the priest of Fro is the first two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scrolls displayed in the Temple of Ilmoth record the teachings of Fro, who was once so benevolent and respectable. No one can imagine that in just a few hundred years, Fro's pastors will fall to this point - they are no longer the protectors of love and marriage, but become their executioners - how many sons are all day The night indulge in the arms of Pastor Fro, forgetting the old mother waiting at home; how many husbands easily abandoned their wives who should have been with them in order to win their kisses; not to mention how many fathers They took their slight smile and sold their children... These are the priests of Ilmot who saw it with their own eyes. He extended his hands to help them, but in addition to taking out the silver coins. Buying a few children so that they don't become slaves or fall to a more miserable level, what he can do is minimal – he can't punish those who bring disaster to their loved ones – that's they The sons, husbands and fathers could not force them to leave the cause of the fall. They were obsessed with them, like poisoning or cursing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irmotte asked them to bear the suffering of people, but in this respect, they can do nothing. This has caused pain to all the followers of Irmot, especially the fact that Fro's pastor even colluded with the thieves. After murdering the lives of innocent people for money, their anger can burn the entire city. The problem is that even the most junior apprentices know that they are involved in a god. Even if it is just a god like Fro, even the smallest things can have terrible consequences; and it is irrefutable that men love such a priest Fro, you can see Eve in any city (regardless of size) Luo's temple. And Fro's wild priests (those who were driven out of the Temple of Fro by their mothers and sisters) often appeared in some of the more affluent villages and settlements - ridiculously, the followers of Fro have not yet When fallen. Fro's temple is only one-third of the present, and perhaps less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred years ago, people worshiped Fro, only need wheat ears and sweet peas, for their pure love and the fruitful fruit that followed them; now people worship Fro is the same golden gold, sweet peas The gems with the usual colors of flowers are for dirty personal feelings, despicable transactions and conspiracy of the next work - if a woman wants a child, she will go to worship the Gredi. A new goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only talk about it. Fortunately, there are indeed one or two lords or consuls who are deeply favored by Ilmotte and other good gods who are willing to consider limiting the expansion of the Temple of Fro, which may have to wait for ten years or more, but they It must be careful, because there are too many people entangled in it, and the people are sometimes very tolerant and sometimes very demanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, don’t expect a priest from Ilmot to have a good impression of a Fro priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please be cautious," Ilmot’s pastor said coldly: "Maybe you can't understand, but use your mind to speculate on a selflessness." A respectable person is an extremely rude behavior." He stared at Mei Mi closely: "We allow you to stay here because someone has guaranteed you, but that doesn't mean we can't You are expelled again, Fro's followers. When you are insulting others, please look at yourself too much - remember that not everyone will be as willing to stand in the smoky mud as you are." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin felt a little headache, he was very grateful to Mei Mi, when he needed the support of others, she insisted on returning to him and staying. Although he also considered whether she had to return because she could not leave Doring - but she was still taken care of by her. As for the words of Pastor Fro, he completely disagreed: "I apologize for her, goodness. "The followers of Almat," he said softly. "But I think that Leona is not accounting for this matter--although," he said on his face with an expression that could be described with contempt. I don't think your thoughts are correct. I have a feeling about Leona's feelings for me - I can almost be her father. No, but I believe she is a monarch who can bring Highland Norman to the path of benevolence. Her pedigree, and her thoughts, are doomed to her. She was originally a pure and noble person, even if she was only a child..." He gasped, priest The potion made him temporarily relieved from the pain, but it also had the corresponding side effect, that is, the spirit is difficult to concentrate: "She will do this, she will do this, those who are her people, her crown is the most璀The gems, the ones she cherished the most - I am not surprised at all. Meimi..." His eyes flashed with a small light, and he smiled and said: "She doesn't have such far-sighted eyes, and she is not so generous. The heart," he looked at the priest of Ilmot: "Look, she is standing there, only to see something in front of her eyes, and Leona is standing on the tower - they are two Disparate people, no one can demand that they have the same idea, if so, Leona is not Leona, plum is not plum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ilmot reluctantly glanced at Mei Mei, his expression would let the unsuspecting person think that he saw a carrion: "Maybe," he said: "But I still think that she should be more cautious. Some."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Birdwin said, he was very tired: "Of course, is it, plum?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei knows that Gülen has gone to a dangerous place with the Master, Ranger, and Priest. He can't hide in the shadow of the room, listen to their conversations and make ridiculous laughs. But she still faintly heard it - or it came from her heart. Her lips and tongue seemed to melt together, and she couldn't open it, but Birdwin looked at her, her lover waiting for her answer. So she opened her mouth again - just like holding an invisible knife and cutting them, bloody, painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," she said, and the voice seemed to come from the endless abyss. With a deadly poison, "Yes, I am sorry, I will never say that again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world almost immediately found out that his cohabitation was not quite right - he trusted the undead who had been, and the latter was originally the indigenous And it is still a fierce mage. The spellcasting and combat experience are equally rich, knowledgeable and responsive. There is also the elf lineage, except for the bone shelf, which is simply a Jack Sue. The soul of the alien world has never thought that he will have chaotic fear and can't act, can't say or even think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others may not be able to detect it at once, but as we said before, when a soul controls this body, another soul can pass His senses to understand the outside world... can smell what he can smell, can feel what he touches, can hear what he can hear, and can see what he can see - the outside world The soul is because the lich's line of sight has never been able to break away from a fixed area and found that he has a problem - as a caster. It is most important to observe the surrounding situation anytime and anywhere. The lich often warns it because it will be attracted to something strange for a long time, and he is certainly less likely to commit this. A ridiculous mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It tries to float upwards, which is not easy. When the Lich controls this body, the surface of the sea is covered with a layer of transparent but heavy ice. As soon as the soul of the outside world approaches, the chill can be felt directly into the bone marrow. Oh, yes, it has no bone marrow. In short, it is very uncomfortable. But now I don't care so much. It beats the ice layer hard, hoping to attract the attention of the cohabitants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how long it has been - maybe just a few heartbeats, the lich leans down, makes gestures, the ice melts, and the soul of the outside world can't reach him, but at least it doesn't have to be frozen like a tofu pudding. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Not too good. The lich said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——嗄? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-I don't know if you remember it - the Lich said euphemistically, our body has some little trouble...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Please speak people. The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The blood is back, the Lich simply said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Oh, the soul of the outside world said dryly, I am not a goldfish, of course I remember - as if I was using this body during the last episode It's even more smashed--and so on. It's still before we go to Wangdu. Now it's a few days apart, in short less than thirty days. What's the matter? Damn, is there any spell that can speed up the time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——There is no mistake in time, the wrong thing is this body, the Lich said, it may be the reason of a spell - just like letting a sleeping lion sniff It is the taste of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-In any case, the soul of the outside world is distressed to say that it is not the time, right? They always come when it is not time - I remember you also said that it is not affected by it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Unaffected does not mean that there is no impact, I just can bear it, the former undead said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation between them only lasted for a short period of time, almost negligible, but during this time, the obsidian carved giant Once again, the dragon changed, and it shattered into countless tiny pieces, stripping out the core of Can Ruochen's heart--even if the souls of the outside world who have received thousands of impacts are at the moment Unthinkable state - it is a woman, a beautiful, and a strong woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe someone would say that beauty floats on the surface, of course, can be captured with eyes and thoughts, but how can it be seen with power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world can answer you, and the power can be seen as if it were a star far beyond the countless years of light. At a similar distance, the bigger the brighter the star, the more its volume and energy. It is also above the same kind - just like the woman who stood before them, she is such a radiance, and that kind of majesty, in front of her, perhaps unacceptable breathing and heartbeat will be included in the act One kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you come by me," the woman suddenly said, her voice was like a magnificent movement, "Come to me, gram Rimal, my child, come to my mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the soul of the alien can imagine a bottle of cola in the sea, he must have Sprayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What! ? He shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Don’t talk, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was first alert and deeply bowed to the lady. "I don't want to violate your intentions," he said. If I am in this position, I am not qualified to approach you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie." The woman said that her radiance in her body has diminished, but around The pressure has suddenly increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich’s hand grabbed a reel in wide sleeves. If breathing is not so critical for this body, he may now be in a comparable Dangerous state - his fingers are shaking, this is a very fresh feeling for the undead, he has not trembled for more than a hundred years - as his memory is generally deep-rooted blood He thought he had got rid of it, or could ignore it, but he knew it was a wrong idea - just like the curse of the devil's black blood written on the bloody red devil's paper, so even Already leaving the mentor, he will still avoid his father's palace and kingdom at every moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That image - yes, that powerful existence will not fall here, if she is real, then the multitude has already vanished - She extended her hand to the lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last time," she said, "Go back to my side, my child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
