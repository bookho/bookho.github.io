			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada people rarely care for those unfortunate people, unless his departure can bring benefits to themselves, the so-called bottom-up is just to be able to fight Your own enemies are either trying to save their prestige in the hearts of others. Again, the other members of the Dragon Thorns are safe, or from the battle against the Walled City, they get a lot of benefits - because that The keel whistle that can transfer spells can be restricted. None of the castle's casters can escape. Their counterattack after desperation does cause a little trouble for the Grenada army, but that is just a little trouble, in the same After the ruins of the Red Dragonfly's hand were destroyed in the landslide, the lion's lions and beasts of the Dragon Tooth Legion became the king of the air. The warlocks on their backs had sharper eyes than the eagle owls. They were condescending and could lead and Observing the whole battle, once the dragon clawed knight or the dragon thief encounters the resistance of the casters, they can arrive in an instant and then throw a dangerous spell.In this way, under two sides, even under three sides, no master or warlock can escape, and the treasures they carry with them naturally become the rewards of the Greinadas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Kremar said that there is no need to leave the orcs, but some orcs, humans and giants are still left, and there are some surprises, those different The caster who feels that the soul is not well controlled and utilized is also left behind. "Those humans can be used as forwards for the next war."The fourth team leader said so," or we can kill the orcs first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the soul of the alien world replied that in this battle, the execution of the orcs alone may be regarded as a luxury for the beasts. Provocative, in the close relationship between Gree and the beast god Kawu luxury, it is best not to touch the sensitive silk thread - when he is about to enter the tent, he finds that there are two in front of the waiter waiting outside the tent. The slave who put his knees and forehead close to the ground, "Where did the two come from?" "he asks<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the depths of the tower, a warlock, of course, not our warlock, deliberately raised, I am sure they have not been touched," The four-team leader said, "If you don't need..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world shook his head slightly, and he walked straight into the tentThe black-haired dragon's attendants, in fact, were only carefully and cautiously checked by the knights who were trusted and valued. They determined that these two are just the most ordinary mortals, and there is nothing around them that can be used as a weapon (even they The long hair was also cut off) before they were allowed to serve the new owner of the Dragon Tooth Legion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on"The dragon tooth knights heard the highness of the temple before they left the tent. They looked at each other. The smile on the lips was very familiar with the male. To be honest, when the knights just discovered them, they were very Surprised, because here is just a walled city rather than a city filled with males and humans who want to be dissatisfied, as well as orcs and giants, and these two small animals are just as sweet and lovely as the peaches of the morning, perhaps because of them. There is indeed a strong master - unfortunately, he has not had time to enjoy them, of course, it is possible, they are going to be sacrificed, the pure and physical children are also deeply favored by the devil and the devilAnyway, no matter what, because they were discovered, they were as clear and intact as a spring.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The next will be a celebration, small, the Lich says, but there is still, the first of the Grenada corps after winning Have fun at night - wine, woman and magic<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Don’t they worry that the enemy will attack them with a gap? The soul of the opposite world said, taking off the red robes and revealing the white robes inside and knees. The undead who once thought that Tell's gift would gradually be eclipsed in the evil air of Grenada, but he was obviously wrong. Wrong, it not only has no signs of corruption and brittleness, but has become more tenacious and bright. It is just like a master. Evil is like the most fierce spirit of the violent one-eyed god. He will jump up in spirit and wave the heavy hammer - and this robe, if it is not without hands or feet, the lich will even think that wake up some morning will see It is heads-up with a warlock or a red dragon<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two human slaves also saw this white robe, but they are not casters, not so sensitive to the color of the robe, so one of the girls is just She showed a weak look. She knew that she was going to serve this person. She said from the bottom of her heart that she was not very reluctant. This is a very nice person. His black hair is like silk in the light of fluorite. Silky and shiny, he is very young, the skin is smoother than the whites they are coming from. His face is the most beautiful of the people she has seen. She remembers that her master mentioned that the leader of the walled city has captured two elves. (He is deeply embarrassed about this), but the elf is being held in the most secret room, not to mention that she is not free to move around, even if there is, she has no way to see the beautiful existence that is said to be like the morning light and the forest. - She only saw the giants and orcs from the small window of the room. They are so embarrassing and so terrible. Every time I see her, I feel that it is like ugly all the evil. face Like a sword as her body fragmented<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the fine sand fell from the fingers of the black-haired dragon, and fell into the girl's hair, she immediately fell asleep, with tension and expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to do something," another girl said, "Can I wait a moment, or do you want two? Dear His Royal, I Although I have received strict teaching, I am still a virgin. Moreover," she said with a sweet smile: "You are the kind of beauty that will make all women happy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I have this wish," the soul of the opposite world said calmly (compared to the time when the port was sharpened - the Lich commented): "I will tell you," he Say: "But let's take a look at the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two human slaves, one of them is the subordinate of Gülen, her A small spider is painted on the wrist with cinnabar. This is the symbol agreed by Gülen and Kremar. She brings information about their next goal, the Principality of Tiran, and Crimmar will be fine. Chew them and verify them with the information submitted by Dragonthorn to ensure that their perceptions are not biased. - Of course, this information cannot be placed in the girl's belt. They are all remembered in her mind. She climbs up to the large bed, opens her companion, soft body and black-haired dragon. Tightly snuggling, even without the protection of the spell, her voice can only appear in less than an inch - this is one of the skills that thieves need to master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really want to enjoy us?" Finally she said, and her hands were tightly held, and the hands were beautiful, but they were also a pair of men. The hand, and more powerful than any male that the female thief had encountered before, she bent her little finger and instigated the place where she could not resort to words: "People say that the dragon has more enthusiasm than the orc. She wants to look forward to it." She moved slightly, her lips almost felt the fluff of the underarm ear: "Even the child who is still sleeping, she will not cry for it, Your Highness, you It's like a piece of jewelry that can only be touched in a dream, yes, more correctly, no one can reject you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I can Refused you." The soul of the outside world said ruthlessly, "And her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what?" Young to say that it is young, but has Mature female thieves who are completely unmatched in age say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Gülen's subordinates can't even handle this little thing," the soul of the alien world said: "I will laugh at him."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and gave the seat to two women, walked to the desk and sat down, opened the ink bottle, pulled out the quill, and opened the copy paper for the scroll. When the female thief saw it, she knew that the night she expected would probably only be done. She lamented, if possible, she really didn't want to leave her first night to the task, but she also had her own wisdom. Know when it should be appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, the souls of the opposite world heard the subtle and happy voice, they sang to each other, and the air became hot, and the fragrant and scented atmosphere lingered in the air. It is like a myriad of sweet and invisible little hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If you want to do something, the Lich says, don't worry about me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- That is only part of the reason, the soul of the outside world sorted out the nib, at this time, I don’t want to think about anything but that thing - You know, we may have to face thousands of deaths, and we...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We can only do our best, Lich Ruanly, we have done what most people can't do, and then he seems to think of something, the tone has become softer, the dragon tooth knight is enjoying, their mount is also, Keou will follow us The plan is to do, those dragon tooth knights will remember the debt they are going to pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Dragon claws and dragon thorns? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You are their leader, the Lich says, and you have dragon teeth, the strongest of the three legions, with their support Your rights can benefit... those innocent people, at least most of them. He paused, as if hesitating, don't be afraid of the lives that are destined to die. This is not your plane, nor your country. This continent has spread from tens of thousands of years ago. War, if you think they have subsided, I can only say that this is just a false fantasy, like those who are gray and dull because of the lack of air, my ... cohabitants, as long as there is a finger to dial Move them and they will burn up violently. This battle has been determined from a thousand years or even earlier. We are not so important and powerful. We can dominate its life and death and control its direction. What we can do is that most people cannot do it. The thing, we snatch its prey from the teeth of the beast, and this prey may be hurt, maybe die, but without us, their lives only end. You never ask anyone, idiots harshly, and in this extremely difficult job, you are persecuting yourself in viciousness - you are not even a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
