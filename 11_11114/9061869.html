			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 259 Festival (3)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to the Lord of the Side Island The ship arrived at the port of the East Crown before the Galaxy had completely traversed the sky. The port was special in shape. If you must describe it, you can think of it as a wound that was left behind by cruel bites - black The rock towering into the clouds, like the Temple of Tell, surrounded by the judges who wrapped themselves in dark armor, surrounded the port, and the sword was silent. This port is not a natural creation, but a hand from a gnome, like Some East Crown lords are not willing to receive, and those who are prepared to guard them but have to allow them to enter the main island must go from here to the island - the curved barrier formed by the rock completely surrounds this small port, on the rock Above is a wall-like stone sarcophagus. When necessary, it can accommodate hundreds of archers while arching down or throwing torches and stones.壹看?书?·1?K?A?N?S?H?U·CC<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this visitor is almost always the relationship of the caster, except Archers, knights and soldiers, as well as the wizard's black robe occasionally flashed on this barrier - Kreima remembered that there were no fewer than three masters besides the red robe warlocks, but according to Dada, There are four or five exiled mage living on the edge of the East Guan Island, waiting for his orders, but fortunately the latter is far less powerful than the latter - the strongest of the casters around the East Crown lord is the enchanting An abundance of female warlocks, "Our father really values ​​you very much." Dada said, with a bitter and hateful smile, "She rarely leaves his side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is always war in the war between the Dragon Fire Islands, in order to prevent the enemy's caster from calming down the stupidity of the dragon, he will also let himself rest in peace. All the wizards and warlocks must be in the battle. Sign a contract before actually entering the East Crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origin of each contract is different, but it is quite reasonable to let the master’s caster cast this spell—not to hit it. After the mages and warlocks left their ships and gathered on the platform of the alabaster and ebony, the female red robe raised a hand so that everyone could see the scrolls and reels in her hands. It has already been copied. "We need a strong and respectable witness," said the female warlock. Her voice is as bright and clear as the harp of the harp. "Before I invite, people who are not willing to sign this contract can leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The first thing you should do is to unfold the scroll and let us review the contents.? Read the book ???W?WW?1?K?A want N book S?H?U·CC" A warlock is maliciously Say. His forehead deformed prominently, like the birth of two flesh-colored horns, the eyes are a bright yellow that ordinary humans don't have, the skin is red, and no one else stands within ten feet. Although the casters are never used to being too close to others, his side is so empty that he is not a good person, and his breath has a sulphur smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A shallow fool, the Lich commented. He simply wished to imprint his demon blood on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——No? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Of course, once the undead said, but most warlocks will hide their blood, because the blood is also a weapon, and their weaknesses and strong It’s just stupid to put it everywhere you can see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock seems to have someone who is so straightforward to show her hostility and contempt, she paused. Then unfold a malicious smile, "Of course," she said. "Everyone of you can look at it carefully before signing your name. I am not the kind of unreasonable person."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first caster who came up to view this scroll was the warlock with the demon blood, his eyes wickedly staying on the chest of the female colleague for a while, Then he fell to the scroll that was spread on the back of the slave. His eyes were strangely changed from the original yellow to reddish, and the faint light was emitted like a charcoal fire. He not only watched, but also cast two spells. . The spell fell on the reel and disappeared after a dim white light. He waited for a while and reluctantly returned to its original place. Then there are other people, and the casters are very cautious before signing any reels. They not only cast spells, but also move the reels closer to them (almost touching their noses) or zooming out Watching it ten feet away, there are also mages who reverse the reel and tilt it. Or to paint the shading, to see if the beautiful patterns will form some kind of text, but what makes them uneasy is that this scroll looks like no problem, the content is very simple, so simple that it is difficult to leave a trap in it. However, it is only for them to swear by the magical star river that they will never be disadvantaged to the owner of the island in the next three days and three nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to choose that witness?" asked a mage. ???When reading a book WW?W?·1K?A?NSHU·CC<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A devil," the female warlock said, ignoring those casters suddenly became Not so good-looking face: "A high-level devil, a bone demon or a succubus, or even a refining demon. Look at today's respected adult willing to respond to my call."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There has never been such a thing before," the wizard said. "Do you think that a spellcaster will violate the oath of the magical Galaxy? The devil is the most embarrassing evil creature, let He came to supervise, he is likely to find an excuse to kill and even devour one or two of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a fairly loose contract," said the female warlock. "Unless someone violates it, even if the supervisor is a high-level devil, he may not hurt you." She gently swayed her finger, the scroll Flying from the back of the slave, back to her hand, and when the contract was just off the back of the slave, the strong slave like a bull fell immediately, and the movement that he produced when he fell was as light as smoke, and Quickly dried up, the warlock with the demon blood screamed in disgust, a flame rising from his fingers and falling on the slave, like an empty cloth pocket, the slave immediately violently burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that you can leave at any time." The female warlock said, but no one left, they were all raised by the lords of Longhuo Island with generous rewards. The casters around them, they have eroded their will and bones, and they don’t want to leave the Dragonfire Islands, which are as perfect as they are. In contrast, they can’t defy the orders of the lords, and they are less willing to be weak or It is incompetent and rejected by the lord - there are always people who want to replace them, and a caster who can contain volcanic explosions and experience can always get more tolerance and favor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since no one has put forward other opinions or decided to leave, then the work can be carried out - the gorgeous gnomes are busy moving up. A piece of gold fittings of different shapes, they look like wooden components that are built together by wedges, but the surface of each piece is engraved with runes. However, a few breaths of time, a delicate, even a little cute little altar appeared in front of everyone, a group of soldiers will sacrifice. That is, a slender female slave was sent up. She was devoid of her face, beautiful and beautiful, and she was only ten years old. The delicate skin of the fair showed that she was not the kind of "cow and horse" that was raised in the beet fields. It is the daughter of the lord or granddaughter. The flexible eyes also show that she has not been poisoned by too much tobacco. She still retains her own wisdom. At this time, it becomes a kind of sorrow. If they don’t know what they are going to face, they may not have to suffer. This is like the pain of pinching the heart in your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnomes sneered at them with a whisper, and they leaped up and down their little hands, and after the altar was a circular array, each deep The concave lines and text are pre-pressed on the gold plate, which is inlaid with precious gemstones, mostly rubies and obsidian. The female warlock had waited so impatiently. After the gnome slammed into the last accessory, she walked over and kicked him aside. His companion smiled and watched him squatting in front of Kremar. There is no such thing as wanting to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black caster retired backwards, as if he didn't want to be smudged by the gnome. In fact, he just wants to hide his own gestures. The feeling of innocent people dying but unable to move is really terrible. Fortunately, this time Kerry has not come with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young sacrifice was sent to the altar without a sound, and the female warlock cut her blood vessels. The arm pressed her to tilt her to the left, then dig her kidneys behind her, and placed the bloody precious in a groove in the altar, the girl's blood flowing down the groove. Into the circle, the deep lines are filled with it - the girl is breathing, she is not dead, the sad dark blue eyes are watching the people around her, she is still eager to live - dangerous in Kremar When the ground stepped forward, she made a last vague scream. Closed his eyes and died desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black caster licked his lips, and a mage around him glanced at him. "It’s a bit violent, isn’t it?" He whispered, he was a handsome face. The young man, perhaps because of this, is very interested in him and Kremar, who seems to be about the same size as him, said: "I also have a few big rabbits here. I am waiting for them." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was eating and laughing, the soul of the outside world only wanted to give him a punch and put his face into a braised Rabbit head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony has reached the final step, the female warlock casts a piece of sulfur, and the sulfur burns when it falls to the center of the circle, when it does not fit its size. When the black smoke rose and began to condense into a human form, all the people, including the female warlocks, stepped back. The candles lit around the circle and the torches were extinguished, but then they burned again. It is different, but unlike the previous red and golden flames, this time the flames are blue and white, and every face that shines on it seems to have been taken away from the blood of the living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on the face of a caster who is most trusted by the lord of the East Crown is indescribable. She first reveals an incredible look, then confuses, and then turns before the moment In order to thoroughly ecstasy, she swayed forward two steps in intoxication, slammed down, like a slave in the Longhuo Islands, "the bottomless abyss is down!" She screamed hoarsely Road: "Is it you? My strongest and respectable Lord? Is it you? Did you hear the request from your most loyal slave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes." A voice replied from the black smoke, several wizards raised their hands and covered their ears, but the voice seemed to be sharp and terrible like a direct piercing into their brains, like a Thousand-handed rusted saws saw their eardrums and skulls, two of which even showed uncontrollably pain, and even the summoner’s ears and nostrils flowed out of blood. After all, she was the closest to the squad. But she does not seem to be embarrassed, as if pain is also a rare Yao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
