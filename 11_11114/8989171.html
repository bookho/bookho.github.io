Ascending to the sapphire blue sky, the trees are like a spear of a tree, and the spurs of the dark black silhouette are clearly visible in the magical galaxy. The starry lights of the night are extraordinarily bright. The elves who are very sensitive to magical energy can At the same time, I saw the light cast by it and the ordinary stars, like the clean and cold light of the current. The birds in the forest have rested, but some animals that are accustomed to and like to hunt at night are opening their eyes and moving their bodies. It is now their time. A row of hedgehogs arranged from large to small is passing through the temporary camp of human beings. The gray-white spikes are as obedient as the human armor, and the smallest one can lie in the palm of the elf, and the biggest one is just as big as a grapefruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the unique scent of the forest, the elf’s scorpion is raised, and his hood is raised. The elf can smell the thick water vapor in it, because there is A wide and long river creek is accompanied by a forest belt. Its tributaries occasionally appear in the forest. Although it can only support the wooden boats played by the children, sometimes it hides between the dense leaves and flowers, no matter how you look for it. Can't find it, just like the naughty little monster has applied magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry's 鸮 鸮 舒 舒 Shu Shu pulls his head from the arms of the elf, jumps from his arm to his head, flies his wings and flies deep In the hustle and bustle of the forest, it has already shared their dinners from its big friends and the Master at dusk, but this does not prevent Xiao Jiyun from coming back for a delicious nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly, the sound of Sosso sounded after Kerry itself, and the elf turned back, not so unexpectedly, his half-man, black Caster Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you were going to sleep for a while." The elf said, and gave him a narrow smile: "Dancing is a very laborious thing." "Then he slightly put away a smile: "Do you think it's okay? Kreima. I think you can go back and take a break, the caster needs a good rest. As for me, the elf needs to sleep forever. Half of humanity, Gülen will succeed me on a quarter of a night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know... I have been very awake," Crema I was distressed and said: "Just... very excited," he looked at the elf: "In fact, until now, I still want to do something. I can't sleep, it's hard to meditate. So I want to go out, and You said that for a conversation, I promised that I would go back to sleep in a short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mei honey is a bit too self-proclaimed,” said Kerry Ben, who leaned down and picked up the wet branches and extinguished the last ignition star: “I will talk to Baldwin tomorrow.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely needed." The soul of the outside world agrees. He can almost guess what kind of look the lich will use to see him tomorrow. The last time on the Starlight River was once The undead have not yet been able to find out, the soul of the outside world sincerely hopes that things tonight will be blown away in the wind as well as Mei Mi’s practice. As the thieves said, it is a very dangerous and selfish act. If it is not the soul of the outside world, it is "drunk"... Her situation will be extremely embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is purposeful, right?" The soul of the opposite world looks to the place covered by the dense foliage. Of course, they can’t bring tents, the snippet bags of the wizard and the elves, and the snippet bags stolen by the thieves from the semi-dragon and the half demons are extremely small, prepared for storing coins and precious magical instruments. . It won't be used to assemble tents by violent things, but as long as there are plants, the elves will not sleep on rough rocks. Kerry's vines and trees are intertwined with several pyramid-shaped spaces, hanging high above the waist of the trees, safe and warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has reserved the location of Mei Mi, a separate small space, but she chose Byrdwin without a trace of hesitation, and Bywin It seems that there is no rejection. Gülen is looking at how they are entangled. Kreima sees him standing alone on a branch, his eyes shining in the dark with a faint yellow light, like a wolf or a leopard; When he noticed that the mage was looking at him, he lowered his head and smiled at Kremar. It was hard to describe this smile. It seemed to be a four-solid sarcasm, three ruthless mocks, two copies. The poisonous abomination and the combination of a sorrow and a sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She admires Baldwin." Kerry Ben said: "Fro's pastor wants to express his admiration for one person, giving his body a "It's a very normal thing." He hesitated for a while: "But their admiration is short-lived, uncertain. They don't have the concept of long-lasting love. They prefer a blazing fire like a boring life like a stream. For a moment of joy, no Fro's pastor will stay with a man forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it before?" Kremar asked: "Is it sixty years ago?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." The elf said: "Fro's pastor belongs to all men, and they will not marry someone. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do they have children?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Most of the priests of Froo can use drugs and prayers to make themselves not easy to conceive,” Said: "But they sometimes want children, or occasionally accidents, then they will give birth to the child. If it is a boy, he will be sent out of the temple when he is born. If he finds his father, he will give it to him. Father, if they can't find it or can't confirm it, then they will be thrown away at the roadside; but if they are girls, they will be left behind, and they will be raised and raised by the Frocher, waiting for her to be fifteen, in general Will voluntarily become a follower of Fro, a new pastor, that's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar was silent for a while, he knew that this involved The sacred thing has no room for him to set aside: "Is there no exception?" He asked: "Is there a Fr. Froo who falls in love with a man, and then wants to be with him for a long time, be his wife?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe," said Kerry Ben, "If If a priest of Fro is not willing to follow her goddess again, then her face and breasts will be branded. As a false believer and unbelievers are expelled, she can marry someone else but I have never I have never seen Fro's pastors almost accustomed to the life of the three, and now the followers of Fro, who are greedy for pleasure, let go of the waves, refuse to be subject to any control and constraints, just like we see It's like Meimi's things. They are rarely willing to think for others, sometimes even tomorrow's things are not willing to think about it. In this case, how can we adapt to a mortal life?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When we left Norman in the Highlands," the elf said, "I am sure that I have escaped their pursuit. Then, the best place for Pastor Fro is still Fro. Temple, as far as I know, there are quite a few temples of Fro on the island of Longhuo. We can put plum honey in one of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Remar nodded. This is no better than ever. As a soul from another plane, he has a respectful and respectful attitude towards women who can support half or even more days. Because of this, he really can’t Meimi found a place where he could make a difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m standing up in Krymal, I want to say good night to Kerry, and go back to my vine bed to try meditation, a special The guest broke the silence between him and Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" said the sable of dark brown fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Kremar asked, casting his spells. In order to ensure communication with the leeches, it is the otter who has been persistently stealing the fish caught by the thieves. The thief wants to peel off the skin of the thief, then put it on the fire, and the black caster Stopped his anger. They are not lacking in food, and this otter makes Kreima think of the white face of the ash that lives in the gray ridge. Before he left with Kerry, he had already become a father. I don't know if they would go back. Can you still see the white fluff on the otter baby? The otter is always long. Not only did he save the life of this otter, but he also gave it a grilled fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also said it to the otter. It will provide them with a full night of alert service (in this case, this otter is more professional than a white face), and the caster will give it three fish no less than the length of the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a joke, the caster first thought of it, he didn’t think of a useful leeches hidden in the bottom of the river or in the cave. The message and the otter can know what the human knight and the soldier look like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Margin does not know what human knights and soldiers look like, but he knows that a group of monsters walking with two feet ruined its lair, it Angrily slashing, the monsters suddenly appear, growing like stones and blood-colored fur, they are drilled out of a cave that they never saw. The cave is square, shining with the light of the day sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar was able to tear open a reel while listening, and also narrated the words of the otter to Kerry. The Elf Ranger and the caster looked at each other: "The portal," Kerry said, the magic on the reels began to flow, and the elf quickly identified that it was a spell-preventing spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must go immediately." The elf said, then he saw Gülen, and Gülen was dressed neatly on the cheekbones. With a sick redness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bedwin and Plum?" He said: "They are still indulging in sweet dreams?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to wake them up," said the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima gestured to the thief's jaw and then fell into a state of ecstasy, and then he was about to cast another portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief watched with a blue light spot in the air, and then stretched into a straight line. About one person stretched out the arm so long; the ends of the line dropped two light spots, and the light spot stretched again. The length of the drop can be flush with the height of an adult male, after which their ends are folded inward, and after the connection, the wire frame begins to flash like a mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey jumped down the tree bed with the help of Baldwin, and the elf followed, licking his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about these trees?" Gülen said: "They can come to us as soon as they arrive here."<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "We have already been made," said Kremar. "Whether it leaves a trace of whether or not they will track us." He is worried that someone remembers the spell that tracks the landing point. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are we going?" Mei Mi grabbed her silk gown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," said Kremar. "I just hope it won't throw us back to the king of Norman."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely not," said the elf. "We have had the distance that the portal can reach before the Norman king."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief watched with a blue light spot in the air, and then stretched into a straight line, about one person stretched out as long as the arm; two ends of the line each dropped two light spots The spot is stretched again, the length of the drop can be flush with the height of an adult male, and then their ends are folded inward. After the connection, the wire frame begins to flash like a mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey jumped down the tree bed with the help of Baldwin, and the elf followed, licking his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about these trees?" Gülen said: "They can come to us as soon as they arrive here."<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "We have already been made," said Kremar. "Whether it leaves a trace of whether or not they will track us." He is worried that someone remembers the spell that tracks the landing point. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are we going?"
