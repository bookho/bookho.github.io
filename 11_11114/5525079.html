			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the night, the little bird’s cook showed his skills. He slaughtered a fat sheep, two chickens, made roast lamb chops, stewed chicken, mutton, fried Fish balls, cabbage soup, baked bread and steamed noodles, appetizers are vinegar and sweet ginger, desserts are sugar-coated apples and goat's milk cheese, sweet ginger and sugar-coated apples have only a small amount, probably only one head The people who ate the meal - the captain, the chief officer, the sailor, the doctor and their guests, the other people have to look at their luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain took out a bottle of precious rot white wine, which was made from grapes infected with noble rot fungi, tasted like drinking dice And fresh cream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain is the first person to take food. He is the owner of the entire ship, the Governor and the King. Today he transferred this right to them. The guests - golden lamb sizzling, fleshy, sprinkled with a layer of finely ground black pepper powder, mixed with a small amount of red pepper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a feast," their guests praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a small part of my goods," said the captain, pouring a glass of wine to the guest: "I think I must thank you." For my sailor, there is my forehead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage looked up, a little surprised, the average person only saw the killer whale rushing across the deck Or see him agile to escape the robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The captain knows everything." The sailor complimented him with a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," said the captain in a gentle tone: "I know this is very presumptuous and rude, but a question is always lingering in my heart, tormenting. I have been around for a long time, and if I don't get an answer, it will continue—you should be a noble and respectable person,” he put down his glass and watched his guests from the stewed chicken and the lamb: “ But what kind of relationship do you have with the thieves’ union in Minamata?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master recalled for a while, he felt nothing to hide in the past, except for some The more critical part: "A short-lived relationship from a despicable sneak attack, a conspiracy to the center, and a violent ending - was a small accident at first, a wrong portal," he said. "I want to go to Bibi Dibao, the result. But it was thrown into the sea water of Jianjian Port. Hey, that place doesn't seem to suit me very well. One of my friends recommended a blunt head. He told me that someone could help me find a boat to Bibi Dibao." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That old sea dog," said the sailor. "He is not a trustworthy guy. How are you getting along with your friends? I mean, you didn't have a knife on him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" the captain warned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master raised his hand and said that he did not care: "He and I said that it is not an exaggeration," he said honestly: "He is just a little bit of a concept. Sexual error - there is about the ... old fur seal, maybe he really wants to find a boat for me, but that night I was attacked by three people, one of whom was the nephew of the leader of the Thieves thieves union, he died I think the tavern owner recognized him. In order to ensure his safety, he went to inform the secret, and then, under the direction of the leader, sent me to the Lady Golden Dr. Drake."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drake's favorite and best at slave trade," the captain once again wrinkled his chin into a walnut: "Although he has always claimed that he is doing silk and The cashmere business, but that is only his disguise - he is keen to abduct those young people who are not good at the world but have good backgrounds and beautiful appearances. The frequency is not so frequent, because he has brazenly claimed that he only does 'selling goods', usually The goods are not in the scope of his hunting, or that he is not subject to his The favor - ordinary humans, goblins and gnomes are hard to satisfy their greedy appetite; and Drake, you have seen Drake, his appearance is as magnificent as his ship, and it is like that. So considerate, so many people have been deceived by him - not to mention that he has a group of sailors who are willing to help and a corrupt master, he provides the goods they want to those non-human existence, in exchange for those There are no market reels and potions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If someone comes to ask friends or relatives for their whereabouts, Drake will tell him that they have been sent to Where they went, they left, and left his boat, and he didn't know where they were going - if there was an appendage who was summoned, and the person who summoned it was horrified to see it on the chest of the appendage. His brother has not yet rotted his face, and he managed to summon his soul. The people who ruined the villain will have more. Even so, some people who have never heard of him or who are intentionally concealed become poor. Sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is one of the most hanged people in the entire port of Mind," said the ship doctor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was sheltered by the Apollo woman's grandfather," said the sailor. "It is said that he is the lover or illegitimate son of the daughter of Krassu." And no one can get solid evidence to prove that he did have a sinful deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, it’s just too good to see you sitting down with us for dinner." The first officer told their guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I managed to talk to Captain Drake alone," their guest said. "In a way, he is sensible and open-minded. People." This sentence got a snicker from everyone on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the Lady of Gold is simply unable to get close to Bituminburg," the Master continued: "So I only have to go and talk to the leaders of the thieves, fortunately. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, he is also a sensible and open-minded person." The cook answered, he was standing next to the sugar-coated apple standing out of the pot. It’s been a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage smiles, while others (except the cook) slap the table and laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next atmosphere is much better than the beginning. Everyone has a big appetite and the cook is busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also opened a small concert after the dinner, each sailor is an outstanding bard, yellow eyes are rushing to eat their own After rushing over, I sang a long song for the Master. There was a big ship that was bitten by a whale. The Master felt that he was mocking the golden lady who was smashed out of a big hole by the octopus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s really funny, the soul of the outside world thinks, this is probably his happiest day to date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Can you stop? The lich can’t bear to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If you can be like them, the soul of the outside world will be gentle, I will be honored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Then you have to pray for the true identity of this body not to be exposed. The Lich says that if there is such a day, idiots, your kind will be better than me. The same kind is more vicious and cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
