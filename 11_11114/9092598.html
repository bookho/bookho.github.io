I didn’t feel surprised when I came with me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She claims to be the widow of Black Lev, who is the mage who used to be a threat to the adventurers before the Cavaliers took the lead. It is said that he has a very good day. Points, when leaving the instructor, you can already cast spells of level 4 or higher. His father has only one son. He died when he followed the tutor to learn magic. Lev inherited the castle and the surrounding territory, but he Like all the casters, they are not willing to spend their precious time in the fields and vineyards. The problem is that the Master has always been an expensive profession, and the expenditures related to the casting materials, spell books, scrolls, gems, etc. Unexpectedly, the castle’s inner library can no longer find a gold coin, so he recruited a group of guys named knights to be mercenaries to build their own army. These people use black ones. Hoods and cloaks shrouded the whole body, running like a fast-moving steel river during the run-up and dawn. Under Leif’s orders, they rushed around like thunder and looted. Suozhi place can not remain a vocal complaints of life, so that his crime was only discovered after going to a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lords who have taken away the people, the wheat, the horses, and the cattle and sheep will naturally not give up, and after offering sacrifices to the sanctuary of Tyre, they Angrily rushed into Lev's territory, attacked his castle and demanded him to repay illegal looting and make compensation, but unexpectedly, they were not greeted by Lev, who said that they were invincible and attacked the black army. And there was only one young woman holding her child. She told the lords that Lev had left his territory and did not admit that her husband had committed such a serious crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lords did not find anything of value in the castle, or strong evidence, they can only be replaced by Lev Gold coins or gems are hidden somewhere. After all, he is a caster. It is not so possible to leave them in such a futile way. They took all the things they could take away. At night, a thief guild immediately stole. The child, the son of Lev, was put in a miniature cage a few days later, hanging on the outer wall, facing the suspension bridge and the moat. People coming and going could see it at first sight. poor child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daring and bad-tempered lord has several times the army with other people, and two mages and a pastor, so he is not afraid of Lev, everyone knows his purpose, no matter what will appear in the future. Or his black army can be said to be a threat as long as it appears in the capital of another lord, and the latter can explain that Lev is closely related to these black knights, he will complain to Dagong and ask for the list. The husband’s territory is used as compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif’s son has a pretty good treatment compared to those who don’t want to get a drop of water in a cage. He can drink every three days. A glass of light wine can eat a piece of fat every five days, so he stayed in the cage for twenty-five days before finally returning to the mourning wilderness. From the first day to the last day, Lev and his black army It seems that there is no such thing as a mother. Only the mother of the child came to cry, but the answer of the lord is very clever. It will only be a shameless thief. It will definitely not be the son of a prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year later, Lev’s wife wore a black coat and hung a black veil, telling everyone that her husband was dead. Although people still call her the widow of "Black Lev", some people have tried to count her and this territory, but because there are too many enemies before Lev, no greedy gray wolf is willing to give up in the mouth. This piece of flesh and blood gave the widow a chance to wheezing. She told Dagong that if the Dagong would let her live in the castle before she died, she would be the owner of this territory, she would never marry. Then this land is the land of no ownership after her death, and the Grand Duke can take it back in a logical way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the marriage tax and the gift of the so-called fiance candidate, Dagong is of course more willing to return to the territories, so the whole thing is so happily decided It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think that the gold and silverware stolen by the black-footed half-body are also the grand prince’s reward, for a total of twelve silver and silver cups, and Two candlesticks, a gold necklace and a flower crown, four rings, these things are perfectly fine even in the Dagong's room, but Mrs. Lev did not inherit their children, so she waited for her to leave. These things will still return to the hands of the descendants of the Grand Duke with the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if these things are lost, it will make Lev’s widow more frustrated, or let Dagong be more frustrated, but in any case, Mrs. Lev It is also impossible to let them disappear without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid unnecessary doubts, Perant did not ask to be alone with the black-footed half-length, they completed the trial in the courtyard, black feet half-length The human language is born out of the halflings, but they have their own characteristics. It sounds a bit like a snake in the tongue. It is like a frog screaming, and the thinking of the black-footed half-body is chaotic and incoherent. Hey, there weren't many people in the audience except Perant and Kerry Ben, so Perant stopped his speech before the half-body he asked: "Use lingua franca." Perant said: "I know you will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-footed halfman reluctantly licked his own feet, and the black hair on his feet was entangled in mud: "Well," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you stolen the lady's gold and silverware?" Perant asked bluntly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mi has..." The half-length population voice answered very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He certainly won't admit it." The Cavaliers leader couldn't wait to say, "He knows he will be hanged outside the walls when he admits."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That may be difficult," Gülen said sarcastically: "I am really worried that he will fall down with a whole wall when he just hangs."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers leader gave him a vicious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anmen only..." The halfling swallowed and said: "Only take the salt... there is better than no, fish."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you coming here," Perant asked seriously: "There should be your food in the swamp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No..." The black-footed half-length man began to rub his feet with irritability: "No, can, can't pull... there is a dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Gnomish double-footed dragon?" This is indeed possible, the gnome double-footed dragons often clustered to attack halflings, these guys are fat, that is, a little more bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can it still be a dragon?" The Cavaliers leader interjected for the second time: "What do you ask for? Adventurer." He looked at him questioningly. Perant: "Are you collecting intelligence? Or are you going through the swamp?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very sensitive human, the lich said in his heart, but it was too sensitive . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little dragon, a lot," the halfling shouted: "Many, many, squid, output..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will confirm it," Perant said. "So you really didn't take anything other than salt and fish?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Dead fish," the black-footed halfman insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, dead fish," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers leader sneered, "I don't think a thief is worthy of trust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then I came to find a witness who would not lie," Perant said kindly, and he placed a small flute between his lips and blew it softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of trick are you playing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly safe," Druid Say: "Your master has not spoken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight leader turned and glanced at the lady, the old woman sitting in the chair where the maid was moving for her. Put your hands on your lap and stare at it with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much, a fat black-haired house mouse got out of a grass, and it looked around without fear, shaking it. The fur, sweeping away the icy snow, quickly ran to the front of Perant, and called a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is something you need to help." Perant said, then snorted a few times, and after the house mouse screamed twice, Perant’s long story Said for a long time. Then the house mouse jumped from his hand and went into the hay without a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that this trick is really interesting," said the Cavaliers. "I can give you a copper coin. What do you think?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not good," Perant raised her hand and pulled down her hood, revealing a different look and tip from humans: "I am a druid, Child, I let it and its children and grandchildren look for those lost things. If they disappeared last night, as you said, then I think they are not too far away from us."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s stupid," the knight’s leader muttered, putting his hand on the sword, but seeing the adventurers, especially the wizard in white robe. He obviously changed his mind: "My knights found a deer," he said to Mrs. Lev. "I think they will need help. I can give them some help. Maybe we can meet a deer. Maybe we can. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he immediately noticed that Mrs. Lev’s attention was not on him. She stared at Perant in a fanatical manner, just as her husband or son suddenly returned as Perant, but this expression If it appears on the face of a young girl, she can barely endure it, but Mrs. Lev has already been white and white, wrinkles are as dense as the folds of silk, and the skin is hung in the lower jaw like the cock's sac. This expression will only make People want to vomit or run away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t need Mrs. Lev’s answer, but he didn’t go away as expected, because the lich only stretched out, Gülen The activated silver rope will be thrown out intentionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is an update within an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomish double-footed dragon?" It is indeed possible that the gnome's two-legged dragons will often attack the halflings in groups. These guys are fat and a little bit more. bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can it still be a dragon?" The Cavaliers leader interjected for the second time: "What do you ask for? Adventurer." He looked at him questioningly. Perant: "Are you collecting intelligence? Or are you going through the swamp?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very sensitive human, the lich said in his heart, but it was too sensitive . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little dragon, a lot," the halfling shouted: "Many, many, squid, output..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will confirm it," Perant said. "So you really didn't take anything other than salt and fish?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The dead fish," the black-footed half-man insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, dead fish," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers leader sneered, "I don't think a thief is worthy of trust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then I came to find a witness who would not lie," Perant said kindly, and he placed a small flute between his lips and blew it softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of trick are you playing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
