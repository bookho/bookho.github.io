			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not someone else who walks in, it’s Birdwin Don Clay, he’s just coming down from the competition, wearing a chain armor and holding a helmet in his arms. When he saw Gülen, he gave a slight gray eyebrow, but said nothing, just walked over and kissed the girl's cheek with Leona, and then he walked to the reception room. A door. Although Baldwin's movements are very fast, and Gülen can't look at the bright, but who can escape the eyes of a thief, it seems that he and Mei Mei are not only good things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connected to the living room is a small suite, the inside is the bedroom, outside is a small hall for living, Birdwin hangs his helmet in Li Next to Oona's cloak, she took off the wide sword and leaned it against the virgin sword of the king. The heavy chain was held by Birdwin. He opened a box and placed it on a soft velvet. The magical velvet will clean and polish the chain armor, so that each small ring can become light, and Leona's chain armor is also on the side, has been properly managed, exudes the secret of the secret silver Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin walked into the bedroom, now, apart from not having a marriage contract, he and Leona are like a real couple - Bywin swears Originally, he did not have this idea. In fact, he always felt that the girl was not a love for him, but an unreasonable fascination. It came quickly and went equally fast. In the past few years, he has been waiting for Leo. Na is apologetic or tired of her expression - although on the Longhuo Island, he is angry at Li Naina’s betrayal of him, but there is always a sense of relaxation in the heart, "ah, finally come", even now that Li is proved Oona still loves him, but on this point, Baldwin did not try to explain or shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for Leona, he has to admit that this woman she loves, Baldwin is not as close as a woman like Plum. Before she left Longhuo, her most intimate behavior was just a warm kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is driving him, and Leona makes a change, Birdwin thinks, he doesn’t know what Leona thinks, but He did feel the crisis - when the royal family of Norman in the Highlands was dying with only a lonely flower of Leona, even the most rigid jazz must make a concession, not to mention Norman’s inheritance method as early as one year. It was revised more than once. In the future, Leona will surely become the king of Norman, and it is the first queen. Her identity can be said to have climbed from the mud to the morning light. People bowed to her humbly, and called her Highness, perhaps in the heart. Still shouting "Your Majesty", offering countless gifts, from the arms of the big silver plate to the gold crown inlaid with gems, from the white bear skin to the ivory wine glass, from the gorgeous silk to the smooth Fine linen, gold coins and silver coins quickly accumulate in the empty inner library, turning from a hill to a peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Leona’s side, there are more young Sir Alex and the Cavaliers, they are graceful, courteous, and have no cleft palate in the face. With wrinkles, vibrant, gentle, if you want to ask if they are brave - one or two of the same Knights who are followers of Tell can compete with Birdwin, they have waiters, have a squat, have an army, and They dance, play the piano and write poetry. They have all the advantages of Baldwin, but they don't have the disadvantages of Birdwin. Don't say Leona, or any girl, even Birdwin, if he is also a woman, he will pick one from it instead of staying with an old, violent fallen knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Leona hugged Bywin on a cold night, the former Thunderbolt lord gave in for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the relationship became more intimate, they almost regretted it - not regretting doing it, but regretting not doing it earlier, as if after revealing The heart is also presented straight to the eyes of the lover. They curiously explored each other's body and heart, and were surprised to find that they were so stupid, stupid enough to not fully understand the trust that the other party gave themselves, and such sweet love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like now, Baldwin can understand why Leona uses someone like Gülen, just like she uses the Baroness, even if he used to Expressed opposition, just as people need cats to catch the mice in the night, then you can't blame the cat for stealing fish and dried meat – you can't let the dog catch the mouse because the dog is more loyal and cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened another small door connected to the bedroom, behind which was a room entirely made of alabaster, with a magical effect in the bathroom. In the tub, the water inside is always clean and steamy. Birdwin untied his long underwear and sat down slowly. The hot water suddenly immersed in his chest, and their heat penetrated into the skin, letting Birdwin endure. He lived a little trembling—he heard the sound of the door being opened and closed, and he was familiar with the footsteps of the person. It was Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
