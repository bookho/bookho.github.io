			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era of Morton and Birdwin, every late autumn, soldiers will be sent out to remove the vegetation within 50 feet of the wall. Then the thatched grass that has been dried by the wind and the sun will be ignited, and the fire will spread rapidly. From the end of the mouth to the place where the mouth is burned, sometimes they will burn for many days until the temperature drops and the frost covers the ground. Sometimes they go out very quickly, and the mage on the walls will inform the situation that they are vigilant - because the thatch can be extinguished within one or two days, it can only be said that it touches the edge of the orc's tribe - When the orcs are stationed, their livestock and slaves will eat the surrounding thatch, and the tribe's priests will pray for the orc's god Kauka to lower the magic, perhaps just for a while. Sticky, stinking rain can keep their tribes from the flames and black smoke<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Dylan took control of it, the people who dared to mention Bedwin and Morton were dead or expelled, and some, though I mentioned the burning of the mouth, but because Dylan was busy setting up the squad at that time, he just let it go, and the suggesting mage didn’t know if Dylan knew it was the experience accumulated by the masters of the first two territories. Out of timidity, they chose to swear by wisely - since they did not leave the Thunderbolt and were willing to work for the new lord, they would not be an innocent person.Later, the attack of the orcs was as expected. What made them feel at ease was that Dylan’s magic and maps were as impeccable as everyone expected, and the orcs could not even reach the walls and soldiers, only outside the transparent barrier. The screaming and screaming of the grin, but the slings and spears, arrows and even fireballs, lightning and ice on the walls of the triple city can cause irreparable damage to the orcs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the orcs was soaked in the land of the mouth, the soldiers burned the ugly bodies on the spot, and the ashes of the bones and flesh were scattered in the thatched grass. In the second year of June, these thatched grasses grew to the waist of human beings. In October, these thatched grasses were almost as tall as human breasts, and as dense as rain, they supported each other and the caravans walked inside. At the time, it’s like opening a blue-green wave. It’s just passed by, and there’s no trace left behind.In the frosty weather, their color turned into linen and luxuriant gold, covered with a thick frost cover. When it was white, the frost cover melted and flowed along the grass stems to the earth. At night, these wet stems freezed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frozen thatched grass makes the soldiers less willing to deal with them, they will not only open the clothes, but also the skin in the clothesNow, in Thunder, the soldiers are no longer objects of respect and envy, the Master is, all resources are tilted to them without restrictions - but the soldiers believe that more likely because of Thundersburg Acting lords always fill their pockets with unscrupulous means. Anyway, those proud mages, the soldiers’ linens, wooden boots, accessories for weapons and equipment, ale or bread, and one or two silver coins. What? They don’t even look at it at all<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these are very important for the soldiers. They don’t have linen and wooden boots. Of course they will care more about the original one, so no soldiers are willing to go. When Baldwin is still there, he will reinforce and rebuild various fortifications every year; without new accessories, they will no longer care about those bows, slingers and spears, and anyway, magic has replaced them; Without ale and bread, they try to reduce their own consumption. If they are caught in the past, they will be whipped for twenty to fifty. In serious cases, they will even be executed, just like the soldiers’ companions. It is proposed that going to a sheltered place to sleep for a while has become a small thing that will happen at any time. Even if the knight and the captain see it, they will only turn their heads. Why do they know that they are still there? Purely because there are no soldiers and knights on the wall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these thatched grasses, they are finally released monsters, they are the creation of red robe and devil, with human and orc blood, eating The blood and flesh of their mothers grew up. In just a few months, their numbers have been able to be equal to the orc soldiers, and since the last batch of female servants died, their supervision has been from orcs. Changed to warlocks and mages, otherwise they can jump out of the high fence at any time, just grab any living creature to bite and eat, in the priest, of course, under the direction of Gersh, selected the offensive One day later, even the orcs put down their tight shoulders. You know, although they are very careful, there is still a monster of "Sheep" that escapes, and the number of fingers is ruined. Fifty tents, whether they are orc warriors or slaves, have become their mouthfuls of food, not even a bone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they have human wisdom, or more insane than humans, and have the instinct of the beast, no one has taught them what to do, but they were born I learned to be quiet, to lie down, not to attract anyone's attention - although they are crowded, they will only swallow the same kind if their companions have been seriously injured or die, and they will not only focus on one. A prey, in the case of a large number of prey, they will kill the existing, warm, actionable, flesh and blood, and then slowly eat it - the reason why the fifty tents will be lost It’s so fast, it’s because of this calmness, and now they are driven by the wizards and warlocks, rushing into the mouth, not stupidly standing up, looking around or making other things that will cause prey, or They kept bending over the back, and as soon as they saw the thatched grass, they immediately went in and hid themselves—in the dark, they were as visible as the orcs, but they no longer needed eyes. They had like hyenas Vultures generally keen sense of smell, they know that, behind thick brick, with their favorite food<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companion, who is also the wife of his wife, suddenly gave a cry of horror, and when the soldier failed to reflect what had happened, he was forced to grab his neck and fell down with the person behind him. Just above him, where the light of the torch is shining, a monster is squatting in the air - no, he is sure that there is no wrong place, it is suspended in the air, like a lizard crouching on the top of the glass, The magic barrier blocks it<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person behind him violently gasped, then the soldier heard him laugh, although the laughter still trembled with fear, but no matter what It was a laugh: "Too... great..." The soldier heard that it was the voice of their captain. "Too good... I said," the captain’s hand touched the soldier’s back neck, the soldier Only to find that his fingers are cold is like a dead man: "Too... wonderful," the captain continued. "This is... magic, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"CorrectThe soldier said in awe<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commotion like this spread throughout the three walls, the pre-arranged torches were lit up one by one, and the walls were bright and white, and people saw It’s like an ant-like monster around a drop of honey, they crouch on a transparent barrier, two, or three, or maybe eight eyes squinting and watching the situation below. Their distance from humans is so close, and it is like a ridiculous specimen. Humans can clearly see their appearance and structure. The bodies of these monsters are human, but their heads. The part is like a bird or a crocodile that has been stretched from the mouth. It should be called a long kiss. It is a full-mouthed tooth. The red tongue of the squid can be curled up and hidden in the nose. Like a spear, their arms and legs are difficult to distinguish, and the number of fingers and toes is different. The only thing that is the same is that they all have curved claws. These claws are scratched on the barrier. To destroy them But no, yes, no trace of scars<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentices of the mages flew on the wall, and several mages and warlocks soon appeared. They were extremely contemptuous of the panic and uneasiness of the people. And mocking: "I don't see any problem, sir," one warlock said to another warlock nearby: "What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also look for There is no reason why we are here, although their description is like the wall has collapsed, thousands of monsters have been filled with the entire Thunderbolt"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One hundred sorry," said the Cavaliers: "but...these things..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It’s just some deformities," said a warlock. "I feel very worried about His Highness Dylan and the new king of the future. His knight is so timid that he should be so careless that he can’t even touch him. You must know that the ladies will wait until the mouse climbs into the skirt to scream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His humiliation made the Cavaliers look pale, he was Dylan's knight, not Morton or Birdwin, but the caster's status is Thunderbolt is unshakable, and he only bows his head in a respectful manner, muttering some sorry words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay," said a mage. "We have to forgive these mortals."He said: "I went to the center tower to see"The latter sentence is spoken in the silent language, the knight can't understand, but the caster can understand<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think it’s necessary, the warlock who previously mocked the knight also said in the same way<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are so ugly, the Master said, I think seeing these things, my breakfast for tomorrow can be omitted.The warlock looked up and he must admit that these things are not very good-looking. In addition to the distorted body and face, their skin is deep and flesh-colored, with no hair, only sore bags and sparse scales. There are also translucent mucus like cockroaches, and some well-known cracks and bulges. Even the warlocks must admit that they are really unsightly. If they are just there, not only breakfast, but even Lunch and dinner may also be cut.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With you, he said in a lonely language, then, gave it to you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, give it to me, the Master doesn’t care, he just reminds me anyway.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbolt people don’t know where the central tower is. In the process of rebuilding the city, the class is more strictly divided, and businessmen and civilians are fundamental. I can't get close to where the casters are, and the center tower, although it has such a name, does not extend into the sky and the sun, but is deeply embedded in the cold land of the North, where thousands of slaves die. Under this project, but in contrast, this is a miraculous building. It is like a nest of termites. It is divided into a number of branches by a trunk, some are connected to each other, some are not, and the end of the main root is also the deepest. The place is a large room with eight warlocks and mages supervising the entire array every day - the image is like an invisible cube, shrouded the triple wall and Thunder Castle under its power, and These casters correspond to the eight points of the cube. In front of the round table around them, there is a huge devil's paper, and all the buildings and roads of Thunder Castle stand or stretch in an impeccable manner. On the moving white paper, the red line that emanate from the center tower spreads in all directions, just like the root of the bayonet vine, without any tiny spots, and on the line, there are eight bright spots, that is The key to the array - rune plate<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
