			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos laughed and made almost all the devils criticized, and its laughter was soft and soft in the endless abyss. Even a minor succubus, or the baby of a human female and the devil, the laughter of a half-devil is more threatening than its laughter, and its scream, its deformation, it The tail and teeth, its size is destined to be not as good as a piece of food (Asmodeos is quite grateful for this) in the bottomless abyss it simply can not get the attention of any big devil, the public opinion gets them Favor. So, like many little devils, it turned its power to the main material plane. Red robes and grey robes often would like to raise a little devil as a messenger, spy, and assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos is fortunate, its first owner is a lich, although his qualifications are not deep, but It’s better than the ordinary gray robe to be an apprentice. The little devil laughs at the kind of condemnation that is forcibly condemned by a fool who is only better than the mortal. It did not expect that he would fall into this tragic In the realm of the world, with a mortal who has a bloody elf, and a snake, whenever he looks at Demon’s stupidity, it can’t control its first master, the smart and young (for the undead) Said) the lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the little devil, he is not cruel, not cold enough, and willing to abide by the promise, but perhaps because of this, Asmodeos The rewards he got there can even be said to be rich. With those, the little devil quickly climbed from a poor inferior to a position that was comparable to the succubus in decades, whether it was wisdom or Power - There are more and more places where he can play for the master. The name Asmodios is gradually becoming widely known, and then... the little devil shrugged, and its original owner should know that the devil is always sly and changeable. They can't surrender to a master forever. When there is more powerful force to reach out to it, it can't continue to maintain its loyalty. It does have some dealings with several undead, they are better than His master is much more greedy. In addition to Asmodeos, they still cherish the secrets and power of its master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the dragon has the blood of the dragon that Asmodois did not think of, who can guess it, guess from the shape of his hand bone . At the very least, I can guess that he is a half-elf. The gods are on. If you are a descendant of a dragon, the little devil thinks, you should be a warlock, and easily stand on the top of most casters. - Instead of doing a gray robe that requires hard work to hold a spellbook to recite a spell's memory gesture. Ah, it’s not a gray robe, he turned into a lich with a bone shelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transforming the lich is not a fun and easy thing, ignoring the innumerable money, manpower, life and precious casting materials spent in the preparation period. How many gray robes have failed to transform, turning themselves into a complete and thorough, without a trace Memory and intelligence left zombies? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the owner of Asmodeos did just that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He successfully escaped from the siege of several lichs, and also hit two of them, Asmodeos did not expect him to be dull I will not find my betrayal, so. As Demon did to it, the little devil thought that its original owner was in a precarious state of weakness, and he wanted to take the opportunity to dismiss him from the contract between them. As a result, as we have seen, the contract was lifted. But another contract was also established at the same time - it was exiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astromous has not been able to enjoy the main material world like a free little devil for a long time, but also lacks magic The body fled everywhere, it could not return to the endless abyss, and its power was not as good as a bad demon after being exiled. Thanks to its small and harmless appearance. It hid in the human house, earning the trust of the children, letting them quietly bring themselves back to the room, and then they got into their stomachs after they fell asleep. The whole person is emptied - it has to rely on these flesh and blood to make the wound heal, and the strength is restored - it was caught by the owner of Amonis when it was done in a human castle, and Amonis was very interested. Adding a nightingale, but the latter's owner did not think so, he was fascinated by the spells cast on Asmodeos, and after a few months of research he finally understood the key. He did not throw the little devil who lost his master as a dessert as Amonis had always said, but gave it to his disciple Demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first sight of Demon, Asmodeos knew that he would not be his true master, he could not, even if he It is impossible to forcibly obtain its real name when he was seriously injured by Asmodeos. The real name of the little devil is still firmly controlled by his first master. His authority is greater than that of the little devil and all the power is low. For his caster, and Demon, his qualifications are mediocre, a little clever but anxious, short-sighted, becoming a red robe disciple can only say that he has chosen an inevitable dead end, the length of the road is completely controlled by his mentor . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just like now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the "fine net" guild, or the sorcerer who played for the terrible shadow behind the guild, he was as physically as the original owner of Asmodeos The blood flowing from the dragon is not confined to the life of a disciple. He, An Zhen and the female leader of the thieves union have conducted a series of negotiations and discussions through spells. The specific situation is not known, but it is unknown. I know that Anzhen agreed to build a tower for the red robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain made Demon awake. He pulled a wand from the pocket of his waist. Once it was broken, it could cast a powerful protective spell, but he just took it out, a hand with a honey skin. Just wraping from behind his shoulders, gently pulling it away from his clenched fingers, he yelled, and when he wanted to take it back, a handle was made into a ring, enchanted. The fine gold knife circumvented from the other side, cutting off the secret silver chain carrying the pocket, and the protective magic on the chain disappeared after a slight flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dimensional Bag filled with scrolls, wands and wands was held in the hands of the guild's leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demon stared at her with horror, how many brilliant illusions that the wonderful body had given him, and now how many terrible speculations have been given: "...I Didn't betray you!" He cried, "No! I... I have stamped and signed the name on every document; in my prison... there is no thief belonging to you. I... I also let the merchants... deliver the taxes you asked for," he stammered, and even the pain in his eyes was forgotten: "I followed all your instructions, and I... I have not tried to fight for ... your power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please," Baita’s governor squatted and desperately pleaded: "Don't, please tell me where I have not done enough to satisfy you. I will do it - is my wife making you unhappy? I can go and kill her, and her Children - please don't hurt me! Don't kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have anything to you Local meaning, "female thieves gentle voice said, while stroking the bird by the Succubus dimensional bags made of skin - even old grandmother stroked her youngest grandson gesture may not have her so gentle and considerate. "But indeed, we need you to do something for us... can I ask first? Demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course! Of course!" Demon eagerly promised: "Whatever it is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you open the channel for the Grey Ridge for us?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon's movement stopped at once - this is of course impossible, the elf is simply abhorrent to him, he even left the White Tower, did not dare to walk to the Star River. Not to mention the negotiations with the elves, let them re-establish trade with the White Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see," the female thief spread his fingers. "I said, but it seems that you can't do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the elves come back," Demon screamed Shouted: "You can't live in the White Tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female thief smiled and revealed two sharp teeth: "We have our way. She said: "But she reminded us that what we want is a commercial city that can bring us intelligence and gold coins, and is extremely prosperous. It is not a waste city."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She?" Demon immediately captured the word: "Who is she? Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is me."<蒙 /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon turned around, he saw his wife, still so docile, thin, hands in front of his belly, eyes full of compassion and pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She can help us do things you can't do." The female thief added, smirking the sling bag on his belt. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon reveals a distorted smile. "A dead man can't do anything." He declared that he began to turn the magic ring worn on his thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen did not retreat, the power of magic caused a whirlpool in the room. But this is not a deadly spell. On the contrary - this is a teleportation. Demon finally made a correct decision, but it was too late. Asmodeos knows more about Demon's magical instrument than anyone else on the scene. Its tail is like a black line drawn across the air, violently elongated and stabbed the surface of the ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small fire burned the tail of the little devil, and Demon's fingers, the spell was successfully and violently interrupted. The bloated figure of the caster became blurred from clarity, and became clear from blur, and then fell to the ground without control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a roar like a wounded beast, the leader of the Thieves Guild cut all the fingers of Demon and picked up the few from the pool of blood. Falling ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, he gave it to you," said the female thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you very much,” said An Zhen calmly, turning a deaf ear to Demon’s dirty curse: “I need a little time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“With you.” Female thief Said, squatting to the side of the room, nested in a chair that looked very comfortable and began to check her spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in." said An Zhen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A veiled woman immediately walked in from the outside. At first she was still trembling, but when she saw the ampoule and Demon fell to the ground, Instead, she quickly stabilized her emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take your veil." An Zhen said: "Let him see the crimes he committed."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman took the veil, her mouth was as tall as a wild boar, ugly, but looking at her gentle eyes and the small, straight nose, she knew that she was very beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promised you." An Zhen said: "Do you want a knife?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The woman smiled, it was an unforgettable smile. "I brought it." She pulled an iron fork from under the skirt and used it to roast the meat in the kitchen. It was black and black, only the front end was sharp. bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon wants to escape, his magic pet flies past, digs out his other eye, bites his nose and sheds blood Injecting his own venom into his wounds is extremely tiny and only acts as a paralysis. The little devils often do this when they store food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's take it," said An Zhen. "We still have a lot of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What is this ghost thing? ! The soul of the alien world is rampant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The original owner of the underground palace, the Lich said, in addition, please don’t say that this is a ghost thing, insulting his current identity, Although the locust mage has nothing to praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who once smashed the reel, a fireball hit it, the flame spread in the pile of locusts, and they quickly smelled "protein content exceeded The ten-fold "beef of beef" burned after the nausea and odor, but like the tide of the locusts, the flame immediately covered the layer of creeping white worms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are rushing, tightly combined, forming a body similar to humans at a speed that is not fast but not slow - it silently screams angrily to the lich and him. The cohabitants stretched out their fingers, and a group of sticky locusts were thrown over like a baseball. The lich walked away and the locusts were thrown onto the rocky walls, eroding a fist-sized hole there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Too much, the soul of the outside world is weak and said, I am glad that I have to face this monster is not myself, it almost does not want to see it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Watch the observation, the sorrow is calmly and calmly combined with the monster of the locust, and the monster is very common. But in general, their core will only be an ordinary grievance. As for this one, according to my estimation, it may be that the innocent and lovely white robes have not been thoroughly cleaned up - they probably thought it was killing It’s all right to kill a dead person as long as you knock a bad scorpion...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Is it related to the lich? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The remaining pieces of the undead are destroyed, there is not much wisdom, but his body, and the mites that are produced in his guinea pigs The worm will instinctively find the piece and then use it as a core to form a monster that is similar to the original body. The Lich says it is dangerous for mortals and underpowered adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——For you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I can leave it here and wait until you control the body to deal with it. what do you think? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Thank you, but still not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world said, then it will stop talking, and slightly sink into the sea, so as not to disturb the former undead, just like driving Don't talk to the driver at the same time. It is also a good way to kill yourself when a spellcaster is preparing to cast spells. (To be continued.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: 鞠躬Thank you for the ceremonial 1990 classmates who cast a valuable monthly ticket! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;鞠躬Thanks to wjdxk1 for casting a valuable monthly ticket! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
