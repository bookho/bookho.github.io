			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When people think I won't do anything," Kelsey said to himself: "It's a good time for me to do whatever I want." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that some pastors are sent by the chief pastor to ask for pregnant women or young girls, which is more and more crazy than sacrifices. The slaughter is more like a celebration or a curse, but Kelsey does not care about this. As a daughter of the Red Dragon, although she can't be liked by the pastor, she has to change the power of one or two tasks. There are still some – and among this group of young pastors, Kelsey is hated because of the absurd and cruel behavior, but as long as she is willing, there are still countless people who hope to be able to work for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows how to make people sad, since the pastor will not hesitate to protect his deformed beastly slaves, then he will not The fate of the slaves will be indifferent, and the pain and humiliation that can't be done will occupy his mind. At least in a short time, it is difficult for him to be unaffected by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon’s woman’s eyes are shining brightly, and her mouth is singularly curved upwards. Wherever, pastors and apprentices retire to both sides. And Kelly did not care about them, she walked all the way to the bottom of the "honeycomb", floated up on the toes, with a black blood - her maids on the platform Meet her, they are dissatisfied with her behavior, but like every time before, they did not stop or warn her power, they may be able to inform the priest, but the priest will not stop Kay They threw them into the lava that was always hot and rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalal first smelled a strong bloody smell before seeing Kelsey, blood flowing and knotting on her body, but from the dragon The look of the patriarch can tell that she has not gone through a battle, or that she has been injured for other reasons. Yadel is tired of frowning, and those are the blood of the victim. He can only hope that they need pregnant women, not girls, so that those unfortunate sacrifices may still last for a few months. He doesn’t know if this is torture or hope for them, but as long as they are alive, then There is always a meager possibility of one or two points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you are ready." Kelsey said: "But you have to wait for a while." She needs to clean up the sacrifices. Blood, women's blood is sticky and dirty, making her sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalal is lying quietly on the smaller altar On the bed, it is obsidian, the surface is covered with Mithril, the four horns are engraved with runes, the four claws are pure gold, and on both sides, there is a deep blood trough as well as the altar. Moreover, as far as he can see, the floor and walls of the room are also engraved with precise patterns and words, and at the end of his line of sight, is a statue of Grein, an inflated abdomen almost dragged to the ground. On the glamorous woman, her body and face are ivory, with a milky white glow, wearing jewelry like a star shining, Yadel can not tell the texture of her golden eyes, but no matter what When you look at the line of sight, you can feel the statue looking at him intently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapse is not a collapse, this cognition gives him a little peace of mind, when he is attacked from behind, when he falls down, look When the avalanche that is waiting outside the courtyard is changing, his body suddenly grows like a clay, and the facial features become blurred, the limbs become thinner, the fingers fall on the knees, and the knees are oddly curved, although only one In an instant, Rosada’s pastor also knew that he was attacked by a deformed monster—he changed into a collapsed form, took himself to a place where there were not so many eyes and ears, then knocked himself down and took himself to Here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who are very correct about Kelsey’s psychology, Yadel does not know that Kelsey knows that his every move is in the prediction of others. What is the feeling - if they say it is good, then he should now be in the sanctuary of Greet, the residence of the priests of Greedy, which is the best for Kelsey. The little nest, other places will only make her feel anxious, let alone savor the taste of the prey... and she is so cowardly, although on the surface, Kelsey has always been a symbol of death and horror But her essence is simply a stupid gerbil - she doesn't even dare to confront the succubus Ferrik Hill who stayed in the house of Kremar Palace. She asked and looked up the name, but it was like Like every demon and devil, this name is also an ambiguous variant name, which is recognized by magic, but only the mage or warlock who has summoned this succubus can match the name with himself. For unrelated people, the name is No effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She even repented deeply, and given that she had ridiculed her father ignorantly, she could not get help and protection from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kelsey didn’t want to give up, the feeling of failure was too bad, she needed to save and need comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Rosada gently moved his fingers and found that they could not use even a little effort. His clothes were collected together with the reel and potion. His body has been thoroughly cleaned, and the body can even feel empty, the kind of emptyness that will last for a long time, which may be a spell, so as not to vomit or incontinence, and then destroy The interest of Kelsey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time the maids checked the physical condition of Yadel, they left, and there were only two people in the room, Kelsey and Yadel, a human being. A dragon is like a baby, facing each other without a cover. After careful scrutiny, the woman of the red dragon reveals a greedy look. Austal is right, Yadel’s face and age are It doesn't meet Kelsey's preference, but he is the biggest weight of the person who Kremar cares. Kelsey puts his finger on his chest. This pastor is not like the goods she bought before. It is either dry or obese. He is like a warrior with solid muscles and strong bones. Compared with his branded face, his skin is smoother and more delicate. The dragon and the dragon's favorite pale gold, Kelsey crouched on the bed, like a beast according to his own gift, inherited from the red dragon's sharp teeth from the lips, scarlet tongue stretched into the air, Like the viper, it smells in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelsey’s maids are waiting outside the door, After the wreckage and bloodstains, they should be cleaned up. A maid suddenly smiled and shook his finger at the other maid. "You think..." She said "in a silent language", "Is that pastor a hunchback?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If yes," the other maid also answered "say" in the silent language: "That would be interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't think it should," said the third maid, "Kelsey's attitude is very cautious about the succubus." At the same time as she gestures, her smile shows that this caution can be done. Replace with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She just wants her brother to be upset," the first maid raised her hands: "But what she did was kill some slaves." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe just for the respectable 'mother'," the third maid whispered the little finger: "The black hair of His Highness is now a mother." 'The darling.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they just looked at it and it was clear that this sentence was false and could make a Grinada vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first maid who started the "conversation" raised her hand again and wanted to continue the conversation between them, but a sharp shout broke the silence between them. The maids showed a confused look, but they immediately noticed that the sound was coming from the room, and Kelsey’s room was as isolated as other high-ranking pastors, and now they can hear the shouts. It means that the constant spells used in the room for sound insulation have been broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the maids immediately throws a prepared milf on the companion. After the strength of the dragon is strengthened by the magic, the maid of the surgery The threshold of fine copper was opened, and the suffocating darkness and cold rushed. The chain of thirsty and unbearable writhing in the air only caught the neck of the maid and lifted her high, and her companion was high. The singer sang, the black mist that shielded the light was suddenly dispelled, revealing a terrible mess: "It's a chain demon!" A maid screamed, "No, it's a demon!" Another maid corrected, 怯The devil is one of the demons. It is small in size and only about four feet high. But this scorpion crouched on the shoulder of another demon. It is a Fro demon with tumors growing on the limbs and on the back. The fleshy wings, Kel's home is tall enough, but it still seems to be like it can't really stand up, its knees are bent, the claws are swept, and it's too late to prevent, a maid is barbed on the paws Live, hang up, she struggles to want God put the surgery, but Flo magic abdomen suddenly appeared with a shark-like teeth stacked mouth, suddenly bit off half of her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only remaining maid looked for Kelsey’s figure, and she found the familiar face from the light of the magic rune, but she Not ready to help Kelsey get rid of the existing dilemma - in addition to a Fro demon, there are two or three demon spiders around her, their cheeks continually ringing in the air, eager to chew Broken fresh flesh and blood, the ground is full of sticky white silk, Kelsey's legs are almost entangled, she can still insist, because this is her lair, the sudden burst of protective spells for her A little time, she can stand up to her own barrier, but this does not last long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
