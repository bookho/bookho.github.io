Gülen asked, he and Kremar, like them, bare feet, pants high up, his skin Showing a pale color, even in the hot sun, it looks like a sea snake that has just been taken out of the ice. The "wide dolphins" glanced at him uncomfortably, moving away from the black haircaster's side. In the huge basket, there are many foods and utensils besides the green-bellied hermit crab, including coconut, snake fruit, durian, and the multi-tumor white melon that Master Alva once asked Captain Cobb. Some seabird eggs and spices, utensils are some wooden bowls and plates, as well as a variety of cookware, charcoal. WwW.XsHuotXT.com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have to mention is the hotel in Hongyan Port. Like other ports, Hongyan Port has both pubs and restaurants. Accommodation hotels, but also have "empty houses" that are quite rare elsewhere. These empty houses are built on coral reefs that are not completely exposed to the water. The materials used to build them are neither soil nor grass leaves, but are spawned by the casters. Corals - perhaps because of the climatic climate, the clear relationship between the seas, the cast of this spell in the Dragonfire Islands can often do more with less. These "empty houses" belong to the lord, they send trustworthy slaves to manage here, they look like a Hollow spheres, ranging in size from 50 to 80 feet in diameter, are coated with surimi on the surface and inside. This glue melts only when it encounters hot water, so people living in the cabin do not have to worry about clothing. The rainwater or seawater infiltrated by the holes is eroded and moldy; the lodge has a bed base that is also made of coral, a low seat, and a sunroof inlaid with shells on the top, only The wooden part has only a black threshold, which is said to be the core of the coconut tree soaked in syrup. How to know it is not known, but the most curious thing about the soul of the outside world is that there is no window that can be opened in the cottage, and the threshold is specially made into a wedge shape. To avoid rain and waves, but they don't feel bored at all - thanks to the slightly yellowed fish gelatin, which can isolate tiny drops of water. It will allow fresh air and light to enter the room, but the air is almost unobstructed, the light will become slightly dim and sputum - this makes the thieves somewhat uncomfortable, if you light a candle in the cabin or take out the fluorspar illumination. The outside person can see your every move, and finally he has to go to the caster to help cast a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can of course go to the usual hotel near the pier, but it’s not a problem that is not suitable, but a matter of life. - A newcomer must be subjected to harsh and frequent spying. Gülen himself did this. He was surprised to find that he did not like the place and practice. Especially as a bearer rather than a donor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "wide dolphins" showed diligently that she could help them move things into their cabins, and the thieves transferred their hands to his fine gold dagger, ignoring and contemptuously. He didn't want the "wide dolphins" to get too much from them. With a lot of intelligence, the female traveler shrugged helplessly. She placed the goods on the sand, and Gülen looked at it like Meimei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you would leave immediately." When far enough away from the "wide dolphins," Fro's pastor said that her voice was as light as a gossamer, 搔Move the ears of Gülen. This is also one of the special skills that they have cultivated since childhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am different," said Mei Mi: "Fro The temple is not so easy to get in.” Think about it, sometimes in order to win the favor of men and Fro, her followers will even drive out the competitors – their mothers, sisters and daughters, only to them. A suit, a bell is almost all gold-plated copper or tin, a pair of shoes and a Frocian priest's name, like this priest who has no shelter, is called a wild priest, was driven out The priests have a high probability of dying, and they have no skills. There are no friends or relatives, and refugees and thieves often attack them and use them as free instruments to relieve their desires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anything that can be called lucky, it is that they are still a god pastor. Unless necessary or have a more peculiar hobby, slave traders are seldom willing to buy a priest - most red robes and gray robes are more willing to buy healthy and strong ordinary humans, and if the orc priests are to their gods The priest of the Froe will be thrown into the bottomless abyss by the violent gods and his entire tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei sometimes dreams of coming back at midnight, and will be surprised that he is still alive until today, with no eyes or multiple stomachs. Fro is also willing to listen to her prayers and give strength, even though the power is as thin as the blade of the wizard, but it is also power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then my answer is the same as you," said Gülen. "It's really confusing here, but the confusion is just the outer edge. The inside is still tight and tight, a foreigner. If you don't have reliable dependencies, you may become a peacock's snail food in a year." Gülen took a position with his own skill and generosity at the dock's pub, perhaps in good faith. The warning or malicious intimidation, when he learned that the people here are dealing with some "wandering ghosts", the easiest way is to smash him into meat and throw it into the sea. The fine meat is the big snail with a beautiful shell. The food, and these peacock tail snails, which are as big as the human head, are the natural enemies of the starfish. The starfish is the natural enemy of the coral. When the whole dragon fire island is almost coral, people will consciously give the best coral. Reproduction conditions and environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I knew this, the black-eared caster also said that "the people in the magical world actually understand the environment and ecological protection." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do they want to do next?" Mei Mi knocked on a small frying pan to see if it was evenly thick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came to your hut at night." Mei Mi said that she still lives in a small room with Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bedwin lived with me," said Gülen. Of course, they have more than one gold coin to rent more huts. The arrangement is just to ensure safety. Even the houses they rent are close to each other. The base of the centrally located lodge extends a white narrow reef tongue. It's like a pontoon, connecting it to other huts, and some to the embankment. If the guest doesn't like to go back to the house every time they have to take off their shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let him go to find Leona," Maymi said. "I know you can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gloria looked up and saw that Mei Mei was blinking at him and pouted at him. Meimei’s lips could not be compared with the “wide dolphins”. But the victory is gentle and tender, her gem-colored eyes are more radiant in the sun, sparkling with a fascinating look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief dropped a coconut, "the deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Gülen kicked the coconut away, and changed his face to face the Kerry Ben who did not know when he appeared behind him. It is the silent voice that has the ability to go anywhere. He has a belly, and the career they should be most engaged in should be thieves and assassins: "Is there anything I need to do?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar still needs something." The elf handed a narrow strip of paper to Gülen, and Gülen glanced. These are some of the paper, ink, casting materials and instruments and tools used to make the potion. These things can't be bought from a travel agent, and even if they are, they can't be reassured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The above things can't be said to be rare or too expensive. It is annoying that the Red Throat Port is as deformed as the entire Longhuo Islands. Almost all of them are recruited by the lords. They don’t need to go out and buy the things that the casters need, and the sporadic alien casters have not yet had the appetite to support a magical store, so these things It can only be obtained from smugglers and thieves. Basically, it is unclear. But some quality is still good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wide Dolphin" has been paying close attention to their every move, seeing Kerry Ben took out two small skins, one for her and another After a heavier weight gave Gülen, her round, small eyes sparkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this adult going to the dock?" She said eagerly, "I can let my slaves go to you - it is very fast, very Smooth, I promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Gülen couldn’t react to it for a while. What happened? When he saw the slave squatting on his back When the empty basket climbed over, his face was a little numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You," he said hesitantly. "Is it to say that I am going into this basket..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can also ride directly on his shoulder." "Wide Dolphin" does not matter, "I brought a chew." She grabbed a leather from the waist and couldn't see what to do. The slave thrown to her, the dark and thin man immediately grabbed it. Bringing it dexterously, it looks like a half mask, wrapped around the chin, like the horse's chews, and some of it is pulled into the mouth, when the slave opened his mouth, Gülen found He has no teeth left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said Gülen. In order to express his determination, he also took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free." "Wide Dolphin" said: "As long as you tell me what you need, you will get it." The bag is gold coins: "Wide Dolphin "Dare to bet with your chest and hips, so it will be so heavy, it seems that the capacity of both skins is similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The thief said that he once put his foot on someone’s head, and often beats apprentices, ridiculing that they are head-filled with lead. The pig of water, but this is a bit too much for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
