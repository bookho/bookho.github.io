			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irmot’s pastor applied a treatment to Baldwin, and the white light spots landed on the body of the former paladin like raindrops. They were surprised when they found that the treatment was completely ineffective for Birdwin, but very quickly, a grammar priest handed a iron pointed hammer to the hand of Birdwin. In it, when it rusts at a speed visible to the naked eye, there is no need for the priest of Ilmot to know that lying in front of them, the dying patient is a sinner who was expelled and abandoned by the god he once believed in. They have a small dispute healing treatment and treatment potions are limited, and the treatment has proved to be useless, then whether to spend precious potions for this sinful sinner, you know, there is more in the temple. Many noble and innocent people are worth saving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But he is a good friend of the Elf Ranger Kerry Ben," a priest of Ilmot insisted: "The elf is not going to be with the wicked." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then he may be blinded," said the younger pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This person is a warrior," said the priest of Ilmot. "He can't touch the sword without using it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to argue." Just arrived here, the chief pastor of Ilmot said, "The Ranger has explained this to me." He repeated the story briefly. Wen’s identity and the misfortune he encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His fall is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the excuse," The elf's companion can't be a pastor of a sinister person. "He may be wronged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick stop," director of Ilmot The priest said sternly: "You are questioning a god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reprimanded priest immediately bowed his head and put his hands on his shoulders, deeply Apologize for your failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do we do?" The younger of them said that he did not think he had won in the debate, with his companions. Similarly, he also had a bit of pity for this dying male. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Treat him," said the chief pastor. "Since the treatment is not available, then we use the potion we prepared. We want to delay his death as much as possible, like everyone else," he watched Bywin because of pain. The distorted face made a gesture of prayer: "The benevolent Ilmot asks us to help all the wounded and suffer for others. This is what we should do."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing he didn't say was that the chief pastor with a drop of gray tears under his eyes thought that after a third of the day, the three men of this human male, an elf ranger. A half-elf mage, and a human thief, will have to perform a dangerously abnormal task in order to save the church and more people. They may not be able to return safely, but if they return, he does not I hope that they will meet them with the body of a good friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he would not say that the two brothers who had a dispute were too young to be compared to him, and their beliefs might be shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The therapeutic potion was taken when the candle had not dripped a new drop of wax oil, and the priest of Ilmot was careful to hold Baldwin's head. Pour the potion into his chapped lips and still haven't seen the familiar black blood. He thought, this person can still hold on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potion works and the pain is relieved. They saw that Baldwin's brows gradually eased and fell into a peaceful sleep, and he quit his room and there were others who needed their care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they don't know, they leave. The pain returned to the face of the former paladin again, but this time not because of the body, but because the soul has escaped the king of Norman. For the first time, Bywin was so clearly aware that he had been abandoned by his gods. He was a sinner, a fallen paladin, and his sin was as sharp as the rust on the sword. On the way to escape, he didn't have time to think about it, and in the remote village of the corner, the situation was almost completely isolated from the outside world, causing the villagers and their pastors to know nothing about what happened in Wangdu, and he went to Kerry. The expensive and extraordinary weapons that I borrowed also cleverly helped him to escape the doubts and panic that might be there. He battled monsters, grievances, and half dragons with pride and compassion, almost forgetting that he was no longer approved by Tell. Followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it didn’t leave, it was like a poisonous snake hidden in the shadow, and he was caught off guard when he was the most vulnerable, the most painful, the most desperate. A blow, its venom leaked into his heart. For a moment, the former Paladin hoped that he could die, so as not to suffer similar torture in the decades-long life, but he He immediately denied the idea. He was not willing to die with sin. He wanted to live, want to redeem his sins, wanted to re-name Tyre’s name, and stepped back into his church. Dedicated to your own sword and loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He prayed intermittently. Whenever he spit out the name of Tyre, these two words were like a soldering iron, and his tongue was burned. There was no light, no warmth, and there was no sign that the wall of the copper wall had a hint of looseness. He burst into tears, how much he hoped that one hand could hold his hand and give him some encouragement and courage, but in the dark and dirty room, only his voice echoed repeatedly, and the emptiness was like his heart. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when there was such a hand holding his hand, Baldwin almost jumped out of bed (if he could), he was tough Holding the hand, the hand is soft and small, it can never be Kerry Ben, Crimal or any man, and Birdwin is still familiar with it, after all, the previous one They just touched him intimately in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mei honey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said Mei Mi, kissing and using his own Cheeks rubbed the hand: "Yes, adults, it's me, I am back, come back to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crow flew over and landed on Leona’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no," Liona yelled angrily: "No, you can't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The crow is like a person who is so cute and stunned his head. Its eyes are red, it looks very evil, and it does not do so well. It smashes Leo. Na's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand supported the weight of Leona's majority, and the crow's cockroaches almost ran through the back of her hand, and she screamed with pain, from The wall fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall of the Spirit is certainly not as tall and generous as the walls of the Norman Kings, but it also has at least half of the latter. Losing balance from a few tens of feet, falling high, if not a sudden illusory hand holding her up, the Norman Princess of Highlands is not going to die or will spend her second half in bed. The hand gently placed her on the ground, and then the mouth of the city wall revealed a huge bird's beak, a grammar priest appeared on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hands to Princess Leona without learning the language, and Leona knew that he was urging her to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of persuasion is too rude!" Li Oona lifted the intact hand on her mouth and shouted at the top of the wall, taking out a bottle of healing potion and unscrewing the lid for a drink. Her hand was quickly healed, but it didn't take much effort, and there was some faint pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me," Liona continued, shouting: "Is Badwin Don Clay in Dorsett?" In fact, there is no need for the pastor to answer, she also Knowing that Baldwin is close at hand, she is almost burnt by the pendant that clings to her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Klanwo went down again and waited for a while, seeing that Leona didn’t seem to leave, he retracted. After changing a gray robe of Pastor Ilmot, Leona raised her head and accidentally discovered that she knew him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Princess of Norman!" The priest of Ilmot whispered helplessly: "You should not be here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for my friend," the princess responded. "Bedwin. Don Cray and his companions are here. Right?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irmot’s pastor stuck a bit and did not answer the princess’s question: “The city is being controlled by a terrible disease,” he said bitterly. “No matter who you are, you can’t enter here. I can't leave here either."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you want to ensure that the disease is no longer spreading," Leona said: "But I have the same experience as you. Firm beliefs and reasons, they tell me that I have to enter the city. I am with my friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the reason?" The priest of Mott asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona reveals a smile, it is so pure, so brilliant, can be compared with the sunshine at this time: "That is what I love Birdwin Don Clay, I love him, love him as much as I love my life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irmot's pastor is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately..." After a while, he said that the sound could hardly be captured by Leona in the distance: "If you said it is The unfortunate person, Your Royal Highness, please give up your original plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona stopped all the movements, looked up, and listened calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was infected with the disease," said the priest of Ilmot. "He is dying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Leona closed her eyes calmly. When she was a carefree little girl, she didn’t know why the bard always lamented the cruelty of fate in their works, but she suddenly died in her father, and the person she admired was accused of killing After killing his murderer, he has really tasted the bitterness. Now, it is just another bitterness. She won't even cry for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She carries a rune plate from Norman’s royal family library, each of which stores one or several powerful unmatched spells, as long as she likes it, She can break the wall of the multi-spirit, so that it cracks a gap enough for Leona to walk in. Her heart strongly encourages her to do this, unscrupulously, without considering any consequences, but her reason After rejecting her, she is still the Princess of Norman. If the disease spreads out, her death will be her people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she also knows that the pastors will not allow her to enter the multi-spirit, even if she is just standing here now, enough to make them anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Princess Liona..." The priest of Ilmot just wanted to continue to persuade a few words, and he was beaten by a knight who flew from afar. broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight jumped off the horse in a few dozen feet from Leona and gave her a swearing ceremony. He seemed to want to be on Leo. What Na said, but chose to give up because she didn't know how to word it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he turned to see the priest of Ilmot, he was very happy: "emergency!" he shouted: "Hen The followers of Ilmot, please inform your chief pastor, our master, the lord of the Spirit has just hosted a noble and powerful guest, Lord Dylan Doncre, who heard about the multi-spirit and is generous The land decided to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of help?" Li Oona asked, she didn't think her cousin would suddenly become Ilmot. believer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He wants to burn more spirits," the Cavalier gasped and said, he ran all the way, not daring to make a mistake: "He wants to burn the whole multi-spirit, He shouted loudly at the priest of Ilmot: "Our master asked me to ask if you already have a way to fight the disease. Otherwise, please leave as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
