			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Two chapters in one)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway has no idea what is already in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flipped through the spell book, the text above was not so much trembling, not to say that it was dancing, they sang loudly, with a hoarse abyss language In line with the frenzied beats, the occasions are clamoring for occasional screams, and they vent their own joy and hatred - for the coming disaster. It is a pity that their only listeners can't understand the hidden meaning. He blames it for the illusion or tinnitus brought about by tension and fatigue - everything is ready, and the rest of the messenger has been invisible. Wrapped out and discarded - Ilva and the other elves are chasing the deformed monsters exchanged by Fenway until the glory of Rosada covers the entire jungle. At that time, his spells have been successful, and the traces have been cleaned. Clean, and this evil spell book and the rest of the material will be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that was put into the circle was the internal organs of the half-elves. Except for the heart, this is not the material needed for the spell, but the sacrifice to the devil. When the devil's skin undulating satisfactorily, muttering and squirming and engulfing these internal organs, Fenway began to recite the long spell that was firmly in mind, and every syllable he spit out took away his energy and remembered it. Leave a white hole in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster needs to go all out to be controlled by the fear that the spell may fail. There is no room for him to retreat behind him, and he does not want to retreat. Before he made his decision, he was used to long-term hatred and contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal organs were eaten for a while, and there was no bloody mucous membrane left on the devil's skin. It looked so shiny and smooth, and the fine gold lines were not. Pollution, the caster took out the blood of the first half-elf, the blood of the purebred book is best written in the spell book, but half of the blood can also be - if it is not said, Fenway may It was destroyed at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sprite is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He poured the blood from the bottle into the circle, it was still hot, the red was shining, just like just coming out of the heart, the rich smell With the sweet smell of honey, the devil's skin screams excitedly, constantly wrinkling and sag, trying to swallow the most blood in the shortest possible time, and the veins in it are thin and fat, liquid The flow tends to be clean and visible, it is similar to greedy enjoyment, but this is not a sacrifice, it is a material - Fenway picks up the whip that the prosthetic nails and tentacles are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the spell book, he vigorously beats that Bone the white skin until it becomes obedient - just eat the dregs and leave the pure elf's blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway took the time to pour the second and third bottles of blood into the circle - these blood can be filled with two eight-litre glass cellars, but in the Faction, they are like pouring a small glass of water Into the sand that was soaked in the sun, it was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage recited the next spell and sprinkled the devil's black blood evenly on the devil's skin. The two old rivals immediately fought, but at the level and magic. The reason, the devil quickly retreated, before the blood began to swallow the skin, Fenway threw a heart, it is the same as the blood, but also live jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood with ugly colors gathers and swallows the heart, the wizard's spell turns to the third paragraph, and the most critical one, he will leave the remaining heart Hold it in your hand until the devil's skin will swallow the blood back - not mixed, dirty blood, purified and clarified blood, elf's blood, they condense on smooth skin, along A corner dripped, and Fenway followed them with a crystal cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the elf is also red, but the red is like a frozen morning urn like a melted garnet, with no impurities, not much weight, just enough Filling up a cup, Fenway put it properly in the scorpion, casting it to make sure it doesn't tip over or move - then he calmly turns to the squad and throws two hearts into the roaring dark blood. When the devil was busy chewing, he read the last spell loudly, and quickly pulled out the secret silver nails. The free demon skin was like a squid that was mistakenly caught in the net, and the devil was The blood is wrapped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway subtly flips the wrist, a scorpion that has applied a scorpion-like spell to accurately cover the devil's skin and the devil's blood and get it right away. Cover it and let it hit the bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to mix the purified blood with the blood of the dragon and drink it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is both bitter and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to say that humans are always a strange thing," Meng’s mentor said: “Sometimes very smart, sometimes stupid; sometimes very generous, sometimes very embarrassing; sometimes brave, sometimes very embarrassing – seemingly cautious, but in fact reckless like There is no such thing as reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it's only half," his magical darling appends, it rolls the gold cup with its tail, pours a little honey in it, puts a little venom, and wields a sharp-edged tail to dig a fresh eyeball - from a trembling In the eyes of the human child, the child grew up in pain, but he could only make a wheezing sound. He had no tongue, and the vocal cords were cut off in advance. The eyeball fell into the cup and was immediately melted by the venom. The yellow liquid also turns into a grandmother green that will make any human being fascinated by the mind, provided they don't know the main ingredient: "That's human too - a low-lying stupid race, better than the elves." A little, but not as good as the orcs and giants, and other people," it continued: "They are always hesitant, capricious, and a little bit of visible interest can shake their faith, obscure their thoughts, and let them Turn a blind eye to the imminent dangers and predictable pitfalls, and listen to them – they are still hypocritical, they even deceive themselves, thinking they are doing the right thing Bright, selfless, but in fact, the respected masters, as far as I can see, they are nothing but a group of poor and humble, stinky, fragile bugs that seek to wreck the leftovers in order to satisfy their own ** Everything is done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is nothing wrong with it," said the owner of the magic pet: "For us."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really." Viper said, it never caused any disobedience to its Master Master, at least on the surface, at least when he was still very strong, "Demon Very good use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is my disciple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viper carefully cautiously The master's answer: "One of the disciples," it said, "but he is still very obedient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the time being," Demon's mentor said: "In When I can give him what he wants, he will be a cute puppy screaming at others, but if I can't give food, he will try to feed from that hand. Take a piece of meat on the top."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same ambitious and unscrupulous as other human beings," said the demon pet. "It’s equally stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster nods and agrees with the pet's comment, "I only need a little loyalty for a short time," he said. "It won't be long."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So." His magic pet said: "When I get that day, I can dig up his eyes and dip it in the glass. I think his eyes will have chocolate." Taste. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The color is tasteless,” Demon’s mentor politely reminded: “The grandmother’s green eye does not have a minty taste.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always think that they should be tasteful. It’s just that Demon didn’t find the right person,” the double-headed viper complained endlessly: “I think the green eyeballs should have a minty taste, and the blue ones should Sour and sweet, amber should have honey..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bitter taste?" The double-headed snake is undecided: "But Brin and Raspberry are also black, they are sweet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demon's mentor stood up, opened the corner of the curtain, and listened to the sound of the darkness. The fine rain was hit on the glass. On the signboard, on the stone lattice road, several wet birds that were hit by the rain vyed for the dry. In the eaves, the cats lying under the armpits screamed like a baby crying. The horse and the donkey chewed the licorice in the shed and screamed with uneasiness. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then belongs to humans, a screaming scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, it stopped short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway drank the blood, no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s cold and bitter, it’s hot and sweet after sliding down the throat, and Fenway can even clearly feel how it invades every part of the body. It is very persistent and extremely powerful - the auburn liquid flows out of Fenway's eyes, nose, ears, and every hole in the body. He is still stunned, and the dirty mucus is covered with every inch of the skin. I can't see things, I can't hear anything, I can't breathe and shout. His body can't move. All the internal organs and liquids seem to become semi-dissolved magma. He tries to remember the spell and wants to analyze it. The problem is nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame is flowing, flowing out of his body and falling on the ground, Fenway can't see it - the things flowing out of his mouth are alive, though Its color can only be seen under the tongue of the deceased. It flows on the floor of the silver crest, leaving a burnt trace of burnt black. It is a kind of cyan and white like phosphorus fire. The more transparent it is, the more transparent it is. To the top is almost colorless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of its spread was so fast, and Fenway's room flowed out in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A squirrel is sitting right on the purlin bracket under the large eaves, rolling its tail, half asleep, and the flame is alive. The hungry eagle slammed it like that, and it slammed into it, and the screams didn’t come out, leaving only the ashes that were not enough to fill a small fingernail cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame trembled slightly, not satisfied, it swayed from side to side and split into one hundred or more, they were like a newborn snake. Dissipate quickly and quietly and swim in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are such greed - maples, shrubs, grasses, insects, from flying in the air to deep underground... as long as they are alive, there is life Their food, they are as thin as the body that can disappear at any time, exploding at a speed visible to the naked eye, from the thick and thin fingers of human fingers to the thickness of the wrist, from the wrist to the arm, from the arm to the leg, to the body...they When you devour something much bigger than them, you will fuse, catching agile prey, such as birds and squirrels, and splitting into more swaying, stalking tentacles and tongues - some prey will soon escape from the net At the same time, they will also jump high, chapped in the air, and scattered into numerous tiny Mars. These small sparks will sneak into the fur and skin, burning the internal organs and bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not afraid of rain, nor will they mind losing the air that ordinary flames rely on to survive. The speed of spread is like a tide or a gust of wind, swallowing a tree. The fifty-foot-high cracked maple tree is no longer than the time it takes for humans to swallow a sausage; they even know how to limit their swallowing speed so that the panicked birds and squirrels take them further afield. The hot air they emit has a smell of odor and sulfur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich knows what this is, his mentor has gotten and raised a handful of them - the fire of negative energy, he was assigned "Feeding" it is to throw a mouse or a common creature of the same size at intervals to avoid it "growing up" or "dead". This work is not too heavy, but it needs to be very vigilant. The flame becomes extraordinarily clever in the face of vitality, and it even deliberately narrows itself and becomes dying to deceive food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It comes from the junction of the endless abyss and the fire element plane, fuels life, and as long as there is life, it can burn indefinitely - Fenway Stupid than he expected, he opened the channel and released something worse than he had imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to admit that the person who planned this plot is very clever, he has avoided the lock restrictions set by the elves - the elves' locks in the gray ridge limit the use of transport-like spells and summoning spells, so in the gray ridge You can only walk or fly, and you can't summon the devil or the demon, but you can still open the passage to other planes - the water element plane, the fire element plane, etc. - this is a wonderful edge ball. A magical array that is pretending to be used to convert races (to be honest, this magical lich has never seen and heard), but in essence connected to the fire element plane, contains all kinds of blood of vitality... The most powerful and powerful dragon blood attracts and seduce the blood and elf blood of its abyss creatures. Of course, and finally, the most important one, who has the ability to complete this spell, hates the other half of his blood, and is elf Trusted fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is hard to understand what Fenway thinks, a so complicated, and extremely powerful evil ** is only to satisfy a half-elf cute naive Little wish? All the red robes and the gray robes will cry for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I don’t think it’s a good time to sigh or recall the past, the soul of the outside world shouted, don’t you think that the entire gray ridge is burning out? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Don't tell me you want to live in the ruins! He continued to shout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich digs his ear in his mind - what do you want to do? He complained that if the elves would trust me, I could kill the whole thing in the hustle, but now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you say that the fuel needed for these fires is life? The soul of the alien world is eager to say that there is a way in our world...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Open the fire retardant belt. The Lich said, I know, but the problem is, I can't control the flame like you, ordinary fire can't spread below the ground, that is, there is no guarantee that the negative energy fire will be absolutely blocked - they may burn together Ridge and silver crown jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——So, what if we let go, what is the worst result? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The Grey Ridge and Silver Crown are burned out, the Lich answers, but I think the elves will figure out ways to keep the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The gray ash will be grayed out, and the soul of the outside world will simply say, let's do it, dog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an idea," said the Lich: "But I don't guarantee that the whole thing won't get worse."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager of the steel blue eyes looks at him, the young wizard of the black hair can be said to be unscathed, but if he remembers correctly, Kremar’s spell book is in Fen Via, and these weird flames are coming from Fenway's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fenway returned the spell book to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Lich Says: "But I have remembered a few spells before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Ignition of Grey Ridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Gray Ridge, the caster Rarely will remember a flame-like spell, although the silver-crowned tree contains metal, shrubs and parasitic plants are dense and humid, cracked maple trees are not so easy to ignite because of the large amount of sugar, but there is no doubt that the flame is still It is the most needy thing to avoid in the place of gray ridge or silver crown jungle. For this reason, the residents of the gray ridge do not even use open flames, but instead use the pyroxene powder, which will produce high temperature mineral dwarves. Expensive, and the alien soul who used to gas and gas always felt that its firepower was not strong enough - when he wanted to fire a fish fillet mushroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Krimaar and Fenway, the life and death of the Fenway, there are four mages and three mage apprentices in the Grey Ridge. One of the apprentices cast a trick and lit After a dry moss, the elves took turns and lit the torches in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if this can be done," a mage whispered. "Although I have the spells I might use, I am worried that I can't cover it." "The area needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I have never liked lightning-like spells," said another wizard. "Otherwise, I have to do nothing to do it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning spells are equally useful," the Lich said. "What we need is to develop a protective belt that is inanimate or has only a few lives, but one The trees burn out for too long. When they burn, the residual vitality will still help the fire of negative energy. If the trees are broken, it will be much faster to burn the stumps, and the lightning can also burn. The roots of the trees staying below the ground - we also need sonic-like spells, which control the range of ordinary flame spread - powerful sound waves can increase the speed of the air, making the air thinner, when the latter's content is reduced When the flame is critical, Flame becomes weak to be able to let the rain beat off "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;He paused and added: "The effects of corrosion-like spells and lightning-like spells can be said to be equivalent, but no matter which one, we have to do it as soon as possible - your concerns are right," he said to the first one. The Master’s jaws greet: “We must not let the flame expand to a range that we cannot interfere with.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But if there are more mages...” he said Look at the manager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will ask Baita for help," the manager said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill’s raised her longbow for a whole night The pursuit was finally at the end, she aimed at the gray, faltering figure, her arrow with her hatred broke out, silver light pierced the air, fiercely bite into the back of the gray robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying mage raises his hand and tells the elves not to hurry up. He casts a flight, hovering around the gray robe for a while, and then cast two more. The spell only nodded to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rely on the past, a male elf flipped the body and let him reveal his face, it was a strange face, and the elves didn’t have any impression of it. - An evil gray robe, not the first one, not the last one, but he has nothing to do with the residents of Gray Ridge. This makes Yi Er sigh. She straightens her body and hears another when she wants to leave. An elf is exclaiming loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the strange gray robe changed, the facial features became blurred, the nose was flat, the lips were sunken, the forehead collapsed and all his hair was lost, and the larynx disappeared. The skin is grayish white, like a stone carving, can not see a trace of texture, thin limbs, fingers close together, bonded together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t need to flip his body to find the wings. Ill, I can recognize that this is a deformed monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt a horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater exclamation sounded, and an elf grabbed Il's shoulder and turned her in the direction, letting her look at the gray ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
