			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft prevention section, replace at 9:00 tomorrow morning<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are adults complaining that the first chapter is always anti-theft, so ah, that, I put a chapter "The Servant of the Servant" to do the theft...<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bishop of Perugia is, he hopes that Bishop Bicromini and his "followers" will leave Assisi as soon as possible.Everyone knows that anything will happen before the chimney of the Sistine Chapel (Note 1) - but in any case, even the Borgia in Rome may not be a despicable pilgrimage. Excuses or shirks, public opinion is far superior to the Bishop of Piccolo, who is a red-shirter in personal conduct.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways to worship the FranciscansYes, people agree that the long and hard way of pilgrimage is the most devout and most orthodox way of following the path of the saints and walking through every path through which he barefooted, not to mention the cost of the road. Time and energy, plus the threat of hunger, disease and thieves, you have to be young (at least not older than the Franciscans before the vocation), strong (can withstand all kinds of a torment, and a firm and intelligent person (you don't want to know how many poor pilgrims are lost on the road to life)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, more people choose to simplify the solution<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First you have to worship the Eucharist - and then, from the house where St. Francis was born, to his baptized church; to him as a homeless The Assisi mountain range that wandered through the refugees; to the leprosy hospital near Assisi (St. Francis is there to take care of some of the most terrible patients); to the San Damien that was repaired by the hands of St. Francis after the collapse Church, Church of St. Mary (now St. Francis of the Holy Francis) and some other small churches; to the squares, villages and woods where he preached; to the sacred five-injured Avignon mountain hut in San Francesco To the church of Assisi, look at the statues of Chimabu, Jakopo, Ducho, Giotto and his disciples for the Franciscans; to the Badingula Chapel of the Subo Snow Mountain Monastery (Sanctuary) Jiuji lived as a user;) to the manger in the monastery hall of the Grydy Rudi Valley; to the Hell Hill where he was once buried (which was originally used only to bury criminals and refugees, St. Francis insisted on being buried there, and now is also a holy place); to St. George The Great Altar in the lobby, where the saints were finally sanctified by the will of the Lord after the call of my Lord (yes, the day after the death of St. Francis, people dug him out, the first of the holy two years he again moved to the bottom of a large altar) ...... <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; the key is that this simplifies the process of pilgrimage bishop seems to Perugia, a bit Too slow, he certainly did not suddenly decide to send away Caesar Borgia without reason, the Holy Spirit is on, he saw the assassin of Lovere<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is how a ghost is.Bishop Perugia said that he could say that he had prayed sincerely and returned to his bed to sleep. The bed of the bishop and the monastery provided the same to the bed of the rich pilgrims, not only the curtains. , linen sheets, wool blankets, goose down pillows, and incense boxes filled with dry lavender, it is said that you can get rid of fleas and bedbugs, the specific effects are not known, but the bishop's bedding products are all new, except for the original ones, no strangers The visitor jumped on him to hold a banquet for food.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s reasonable to say that this environment is very good, but after letting go of the curtain, the Peruvian bishop can’t sleep, and he can see it when he closes his eyes. To the long-wearing gray-gray underwear, sleeveless outerwear, and an assassin with a leather belt, maybe the latter thinks that he is no different from many pilgrims... oh, don’t say that the pair should not appear in the pilgrims at all. The body, the eagle and the wolf-like eyes, it is not used for decoration and intimidation but a practical and fine thorn sword and dagger, as well as a string wrapped around the arm - also thought that no one knows that it is not used Is it a birdie to break the neck? Looking at the ball hanging at the end, when Bishop Perugia was a laity, he saw how it took a life--a hand grabbed a ball and the rope crossed the victim’s head. Set, and then forcefully, you will be able to smell the smell of urinating in a short time. It is said that assassins who are as powerful as Samson can even directly smash the target's head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention that Bishop Perugia saw this person at the banquet of Bishop Lovere, he is a bodyguard and swordsman, but like many families, This kind of person is more of a role as an assassin. Bishop Perugia is not a smart person, at least not as good as Picromini, his classmates and friends, but that person has a dog face, which makes He is impressed<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned up in an annoyed body and pinched the meat on his stomach. For many days, the poor Bishop Perugia was having a nightmare, not himself. In a gloomy corridor, the sudden thorns are pierced from front to back (although he believes that the relationship with Lovere is not so bad), that is, when he cheerfully opens the lid of the dish I don’t see a fat rabbit, but the head of a small Borgia.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also let the saints get back to the precious calm sooner.He said to himself, calculating which pilgrimage points to reduce.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilgrimage team set off after the morning prayer, and the little monk brought by Piccolomini was left in the monastery. He was too small, fundamentally I can't keep up with the pace of the adults, let alone they have to go through the rugged mountains, and there is a leprosy hospital on the way to the pilgrimage - although Piccolo is a priest, he is also a teacher at the university. Half ridiculously called a wizard, because he has excellent medical skills and extraordinary medical concepts - he believes that young children and the elderly are indeed more susceptible to infection than strong young people.So after he thought about it carefully, he left Julio Medici and a monk who was looking after him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" The monk asked with a sigh of relief: "Julio brothers?" The reason why he is so respectful is not only Because of the surname of Julio Medici, and because this monk was originally a friend of Lorenzo Medici (or a servant)He is a goldsmith and he is not going to be a monk, but since Medici gave him a generous reward, he can follow the Bishop of Piccolo to travel around Umbria, he can learn more. Things may also work for a bishop in the near future, or if it is possible to go to Rome in the future, then let him take care of the children of Giuliano de Medici, not to mention anything, let alone He also created a beautiful gold lily heraldry pendant for the beautiful man in Florence, and got a lot of money.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to go to the courtyard to seeJulio said<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goldsmith monk looked out, what Julio said was not the courtyard inside the monastery, but outside the monastery, a green and lush place, there is a forest There are streams outside the forest, and on both sides of the stream are the orchards and herb gardens opened up by the monks. Now there are several monks busy in the fields.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
