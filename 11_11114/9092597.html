Get on the horse, then pull the reins, let yourself be in the same position as the other knights, and the distance needed to pull the impact - when the adventurers did not stop, the headed knight lifted the hand with iron gloves to stop They continue to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the territory of 'Black Lev'," the knight headed out loudly. "Unfamiliar people, say what you want, or we will "You have been arrested as a thief!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just passed here," Perant said calmly, he and Kerry Ben are wearing hoods. The feature of the elf is not revealed, and the inner silkie shirt and the secret silver chain are hidden under the dark brown cloak. As a druid, Perant’s body has only a few pieces of jewelry, Kerry itself. Although carrying his secret silver double-edged, but for the sake of concealment, his weapon and the thief in the arms of the dagger, after a lot of plating, looks like an ordinary iron weapon from the outside - - Behind them, Baldwin, his prosthesis was hidden under the coat and leather gloves, and it looked like a lonely warrior. Instead, Leona caused a bit of interest from the Cavaliers. His eyes were on Leona. Slightly staying on the chest, turning to her face, the eyes can not help but flow A trace of regret look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is anyone among you a pastor?" he asked, because he saw the lich, he wore the white robe that Tyre gave, as a The undead and the caster, he will not idle such a precious magical instrument because of dignity and willfulness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a pastor," the temperate lich waited until the knights showed a relaxed smile and continued: "I am a mage."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mage is certainly worse than a pastor, but it is hard to say that the silence of the knights caused a little dissatisfaction with the Lich: "It seems that you need a proof." He said that he raised his hand and, despite the knights driving the horse's flustered retreat, cast a small spell - a water polo made by the spell on the pile of bonfire for "grilling", extinguishing the flame. It is also a black-footed half-length person who has been smashed on the iron bar and has already exuded the scent of the scent. It is hurt and gratefully weep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" The Cavaliers leader screamed sternly: "We also have a mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of years ago." A knight whispered, The Cavaliers leader almost couldn't help but reprimand the idiot, but he looked at the distance between them and the adventurer and settled down - this should not be heard by the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think my companion is just answering your question." Perant said that he is not the first to deal with the most stupid and inferior of human beings. But this kind of thing still makes him feel tired: "So, can you answer one of our questions?" He pointed to the black-footed half-body. "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers leader is very angry, but he knows that a risky team with a mage is not a squatting thing that allows him to bully and insult, and he suddenly perceives a problem, that is, he must be big Shouting can make the voice convey to the other party, but the voice of the other party can not be sent out like a scream. "We are carrying out the task that the lady gave us," he said unwillingly: "These wicked thieves stole The salty pig legs of the castle, as well as some gold coins and silverware, we must torture the whereabouts of these things from their mouths."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black feet half-length People don't steal these things," Perrin Indifferently said: "They live in the swamp and have become accustomed to cold and tasteless food. Even if you put the most delicious ham in front of them, they will only choose to lick the water snake. As for gold coins and silverware, perhaps most of the halflings I like it, but the black-footed half-person will only steal the cloth and the pottery, because that is what they need." Every time the merchant wants to cross the snow-capped marsh under the guidance of the black-footed half-body, never leave the snow cover. The black-footed half of the swamp will only choose these things as commissions. For this, Perant is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not a halfling," the Cavaliers shrugged. "How do you know what they think, maybe they want to change their appetite?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the anti-theft section, the update will be revised before 10 am tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has raised his bow and arrow, and Perant put his hand behind him and swayed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights looked at these strangers in a gloomy manner. The two knights responsible for the "grilling" black-footed half-length were still stalking the horse under the cover of their companions, then pulling the reins and placing themselves in a similar position to other knights. And the distance needed to pull the impact - when the adventurers didn't stop, the headed knight raised his hand with iron gloves and prevented them from moving on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the territory of 'Black Lev', the gods witness," the knight headed out loudly, "Foolish people, say what you want, Otherwise we will arrest you as a thief!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just passed here," Perant said calmly, he and Kerry are wearing The hood did not reveal the characteristics of the elf, and the inner silkie shirt and the secret silver chain were hidden under the dark brown cloak. As a druid, Perant had only a few pieces of jewelry. Although Kerry itself carries his Mithril double-edged sword, for the sake of concealment, his weapon is the same as the thief’s dagger in his arms. After some plating, it looks like ordinary from the outside. Iron weapons - behind them are Baldwin, his prosthetic limbs are hidden under the coat and leather gloves, and it looks like a lonely warrior, but Leona has aroused the interest of the knight leader, his gaze is Leona’s chest stayed a little and turned to her face, eyes I can not help showing a trace of regret in look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is anyone among you a pastor?" he asked, because he saw the lich, he wore the white robe that Tyre gave, as a The undead and the caster, he will not idle such a precious magical instrument because of dignity and willfulness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a pastor," the temperate lich waited until the knights showed a relaxed smile and continued: "I am a mage."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mage is certainly worse than a pastor, but it is hard to say that the silence of the knights caused a little dissatisfaction with the Lich: "It seems that you need a proof."
