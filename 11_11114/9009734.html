			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat in the air is gradually dissipating, and the outside wind blows away the strong smell Gas - the goblin's lair is located in the middle of a barren hilly community, perhaps because they collect the relationship between manure and carrion like collecting gold coins. The grass surrounding the nest is dry and yellow, but only slightly green, but more than others. The fine grass of the place is more lush, and when Leona walks, she can feel that her knees are gently pushed, and the toes should be raised so as not to be stumped by the tough and developed roots of the grass. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They opened up a wide fireproof belt when the mage burned the goblin lair, now it is not necessary to worry that the flame will burn out the entire hill, Leo Na took the flame-shaped sword attached to the back and inserted it into the ground. For Leona, this heavy sword is not a burden, but when it comes to enemies, a flame-shaped sword that is inserted on the ground instead of stuck on the back can save users more time. - She holds her arms and looks around. Although the Elf Ranger has pointed out the other exits of the lair, but because the goblins have the nature of mice and rabbits, their exports will only be more and unexpected - the king of Norman in the Highlands Previously, I only saw goblins in the descriptions of pictures and bards. The ugly ones are like hairless mice, but there is not much mention of their stench. Kerry has reminded them that it is best not to Let the goblin be too close to yourself. The teeth and claws of the goblin hide the poison that can make people rot. Being caught or bitten can lead to unbearable pain and continuous high fever. If you don't get the medicine or timely Treatment, a small wound can also lead to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei can be under a lone tree, with her eyes closed, praying to her goddess, the lilac flowers falling from the tree, falling On her robe and cheeks, and Fro's pastor was unaware, before she prayed, she thought she might not be able to enter meditation too soon. Bydwin’s refusal made her heart feel like a tearing pain, but on the contrary, she almost immediately fell into the subtle concentration when she prayed at first, and she could still hear the sound of the wind blowing through the grass. I smell the turbid breath and feel the flowers fall on the skin. But they are not true, or, not really, everything is like the illusion of poppy, aconite and mandala, as long as she opens her eyes. She will find that she is still in the temple of Asolo, a child under the age of fifteen, who has not yet become a follower of Fro, and her sisters huddled in a room, acting as the maid of her mother. She can only eat hard bread and clear water, but at that time she was pure and as innocent as any girl who walked outside the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birdwin also wants to kneel and pray to his god, Tyre, just like every time before. He prayed to Tell, praying that the impartial deity could watch him and his companions and help them to win and glory, but now he dare not spit the name out of his lips, otherwise his tongue will be seen. The charcoal fire that was not seen burned, he only bent his knees, put his forehead against the overlapping hands, and briefly stated his grievances and determination to the will - he breathed his breath and looked forward to receiving a glimmer of response. But he was disappointed. He didn't get anything but the stench of the goblin. Although Birdwin knew that he would not be so easily forgiven, he still felt that the pain was biting his spirit. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; He tried to keep his frustration shape of the outside. When Leona looked at him with concern, he smiled at her and then turned back. Plum was still holding his hands and praying toward the pure gold bell, an uncontrollable rush. Start. Once the paladin turned his eyes and focused his attention on the only tree that survived. The goblin is a greedy and less savvy creature. When they are hungry, they will even smash the steel. Of course, Their favorite is rotten flesh and blood, but their teeth will grow like a mouse, long enough to poke their upper and lower jaws, so the goblin will also rub the excess parts by biting the trees, by the way. The teeth are sharpened a bit more sharply, so in general, you can't see tall trees around the goblin's lair. This tree survives from the goblin's teeth, probably because it is a bitter. The bark of this tree is as painful as the tears that flow when the lover is farewell, and there is a certain toxicity. When the food is sufficient, the goblin will naturally not ask for it. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "? What you do not smell," Liao Na suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smelly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not quite the same smell." Leona said Then she saw that Baldwin's look became dignified: "Warning!" He said to Leona, while running to Plum, "Go to the tree." He shouted, reaching out and raising his arms violently. The priest, who is in a state of meditation, Mei Mei stood up abruptly. Although she did not quite understand what happened, she knew that Baldwin might abandon her, but she would not deceive or juggle her. She did not Hesitantly climbed Bydwin's arm and stepped on his knees, and by his strength climbed the first branch of bitterness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bedwin!" Li Oona shouted, and Mei Mi also uttered the same scream, and Baldwin subconsciously raised his sword sideways. The yellow-brown shadow passed by his ear—he turned sharply, leaning against the bitter, broad trunk—and his creature slammed into the grass, and his body was like it. As the cold disease trembled, the fat liver flowed out of the crack from the wide sword. It was a hyena. It looked down and sniffed, and even ate its own internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More hyenas are hidden in the yellowish green grass, and almost the same color as the fine grass makes them look invisible, and the most embarrassing two are rushing to Leona. - This human female is different from the men around her. She doesn't have a strong bloody smell on her body. It is a good prey that is easy to deal with. What they can't think of is that this easy-to-handle prey will disappear. Without a trace, they slammed head to head and made a cry of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona jumped up and her feet fell as lightly as a black feathered crane on the metal guard of the flame-shaped sword. Her weight pressed down and stood firmly. The Norman king of the Highlands took the crossbow from the belt and aimed at the two stunned hyenas pulling the trigger. The arrow of the steel arrow They shot their eyes accurately and penetrated into the brain deeply. The dogs didn't have time to scream and died completely. Then Leona shot all the arrows, she couldn't be as good as the elves, but sometimes a small one. A small disturbance can make Baldwin's wide sword cut off a dog's back or neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it over?" When those nasty fur creatures died. Leona shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope, but not!" Birdwin ran back to Leona and leaned back against her. "The stench is not a goblin - —It’s a jackal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder he would feel familiar. The orcs often raise gnolls, just like human domesticated puppies. In the siege war, the scorpio people do not play any role, so they rarely appear, but the patrol knights outside the Thunderbolt often encounter clusters of gnolls. They are good sneak attacks, often accompanied by hyenas, hyenas will bite the horse's legs, or pick up the intestines from the horse's anus. When the knight falls from the horse, the jackals will embrace and they will eat the knight's The body, bring the knight's head back to please their masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s not that they will only appear on the wilderness. They are the devil's forwards, and they can be seen as long as they have evil places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&& Later. Modified back within an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin also wants to kneel and pray to his god, Tell, just like every time before, he prays to Tell and prays for this A fair god can watch him and his companions and help them win and glory, but now he dares not spit the name out of his lips, otherwise his tongue will be burned by the invisible charcoal fire. Lower knees. Putting his forehead against the overlapping hands, he briefly stated his grievances and determination to the will - he held his breath and looked forward to seeing a response, but he was disappointed. In addition to the stench that the goblin exudes, he has nothing to gain. Although Birdwin knows that he will not be so forgiven so easily, he still feels that the pain is biting his spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried his best not to let his frustrations go out of shape. When Leona looked at him with concern, he smiled at her and then turned back. Mei Mi still clenched her hands and prayed toward the pure gold bell, an uncontrollable rush, and the former paladin turned his eyes and focused his attention on the only remaining fruit. On the big tree - the goblin is a greedy and less stressful creature. When they are hungry, they will even look at the steel. Of course, their favorite is rotten flesh and blood, but their teeth will continue to grow like a mouse. They are so long that they can poke their upper and lower jaws, so the goblin will wear off the excess parts by biting the trees, and by the way, the teeth will be sharpened a bit more, so in general, around the goblin's lair, you I can't see the tall trees. The reason why this tree survived the teeth of the goblin is probably because it is a bitter, the bark of this tree is as painful as the tears of the lover's farewell, and there is still Certainly toxic, when the food is sufficient, the goblin will naturally not ask for it. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "?

They head-to-head and scream together with an angry cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
