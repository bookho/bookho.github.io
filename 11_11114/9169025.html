			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a Sol Stone Strange!" a Master screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gredi's priests released monsters that are not only huge earth creatures, but earth creatures are not only used as weapons, but also as Vehicles and bridges, when they hit the wall, the Sol is strangely transferred from the previous host to another host like a parasite - Sol Stone, just before us Described, they have no interest in flesh and blood. The only thing that can cause them is the ore and the metal. There are not many mages that they can attack. The former unfortunate may be just because of a miscellaneous silver. The black iron crown, which was used to keep the mind awake, but still unable to play its role, went to the mouth of the Sol Stone with his encircled head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers and knights are the biggest victims, their armor, chain armor, swords, bows or iron pieces embedded in the leather armor are On the recipe of Sol's stone monster, the three claws of Sol's stone continually grabbed a person and put it into the top of the mouth. Most of them were about the size of a round table, and the mouth occupied almost four points. The third desktop, it has no internal organs, the three huge eyes are like hard rock, the ordinary sword can't hurt them at all, the people caught are lively crushed into crumbs by the stomach of the stone, metal and stone. It is integrated into the body of the Sol Stone, and the flesh and blood of the flesh is flowing down from their "bottom" like the residue of the stone edge, leaving a footprint on the wall - the singers of the Masters There is only one spell that can control these monsters, but not many Masters remember it. The casters of Longshan State are the ones who defend the city. They want to remember what the "ground motion" does, worry about the city wall. Too strong ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there is something called a scroll and a rune in this plane, the shredded scroll and the carrier of the rune, the magic of the light in the stone bricks Flowing in the stone bricks, the captured Sol Stones were found and thrown, and there were as many as thirty feet. The older or the Masters who knew this monster served as the commanding task: “Improve the perception. "" This is seeking the help of the priests. Otherwise, they are not the dragons or the elves. They can't capture the slight fluctuations caused by the Sol Stones in the underground movements. "Avoid the trebuchet and circumvent the gargle. There is a shooting mouth and a wall! The horse road collapsed! Pumping the individual to repair it!" "Change the gravity, don't let them touch our walls again! Fat Lord!" The fat warlock jets from the nose, okay, in this At that time, he couldn't remind people that his last name was not fat. The Sol Stones were abandoned one after another. The Masters issued lightning, and lightning could not be disgusting for this kind of thing. The monster causes fatal damage, just Lightning is not the destruction of rock, but they are just to intimidate these strange stone, and sure enough, they are a fall to the ground, he tried to burrow into the ground disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just as they are busy dealing with these stone monsters, the moat that was suddenly appeared before The blocked earth elements were once again driven by the priests of Greedy. They were not very willing. A soil element, which lost about 20 feet of tail in the rushing water flow, the strength of the shrinking makes it no longer so Obediently, when a priest shouted at it, it smashed it, and completely destroyed this arrogant dragon, no more difficult than a human hitting a fly - but in the young red dragon After the shape of the dragon appeared in the ranks of the priests, the earth elements were forced to stand up and march toward the wall. When they entered the water, they shouted loudly, like a mountain collapse—can have a larger body than other earth elements. Showing that they have a high level of intelligence, perhaps stronger than a monkey, in For the unstoppable damage, the two earth elements that entered the moat even showed a gesture of wanting to attack the summoner, but the red dragon recited a spell, and in the language of the dragon, her voice was higher than the earth element. The sound is like a thunder, like a tsunami. The magical shackles suddenly fall on the three earth elements, and their movements suddenly solidify. The dragon's spells erased their minds and made them completely a tool for the Grinada. Before they acted again, the Masters of Longshan State hurriedly held their hands, one after the other, and the wall was restored as quickly as the other plane in the magical light. But these predictions made mistakes. After the earth elements stood up from the current, they only slightly and tentatively hit the two walls. Their gemstone eyes became dull after a while, and the fat warlock seemed to think of it. What, his look suddenly became frightened, "Expel them!" He shouted: "Expel them, don't let them collapse under the wall!" Some of the more keen masters also guessed, but it was too late, being red dragon The soil elements of the control are straight and the round head of the insects is about fifteen feet beyond the wall, and then a lot of sand and stones pour down like a rainstorm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are going to attack," the consul said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Longshan State know that they will face the real, first strong and lasting offensive - before it was just a temptation and a sneak attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the white phosphorus fumes dissipated, the red dragon unfolded its wings, its sac under the jaws spurred, more glaring than the sun, and even some scales Translucent, she jumped down from the cliff, the wind brought by magic lifted her heavy body, her wings had reached the limit, the blood vessels on the membrane wing were clearly visible, and there was a war left on the human being. The scars left, of course, in return, the human beings of the whole city have become the best meal for her and her knights, soldiers and mounts, but the red dragon will be more careful, she will not repeat the same mistakes, she is a bird's eye view of those small Humans, looking for traces of those cars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon swooped down, the flame that melted the steel spewed out of her teeth, the car and the human being burned, and she was in the next moment Pulling up the body, a smashing arrow swept her tail and flew deep into the wall of the tower. The broken brick was like a biscuit that had passed the night. The red dragon smiled smugly. She saw that the arrow was five feet or six feet. The arrow flashed the light of Mithril. He also saw the human race running over and wanted to retrieve the arrow. "It is capable of killing the dragon. There aren't many arrows, right?” she groaned, and then a wave of scorching fire broke out, but like the night's raid, a transparent barrier protected humans and arrowheads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the Red Dragon angry, she is like a fall to lower the body, the red dragon's claws caught the arrow tower, her wings are like a whip The air slammed so hard that the upper part of the tower collapsed before the humans set up a new brake. The transparent barrier was overwhelmed and disappeared after a faint flash. The stone brick hit the spell protected. Humans, they mourn and fall down, only two or three people desperately rushed to the flames of the red dragon, maybe they think that the flames that have gradually disappeared will not be too threatening, but they are wrong, the red dragon When the flame touched the fresh flesh and blood, it was like being dumped into gunpowder or whale oil. They burst open and swallowed the survivors. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; first lion body and eagle beast wildly Li cried, in order to maltreat Red Dragon Excited, their knights and knights guarded by the knights throw their own spells. Being condescending is their advantage. Although they also have less praise, it is that the eagle lion is not as responsive as the red dragon. Escape every dragonfly arrow, you can kill the dragon's arrow, of course, you can also kill an eagle lion body beast. When hit by the wizard's spells and trapped, the lion beast can also turn over and attack the enemy. But the arrow of this arrow will split as soon as it penetrates into the body. The twisted pieces will destroy all the things touched. The skin of the lion beast is soft and hard, and the hair covered on it can deflect the sword or The role of the claw edge, as well as the key parts will have small scales or horny bumps, just like humans in the chain and leather The iron onlaid, its muscles are more powerful enough to "catch" the arrow into the body, making it difficult to move, so that ordinary arrows can not cause damage, but in a deeper place, the internal organs Where the squirming and blood vessels are densely covered, the lion beast can't have a shield there. The lion beast hit by the arrow shot by the giant python has no choice but to die or wait for death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they have both knights and warlocks, they may be able to fight back or flee, but if there are only knights, there are still enemies in the face. Then, when one or two casters, the possibility of the Cavaliers surviving is very small. The people in Longshan State know very well that once the city-state has framed them, their children, parents and wives will face something, so their Fighting is almost crazy, without mercy and etiquette, the caster squanders his own spells, scrolls and runes as if he were dying at any time, and the city-state knights and soldiers, they also seem to care. Captive of the glory and gold coins that can be obtained after a dragon tooth knight, they only want to kill him, use the sword to penetrate the enemy's body, let his blood soak his own robe and armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original dragon's blood is also temperature." A soldier muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are cold and dirty is the soul." The mage around him said that his brown cloak also spewed a lot of blood, except for companions. There are also enemies, the blood of the Greinada people is also red, and, as the soldiers said, it is hot, but they are not humans, just the monsters of the red dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
