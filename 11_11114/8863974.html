Inside, take out a blood meal mixed with the elf bone powder and sprinkle it to Chimera. "Fly, my child, fly," he muttered. "That is your prey, your blood, yours." Sacrifice! Grab them and catch them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chimera licked his head and pulled out the short gun that had killed the dragon, becoming a card After the container of the black waiter, the intellectual and thinking ability as a intelligent creature left the body earlier than life, even the pain was vague and intermittent. It did not understand the words of the priest Denver, but it remembered Kerry. The shiny creature, he stabbed himself with a shiny stick, it screamed between fear and hatred, and the ugly and sharp voice made the orcs around it feel unbearable - its Bone and muscle roll, swell, rearrange and combine under the skin, most They pierced Chimera's fur and stretched into the air - it was a pair of bloody wings, no skin, only the white bones and the tendons attached to it and the thin, transparent flesh film, when they fanned up and down, deep The red blood resembling black flows down from the wings and accumulates into a small pool on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It flies up, very clumsy and slow, but when it stands up, the line of sight can be almost flush with the top of the giant trebuchet, flying higher, it* * The ground stretched out the claws, and an elf wizard escaped dangerously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to do something," said Kerry Ben, who, like other Elf warriors, took Kremar’s back and grabbed him so that he could Casting spells: "Just do it quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Kreima began to recite the spell after sweeping through the valley and found that there was no omission, he made Gesture, throwing two flames continuously below the trebuchet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impacting flame accurately hits the small wooden boxes stacked at the highest point - when Kremar moves them, it is not without the orcs This strange sight, but they are unfamiliar and stupid about the human spellcaster's tricks, they thought it was one of the magical works of the priests, and even the orcs went to help move the wooden boxes to make them more neatly piled up - This led to the flames of Kremar bringing an unprecedented explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world covers his eyes at the moment he throws the flame. As he expected, a huge force pushed him to the more Far and higher, she heard the screams of the orcs and the squeaky screams of Chimera, and then smelled the rich garlic smell - he cast a trick to dispel the smoke around them, those dazzling enough to melt the rocks The flame engulfed Chimera and the two giant trebuchets beside them, and the orcs around them were either burning or screaming in the smoke, including their priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game.over, Kremar thought, but what he couldn't predict was that he suddenly lost the weight and temperature brought by the Elf Ranger when he was preparing to rise to completely escape the smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry Ben!" The black-haired caster cried in panic, and he immediately saw the flash of the blade in the smoke, the flash he was familiar with. After all, Kerry had used the pair of scimitars in front of him more than once - he saw Kerry Ben, he was entangled in a black shadow, and the head of the shadow constantly swayed in half, half each They are ruthlessly teasing this elf - the Ranger's scimitar can't hurt the shadow-like black imaginary body. The "Silver Crown" and "Starlight" penetrate it like a penetrating air, but the black body can Like a real viper, he sucks his blood greedily and devours his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster did not hesitate to throw out the strongest spell he could cast, and the shadow disappeared after a sneer-like cry. Krimaar caught Kerry Ben in time and recalled the weapon that fell from his powerless hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was completely comatose when Kremar touched the Ranger, he thought without a word, although the orcs were already in a mess, no one I can think of a group of culprit who needs to pursue, but they are better off leaving as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the previously unfortunate elves, they have no extra losses - no, maybe Kerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves brought out all the water of life, healing potions, healing and reel, and Bydwin summoned all the priests from Rosa to Il Mott, but Kerry's torn wound is like a powerful mage or a curse imposed by the priest. It is constantly rotted and melted in the eyes of the crowd - from the shoulder to his neck, arms, The chest, whether it is the skin or the bones, turned into black water, infiltrated the entire white linen sheets, and soon they were able to see the arteries, trachea and tender internal organs that Kerry's trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin looked up at the pastors, and the color of pleading in his eyes could touch anyone with a heart like a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive us for being powerless," said a Rosada pastor. "The high-ranking pastor of the kingdom may be, but our strength... Not enough to dispel a toxin injected with negative energy and negative energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It also took his blood," said another Priest of Ilmot. "There is a lot of fire in his life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If Kerry is dead, the soul of the outside world asks, can he be resurrected with the help of the pastor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——No, once the undead said that humans, dwarves, gnomes, and orcs can be resurrected, as long as their gods are willing to release their souls, but The elves can't, because the god of life they serve is Angris, a stubborn and ridiculous old man. His people respect life and respect death. For elves, death is not the end but another journey. At the beginning, unless an elf bears the burden of changing the fate, they will not respond to the call of the pastor and return to this chaotic world... No, what do you want to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bedwin," said Kremar, "Can all people leave for a while?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin raised his head in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I might be able to save Kerry Ben," said the young black-haired caster: "But please leave, can you?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Elf Masters looked at Kremar and looked at Kerry Ben, the Ranger's breathing has become extremely difficult because his lungs are rot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish." He said that after he took a slap to Kremar, he turned and walked out of the room without hesitation. He was the elf. The oldest one, after Kyreben lost consciousness, he took over the position of the former - the elves are willing to leave, and of course others have no reason to stay, and Birdwin finally looks at it and will die at any time. Friends, quit the room and close the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You can't do this! The scream screams, he is an elf, the son of the king of the jungle, the once undead person shouted with anger and anger, he can regain consciousness and guess what is in this beautiful body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We can escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——And then he will keep this little secret for us? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Maybe no, the soul of the opposite world says, but I don't want to watch him die. An Ilva is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- All the elves will return to the temple of Angris, and the lich ridiculously reminds them that they can enjoy the honor there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——After thousands of years, or 10,000 years later, the soul of the opposite world said, but not today, not now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——But your blundering behavior may make him an octopus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You are not the first person to think of treating the injured with positive energy. Once the undead said, there is a mage who once used his partner, one The knight who lost his legs was thrown into the positive energy plane. His intention was to let the companion regain the healthy limbs as quickly as possible - but the result was that the knight had a whole dozen legs, yes, more than the spider. More, poor idiots, positive energy planes are sometimes more dangerous than negative energy planes. Of course, healing spells can gain maximum gain there, but remember that it also promotes the growth of disease roots or allows ** Unconstrained regeneration - Eventually the knight desperately rushed to a group of giants, neither wearing armor nor carrying weapons, because no mage or priest could restore him to its original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is an elf, the lich sighs and says, and the elves reject and despise all unnatural beings, do you really want to do that? Let Kerry Ben become the first octopus elf ever? Then he was expelled from the silver-crowned jungle, and even if he died, he could not get the call of Angris. He could only mourn the ruins of the wilderness until he was swallowed up by the devil or the demon. They would not care what the food was like, the soul of Kerry. There should be a very good taste that is quite different - he commented viciously, he will hate you, curse you, countless times remorse that he used to treat you as his friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——...呃...that, I want to say...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I didn’t think so well, the soul of the opposite world said that sometimes I am also very selfish. So... sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The author's words - that, the two chapters are deleted and changed into a chapter...
