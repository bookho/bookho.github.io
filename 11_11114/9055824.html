			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada never felt that the morning light at sunrise was so bright and dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caubert rejoiced himself and the Highlands more than once in many years The Norman soldiers arrived late, but not at the latest, and everything was there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Cobbert and others appeared, Gülen had been forced into the sea by the pirates’ arrows, and the sea had not reached his knees. The sea sand was like The octopus's tentacles wrap around his feet, and he is exhausted. His enemies don't even give him a sigh of relief, except those on the shoals, as well as pirates rowing on the sea. They held the torches to illuminate their companions, and the fire was all about the flash of swords and arrows - these were enough for a wise thief to put down his arms and raise his hands to try to reveal a harmless expression. Moreover, there is the Sea Devil, her smell is in front of the thief before her huge shadow, and her waist is hung with a hammer that makes the thief feel familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea devil approached Drake, hit his elbow and smashed the gorgeous pirate, and knocked him down. Drake twitched his mouth and suppressed his thoughts. Going to take a nap and slap a **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is it?" The sea magic is outspoken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't understand what you are doing," Drake said violently: "Our share is well negotiated before departure."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, we originally talked about four or four. You four, I am four, red and two, but now it is impossible for Hung Hom to get a share." The sea devil blinked at Drake. In fact, she wanted to throw a wink. The problem was that her appearance was destined to cause pain in the eyes even if Fro came to her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't wait until everything is over?" Drake whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, look, my cute, my dearest friend Drake," Sea Magic swaggered Dr.'s back shamelessly. The latter couldn't help but burst into creeps: "I know that Gülen has a different meaning to you. You seem to have promised who, if anyone can catch this hybrid, you will pay an extra bounty."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drake glanced around in a disgusting manner, and Ruiyite was not the kind of vanity woman who would confuse the private trading, so only 9☆9☆9☆9☆, m.▼.c¤om is he has One or two less loyal crew members, after all, he cursed his former colleagues and friends a few times after drinking, perhaps at that time he himself did not want to expose the bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five or five points," Drake: "Otherwise, I can catch this guy myself."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four-six, you four me six." Sea Devil. "Trust me, baby, this is a good deal. I am about to catch the king of Baldwin and Norman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I caught Fro's pastor," Drake smirked. "It's already caught, not about to be there, and the Elf Ranger Kerry and the caster, they are big heads."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think so," the Sea Devil retorted, glanced at the situation of the Master. The Master is far away from them. After all, no one wants to be affected by the battle of the casters, so apart from the beginning, the pirates are consciously away from them in the following battles. The flash of magic is still continually lit up, like a thunderstorm in the night, and the battle between them is far from over. "And what kind of master is that? Is he the only heir to the king of the silver-crowned jungle? "Is it important?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t show off your stupidity in front of me." Drake couldn’t help, then he immediately stepped back a few steps, lest It was countered by the sea monster: "We all know that he is the current owner of the island. Even if he is not willing to take out the gold coins to redeem his life and freedom, there are people who are willing to buy him, maybe more than one." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four-six." The Sea Devil insists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless you are willing to bear the cost of hiring Ruiyite." Drake: "Otherwise it is five or five, I have already suffered."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four-six." Sea Magic smiled and said: "I didn't stay with her on a bed. I have the right to refuse to pay for services that I didn't enjoy." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan is willing to continue to argue for a while, he can wait, it doesn't matter, it is worth noting that neither the Sea Devil nor Drake is an idiot, Dray After a few silent hours of breathing, he was "four or six." He. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hah," Sea Devil, she swayed a thick finger, the gemstone ring on her finger sparkled, her, and Drake's pirates acted, and Gülen raised his hands, his fine gold dagger Sandwiched between his fingers, but as long as he waits for a while, it will fall into the sea, waiting for one of the pirates to touch it out, it may be hung by Drake in the waist, the spoils are used to show off It is like a hammer that the sea magic is hanging in the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei was caught in a brace by a pirate, she barely raised her head, because her hair was inadvertently falling into the sea, her hair was like seaweed So draped over the shoulders and face, she saw Gülen from the swaying gap, and the thin figure of the thief was like a narrow crack under the torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heart," a pirate reminds his companion: "She is a pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One Luo's pastor. "The pirate holding Mei Mi does not care: "If she can use any magic, I would be happy to enjoy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The companion showed a smile of the heart, "Cautiously." He, "Let us tie her thumb, so the tie-in will not cause any inconvenience to the later things."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate looked at Mei Mi, Fro’s pastor had been unable to bow his head, his hair covered her expression, but her body was soft and she was disheartened. Cold look, "So the thumb," he, "Do you have a rope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait." The pirate, he pulled off his neck A leather cord with perforated gold coins (the pirates used them to make amulets) wanted to unlock it - he could never unlock it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stainless steel triangular arrow pierces his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a sailor who walks all the year round, Captain Cobbert knows all about the soldiers on the other side of the continent only from the poet's poems and pubs. In the high-profile talks of mercenaries or businessmen, he knows that they are strong and experienced soldiers, and that they are smoldering the sorrow and anger of being expelled from their homeland, but he never thought of mutual urging in the two. How daunting power can be produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a warrior who fought the brutal orcs all the year round, the soldiers and knights of the Norman Highlands can read the entire battlefield in a single moment, and the Master is in the shortest Time to enter the meditation before the cast. The first thing the soldiers did was not to rush out of the ferns, but to raise the longbows and the bows under the cover of the dense foliage. They were not stupid enough to aim all the arrows at Drake and the Sea Devils - although they At first glance, you know that you are the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman’s repairs in the Highlands have asked Cobbert what kind of enemy they are facing – Cobbert is very refreshing to answer that his pirates are almost indistinguishable from the orcs, except one in the plains, one in the sea, so they The approach taken is quite consistent with Thunderbolt – and it is equally true. The pirates are very similar to the orcs in loyalty. They are not human soldiers. Even if the leader dies, they may not feel hurt or be at a loss. They are all 狡猾Despicable selfish ghosts, as long as they find a chance, have a way to cause bad consequences that you are absolutely unacceptable. Therefore, the soldiers did not get too much forgiveness except for throwing the arrow into Drake and the Sea Devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to do is to hold the two pirates of Mei Mi, not because of anything else, just because they are closest to the soldiers, the number is the least, too concentrated hitting all of a sudden The area was completely emptied, and the pirate carrying the nectar screamed, bowed his head, and looked incredulously at the sharp arrow between the third and fourth ribs on the right side. He tried to take a breath and raised his dagger. He knew he couldn't live, so at least until he died. He can still hold a priest of Fro and go with him to mourn the wasteland. However, almost at the same time, a strong fear and doubt poured into his heart, and the dagger stabbed the back of Mei Mi. But because the owner's confused thought was only a long blood mark on Meimi's back, the second arrow whizzed and fell into his eye socket. He fell on his back, and Plum was rushed out of his heavy body with his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's pastor cleverly did not stand up, but continued to squat, hand and foot and climbed to the direction of the arrow, a highland Norman The soldier threw the rope and pulled her into the fern's lair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Hui went back and looked at the rear, feeling that he had to praise himself, if the pirates’ arrows were like heavy rain, the soldiers’ arrows The vector is like a dense thunder, their arrows are longer than the pirates, and the arrows are heavier. If the user's arm strength is not enough, or the bow springs and strings are strong, this kind of arrow The range may not be very commendable, but here, in the hands of the Normans in the Highlands, these arrows are like the magic, even if it exceeds three hundred feet, it can penetrate the human skull or chest, similar The mistakes in the front did not happen again, or perhaps because the object they were trying to help became the relationship between their prince and the former lord. The Norman soldiers in the Highlands did not waste their arms and arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only shot a round of arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byward heard the familiar, whistling sound of the arrow, suddenly gave birth to infinite power from the exhausted body, it was his soldier, he The knight, who has listened to this wonderful whistle countless times on the double wall of Thunderburg, he looked at the pirates who were closest to them from the nearest pirates, struggling with their throats or struggling to fall down, several reactions The agile pirates have already understood what happened. They don’t retreat, throwing fishing nets lined with linen and wire. To catch Baldwin, at least to seize the prince, Leona, who is protected behind him. No matter who they are, since they don't want to let Birdwin or Leona die, then these two people have the value to threaten and blackmail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Thunderbolt lord gently backed back and used his body to push Leona to a black rock standing on a fine sand. The rock was not high, only to Leona’s shoulder, and only two hands wide. It’s so open, but Birdwin doesn’t need much time. He flips his wrist. The golden sword is like a whale that the lady is holding in her hand and teasing the cat. It must be so smart and light. With a dull snoring, they patted the hood to their fishing nets. The fishing net that had previously worked on Gülen didn’t work as expected by the owner. It was shot to the side by a wide sword and even thrown out. His people were also led by a sudden and heavy force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin step forward, swinging the wide sword, and making a pirate who wants to take a gap into the air, the latter’s blood is sprayed into the air, let The latecomers hesitated for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to think about it. Cavalier is the first to break into the pirate group. He is used to using two-handed swords. There are very few people with weapons, and his sword is not as terrible as Visual Wend’s wide sword. They are just ordinary steel one-handed swords, but the power they can exert is not one. Add a character that can be described as a narrow-minded guy. If Birdwin’s killing of the enemy is like a serf who is good at harvesting and slashing, then using a double sword is like a sophisticated tailor. People can often see it. He used a one-handed sword to suppress the enemy's weapon while fighting, and then used another one-handed sword to capture the other's life, or after shooting down the opponent's weapon, put the one-handed sword on his neck. On the wrong hand, his head was "cut". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a "pruning" all the way, and the pirates began to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" asked Birdwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "More than the orcs are more crisp." The Cavaliers replied in a serious manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will laugh later." Birdwin, there are others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before another change occurred, Reyte thought he could win in this battle. The half-elf wizard who was originally the black hair might be able to escape. However, he did not want to give up his companion, which made his situation passive and passive. After discovering his weakness, most of the female warlock's spells were concentrated on the Elf Ranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is only a step away from the sweet fruit, but the bottomless abyss is down, deserve to be cursed for 10,000 years of Drake and the sea devil, and those pirates They, they actually put in a mage! The wizard may not be very powerful, but it is very deceitful and insidious. His spells not only let the wizard called Kremar get rid of her entanglement, but also let her fall into a bad mud – she found herself At the same time, I must face two good warfare and quite tacit Masters. After the reinvention, Ruiyi immediately made the idea of ​​retreating. The same thoughts as her were the Sea Devils. "Remove the spell!" She shouted to Ruiyi. The female warlock took out the whistle and blew it. She grabbed the jewel, crushed it, and closed her eyes to wait for the dizziness that magic had to be effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
