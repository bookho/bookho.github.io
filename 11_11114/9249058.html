The terrible legend of the priest's alienation, but, um, you know, people are always eager for things that are good for them. Fortunately, rituals that worship gods with humans or other intelligent creatures are no longer so common, or that such terrible sacrifices are quite rare except for the whistling plains of the whistling plains and the bottomless abyss occupied by the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the former Grenada. After the disaster, the country of the Red Dragon has long since disappeared. Although humans have spread rapidly, except for sand, Rocks, there are few places to work, so there are only a few villages that are still scattered, and the distance is far away. Some people want to use that huge port - it is said that there was a powerful warlock in the port to build A whole city that can float on the sea, of course, people who have heard of it all sneered, how is it possible, so far, the largest ship is only a thousand feet long, it is already a wonderful result of the cooperation between the dwarf and the dwarf. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the man eventually retracted the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" asked the Ranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flexible crew member (may also work part-time as a thief) smashed the table, the companion around the Ranger immediately put a silver coin, the crew licked his lips I thought I was obsessively looking at him - not wearing the robes that the wizard used to wear. There were no reels or material bags hanging on the caster on the belt. Boots were not boots, and there were no fingers on the chest. Jewelry with a sacred emblem, that is to say, the possibility that this person is a caster is very low, and he looks very young, the texture of the clothes is also very particular, wearing a dagger and a dagger, probably traveling with the elf ranger The noble children - this situation is very common in the past 100 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it hasn’t been... quiet recently." The crew said, while picking up the silver coin, hesitated whether he should continue to hang these two strangers. The appetite of the person, but when he saw the delicate fingers of the elf seemingly inadvertently stroking the short sword, his head, which was confused by the inferior fennel, suddenly woke up: "I heard that someone was there to hold a live sacrifice. The ceremony, specifically the god, I don’t know, but it is said that he is extremely powerful and evil.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranger’s look immediately became cautious: “You Ok?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not sure," the crew said honestly: "Adult, look, I am just a poor little sailor, how can I do this kind of thing?" Ok, I’m afraid I haven’t escaped enough – someone has been exploring, but they haven’t come back, and...” He hesitated for a moment: “Some of my friends said that it’s close to that during this time. The ships in the port are also inexplicably missing, and there are several villages, they..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They also disappeared?" Ranger's companion interjected and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the crew swallowed: "They are all okay...that is, suddenly, they become so wide, you know, there is almost no The caravans are willing to go, but there are always people coming. Anyway, they need salt, cloth and wine, but recently, they... actually bought the sugar from the Longhuo Islands, and they bought the boxes into boxes, they’re going to It’s bought here, there are spirits, silk, wool, bronzes and silverware, as well as gold and jewels. The gods are on, you said, where the dry wheat has no output, where is it from? With so many squeaky money?” When it comes to this, the greed of his eyes can hardly be hidden, and the voice becomes very, very light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranger and his companions looked at each other and the Ranger raised the glass. This was a subtle drop-off. The crew grabbed a few of the Ranger companions. A silver coin, slipped away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do next?" The Ranger companion asked happily, and the elf happily stared at him, knowing that he had an idea: "Wish "Details."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They need sugar," Ranger's companion shrugged: "And it happens, I have sugar."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrow has no opinion on the requirements of the caravan to return to the village with him. In fact, there are already several caravans that are ready to look for opportunities to find out what they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the village are already prepared for the adult’s point of view, but the number of the caravan is unsatisfactory, plus There are only a dozen people in the servant. Fortunately, there is an elf ranger who is traveling. His eyes flashed and he opened his mouth and smiled. "Please, please, dear lords."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aro's village is located on the hillside to the harbour, although not very high, but from here, you can overlook the entire port, they are at night, the sea is waved, the night sky is high Hanging, contrasting with each other - the beauty of the village is comparable to that of the village. The Ranger exchanges a look with his companions. You know, in this world, whether it is the use of torches or candles, the light of the night is a luxury. Even in the bustling Bibi dike, at night, in addition to pubs and hotels, only moonlight and starlight give people comfort. Such a small village is like a bright fire, which is unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the village, the strange feeling is even stronger, the delicious food, the soft sheets, the clean room - yes, the clean room also needs money It is maintained with time, and people here can only make a living from wheat and scarce catches, but there is almost no smell of dirty earth and fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also received good hospitality, the Elf Ranger and his companions were assigned to a room, and when the door was closed, the elf’s companion raised his hand and made a gesture. The eyes of a small sculpture (a winged dragon) on the door dimmed after it was lighted up: "Not bad..." He thought for a moment and said, "For the current Master." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Warlock, or Master?" The Ranger asked: "Or is the priest?" All three have the ability to make runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like a warlock, but..." Ranger's companion frowns, but also like a pastor: "But it doesn't matter, we will soon know." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They seem to welcome us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably need a sacrifice." Ranger's The companions walked around the room and pointed out some arrangements in the room for the Ranger. If only a mortal who lacks vigilance lives here, it would be no different from an animal that has fallen into a trap. "It may be a matter of quantity, or it is exempt from the death of one's loved ones, and you are," the Ranger's companion squinted at him mischievously: "The elf, who has always been the best candidate for the sacrifice - the bard, There are also novels written like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranger sighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I I thought I could sleep comfortably," said Ranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companions agree, who knows that these people are working at midnight, they are not so happily picked up from the bed, and they are cast a spell After being double-banned with the pharmacy, it was placed on the altar - and so on! This is an absolute difference in treatment. The Ranger is on the altar. His companions can only sit under the altar, and with the cold stones, the elf almost laughs out, and the guard on the side is almost certain to be a warlock. The wheel was clenched uncomfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the location is not good, but for the observation of these people, this position is very convenient, the ranger's companions are very savvy to scan the people coming and going, among them The caster, and some of the apparently respected people, wore red robes, and the thing on the neck that looked like a sacred emblem - the red dragon, could not help but remind him of some less pleasant memories, and These people are all male, believe in that... eh? Do you want to advocate equality between men and women in this plane, and have a baby at an early date? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these people, there are a lot of people in the village. In front of their queue, there are about a dozen clothes...there is nothing to say, because there is nothing to dress up because They are almost insignificant, young men and women, with a handsome face or a correct face – the naked skin depicts the red dragon, and this is almost certain of their identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Ranger’s companions guessed whether they were people in the village or people in other places, the village’s team suddenly rushed out of a young man, he Waving the torch, forced the people in the queue of the sacrifice, and grabbed the arm of a girl, "Go with me, go with me!" He shouted: "Juli! Go with me! Don't make a sacrifice Product!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am willing!" The girl named Julie also shouted, "I am willing! I am willing! I am willing!" She even shouted three times, her eyes flashing under the light of the torch. "This is God's gift to me." The glory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that at this time, the boy has been pulled down, stagnation in a moment, the team continues to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The casters once again carefully examined the offerings, from quantity to age, from appearance to mental state, and then the two garments were extraordinarily luxurious (the robes were embroidered) The warlocks of Red Dragon and Dragonfly began to recite the spells loudly and waved their arms—there was a whirlpool on the sea surface, so small from the mouth of the cup until the ship sank. Everyone murmured and kept mentioning the name of the Ranger. The companions felt a little ominous familiarity - when they stunned, a gray head appeared on the sea, it was a soil elemental creature, and a huge body held a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be the god they worship, but the Ranger, and the ranger’s companions can’t see which god it is, it’s too ugly – Today's starlight is extraordinarily bright, and it hurts the eyes almost - can't see sitting or standing, the spider's arms are sticking out from behind, almost touching the ground, the end of the arm is not the hand It’s better to say that it’s a paw, there’s no shoes on the feet, and the big face can be used to cover the rain for a village. The nose is soaring, like a bird, the lips are flat, like a dragonfly, the eyes are deep, like a monkey, the neck is leaning forward. Like a tortoise, the head is even barer, and there are many beards on the chin that hang down to the feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the orc god Kauka is not so ugly, the Ranger’s companion thinks, at least he looks fierce, and this, even if it is The bottom abyss may not be born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is still lying quietly, anyway, he will get the answer soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robes headed up in front of the earth elemental creatures, holding up the scepter, all the people squatted down, and the ranger’s companion listened absently to him. I have a lot of adjectives, like "incomparable evil", "very horrible", "very powerful", "very great", really, this vocabulary is a bit poor, fortunately, this means They will soon enter the topic, and he listens with full concentration...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...we are great, evil, horrible, powerful - The god of the red dragon, Kreima!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say Ha! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say Ha? ! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————————————————<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, hahahahahahahahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry, I was seriously hurt."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...噗...haha...haha...hey..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry Ben!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噗..." Elf Ranger, the king of the jungle, Kerry has raised his hand and held his face: "Good Well, okay, I am sorry," he let go, revealing a red-eyed corner of his eyes. "But...ha, really, I didn't think you would have that day in front of me in that image." He paused: "Maybe it's not so bad? At least... it looks, still...hey, tall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me, "The soul of the opposite world said sullenly: "All the statues and portraits have been destroyed." Lich looks like a twin brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I promise." Kerry is very authentic - as for dozens of days, the Illy of the jungle received a strange gift and we don't have to More to say, how can ordinary statues and portraits express the reverence of the believers to this great god? The holy emblem worn by the headed "Priest" is a special rune. As long as the name of the god is called, the holy emblem will open, and a small "beard monster" will come out from the dragon's belly and raise his arms. It’s sacred, and there’s an accompanying “praise” accompaniment with numerous names...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How do they think I’m going to be such a ghost? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
