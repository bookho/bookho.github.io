The more gorgeous, the more soThe city of Spello is no exception. After three days and nights of parade, prayer, receiving the Eucharist and watching and performing holy miracles, even the strongest man and the most excitable woman can't help but fall on the slate. Or on the bed, they are flushed, dying, extremely poor in the body and extremely incompetent in spirit. At this time, the money they have longed for, the sensuality and power are so worthless, their souls. Already in the frankincense and hymns, I have been separated from the dirty body and flew to the sky in a fluttering manner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street is messy, in addition to the traces and powder left by fresh or dried flowers, there are waxes that people fall during the parade. Oil, black pine branches, decorative ribbons and buttons, and even one or two pairs of shoes, in this age when the shoes can be given as a legacy to the children, but a small loss, but scattered in the night fog Before, something that was slightly valuable would disappear silently into someone’s pocket or apron.By the end of the morning prayer, the first hour of prayer, about three hours, some of the dirty work we mentioned before, ran out of the small room, carrying a broom, wood The bucket, washed out of the street with water, has lost the original flamboyant color and the scent of the broken petals, mixed with carbon ash, dust, stones, as the flow from clear to dirty water flows into the drains on both sides of the street - Speaking of this, the drainage channel was pre-embedded before the small town was built, just like the pottery drinking canal still in use. At that time, they all belonged to the Emperor Claude of ancient Rome. The canal draws sweet and cold spring water from the mountain, and the drainage channel brings the dirt in the city, whether it is human, livestock or nature, to another small stretch of the Topino River, a tributary of the Tvere River. Tributary<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of the ancient city of Assisi, which was passed by them. It’s worth a bit of a poetic poet to ridicule, even though there are still some old-fashioned priests and The historian blamed the memory of Constantine I (the 42nd Roman emperor, also the first credible and documented Roman emperor). Rome was a rotten, locust nest that wriggled inside. A numb slave, a sinister civilian, a vicious businessman, a ridiculous aristocrat, a bloodthirsty emperor, and a pagan god they worship, like demons and devils - but the cities created by these locusts And the roads are still the people who are most willing to use and live. Compared with the new cities that do not have perfect water supply and drainage networks, they are like Assisi, Spello, and the ancient cities such as Foligno they are going to come. Bright and clean<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brown-red skull, the white-cheek sparrow was alarmed by the people who cleaned the street, giving up the berries in the gap (people also use berries to decorate the image of the flower Eyes and lips), fluttering and fluttering, it first fell on the second floor sill of the brown building, curiously knocked on the narrow glass, and the people inside came to see it with surprise. At the time, it flew to a higher place. On the third floor of the window, it saw a young and gloomy face. Then, it circled around the bell building behind the small building, in a convex The white decorative corner stopped for a while, then, when I saw a young priest walking out of the hallway and holding a piece of bread into the sky, the sparrow suddenly forgot what had previously attracted it, the bell tower The sorrel-colored body, the white neck and the elegant bi-colored pointed hat are left behind, and turned into the embrace of food.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before the sparrow fell, the young priest was summoned back to the room by his mentor, the priest of the church of Maggiore, who hurriedly took the bread when he left. Tossed in the courtyard, a large group of sparrows where you argued for me, and kept on - and their benefactors have returned to the dark room, here is the holy room of the church of Maggiore, and Father Maggiore will not Phosphorus is used like Bishop Bicroixi, so he can only look at the precious sacred objects with the light leaking through the small window that can be used as a unit of measure. There are saints with broken nails, bones, skin, There are also whole dry limbs, as well as the utensils they used, from wooden cups to gold bowls with gems, headscarves stained with blood, semi-decayed wood chips (from sacred eucalyptus), with dark brown imprinted linen. The shroud, the scorpion and the box with the above things... and the dedication to the Lord, the silver and silver saints of the Virgin and Christ, the gorgeous brocade and velvet, the intricate lace, the glittering gold ribbon, Beads, gems, coral rosary... These are from the hands of mortals, but as long as they are placed on the altar, draped in holy portraits and sculptures, dipped in the clear holy water, they are Also become sacred<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there have always been people who criticize these sacred items sometimes appear in nuns, monks, and even their lover, but more people think that this It is because the former's vision is too narrow, after all, in some behaviors can be described as the devil into the hell (Note 1), the worldly love can of course extend to the flesh-and-blood body and spiritual spirit. In fact, it is a reasonable thing for a priest to have one or more lovers. After all, the Roman cardinals have always been praised by many children and grandchildren. Sometimes, if these hardworking servants are busy The sacrament has forgotten the worldly desires, and there are also good-hearted old women who come to recommend their daughters or granddaughters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Maggiore glanced at him. Before the young man curled up himself, he said, "My dear child, what made you think that there are enough?" When I heard the tutor familiar, with With the words of sarcasm and slight whistle, the young priest once again stepped back: "You are my nephew," said Father Maggiore. "Although your parents don't care much about their third child, I think You are a smart child, I adopted you and sent you to Pisa to go to college, for which I spent a lot of money," he turned and cocked his robes and found the key to open a decoration. A box with a brass corner, "I must admit that I love you very much, and I am pampered in many places, so I don't blame you for shortsightedness and impatience - I also hope that you can understand my disappointment - I will My friend wrote a letter and suggested that he look for another chanting officer. Obviously, you are not suitable for going to Rome for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stern blame and punitive remarks made the young priest as if he saw the ground cracking, and then walked out of it and prepared to drag him into hell. The devil was as surprised, he admitted that he did have his own selfishness, because this bright red wool was originally promised to give his lover, and such wool, even in Florence, is rare, although he can take other a substitute, but how disappointing a lovely woman like a rose is - he is not willingBut if this is extremely insignificant compared to his future, he wants to say something, plead or apologize, but the priest’s cold glimpse makes him calm down. He is the third son of his parents. It’s not the last one. He has two more beloved younger brothers. If it’s not his uncle’s insistence, he’s just a little thing in his father’s farm.Even after his long brother inherited his father’s surname and fiefdom, his status will be further reduced. When his grandson is born, waiting for him is nothing more than a calf or a mill manager’s job.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately bowed his head in a respectful manner, expressing complete and obedient acceptance of the new arrangement, after which even Father Maggiore took out the Holy of Spello. One of the most precious sacred objects of the Church of the Great Mary - a Ludovico Sforza of Milan, known as the Regent of Milan, who executed his friend in 1480. With Chief Minister Chico Simonetta, and expelling his 11-year-old nephew mother, Savoy’s Bona, out of Milan, he became the only voice in this small country, perhaps In order to pretend his fame, or really from the heart of his apologies, he has dedicated many sacred objects to many monasteries and churches, both in terms of quality and quantity.One of the things that Father Maggiore took out of the small box was one of 770 pages, each page was 12 inches wide, and the text was divided into three columns, each row of 77 lines - these numbers all have sacred meanings - beautiful The golden squiggles are radiant on a dark background, surrounded by beautiful pictures and symbols, and each initial letter is capitalized and outlined.According to the fact that each sheep can provide such a split sheet of sheepskin, this Bible has to sacrifice at least 400 sheep, but this is not the most vanity place. The sheepskin used in this Bible has been dyed noble. PurpleIn the words of industrial dyes, it will take hundreds of years to appear in the dictionary. This mysterious and colorful "Til Purple" can only be obtained from a kind of snail mucus from the Mediterranean coast. After complicated processing, 250,000 bone snails can only extract half an ounce of dye, just enough to dye a robeSo, of course, from the beginning, it can only belong to the most noble, most beautiful and most sacred people.From Cleopatra VII in Egypt, to Caesar in Rome, to the Byzantine royal family - their rulers wore purple robes, signed instruments with purple ink, and their palaces were purple. Even the days when their children were born were called "Zi Ri" to show pure bloodlines.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, only the Virgin, Angel and Pope who are able to wear purple in RomeA parchment paper that has been dyed by Tyre Violet can be said to be a despicable act even if it is exchanged with the same amount of gold. Father Maggiore originally wanted to use it as a killer, perhaps for himself. A more prominent position, perhaps when the sword was added, was used to bribe an unknown villain, but after he heard and witnessed something, he did not hesitate to dedicate it to a Picromi. Ni<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When taking out this precious sacred object, Father Maggiore heard his nephew sighing sadly, of course, he also hoped to dedicate it to the cardinal Even the Pope, but the Roman sages are not easily seen by an ordinary priest like him. A Piccolo is already the most prominent figure he can see.And he still holds a meager hope. After all, the friendship between the Piccolo family and the Medici family has been indestructible nearly a hundred years ago, when Pius II was still Einius, if there was a Medici. With the full support of the family, it is not impossible for Bishop Bicroioni to become a cardinal or even a pope.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
