			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human gods shouted together, so, as every time, the God of God, Ao, came to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods of God that each god sees are different, like evil, chaotic, or gods that advocate violence, such as The god of the storm, Talos, who abused the goddess Lavetta, or they saw a strong and rude male image, wearing a dragon skin decorated with white bones and hair, naked feet and upper body, inlaid on the belt. The teeth of all races, wearing iron boots; or the warrior who saw a whole body of steel armor, holding a big sword, the position of the eye on the helmet is only two gaps, inside is a deep unfathomable darkness; and such as Luna Sulun What I saw was a young man and a young man with a graceful posture and an elegant posture. His eyes were shining like stars, his skin was as bright as silver, his hands were holding bows and arrows, and his back was carrying a quiver; the god of knowledge, Ouge Ma saw a wise old man, dressed in plain style, holding books, and his face was very young. When he looked at Ogma, countless new knowledge flowed through Ogmar's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the gods are deeply stunned by the god of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You call me," Aiou asked. "What is it for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gods suddenly talked about what they had encountered, especially because they suspected that several gods had already encountered an accident - Luna Sulun thought he would not be affected by Cherik, but she When I mentioned Tyre, I still couldn't help but look at the face of God. I hope to see the look of regret and sorrow, but she was quickly disappointed. She forced herself to put this dangerous emotion in her heart and look forward to it. God of God, Ao, can give them help and instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Su Lun once again looked at Aiou, Ogma around her suddenly changed her face, and the Ranger’s asylum responded quickly. Behind her, but she only saw a dark gray chaos. She cast a question to Ogma, but she saw that the elder god showed a mournful color. She wanted to talk but found that her tongue was moving. No, but at this time, she heard that Aiou made a roar that seemed to be able to shake the plane. After that, her thoughts and consciousness broke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conspiracy god Siric is not just to consolidate his lies, he brought the chaotic snake Ariman from Aphrod’s Kingdom of God The seeds, and some gods, are like Lierla, who were polluted by Aliman for various reasons before returning to the Kingdom of God. They lurked in the darkness, waiting for the god of God, Ao, to come. It broke out - the weak gods were first invaded and controlled, like the god of winter, Oulul, the god of water springs, the goddess of abuse, Lavetta... their gods only in an instant They were assimilated into things like sludge, and their essence, although they tried to escape, could not escape the head and neck that Aliman had extended from chaos, and was swallowed one by one in his belly. Some weak gods did not even have the opportunity to struggle, and the powerful or agile god immediately gave up the gods and fled to the foot of Aiou in an essential manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how they once again feel the great fear after being forced to become a saint-like sage, although they don’t know what it is, they can feel it. Those tumbling muds are like sea water, and they are like salt. The fear forces them to grasp the body of the god of God. The gray chaos invades from their essential edges, occupying the essence of the gods and boldly Approaching the god of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hirick, who is at the top of the Guangming Peak, feels the sight of the god of God. At that moment, his power is frozen. He is like a mortal, falling between white rocks, but He is just a crazy laughter - on his side, it is a calm dragon Io, who stands here in a human gesture, at the foot of the body of the snake of order, his hand is the first The cause of the Battle of the Gods - said to be the root of the God of God, the source of divine power, the beginning and end of this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was once stolen by three evil gods, causing Aiou to smash all the gods into the ground in anger and force them to be vulnerable The "Sage" gesture to pursue the position of such things, and the conspiracy god Siric, at that time is still a sad mortal, he can become a powerful god, because he was the first to put such things in In the hands of Aio - he is the first person to see and touch such things with the god of mortals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many gods have guessed where the god of God will save this place after it is found, but until the dragon Ai, God The god of the resurrection of the saints, Shirik knew that such things were kept under the body of the serpent of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He died a long time ago." The dragon Aiou replied: "We are only a rule in front of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The law?" Curiously asked: "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon Ai has been silent for a while: "The god of God must also give in to it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at the things in his hand, it looks like a rough slate, it has weight and volume, but in fact it doesn't, it just An image, in order to be able to be understood, the three gods who had fallen before in order to get it may not know that it is omnipresent, it is the will of the entire astral they are in - it has no form, no Emotion, it is not driven by any force, because it is the source of strength, and like a stone ball rolling in a narrow tunnel, there is nothing to stop it from moving according to the established orbit. Human beings are like dust, but gods are no more It’s a bunch of ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon Aiou can see that Chirac can't understand what he meant, but he didn't go on, he opened his hands and turned into a dazzling light. The dragon, he can feel the anger of the god of God, Io, and how his thoughts and consciousness are pulled wildly - he is the saint of the god of God, but different from other saints Because, at that time, the main material plane was not able to withstand the body of the god of God, his body was created by the latter and injected with power, and he himself was part of the essence of Aiou, he was better than any god. You have to be strong, think about it, he can even create ten powerful gods by his own power, and their descendants have once entrenched in the head of all living things in the main material plane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the eviction of the god God Aio to himself and his descendants, the dragon Ai has almost no resentment, the god of God is his father, and his Brother, he knows that the road ahead is hard, but he still obeys the command of the god of God. Although at that time, he realized that the dragon was only the enlightener of mankind, his heart could not help but feel the bitterness and pain of the heart - perhaps It is for this reason that he will decide to stay at the last moment – ​​even as a fallen god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, Dragon Ao will also laugh at himself. If he decides to leave, or completely destroy his will, he may not be so painful - Pain to madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hirick huddled on the ground, looking at the scene in awe--the dragon Io’s body covered the entire sky after turning into a dragon On the basis of silver and light gold, countless brilliant lights are shining. For a time, in the plane where the snake of order is clean and ignorant, except for the dragon Io, I can’t see anything else, Siric. The eyes are bleeding, but he simply can't shift his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The God of God, Ao, finally arrived, but it was still late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what you did?" The voice of the god of God, Ao, rang, but for the first time, Herick felt that he also seemed to Not so terrible, at least there is a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon nodded: "Do what you dare not do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God On the top of the god Aiou did not speak, he closed his eyes for the first time, the dragon Aiou could not assimilate the law, this is something that God of God can't do - this is why the god of God has been hesitant This is his fate, but after the integration of the law, the God of God, Ao, will cease to exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon Io replaced him in fulfilling this obligation to perform, but this is not a gift, but a curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Io," Finally, Dragon Io said: "My creator, if you still think it can stop me, then come." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remnant of this sentence is still echoing in the air, and Shirek’s body is gone, falling down, he shouted in pain, his eyes were Greatly, he saw that the gods of the gods are falling apart. The souls of the voters, believers, and prayers are like the ants that fled before the flood, but they are still caught up by the filthy rivers in which Aliman is incarcerated, swallowed, no, Ariman has not let go of anything that can bring him strength, fragmentation. The kingdom of God, the body of the gods, the essence, and even the god of God, are also among the targets of his attack and entanglement - Sirrick looked at the dark gray wave and rushed toward himself, panting and opening his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ended up with only one swearing word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
