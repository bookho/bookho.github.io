			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft prevention section, updated tomorrow at 11:30 am. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————— Let the Reaper take a day off today...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanwai-Dragon (5) English The story of Gewei and Edelna<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingwi is not flustered, he is not the kind of idiot who arbitrarily swears and then brings countless troubles to others, West Mary He is clinging to his fingers, and once his signs of life are low enough to trigger West Marie's bottom line, the magic gem will immediately take him back to the warm and calm Emerald Island. Now, the little problem brought by a sea ghost is not only to make him a little disgusting, but also to the point where Ingewei can't deal with it. He can cut off the sea ghost's arm in the blink of an eye and regain his freedom - the hurricane will certainly let Countless creatures can't wait to hide and hide, lest they be torn by the raging sea, but the elves will never be in this rank. Their light bodies and dexterous limbs will allow them to fly like seabirds at the peaks and valleys, or It is like a big fish in the stormy waves, the big waves are not only his enemy, but also his ally, the key is how he should use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, apart from the sea ghost, he may have the "Gray" he just met, Ingeway even one Time did not understand what happened to him - was the priest of Talos teaching the magic? His body was slammed into the air, and then the elf's eyes caught a silvery white. Before he screamed, the guy who apparently got the wrong way of rescue suddenly sank and then threw it in a priest. Before the spear hit his front side and fell into the dark sea and sky - below is the Ingway once again thrown into the dark green water, and the sea ghost who still clings to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are heavier than I thought!" Before the loss of the trace, Edell shouted loudly - he really wanted to rescue this Elf, after all, he saved a lot of trouble for himself. The problem is that he also flies with his mother. The special body structure of the elf is almost as heavy as one-third to one-fourth of the height and body width of human beings. It is effortless to carry, so he did not expect to catch himself. Living is actually a so heavy guy - genius, he still looks like a long body, but still can be described as slender - is it because the male elf and the female elf have a very different relationship? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingwei took a sip in the roaring sea, and after a failed defeat, he was already seen by the priest of Talos, they are like The hunter saw a delightful spread of a deer that had been separated from the deer. But just before they cast the spell and shoot the arrow, a silver-gray figure rushes like a lightning bolt to the surface of the sea. The magic light shines, and then the sea ghost only feels the claws suddenly, the one The elf caught by her suddenly slipped out of her hand. She shouted sharply and searched frantically, but like the priest of Talos, she could not find anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, they just couldn’t find the elf, throwing a deformed Edel, and their own spells came into effect, and they brought up the wet little Sheep, flapping their wings and rushing into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the priests of Talos thought that this little lamb was the elf that almost fell into their hands, Edell had already flew and could not even find the shadow. Arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Egret Hotel in Bibi Dibao is here today A very strange guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bibi Dibao still belongs to the unsplit, great and glorious great empire, managed by the king’s dispatched governor, even It can't be said that it is the best, and it can't be said to be the worst. At least it is much warmer and safer. The temporary port of Biar, it has only three layers of white walls and twelve towers. It has been quite impressive, but it cannot be compared with the port of thousands of ships after a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a dragon, Edel, of course, would not be empty, he easily obtained the required credentials from a thief guild, the credentials are true However, the guards in front of the city gate looked at Edel again and again, because as a businessman, he was too young, and he did not have a caravan, no carriage, not even a bag, the only baggage is a The temperamental lamb, the reason why it is temperamental, because it is caught in the arm by the owner, is not to use it to reveal a little bit of small horns against the other's ribs, is to kick with small hooves Take his crotch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
