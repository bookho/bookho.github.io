			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After encountering such a great change, the first place that the undead person chose in the main material plane was Jianjian Port, which is a The chaotic and evil place, the impression it left for the souls of the outside world is wet, dark, dangerous and cold, the only bright color and warmth (although it is clear what the underlying things are underneath) are those wearing Brilliant silk robes, golden bells hanging on thin belts, stalks and shoulders, along the sleazy roads and gray buildings along the tip of the port, the sergeant Fro, who is all along the way - they are very Young (at least looking) and beautiful, each with its own characteristics, they pulled a flat-wheeled multi-wheeled vehicle with a gold wheel with a solid, shiny satin carrying a statue of Fro, in a charming pose The statue that sits on it is no bigger than the statue of Rosada that he later saw in the White Tower. It is only about two people tall, and it is only carved from ordinary ash, which is mostly white or light brown. The special thing is that it has just been cut down. When you come, you will have a soft pink color, just like the cheeks of a girl, plus the exquisite carving technique, so that the whole statue is as fascinating as a real beauty. Less idiots open the tulle that hangs on the statue and reach out to touch her legs and hips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's pastor does not prohibit them from doing this, although this behavior can be shackled on any other god, but for the symbol For Fro, who wants and loves, as long as you remember to throw one or two silver coins on the wheeler to reach the wheel, if you throw a gold coin, you can jump on the wheel to kiss the mouth of the god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world also clearly remembers the scene of Fro’s parade passing through him, and the caster hides himself in a narrow, gloomy alley. The gray cloak was inconspicuous in the dimly lit place like a slap, and he pulled the hood down. The attitude was not as hot and frenzy as other men. Even so, there was a young priest The white sweet peas walked around him on tiptoes, and it was hard to say whether it was a dance. Because its movement is not large, there is no fixed movement, just focusing on the rapid twisting and shaking of the waist, deliberately highlights and shows off as a part of women - she sings softly. Poor at that time, I only understood a little bit of the unfamiliar alien soul in the lingua franca. Its personal thoughts - the singers of Pastor Froe are more like the common men and women than the holy prayers. Whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm came unexpectedly, and the men and women who were entrenched around the statue of Fro were suddenly dispersed as if they were gathered around the grain. Or one, or several, ran into the house closest to them. There are some lovers who have already established a short-lived relationship between blinking and smiling. Fro's pastor hastily dropped the sweet peas and the satin that pulls the gods. Even if the chief pastor repeatedly drinks, they are not willing to drag. The gods struggled to return to the temple of Fro in the torrential rain. When many dexterous little guys used the torrential rain to blur everyone's sight, they grabbed as much money as possible from the foot of the Fro. In his own robes, some people also untied the satin and took it away. Finally, the chief pastor was helpless. He had to pick up the remaining coins with the other two pastors and then hurried away with the remnants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima witnessed the whole process, and Fro's statue was so abandoned in the middle of the street. Still violently stormy, the wood becomes dull after inhaling too much water, making her look like it is shrouded in endless haze, or the vulgarity of the vulgar finally breaks into the sacred body. The tulle covered on her body was not known when it was pulled by the wind or the wind, and everything was at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s a farce, when the Lich said, and the soul of the outside world thinks so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, in fact, the soul of the outside world wants to say the most. What he sees now seems to be very different from that of Jianjian Port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you see it now," Kerry Ben said: "It was a model sixty years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreimaer reveals a stunned look: "So she just went to see you...just for this." Before Mei Mi always followed Bywin, others - thieves Gülen did not have to go Say. The relationship between them is no better than the viper and the mole; the black-haired caster has already remembered the face of Mei Mi—especially the nose of her who can almost go to the cos "the person you know" Mei Mi always remembers him, although she knows that the mage who acts similar to the white robe will not abduct her for no reason, but when it is not necessary, she will still walk around him; as for Kerry Ben, many people dare not approach him too casually. The elf is like this, sparkling, hateful and self-defeating. Mei Mi doesn't want to fall to the point of not treating a man as a lover but as an enemy, so she will be far from Kerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not long ago, they stopped again and prepared to camp, Mei Mi quietly followed the footsteps of Kerry Ben - she thought I did it myself secretly, but everyone found it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it is for this." Kerry Ben said: "I have participated in their ceremonies..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, not only Kreima, even Birdwin and Gülen looked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the Elf Ranger followed: "No, it’s not for you. At that time, Fro’s ceremonies were not so..." he thought After a while, I finally gave up looking for a less vulgar adjective: "The pastor of Fro did not insist on being associated with every man..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"The same is true of Pastor Fro." Gülen said half-jokingly and half-heartedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...different from the present," Kerry Ben said: "Very different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I think I can understand what you mean." Birdwin said: "Her dance makes me feel calmer and more happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soul agrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro’s young priest put on a dark brown linen robes, one of the things that Kerry’s carry-on, regardless of gender. Unusually wide, there is no embroidery or decoration on the robes, the neckline is higher than the clavicle and the hem is down to the foot, and there is no hanging golden bell on the thin belt around the waist - she holds a bunch of exotic sweet peas, its butterfly The petal is a pale pink that resembles white, has a bloody vein, and the flag is a deep red like a rose. Unlike other Frocher, her other hand is still holding a bunch. Wild wheat with heading flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that Fro's holy flowers did not include wild wheat," said Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to include." Elf Ranger said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a bit strange," the thief continued. "The wheat is a symbol of high yield. It should be enshrined in front of the statue of Greed..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not sixty years ago." Kerry whispered, then, as if he was afraid of something, they fell into a dark tremor in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is almost unaffected. Probably only the soul of the outside world that has no concept of the gods. As a dead house that has lived in an atheistic environment for nearly three decades, he has not yet developed a nerve that is sensitive enough to this; A plane's soul puts more attention and attention on the plum. - Pastor Fro is not wearing any accessories today. The dark brown hair with long blond hair is also combed into a bun and then coiled up. Small branches are fixed - green leaves are still growing on the branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her posture and movements tend to be rigid to the current Pastor Fro. It can even be said to be boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young priest’s gem-colored eyes look straight ahead, arms crossed, left arm open, right arm open, forward, close the right arm, left arm open, again Repeated, her shoulders did not shake a little, the waist was straight. When the toes are lifted, they are straight, gently kicked forward, and kick the dark brown robes a little; then bend down the knees, bow their heads, solemnly salute the invisible gods, and each movement is so slow and solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really stupid, the thief thought, the god gave up, and her followers picked it up again - he never violated the teachings of his god Marquez, even though Gülen was not his pastor. But he knows that many times, the tolerance of the gods is more rare than the birds flying in the sea. What they need is the absolute loyalty and meekness of the believers. Rather than self-righteous rebellion and arrogance, this question cannot be spared even if Tyre, who is a god for justice and justice, is not immune to the rumors that the thieves have seen in the port of Tsim Sha Tsui in the past few years. Quirky and cold, she may not be happy to see a priest complete her ritual according to the method of sixty years ago, even if it is a small ritual of only five people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one more thing he must admit. The current plum is full of an indescribable charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, what made the thief even more surprised happened to the golden bell that symbolized Fro (it was placed on a small wooden stake After giving the sweet peas and wild wheat, Fro's pastor pushes the ritual of the sacrifice to the next step. In this step, Fro's priest will dance with each male who has not yet aging to the disabled, and she The hand did not first reach out to Bywin, but chose Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief put his hand in the hands of Pastor Fro, vigilantly, and he vowed that if Mei Jin dared to curse him with some unhealthy diseases, then no matter Wherever he will find her to kill - he holds her hand, Gülen's hand is cold, since the curse of the priest of death, his body temperature is as low as a dead man, but Mei Honey's hands are warm and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should be honored," Mei Mi said softly: "The first male chosen by Pastor Fro in the ritual will receive the opposite sex this year. Favor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think there is anything to be happy about getting an idiot." The thief said in a smaller voice than her: "Unless she can change Be smart, or I think I still refuse this blessing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are not an idiot, how can you like you?" , thieves." Mei Mi said harshly: "Rejecting Fro's blessing may lead you to lose your lover forever, and you will cry all day and night, like a baby."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief’s answer was to hurt her hand, and Mei Mei gave him a sneak peek, but it didn’t make her forget her duty, “Call this name,” she Singing, "Fro!" The name of the flower, the fruit, or the life;" She twisted her finger while holding the thief in turn Wrist, while half was forced to make three rotations of each other, "originated in the land of the original things. "With the strength and direction of the sharp rotation, Fro's priest escaped from the thief's arms, and it can be said that he proudly threw him a triumphant look, and instead extended his hand to Birdwin.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The name is the source of the water, the heart of the lover's thirst. The pure hands, hidden in the name of the tangled sweet peas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Bird There is only one hand in the warmth, but his hand is so hot, burning like a magma and a charcoal fire, so that Fro's heart can not help but jump wildly, she can feel the blood pouring into her cheeks and her eyes, she The footsteps are so light, the senses are so keen, she can clearly see every tiny line of the person she admires in the smiling moment, hear his steady long breath, smell the smell of steel and honey:" Shout this name, shouting the name of Fro, and unfolding the fragrant ovary;" she whispered, "Knot the fruits; pray to her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray to her," Birdwin responded gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to remember this name, just remember the sweetness of honey; you have to remember this name, just like remembering the clearness of Ganquan; you have to remember this name, one If you remember the gloom of the flower; call the name and pray to her. Call out the name of Fro."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has taken over from Bywin’s hand. Fro's pastor, although he can see that Mei Mi is more willing to dance with Birdwin, maybe she will not feel tired all night. So the elf just circulated with her for a week... and she turned it to the bright, eye-catching black hair caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor plum was suddenly stiff, and she almost stumbled on her own, if it wasn’t for Crimmar to hold her in time—in the soul of the outside world In the incomplete memory, except for the kindergarten, the limbs have never been coordinated. He does not seem to have danced with girls of the same age. Whenever he sees other people enjoying the joy and brisk dance on TV or in a movie, his feelings may only be described by envy and hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, they quite match." The thief who was idle said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cremar is still a child." Kerry Ben immediately said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief glanced at Baldwin, and Birdwin nodded calmly and seemed to agree with the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, plum." The thief said that no one found a hint of mercy in his words. He strode forward and grabbed Mei Mi from the hands of Kremar: "I think you should change your partner," he said. (To be continued.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
