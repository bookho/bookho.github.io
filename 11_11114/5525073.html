			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hand wrapped tightly by the soft black lamb skin touched the priest’s throat gently, she just showed a lazy smile, she was So young, has never been rejected, not to mention that today belongs to Fro, the days when men and women can gluttony and indulge without any scruples, she looks up and waits for more touches and embarrassment. Pinch, she hopes that this hand is strong enough, she likes to be treated rudely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she wished, this hand was really powerful. It held the priest’s neck and lifted her up with ease, just like picking up A deep-sea fish pulled out of the water, she only had a half-shocked expression and was thrown out by a pure force. Her back hit the thick door that was just hidden, and the door touched the door. Large enough to shake every piece of furniture in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark brown wooden door was knocked back again as fast as it was when it was closed, and Fro’s priest was pushed to the wall, she was heavy The wooden board screamed and wept, a rough and strong guy standing in the door in confusion, the candle falling on the floor was still burning, and the light swayed to illuminate his jaw. Like a dog that has been digested for a short time, it stretches forward like a wild dog. He smokes a fat nose, his eyes flash like light in a faint light like a charcoal fire that is about to be extinguished, and the khaki skin is full of scorpions. This is a characteristic of the ogre, but a normal ogre should have nine feet to ten feet instead of seven feet and a half. In addition, this face can distinguish the five senses, indicating that one of his parents is very It may be a personal class - most of them an unfortunate woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This uncompromising hybrid first puts the stick into the room, then the head and body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he realized that he had stepped on something, he had already fallen, his weight made the entire pub a slight vibration, the stick from him The hand slipped out, "No.! He! No.!" He tried to get up from the greasy piece and called out his accomplices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halfling who was hiding outside the door raised his dagger and hesitated whether he would join the chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-ogre stunned and stood up, "No.! He!" he cried angrily, finding his own stick in the broken chair. His knees hurt, and he couldn't find his own prey. The unexpected setbacks and the more intense killings caused the roar to roll in the depths of his throat. He sucked and sighed deeply. The stench from the mouth of the full-fledged pig can be used as a second weapon - he turns around in the room, heavy and heavy wooden sticks in the time when ordinary people can't finish a whole sentence. It has already smashed all the things that can be touched. The bed tilted and collapsed when the half-ogres jumped up. The wick grass slipped out from under the wool felt and was ignited by the burning lamp oil. Hundreds of The bugs crawled out of their hideouts and canteens, waving tentacles, coleoptera, and joints in the smog of their widows, whose shadows covered the entire wall in disorder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big thumb bug fell into the red eye of the half-ogre. He grabbed the bug, chewed it in his mouth, and quickly blinked to restore the blurred view. With the flames flowing around the lamp Suddenly rolled up his ankles and dexterously climbed up. When he was eager to put out the flame on his legs and dog skin shorts, a fine sword pulled from the cane broke the smoke and penetrated from his back. The fat heart was stirred up quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth and wanted to make a terrible roar, and the smog poured into his throat, so the last thing he left in the world was A boring and hard cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halfling is desperately wide-eyed, the damp wicks emit a lot of smoke, only smoke, no light - just when he thinks so He saw the light, the burning white light, his eyes immediately smashed, a tiny crystal followed his darkness and his mouth was squeaky, his throat squeaked like a gas-filled skin. Slowly squatting down, no daggers that came in handy fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third person who climbed up from the rugged façade of the pub saw only the shimmering white light. He used his fingers to pry open the wooden window, and the smoke suddenly hurts. In his eyes, the steel piece he held was hot and he was hot between the two breaths and he couldn't hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed out uncontrollably, released his fingers, and the bow fell with his unbalanced body. The window was only fifteen feet from the ground, and wanted peace. It’s too easy to land – if there isn’t a silver rope around his feet, that’s true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His back of the head and the hard gravel ground have a solid kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the pub masters slowly climbed the stairs. The fire has been extinguished. After all, there are not many things that can be burned here. There are black ash and residue everywhere, as well as a wide variety of odors. The flames lick through the dry smell of cobwebs and dust, and the blackened walls are cracked. The smell of mud, the smell of sea breeze and rain, the mild smell of wick grass and wool felt, the hot smell of lamp oil, the blood of half-ogre, feces and urine are mixed together for a whole year under the ground. Shark-like rancid smell... You can of course completely open the wooden window to disperse them, provided that you are not frozen and drowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is really no room under this." He shook his head and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We don't have a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What a terrible news this is - there is no room, the lich screams viciously, you will die, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I am not complaining, the soul of the outside world argues, but what do you want me to wait for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I said that we are a stranger to Jianjian Port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- You can at least remind me. The soul of the alien world said in the heart that perhaps we can try to avoid this unnecessary ... conflict, but he forgot that there is no such thing as "in my heart" in the world of consciousness. The lich therefore made a sharp sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Like them as monsters and nPc in your game, the lich tells straightforwardly that although they can’t be resurrected, they will refresh, the only inferior race can be praised. Probably because you never have to worry about missing a pair of hands in your pocket or a stick that is rushing to open your head. The cheapest in Minkang is the life except the gravel in the sea. They are, you too. Since you have already died once, I thought that you would cherish it a little more - don't forget that death is not the end in our world, and unbelievers will be taken to build walls, eat or trade. And you, a soul from another distant plane, may have more and more important uses...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- never, different The soul of the world interrupted him, I never forgot, every word - so I can cut a throat or pierce a heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You will get used to it, the lich said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What a terrible thing this will be. The soul of the alien world muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stepped into the corridor that still had a little smog, and the place was quiet and dark, like those behind the door, there was no living or They are all dead – the coral-colored robes quickly disappeared from their line of sight, and Fro’s priest miraculously escaped a life from the half-ogres’ sticks and flames, although it’s not Injury - but she has cured her skewed nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I thought you would be sympathetic to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Who? Hey, I know who you are talking about, Fro's pastor - for the bottle of problematic honey? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You praised her legs and thought they would satisfy the most imaginary imagining of most men and a few women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world bursts into a deep laugh in consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-God... um, sorry, I mean, I never thought about it, that... um, a little embarrassing saying that there is still Concealed and literary expressions - yes, I praised it, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--But living things will make you nervous If you don't speak, you are more willing to face a gadget that can be downloaded, copied, and deleted at any time, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——... Is it my illusion? You seem to be happy to see me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Maybe because you are not so stupid when you are jealous? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub’s front room is empty, with new firewood in the hearth, and the fire is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thin, hob-headed man eagerly stretched out his head from behind a stone counter with shells and gave them a pot of steaming peach juice. . The ribs barely protruded from the bare part of his fur. He had a chained collar around his neck. The other end of the long chain was attached to the wall. He was the slave of the pub owner and helped him carry the barrel. Paint the walls, clean the floor, and hit the kitchen. The owner of the pub has to look at the mountain of beer barrels and wine barrels when he has to leave the pub for various reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the tavern stands at the entrance of the alley at the back of the tavern, covered with a long cloak of water. The cloak is made of the wand of the whale, and the rain As if separated by a layer of air, he carefully looked at the face of the person who fell from the window. It was still a child, and the beard on his face was as light as a hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about this?" shouted the small goblin of the corpse, his voice was sharp and thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't work." The owner of the pub said that Kuan Ping's face passed a hint of subtle anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
