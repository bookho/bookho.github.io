When the speed of the ship has not reached the highest level, the words are not shredded by the wind, the elf ranger regrets Say: "The speed is too fast, otherwise, we can play the last game, I think, this time I can also try - it seems quite interesting." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer's forehead jumped unconsciously, and Kerry's tone reminded him of something very bad. He remembered that he had never been from the elf. One thing that was discovered in the mouth... What did you do with this physical idiot when they first took the fly-wing ship in Gray Ridge? He almost dared to make sure that it was unprecedented, even a stupid thing, because Kerry’s smile was so subtle and rich, and he’s more than once slamming his side, trying to figure it out, he’s at least Knowing that you are still not maintaining the minimum dignity that a caster should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can’t be stupid to ask what they did at the time, the elves will be worried – there’s something about why he even did what he’s done Forgetting all the best - when you are not at the end of your life, the undead person once absolutely does not want people to suspect that there are actually two souls in his body. His identity can not withstand too much detail and profoundness. The investigation, the righteous and kind person will question his position and origin, and the evil person, or the non-human and the undead, will flock to try to get him away. There are two inhabitants in one body on the whole continent. It is still very rare, even if Kreima is not a redemption lich, he is also a good enough to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the elf's ridiculous eyes, the lich can only reconcile: "Yes, Kerry, yes, it's a pity." Then he Just drop your eyes, put your fingers into his pocket, and make a way to sort out the casting materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the strange silence that may have made Kerry’s surprise not last long, the flying wing of the flying wing has been fully opened. Forming an obtuse angle with the hull, they extend to both sides, the length exceeds the entire hull, and the wind makes the sails bulge. Lifting the wing slightly tilted forward, the small winged ship has no cabin. Except for the elves and the mage, other people can only tie themselves to the mast tightly. Kerry has reminded them. When they fixed themselves, they faced the stern, so that the wind would only blow from their back to their front, instead of oncoming. Even so, Baldwin and Leona still clearly felt the power of the wind. It is not invisible, it is like a tangible wall, or a cliff; the thieves of the thinner body, Gülen and Fro's pastor, Mei Mi, bend down the back and shrink themselves into a ball. . The wind blows their hair and clothes straight, and Mei Mei wants to pull up the hood on her robe to resist the wind that cuts her back neck, but she will feel difficult even if she raises her hand - her "Little Monster" Smodios climbed out of her robes, and its hair was erected nervously, stabbing on the face of Plum, "Don't!" Fro's priest shouted, her voice only stayed one time. In an instant, it disappeared into the whistling wind: "You... will be blown away by..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be careful," the little devil Asmodeos replied perfunctorily, its pointed claws pierced the shoulders of Pastor Fro, while pretending to help Plume pull the hood while observing the bow. - The elf is concentrating on his rudder and the caster is standing by him. The two are like iron spikes nailed to the board, the wind picks up the caster's white robe, and the dark pockets flicker, like most casters. The black-haired half-evil mage's pocket is tied to the belt with a Mithril chain. After all, it contains the most important private possession of the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It squeezed the paws, the thief Gülen was behind the plum, he stared dangerously at the little monster, his hand on the fine gold dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos grinned at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the hood was pulled up, Mei Mei felt much better. "Come back," she urged. "It's too dangerous outside!" Her devil's fingers were still in the small bag of the "Little Monster". She was in the middle of the night, and Leona sneaked out when she fell asleep. After the dry, the devil's fingers that can be used only by grinding, the gold coins that can be exchanged for her are enough to completely submerge her. As long as there is such a bag, I want to occupy one in the Temple of Fro in Longhuo Island. The position of the chief pastor is not impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodais is on her shoulder, this stupid woman has used his purpose here, it only regrets that there is not enough time for it to Tie her eyes, or suck the blood on her tongue, but these are not the most important, it needs to be disguised to the last moment, lest the adult accounted for its work in the final critical moments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as a person who has not taken a flying wing boat. Even if someone else narrates or describes it in detail, it will be subtle and subtle. Use, but for the king of Norman in the Highlands, she first felt a wild boar with a weight of 500 pounds sitting on her back. She was almost out of breath, maybe not too long, but she can say that this is her. The longest period of time in two decades, but then, without warning, and without any excessive, the wild boar flew up, no, it should be said that it has become a huge snow sculpture - in the palace of Pharaoh A specimen with a snow sculpture is said to have been captured by hundreds of casters and adventurers from the extreme north where the orcs are hard to survive. It is made into specimens, and the eyes are two precious iridescent obsidian, claws and skeletons. Pure gold, in order to reset it, Pharaoh broke through three rooms, Leona was allowed to return to the court, went to the room more than once, she is not a small girl, but still have to rub their feet and straighten their arms Can you touch the shackles of snow sculptures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shouldn't be there, Leona once sadly imagined that it should fly in the vast open air and vast sky, even if one day, it will die because of aging and enemies, then it should return to the earth, not like this. It was placed in the human room without any dignity, and it was annihilated a little by dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, her imagination seems to have become a reality, she was captured by invisible birds, its claws crossed her ribs, her Take the cold high altitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait..." Mei Mi suddenly said: "...someone...know...flying ship...boat..." her voice was intermittent But it caught the attention of others - in order to ensure that they were not taken out, they fixed themselves on the mast. This flying wing had two masts, and the distance between the three was actually only ten feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan asked, he looked at Mei Mi’s gaze "Oh!" he said, "Jewel," he said in his throat. "I want to know... this is... normal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;not to point out. Byrdwin has also seen - something in the stern is shining, the beam leaking out of the deck - the intact deck is impervious, especially the elf's boat, and certainly not such a wide beam. This can only explain one problem - there is a gap in the deck, and the beam is constantly expanding and expanding, but in the blink of an eye, the entire tail of the vessel collapses with a loud bang. The debris screamed like a sword, and a Mithril nail hit Liona's forehead. She fainted in silence, and Birdwin broke his shackles with two backhands. By the side of Leona, he arrived very timely, because another wave of debris hit them, and Birdwin waved a wide sword, blocked the debris, and then turned his wrist. The broad sword was pierced into the deck, grabbed Leona and quickly cut off the rope that fixed her - she and plum honey fixed themselves on the vice, and as the tail broke, the vice was crumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei screamed, Gülen pulled out the rope - the silver string that had a constant activation, and it slid from the wizard after boarding the ship. When the thief arrived, Gülen didn't know if it was sent by the black hair's caster, but he certainly wouldn't refuse it. This rope is a vicious threat to him and a sweet guarantee - in his time Sex is still standing with these people, but he did not expect that it was actually used by Mei Mi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The string caught the plum plum that was falling rapidly. Worse, she tied herself too tightly. Now the rope not only bears her own weight but also a full mast, and the rope is pulled straight. The thief’s face turned white, and the snow was worse. The cracking drive was spreading to the whole ship. As the magic runes were destroyed, the ship began to go crazy and there was no rule to shake it. It was like a dancer in a pub. The fig leaf on the fat hips that swiftly swings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope rubs against the shark's tooth-like deck edge. With a squeaky voice, Gülen tried several times and couldn’t hold the rope. It swayed around and the thieves didn’t feel that they had this power, even if they added Birdwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kreimaar!" Gülen shouted desperately, but fortunately the black-haired caster did not let him down, his spells fell on them, one The sticky and disgusting tentacles climbed up from the deck. It first wrapped up Leona, then Grab and Baldwin, and the extended tentacles picked up the wet plum from the Starlight River. Then they were wrapped up in a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My little monster!" Meimi shouted vaguely, her face wrapped in sticky tentacles, and she smelled the juice when she spoke. Flowed into her mouth, but she had to find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't mention that!" Gülen struggled, trying to pull his left hand out of Bedwin's legs, the bottomless abyss down, this It was so disgusting, but he hit the plum on his chest and let her make a sharp protest: "Do you care only about this! - Oh," the thief shouted: " Damn, plum, the little bastard that should be cursed 10,000 times!" His left foot hurts so much that he is worried that it has been broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deep inhale!" Budwin shouted. "We are going to fall into the water!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had the privilege of exposing his head to the outside, and it was for this reason that he saw that their ship had been completely finished, and Kreima floated in the air with Kerry, and the dazzling light of the starlight rushed toward Their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fell into the Starlight River with their tentacles, and the amazingly huge waters flowed here are completely uncontrolled by any external forces, they are wrapped in this A huge tentacle ball, all the way down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a scroll?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
