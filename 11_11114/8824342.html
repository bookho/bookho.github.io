			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his own little sister, there is not much opinion from the priest who wants to bring a Fro, Baldwin, although he is cautious, he still sees that Pastor Luo - that's really a nice beauty, especially for his embarrassment - he started to fight shield for Birdwin from the age of ten, wiping wide swords, feeding horses, empty time is not used And the priest (not the priest of Fro) learning to write is to practice martial arts with his companions, and with Thunder Castle as a military fortress, the proportion of men is much higher than that of women, and those women are almost as strong and rude as men. He only saw girls of similar age at the market twice a year - but those girls have become rough because of the hard side town life, short and thin, and the daughters of businessmen and knights may want More beautiful, the problem is that they are always kept in the room by their father and brother like a bird. When they travel, they will be covered with the spun yarn of the heel, followed by the servant maid. Squire is impossible to get a chance to see the true capacity and allowable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he was ruined by a holy wife who was proud of his actions. It was normal and could no longer be normal. Birdwin allowed him to take it with tolerance. The woman, but asked him to be responsible for her diet, clothes and horses, and not to slack off her duties, he quickly handed over to Xiao Xiao from a mission, that is, the horses that Birdwin won at the contest, The armor and the weapons are all returned. If any knight insists on retreating for dignity and honor, he will take out the gold coins and gems from his box and buy a pair of equipment worth about equal to the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that is a lot of money." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fur that I brought to the White Tower has almost gone out. I still have a savings in Wangdu. Maybe I will go back this time. There are rewards - I don't have any place to use money... Oh, wait, let me think, you can help me call a jewelry merchant and a silk merchant, I think I can give my wife a surprise." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go," said Xiao Xiao from the "German."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You You can also give your lover a little gift," Birdwin said kindly, not explicitly pointing out that Fro's pastor was rude and unhappy - even if it was just a dream, it was a sweet dream: " She will like you more. If there is no money, you can take it from my suitcase first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Yan slammed his face, but he still remembered to bow to Birdwin before he stepped out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin sighed happily, and Xiaoyan’s eyes and expression made him involuntarily recall that he was young – he was only a hunter at the time. Except for brave and strong body, his wife, at that time, was just an orphan who had no parents and relied on spinning and spinning. Their houses (or mud sheds) were between each other. The distance is only a few feet - no one remembers who is closest to who, Birdwin only remembers when they first cuddled each other, oh, poor Penny, she is so thin, all bones, The hair is sparse, but her body is so hot, and even the hot bonfire in the harsh winter can't match it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin went to the desk and took the paper, the quill, the ink from the drawer, and he carried the letter bird with him, it would take his letter Returned to his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the window all the way, let the sun shine on the letter paper, pressed the slightly curled parchment with the mica stone paperweight, he thought about what would happen for a while. Write, only to smash the quill in the ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin and his wife are both slightly better civilians than slaves, and of course there will be no pastors or mages to teach them literacy, Baldwin still Because of his bravery and keenness to win the favor of the last master of Thunder, he was fortunate enough to get an opportunity to learn to read and write to his clerk - the former lord of Thunderbolt was a good man with a heart like gold, although Baldwin When he saw him, he was already an old man who had to be white, but he was still so majestic, powerful, and impartial. He had been in Fort Rebec for sixty years. For Orcs and Highland Norman, The old knight of Tyre is more solid than the Thunder, and is indestructible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a son, but unfortunately his character and thoughts are contrary to his old father. He only wants to enjoy himself in the king, his hands and feet are soft like It was a noodle with water. The old jazz gave his son and his property all his son, but he gave his army and Thunder Castle to the adopted son, Bywin, and made him jump from a civilian knight to a possession. The nobility of the surname. But Birwin’s wife has not been able to learn to read and write, and Birdwin has found several declining aristocratic women to teach her to write and read, but not long after She would shut herself in the room and ignore it until Baldwin let the women leave - she would only write her own name until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
