In order to ensure the smooth progress of the ceremony, the new lord of Dolling also took out the snow honey collected by the consul--the bottle of snow honey is only as big as the thumb of Birdwin. This is called Mullen. The child who is about to take on the task is a bit shy to hope that the owner of Thunderbolt would not think that he is a sly villain: "Since the elves have blocked the gray ridge," he said: "The snow honey is getting less and less, and even the last month can even It’s rare,” he said angrily. “You, these are still a master’s book for the merchants, but they haven’t had time to take them away.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honey bars, honey wine has the same effect on me,” Birdwin said. “Snow honey is the love of the wizards, and I am just a... ordinary warrior.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry," the young lord of the young man said calmly: "That The teacher still doesn't know about it. If he intends to make trouble, I still have enough gold coins here, as well as some precious magical instruments, which are enough to offset his anger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Drink," said Kerry Ben. "Stupid, do you forget who I am?" He smiled at Mullen: "Respectable lord," he said softly, not because of Mullen. Juvenile and despise him: "What I want to know is - Does Dolling have any intention to do business with Gray Ridge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand standing behind Mullen The wife of the original lord, the daughter of the old governor, a true lady suddenly screamed softly, and when Mullen reminded, he also fell on the ear of Kerry, and was pale gold. It’s as if the tip of the ear that is covered with the hair of the morning sun is hard to detect, but if you have the heart, you can find the biggest difference between him and human beings. Mullen’s uncle raised his hand to cover his lips. , lest you be more rude and exclaimed, and your face can't help The color of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young lords are even more excited about their faces. Because there are various reasons for Baldwin's wanted documents not to write the name of the elf, so that they think that Baldwin's companion is just a beautiful mortal, now he has already remembered, the elf Ranger Kerry. His name is heard in the poet's long poem. He is the only heir to the silver crown jungle. The singer's prince, his promise is more precious than the golden gems - who does not know that the starlight river is a The river is flowing with silver, and the gray ridge is a treasure trove that never dies. The short-sightedness of Baita’s owner has been compiled by many people to make fun of it. The luck of Luzer’s Grand Duke is relished by countless people. It’s so unfortunate that it’s still far from the Starlight River, Mullen’s I did not expect too many spirits to be favored by the elves. We must know that the Baita, which is known as the hills and pearls for its prosperity and prosperity, was originally a small village of less than 100 people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Dolly itself is a commercial city, Mullen was still worried about this huge momentum, the raging disease will make this small city really "dead." But now, as long as there is a fine gold secret silver. Xuemi lead red, even if the disease and the poisonous goddess Tarona built his own temple here, the merchants will go forward and desperately come here, just to find a number that can make them earn several times. Goods that are tens or even hundreds of times of interest - a few years later, Dorsett can regain its ruins, perhaps even further, and he can almost see the bright future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but very quickly. Mullen broke free from the illusion of confusion. The teenager took a deep breath without a noticeable way. The red tide quickly faded from the pale cheeks: "Thank you very much," he used to tremble slightly. The voice said: "Sorrow and all my people will always remember the blessings and help that you and our companions have given us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. "Kerry said: "It is not others who give you help and favor. It is you yourself - you are a strong good boy and will be a good lord in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In this case, Baldwin has nothing to hesitate. He simply drank the snow honey in the small bottle, and the cold sweet liquid brought vitality to his weak body in a blink of an eye. “Much better,” he said, handing the empty bottle back to the maid: “Thank you,” he said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello," the maid said: "His Royal Highness hopes to talk to you separately before the ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Almost everyone has revealed some incomprehensible color: "But the ceremony is about to begin." Mei Mi shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then your Highness must have something important to say to you." Mullen’s uncle said that she did not look at Fro’s pastor as if she were It simply doesn't exist: "Go ahead, I think anyone who wants to wait for one or two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too." Bird Wen said that in fact, he thinks that Leona’s behavior is noble, but in the same way, it is too arrogant – he thinks that he will be able to redeem his sins one day, and become a follower of Tyre. It's like the paladins who have returned to the symmetry after the balance has been overturned. They can do it. Of course, Bywin can do it. All he needs is time and opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also considered his companion, it is impossible for the Ranger to abandon his dangerous friends, and Fro's pastor Mei Mi, a fragile and incompetent sweet pea, she can't do without her. Relying on oneself to escape from the stern net of the new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Dylan, he doesn’t know if Dylan will really throw a flame or thunder to himself, but he knows he can’t be the only one of Dylan’s benefactors. Zi Yan raised the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head and prayed quietly. Although he could not mention Tyre’s name, the familiar sentence still calmed his complicated thoughts. - He fastened the gold pin on the black wool robes, arranged the neckline, extended his hands, pushed open the heavy oak door, and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona sat at the window and changed her clothes for the ceremony. Now she is wearing a violet velvet robes and slanting outside. A black-skinned white suede, a long curly red hair, with a gold pin and a gold crown inlaid with pearls - her face lacks feminine femininity, but is very suitable for horizontal A flame-shaped sword lying on his knees.
