The death may be faster than when he was a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for her current owner, this may be a good opportunity. Compared with the dragons who have left the Grenada for reasons other than the one since the hatching, the power of the black hair caster is as fragile as a piece of parchment. He has no trustworthy person and no authority. There is no money, and this warlock with the sacred blood, if he said, he is the lord of Norman in the Highlands, and his territory has black iron and derived steel, or copper, these are Gray. What Nada urgently needs, every day, like the river of gifts, the steel flows silently into Grenada, and under the work of thousands of craftsmen, it becomes the armor, swords and arrows of the three legions, but these are still Not enough, not enough, not enough. The female attendant with the devil's blood can still get some information from the Warlock Tower. The Legion is still recruiting soldiers and even transferring some of the slaves as the new blood of the sprint camp. The "fine net" thieves' union under the dragon's thorns is like the desert. The rain infiltrates into every part of the continent; the priests of Greed are forced to remain quiet because of the reckless act of a while (expelling Pastor Rosada of the White Tower), but the Temple of the Virgin It’s still more than a day in a day; the scene of the flying red dragon flying over the king’s sky has also been shortened from a few months to a few days in the past few years. Yesterday she even saw two red dragons one after the other. Flying over the Warlock Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the same family who have left this plane, the Red Dragons are most interested in lying down when they are not threatened or threatened. For the dragon, it is like a silky or sand gold coin to sleep comfortably. As a warlock with a demon blood, her age in Grenada may have surpassed the human ancestor. She remembers the last time she appeared. This situation was still about three hundred years ago. When the reign of Grenada was changed, Grenada did not try to maintain stability and peace as the neighboring countries did, so as to avoid any problems that might shake the foundation of the throne. It was stunned to reveal its fangs to five countries. Almost overnight, the army of Grenada radiated like a sharp arrow. The dragon burned the fields and the city, and the deep blue sky was like a Huge furnace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the well-trained horses will still run out of control, even fainting and falling, under the threat of the Deinonychus and the lions and lions, ordinary Soldiers are even more resistant to the monsters of the Granadas, who are known for their professionalism and survival. Their spears are broken on the enemy's armor, and their leather armor is under the sword and arrow of the steel. Not harder than grease, the few casters in front of the warlocks in Grenada are like a small boat in a hurricane, and the touch is a broken bone, not to mention that some wizards immediately try to see the red robe. Ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black armored soldiers poured into the ruling bureaucrats and Wang Ting like a silent tide, dragging the arrogant dignitaries out of the room and tearing them away. Clothes, a spear from their thorns, and out of their mouths, this fatty and white kebab has been inserted from the new territory to the edge of the desert, until decades later there are people picking up the gravel The bones in the wild grass are used as fuel for the campfire, and their wives and daughters, as well as their young sons, are also driven away in a straight line, with ropes around their necks, pulling the geese and lambs like Grena. Tat, branding the slave, waiting for the merchants to come and choose - they walk in the desert, except for some women who exist as precious goods, especially beautiful and distinguished women, it is almost impossible for others to get enough food. And water, alive to come to Grenada's prisoners and "trophies" a lot, die more, but the desert can always swallow all traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original war may have to be a little earlier, but somehow, the action of Gredi has become slow, as if it is still unknown. Something attracts attention, but in Grenada, her will is the will of everyone, no one will go against the "mother" of every Grinada, even if it is a new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not to say that they will turn a blind eye and not listen to it. If anything can stop Greedy, its preciousness must be unquestionable, perhaps not a few Individuals dare to compete with the red dragon that climbed on the throne of the gods, but if it is only one of them... one star and a half? The little residue left in the red dragon's paws is enough to be a good meal for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if it turns out that this strange dragon is not suitable for Grenada, the dagger that protects him will also pierce his back as he turns around - this is also a for her. opportunity. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard his call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the head of the servant came into the room gracefully, the kind of sweet-blooded kind was lying on the floor, the clothes were messy and pale, but it didn’t look like What is fatal to suffer - a human with a succulent blood can have hundreds of different uses at the warlock, she doesn't want to make a guess, but there are hundreds of uses that are the most common and common, and He does have the beauty that is not human: "Which room should I prepare for him?" She asked slyly: "My master?" Since you have rejected a pair of maids? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guest's room," said the soul of the alien world, "Which." He measured it. "Give him a bottle of honey and a healing potion." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant leader watched the look of the new master cautiously, well, it seems that this is not. His value should be more on the black iron and steel he can give. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Gray Robe knows she is crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly, Marleno Lorenos, the northern slave can’t be said to be her disciple, she has completed the contract with the mentor. All the work, but the distance to get a disciple is still very far. Even if he has the blood of the succubus and has been motivated, Mullen can only be her apprentice rather than a disciple—the mortal can't understand the difference between the apprentice and the disciple, because they only know that both will call the mage or It is a warlock as a mentor, but in the Master Tower and the Warlock Tower, the identity of apprentices and disciples is completely different. Under the most demanding instructors, apprentices may be busy for decades and may not be disciples. Those who can become disciples are not only not only disciples, but also disciples. To suffer from the previous ten years, I have to rely on my talent and meekness to win the guidance of the mentor, to get his direct teaching, and sign a formal contract with him - the apprentice can only accept the teachings of the disciples, and take up those There seems to be endless trivial work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if Mullen is her true disciple, in Grenada, in a pure blood with a dragon, he can’t say in front of a prince. What a major sacrifice, not to mention his discipleship, everyone can say that he knows it well, and that he first turned her back, her wings warmed him, saved him from the sorrowful shame, but How did he do it? He took a bite in her atrium! Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just did not hesitate to leave with his new owner, Ms. Gray Robe knows that until tomorrow morning, the emperor’s attendant will send the gem And gold coins, and perhaps wands and scrolls, to take away her last power to Mullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t even change her robes, she didn’t take off her necklace and ring, she was sitting in an empty room, her skinny fingers clutching a piece of paper, this It was the skin that was peeled off from Mullen's back, and the loyal contract was written with his blood—she almost shredded it so that the shameless liar was immediately punished, but her fingers suddenly became weak. It’s not like her fingers. She used to kill her father and another disciple of the mentor. How powerful they were at the time—but now they just take the picture as if The temperature of the flexible paper smashed into a ball, and the gray robes seemed to hear a painful shout. She jumped out of the chair and looked around in horror. Isn’t that tiny damage will make the other side of the contract feel Pain? She didn't know, she sat down, wept and spread the piece of paper, put it on the chest and flatten it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A slight chill wiped her cheek, and the tears immediately frozen. Ms. Gray robe immediately put the paper into her chest and hid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost she sent to Mullen came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is he doing now?!" she asked sharply: "Is he injured? Or is he imprisoned?" She was anxious to know all about Mullen’s related thing: “His...new master...has touched him?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost floats in midair and its response is somewhat sluggish. This is also a helpless thing. Ms. Gray Robe is still unable to take the soul of a caster as a ghost of being enslaved by herself. This is just a mortal. He does not even know that he has been dead for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
