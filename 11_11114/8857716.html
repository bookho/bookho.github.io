			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or you can wait for me to come back, my friend." Birdwin took over the helmet from the hand, hiding his face in silver white When the steel was under, his voice screamed: "I don't know how many beasts will be there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm afraid we have no hesitation Time is up," said Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like to prove for his words, the trebuchet temporarily paused for a while and then cast the white phosphorus pottery again, this time they are thrown far away High, several fell into the outer fort (that is, between the two walls), burned the suspension bridge connecting the two, and others fell into the square inside the fort, burning the horse's drinking trough. Fortunately, while building the homes and warehouses for the soldiers, the families of the knights, and the merchants, the second lord moved them to the edge of the mouth with great foresight. Location, separated from Gashburg by a large piece of deserted sand and a low stone wall. In the existing position, the white phosphorus pots thrown by the trebuchet can not reach them, otherwise it is conceivable. This outer flame temperature can almost melt the mineral powder of the stone, which will cause a serious disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin didn’t say anything more, he turned over the horse, then his knights, and they gave them spears, which are better than others. The spears used by the knights are shorter, and the spears are made of stainless steel. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers have removed the crossbar of the steel gate, turning the winch in groups of two, the knights are ready, their horses are on hard rock Rub the hoof on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gershburg’s steel gates were opened to allow two knights to drive side by side, the owner of Geshburg, Tyre’s Knight, Bird Wenting He raised his chest and shouted the name of Tell, praying for his justice and blessing. His voice was loud and clear, just like Gersh echoed in the winter night sky, and his armor, his horse and his weapon They are shrouded in bright light like a star—his knights are loud and calm, their blood is boiling, their eyes are clear, their ears are sensitive, their limbs are full of strength, yet they are so light and flexible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rushed out in the low-pitched thunder, and the white phosphorus was smouldering outside the walls, but it could not cause any harm to them - Bywin and His knight is like a white spear, piercing the array of orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs who are still coughing and crying because of the smell of white phosphorus have neither the opportunity nor the time to give the correct response. They are pierced by the spear and are cut by the wide sword. Their heads are rolling around and the body is black. The horseshoe of the iron horseshoe is turned into a meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while the orcs in front of the wall were in chaos, the elves’ teams had quietly climbed the cliffs on the canyon side from the top of the castle. Elf mages either cast spells, or tore the reels, use flying, while the other elves walk on a nearly vertical rock wall like a argali, and they have taken off the cyan that will look very noticeable in the night. The robe and silver-green two-color garments were replaced with dark gray spider silk tight-fitting robes, which seemed to blend into the rocky mountain wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry originally did not want to include Krimerar as a member. After all, this mission is full of dangers and variables - but the young caster of black hair Silently showing him his scroll and his ring, he is one of the few in the Grey Ridge and the Silver Crown, who is good at using the flames of the caster - and he is finally involved in this war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is stopping in the shadow of a giant beak, and making gestures to his companions. In order to remain secret, they climb the route ahead of Thunder Castle. The wall is almost twice as high, and now the two giant trebuchets that the orcs are arching are at their feet, looking down from nearly four hundred feet, they are like children's toys at their fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the elves are not inferior to those of the sharp-eyed eagle, even at night. The trebuchet is surrounded by countless strong orcs and priests of the orcs. Compared with the so-called orc warriors, they are thin and dry, and they are even more beautifully dressed. The bones are hung around the waist, and the horns and jaws are decorated with hair belonging to humans and elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking for, Kerry Ben?" an elf asked curiously, the wind violently at the heights was like a buffalo with its eyes closed. Even if it is an elf, it will feel a little hard to hang on it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find a human wizard." Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you suspect that humans are involved in this war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sophisticated instrument It's not made and assembled by the orcs alone," Kerry said. "Unless an orc suddenly becomes a believer in the god of knowledge, Ogma."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Sometimes I really don't understand how humans think," another elf commented. "The orcs - do they think that this evil and chaotic creature can better rule and manage them? Even three-year-old humans I also know that human beings are the food of the orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people always think that they are the exception." Kerry Ben said: "And for them, belongs to everyone The sky and the earth are no more important than the stones they hold in their hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We have the strongest warriors," said the leader of the Black Blood tribe. "There are priests who receive the greatest favor of the great Kauss. We don't need humans to help us guard what."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words are very rude and stupid - he seems to have forgotten the two giant trebuchets, and who is carrying the siege hammer with the iron bull head Come, the apprentice’s fingers trembled, their weapons are entering this full of tribal leaders. The account was seized, but a caster relied on never the secret silver fine, they have full confidence to kill the orc before the priest intervention or just smash him, cut his leg, two arms - - The latter method is more comfortable than the former method. For the orcs, a disabled orc is not only their leader, but even a warrior. He will be stripped of the precious armor robes and rushed into the half-orcs and slaves. In the circle, use your own ** to fight against the sword of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but their mentor only turned their attention to the center of the big account, the owner of the orc’s largest tribe, Blizzard, who was called the orc leader of the Gosh by the orcs, he The other orcs are taller and stronger, and the muscles are arched under the green skin, like a pile of mossy stones, and the black hair that is covered with the night is like a human palm. The long fangs are raised outside the lips, and the slender, bright eyes show a dark red color that is so ominous to the orcs even in the faint light—but it flashes the Master to see it in the eyes of some older humans. The wisdom of the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is indeed the most special one among the orcs. He buys humans who know how to count and write from merchants, learns human language from them and others feel useful. Knowledge - although these "teachers" are not slaves and foods after being squeezed out of their minds, but throughout the learning process, according to the red robe mage, their treatment is almost the same as the orcs The warriors are just as good. For this, the Warriors of the Blizzard tribe have also launched one or two small riots against their leaders, but in the end they have all become the most straightforward and conclusive proof that Gersh can come up with. - Proving that an orc learns human things does not make him as weak and useless as humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, at that time, Gersh was not Gersh. He was still an orc red eye, but since he killed every orc in the tribe who dared to pick him up his teeth - no orc would dare to call his beard again. When he decided to call himself Gersh - in the language of the orc, it meant to be unique - of course, there would be no objection, even the old priest who named him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a guest," said Gersh, and the tent was quiet at once - even though he was screaming at other orcs to try to show his bravery. It’s always silent, but as long as he makes a sound, yes, that’s it. All the orcs will close their mouths and listen quietly and intently to every word he says: “You are a guest,” said Gersh. "It is said that human beings must abide by three criteria when entertaining his guests. One of them is that the owner must guarantee the safety of the guests. Master, in any case, the battlefield will not be a safe place, so," he said. It was very complete, and it was said that it was done according to his body type. He took a hoop gloved hand and patted it on the knee with the head of the ram sheep head: "Come to my tent," He invited: "Let's drink, eat meat, beat the drums. I still have three human female slaves and a bard. We can sit high on the peak, ignite the bonfire, and watch how our warriors look. Capture the Thunderbolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words sounded much sweeter than the black-blooded tribal leaders, but the final meaning is the same - there are guards about the two giant trebuchets, orcs Unwilling to let the human wizards insert them - part of them from their arrogance, and the other part because the orc priests do not want the master to take their prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the trebuchet and the city wall are thousands of orcs who are excited like ant colonies, wanting to penetrate them is like trying to hit Wearing the entire Longji Mountains, you can access these two devices that pose a great threat to Gesberg and only the elves that may destroy them, and the elves, whatever they are, sacrifices or casting materials, are the red robe mage. The most favored one with the orc priest, as long as time and place allow, every part of the elf will be thoroughly used, without wasting, including their soul and emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master stood up, and between the orcs, a human being was extraordinarily weak and small, but he did not seem to notice that he was in a dangerous position. There was no resentment and rigidity on the face that was forcibly evicted outside the hunting circle. He bowed to Gersh in a calm manner, thanking and obeying the intention of Gersh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you more gems," after leaving the big account of the orc leader, Gersh said: "Blood marrow, agate, obsidian, Pyroxene and opal - I can also give you a bag of gold, as heavy as your apprentice. If we can take advantage of Geshburg, you can also pick a hundred people from it, whatever you choose, woman, man, old man , children, except for the Deer of Fort Devon, anyone can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If?" The Master said: "Is it not sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesh smiled, an orc laughed only to make people fear, their faces Just like all kinds of beasts are tied together, the smile will make the muscles of their cheeks pull back, revealing two rows of white teeth like daggers. "Great Kawu luxury is eager for blood and death, the best of the elves, Humans are also good, and the orcs can do it too - this winter our gods will enjoy an unprecedented feast, which is enough, he will be satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, for me," Master Red Robe said: "You are not a good customer," he did not seem to notice the step in which Gersh suddenly stopped: "You don't seem to like my potion very much." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kau luxury does not like the creation of the elves," said Gash, "even if it has been smeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master turned to stare at their feet - Gersh’s tent was stationed according to his preferences On the steep side of the ridge, the wind blew the smell of white phosphorus, and Gersh sneezed. "How many Philippine tribe soldiers and warriors are there?" The Master asked: "One-third, one-fifth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten Centurions and their soldiers." Gersh said that he was the first leader to use the title, the hundred and the captain as the name of the warrior, and Knowing how to count, in a sense, he is more ambitious and has a matching mind than the orc leader who only relies on priests and fingers. Although not smart enough, he can already let the wizard be willing to waste on him. Some precious time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not too much, it can even be said that it is a bit less than the Blizzard tribe in previous years. It is a pity that you are not willing to use my potion, so you can't Take out more soldiers - too bad, they are still afraid of you, convinced of the brutality and power you have left in their memory, but if you win, those orcs will get more wealth and slaves than you Then the power between you will change - forgive me, the respected Kawu luxury encourages his people to get rid of the weak tribes, divide them and eat them."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gash twitched his nose, white phosphorus garlic makes him still involuntarily want to sneeze again, "I have learned a lot with those anthropologies, many, can not say that every one of the tribes It's useful to the orcs, but there are still some interesting things in it - for example, the wizards in red robes are some bad guys who hide the poison in honey and wrap them in soft blankets. With the needle, you thought you could get from them Take a copper coin, but they will take your last toe and testicles from you... They never take life and soul as one thing, yes, Master, I don't believe you— - and your potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
