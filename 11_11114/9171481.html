			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s sleeping,” the dark-haired dragon whispered, “Is it still asleep?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the Grinada people look at the Master who is only 30 feet away from them. This distance can be shortened to the point where the sword is attacked with a slight leap, but the knights just raise their arms and create them in magic. The arrow that was added in the shelter was like a torrential rain, and just before that, the mage twisted the ring, and he and his wife disappeared together. The deadly arrow ran through the long table and chair. Under the gorgeous velvet and linen, it is the decaying wood. The arrow is too dense and strong. After shaking it a few times, it suddenly slammed into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights jumped out of the long table, and the servants not only did not run away, but madly met the Grenada’s short spear long arrows. There are no weapons, but there are fangs and claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a zombie!" said a warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action is still fast, but the zombies who have always lacked wisdom and judgment cannot form a close match with the knights, and the Grenadado is the gray robe. Dragon Knights are familiar with this monster, knowing where their weaknesses are, even without the support of the warlocks, they can handle these things in a very short time - just the despicable master does not seem to give They had too much time, they first heard a slight twist of the gears, and then the floor under the feet began to shake - those stone blocks that were about six feet long and two feet wide began to shrink toward the wall. From the center of the hall, there was an irregular cave with a large serrated edge, and the cave was still growing. At this time, the bright hall suddenly sank in the boundless darkness in an instant - Grenada’s The warlocks are trying to throw a spell, but they find that the light in the center of the darkness is constantly getting bigger. The soul of the outside world looks down the cave, where the waves are rippling, but Surface water only impossible, at least it's the landlord would not do that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the gear is giggling, "Danos." After listening for a while, the dark-haired dragon ordered that Danos followed his gaze. Looking at the past, you can see the tiny tiny metallic flash – below the surface of the water, in the center of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost hesitated, but he immediately threw his dagger, and the steel dagger slammed into the wall, and the thief threw a hand. The tough steel wire was tangled in the handshake of the dagger. He gripped the ball at the end of the wire, tapped on the toe, and flew over the edge of the ever-shrinking stone brick to the other end, and his dominant hand. Holding a spear, he can be said to be an unprecedented whole body concern - the flash of metal has disappeared, like a mischievous child, only revealing his face and hiding himself, but since Danos Once a dragon thorn, it means that he can't remember the point in the dark, the thief hit it there accurately - a strange feeling, not like piercing metal or stone, it seems to be pierced A creature with a solid, thick skin, he contemplates the contraction of the abdomen, lifts his legs, and then only hears a bang, and the sharp teeth are closed under his hips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water splashes sharply, sporadic refractions and stinking winds make thieves aware of the arrival of sneak attackers - there are seven or more tentacles in his Bending above, like a cage, and he is a bird that is about to be covered by this cage, and he only has legs and one hand, the thief bends his fingers, and the wire is screaming at him with a soothing squeak. Ascending, his body suddenly thins between breaths, thin as if only the skin and bones are left, passing through the only possible gaps - the tentacles immediately regained their backs, the generation of the dragon thorns The leader leaned in the air, and when the tentacles rolled over and wanted to catch him, the thieves leaped high with the help of a heavy step given to the enemy. The short sword was heavily crossed in the three parallel tentacles that attempted to block the road ahead, but At this time, the fourth tentacles had been taken from his ear. This was a fatal blow. If it wasn't for Danoy's reaction, it would be agile enough. Even so, his brain was still roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw his leader, the black-haired dragon, and now Danos is sincerely hoping that he really is what those people are saying. Extremely powerful, and with the kindness of the Greinada people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos wakes up again ( Thanks to the bottomless abyss that was cursed a million times! He can still wake up. It may not be very long to find that he is in a coma, because they are still in the hall, but they are divided into three parts by the cave because His destruction, the organ of the hall stopped, but at that time, the slate had almost retracted into the wall, leaving only a dozen pieces of stray-toothed teeth outside the wall. They stood on the slate and placed themselves in three. On the slate, a black hamster, the little devil of His Royal Highness Kremar stood on his chest. He wanted to stand up, only to find himself tied to a slate by a silver string. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you awake?" The soul of the alien world glanced at him: "Can you stand up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos nodded, only to find that he still had some Want to vomit, according to the man in the warlock Tari, this is because the brain is hit by the impact, he just wanted to search for his own pocket, the small devil flapping the wings brought a small bottle of potion, really Small, maybe not a long finger, Danos opened it and drank it. The potion was very good and violent, and it also had the sweetness of snow honey. His tiredness and sorrow disappeared without a trace— - It seems that the rumors that His Royal Highness Kreima has a close relationship with the elves should be true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world only slightly explored, and found the hidden threshold, but in a mage’s tower, the threshold and the passage may not be able to It is very likely that you will bring you where you want to go, directly or indirectly, to bring you to Crawford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want?" Danos said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a warlock standing opposite them suddenly stopped moving, but he immediately made a very threatening gesture, "I think you might A companion is required to be on the outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the guard?" Danos showed a sneer smile, "Da Gong's army?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock doesn’t talk, he pouts, but he can see that he’s already in a state of ecstasy, and he can cast spells at any time. “Maybe you don’t know,” he said. It’s a lich!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos raised an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe two," said the Warlock: "I know that the Lich often turns his loved one into a Lich so that she can be with her." "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So?" Danos said: "You should know that you only have one death when you go back alive, and that is a despicable and painful death. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't go back." The warlock said boldly that he had retrieved the contract placed in the mentor ten years ago, and Grenada had no engine. Elbow his things. In his eyes, these people can't escape the lich's killing and capturing, and the soul of the lich food can't even go to mourn the wasteland, or return to the sire of Grety, no one will accuse him, and The Red Dragon will also hope that they will never appear again. When the Red Dragon finally notices that there is a fish in the net, he has already hidden himself - he can find a small town, although offering and enjoying Not the king of Grenada, but it is better than being caught in a soul gem, becoming a dessert or a currency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was such an idiot among us." Danos muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he wants to leave," this time is talking about Crimall: "Let him leave." His fingers slammed on the wall. A curved staircase leading to an unpredictable land appears in front of them: "What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Following you is our only choice." Standing next to this warlock was another warlock and a knight. They used their actions to prove their will. Although the gap between the slate was wide and narrow, they quickly returned to Krimar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock hesitated for a moment, or turned around, a spell opened the closed main gate, he did not put down the iron ladder, but jumped directly Go on, don't go back and run away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint light in the main fort was quickly disappeared, but the sound of the sound in his ear has not stopped, the warlock soon regrets, maybe It’s not a bad idea to follow His Highness, who knows that this mission is likely to be a trap for the Highness, and that they are almost unable to get rid of the fate of death when they are selected. His Royal Highness died in the conspiracy of the same tribe, and the people who followed him could not escape the punishment. He is no longer just a warlock with a mixed blood. He is the leader of the Dragon's tooth, the darling of the Gree, and the prince of the new king. Son, they can't do nothing like this one time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it’s too late to go back, the Highness and his companions are no longer likely to believe in themselves, of course, maybe not, but at least they didn’t I will regard myself as a traitor. How does the Grenada treat traitors? He will not know more clearly than others. Most of the experimental materials and casting materials in the Warlock Tower are taken from slaves, but from the losers. There are also many with the rebels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
