			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any harm or even kill Master Crimmar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you deceive, mislead, or force him into a trap?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you sit and watch when he falls into danger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know his whereabouts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan Original I don't know if I want to say it, but he immediately thought that such an answer might be mistaken for being a lie: "He fell into the swamp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf in charge of asking questions The Ranger paused briefly and hard, looking at Birdwin: "Do you have anything to ask?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mi, or the power of every Fro priest is very weak, like the detection of lies and the like, they can not sustain for too long, Kay When Raben raised the third question, he was keenly aware that the invisible magic shackles were faltering. When he asked Bedwin, Ge Lan gave a small squeak and a white light flashed. The passing, indicating that his words and heart are no longer monitored and controlled by external forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The benevolent Ilmot will bless the people who do good," said the priest of Ilmot. "Those things may not turn." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hope so," said Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin moved his body, and he still felt that every joint was violently protesting against his misconduct - his arm was also smashed It’s a pain, as if it’s still connected to the body, but the former owner of Thunder Castle knows no, he is watching Fukai kick the arm into the fireplace, and his nose can smell the bad smell. A stinking smell - if he can still keep his grace, he can pray to his god, his arm can grow back, and the physical injury will heal, but he can't, he has lost the care of Tyre. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do we do next?" Gülen asked, trying not to make himself look so desperate, but with little effect, both Kerry and Birdwin were injured. And he is already exhausted, and the priests of Maymi and Ilmot are simply negligible, and they are going to face a caster who has the power and wisdom to set up a sacrifice, and he is not wearing a red robe or wearing a gray robe. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin pinched his fist. "Try your best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry..." The priest of Ilmot said: "But if you can, please wait for me one day." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief really wants to kick this old guy into the swamp, but the two guys won’t allow it, so he can only grab a boring one. The silver coins were turned around between the fingers, and went to the corner of the wall to open the carpet that the villagers sent. The carpet was thick and hard, but it was thick and dry. Gülen fell in his cloak and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the haze cast by the bat, Fro's priest, ranger and thief did not go anywhere else to find a bed, they were directly in the room occupied by Bedwin Resting in the room - Mei Mi is very willing to share a bed with Birdwin, but Birdwin euphemistically refused, the result is that Mei Mei occupied the right side of the room, Gülen and Kerry Ben are close to the left of the room Sleep on the side wall. There is a window on the wall, although it is double-glazed, but like this backcountry, the glass that the merchants used to trade is not very inferior, not only the color is not transparent, there are small blisters in the glass, the surface is ups and downs. Rugged, this represents a place where the glass has uneven thickness - a well-informed ranger and a thief who is good at blazing the thief and the target can see it at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mutation is not a bat but a bird, perhaps they have long been smashed by the cockle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now plum is sleeping in the innermost, and Bedwin is in the middle. Kerry was between the thief and Birdwin, the thief was facing the wall, and a thin cockroach climbed over his eyes. He nailed his long feet with his nails. He struggled fiercely and broke his foot to find a way to live. Gülen waited, and when it was about to get into the crack of the stone, he moved his finger and broke it into two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this. Kerry has taken two bottles of healing potion, the only two bottles, even if he doesn't say anything, Gülen can distinguish one or two from his dignified look - he shared one of the bottles with the three Although Gülen looked at the place where there was no need to treat the potion - the effect of the potion was surprisingly good. In order to escape the deadly iron box, Ge Lan died once, and his injuries were all concealed in a seemingly intact appearance. Underneath, Mei Mei did not know why, and Birdwin and Kerry Ben – and the former Kremar, Gülen did not dare to let them know that they are not as useful as they seem, but fortunately in the process of fleeing There are not many situations in which he needs to be shot, but he also knows that he is only supporting himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The syrup flows from his throat to the abdomen, and the thief recalls the feeling of his first time drinking expensive rotted sweet wine. The warm and soft flame spreads out from the inside of the cold body. For a moment, the curse of Cranbo, the god of death, has gone away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are we leaving?" In the dark, Birdwin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow." Kerry Ben answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they woke up at dawn on the following day, the priest of Ilmot had prepared a generous breakfast for them, dried wild boar, sweet potato Soup, butter, mushrooms, and eggs with black pepper, this is probably the best thing that people in this village can come up with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A good meal." Ge Lan commented pessimistically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey gave him a sneak peek, and Baldwin had persuaded Fro’s pastor to stay here, and Fro’s pastor answered him like this: “Although I am not following a powerful god, but I am also a pastor, and I have not traveled less than your Ranger, Sir Alex," she said. "I know what the festival is, if you fail, I will die as well, and it will be the kind of painful and tragic death - I don't want to wait, I have tasted that taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides breakfast The priest of Ilmot also took out a few bottles of healing potion. Gülen opened one of the bottles and gently swayed. The potion shone with a little bit of light in the bright morning light, like a clear spring filled with gemstones. This is the performance of a good therapeutic syrup, which is almost comparable to the syrup that Kerry has taken before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that Ilmot’s eyes will always look at you, may his hands support you forever, and his guidance will always be for you. Their souls listen - he will get rid of the damage for you, expel the disease, he will love you, just like the father of man loves his children." The priest of Ilmot said that his voice is hoarse and dry, sounds Very harsh, if not so slight - slightly almost people think he is just talking to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You pray to Ilmot..." Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am praying to my god all the time," the priest of Irmot interrupted his words: "I believe. He will You sent it here," he looked at one by one, seeing Gülen from Mei Mi, and seeing Kerry Ben from Bedwin: "You, and your friends, will be safe and safe." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your blessing," Birdwin said, moving his right hand. Originally he wanted to perform a paladin's ceremony, but the lack of the right arm reminded him of his current identity, so he changed the ceremony to a simple one: "Ilmot's holy name will be more because of your piety. Many people worship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mi took a priestly ritual with both hands on the shoulders, but did not say anything, the re-feet of Pastor Fro is not suitable for an Iraqi Followers of Almaty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said the priest of Ilmot. "This is not a blessing. This is a prophecy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There are almost all the people in the village, children, old people, men, women, they are silent, only grateful and respectful when they pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief immediately throws the silver coin in his hand to a child. He considered that the curse of the god of death and the spell of the red robe were even more terrible. He would continue to be "live" or really die: "Do you find out," he said: "The pastor seems to be old. Some."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world yawned and stretched out I woke up slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sleeping in the depths of the sea - it is necessary to explain that if we want to describe the Lich’s knowledge of the sea, we can first imagine it as A huge glass hollow ball - the top layer is as bright as white, the middle is like dusk or dawn, the lower layer is quiet darkness - there is a layer of darkness. There is still a glimmer of light near the middle, like the sight seen from the deep sea looking up at the sky. The more the light goes down, the darker it is to the bottom. It is a solid color that is stagnant, but both the lich and the soul of the alien world can go up and down at will (when the lich is not punished), when they are close to the upper level, they can observe the situation outside by the senses of the cohabitants, that is, no How true. For the soul of the opposite world, it is like a transparent membrane. You can watch, listen, touch, and even smell, but what you want to do is absolutely powerless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lich wants to meditate and the soul of the outside world wants to sleep, they will sink, and the deeper they can feel, the less they will feel. At the bottom, everything will be isolated from you. The soul of the outside world is still not used at the beginning. Later, I feel that this is really good. In its messy memory, it seems that I have never seen it so well. The place to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a long time for the soul of the alien to find that he had maintained a very good habit of living and resting - after the lich took over the body, it would sleep for ten to twelve hours (calculated by its method). Unless the lich sneaked into the ground to violently wake it up (there are a few times), ask him some things and then leave with anger, otherwise he will not wake up during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you wake up, it will float up. Although the Lich hates it, it is a foreign country, every thing makes it feel new. It is full of interest and deserves careful study. Even the defensive stakes in Jianjian Port will make it feel beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s hard to get it, when it’s taking care of itself (squeezing itself), it’s not in the process of slowing up and floating. (Don't ask how it knows), it actually feels a bit regretful - and then feels a bit Stockholm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels a bit wrong - it doesn't know how it looks, because it feels like the whole body has eyes, and the signal from the eyes is complicated. And chaos, and it feels like a whole body fruit, even if it is wrapped in a film, it is also a plastic wrap, when some obviously have a lot of feet or simply have no feet to climb (drill!) over it When you are in the body, it has to grow hair to erect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its body is still changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world wants to scream, and it does the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What are you doing? The lich asked violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tell me this is an illusion, the soul of the outside world shouts, I think our body seems to be a piece... Hey, jelly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The lich wants to search to know that the jelly is a god horse--ah, he said badly, not very right, my dear cohabitation, It's not jelly. If you really want to use food to describe it, there is something in your memory called a chocolate lava cake that should look like it, oh, yes, that's the part inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——This curse will only appear in girl comics! The soul of the outside world is shouting loudly, and the painting style is completely different, so don't put it in a book! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
