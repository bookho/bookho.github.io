			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft prevention section, updated around 12 am tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich’s judgment cannot be said to be wrong. The scales of the Black Dragon are not as hard as the dragons that grew up under normal conditions, even the dust of the edelweiss The explosion still made it bloody, especially the eyelids that had been shot by the elf. It was like a flower of flesh and blood. The tears under the eyelids broke into the eyes and the black dragon squinted in pain. The blood mixed with tears, and other contents flow out of the eyelids covered with scales. The muddy swamp was once again hit by a small rainstorm, but it was hot and bright red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these injuries are not fatal enough, the pain makes this black dragon almost lose the only wisdom, it bends the neck of the bruises, agitates the throat, everyone knows A sour liquid that is enough to cover half of them has been brewed. The reason why the black dragon did not spit it out is because it has narrowed its field of vision after missing one eye. It is necessary to turn the neck to see the other side. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you come again?" Gülen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world shook his head, the lich had reminded him that the black dragon is not an ordinary monster, his memory is not so bad, the older dragon It is even possible to guess from the magical fluctuations what kind of spell the wizard is going to cast, and the next time it will not wait for the enemy to be attacked in the same place - almost the caster with Ge Lan flying, the black dragon suddenly opened the wings It flew up, but in an instant, it rose to a height of a few hundred feet, so that even if it had only one eye, it would be painful to turn the neck every time, but it could clearly find its prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Really, the soul from another plane said, I think I can never understand how these dragons fly, not at all Reasonable - it is like a helicopter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Prepare your spell, the lich says coldly, he thinks he can never understand why his cohabiters can’t always concentrate at important moments - Of course, the exception is when eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even without the Lich’s reminder, the soul of the alien world has already noticed that the druid running in the swamp is preparing his spells, Kerry Ben and He opened the distance and began to shoot at the dragon, quite obviously want to divert its attention, but even the elf, want to use ordinary arrows (the magic arrows have been consumed) shot hundreds of feet high Black dragons are not an easy task, not to mention the black dragons wrapped around the rushing airflow, they are like the whirlpool in the water, the arrows are bounced off - the black-haired caster immediately casts a prepared spell - - He opened his mouth and spit out an acid. The acid was caught in the airflow and splashed on the black dragon. Its scales resisted the acid, but the flesh and bones were stripped of the scales because of the previous explosion. No, when the acid falls on it, it emits a sizzling sound. The black dragon rushes to the caster with little hesitation, and its face looks like a semi-melted cockroach. Looks like awkward and disgusting<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world will gently throw Glan, and the thieves will fall quickly. Fortunately, their position from the ground is not as high as that of the dragon. Gülen tries his best to turn his body and let himself fall into a bright water. The ground slammed into the water and quickly sank - he was desperately sinking, because he heard the sound of sizzling water on the water, and the sound of mist and transpiration, indicating that there were countless acid droplets. swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time, the druid's spells have also hit the black dragon, this spell has pulled the black dragon from the height of hundreds of feet. It is ten times faster than it rises. The black dragon slanted his body, one wing in front and one in the back. It is unfortunate that the piece may be a very rare piece of snow covered marsh. The grassy hills, although softer than other places, are definitely not as amiable as the mud and the water, and the black-winged wing that first touches the ground gives a crisp and loud sound and unsightly folding. Up, the otter (Pygmy McGee), who has been watching carefully all of this in the distance, can’t help but shrink. The bones there may have increased hundreds of pieces because of this. He thought, dive deeper. a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Druid never takes a dragon seriously, he almost simultaneously cast another spell, turning himself into a super-large shield Hippo - This kind of hippo is a monster because it is huge and covered with a hard coat like a steel shield. But in fact it is a natural creature, which can be The Druid's transformation object can be seen - the Shield's incarnation of the Shield Hippo has a third of the size of the Black Dragon's body, and its teeth are not sharp because they are only used to eat grass, and Ma Niu It’s flat, but that’s not to say that they’re not threatening enough. People living by the river often ask the adventurers to help them drive the shield hippo, because this hippopotamus can bite a single one. Trees - Now, this Shield Hippo hides the body between the mud and the grass reeds. Perant wants to attack the back of the Black Dragon, where not only the key, but also the explosion caused by the black hair caster. A large piece of flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he wanted to open the huge mouth, a rapid invisible force shocked him in place, unable to move, and the black dragon maintained its original posture. I twisted my neck with lightning and made myself face to face with the Druid. The black dragon's golden eyes clearly reflected the figure of the shield armor. It did not hesitate to open the upper and lower jaw bones and bite it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hippo’s dull call rang through the swamp, and the caster cast another spell, but the black dragon turned his body and greeted the lightning with the hardest, thick back. The current is flying on its body, but the dragon is like losing its sense of pain and danger. It supports the unharmed wings, flapping, and powerful legs kicking the grassy hills violently, letting themselves In the unfavorable situation, he broke free, and in the whole process, his mouth was biting tightly. The hippo's body bleeds from the neck of the black dragon to the chest. It seems to enjoy this feeling, the blood of the enemy. It is the best healing agent for the dragon. The black dragon raises his head, tightens his teeth, and lets more blood slide into his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods bless!" Gülen said, he gasped. When he wanted to swim, a black shadow screamed from the air at a speed that was too fast, and the thieves fetched dozens of times. It’s so far away – he rolls over a wick of grass, and every time he rolls, he will leave blood. The black shadow is nothing else. It’s the tip of the black dragon. The black dragon’s tail is not smooth, not only full of scales. A also ran a small dagger-like barb. They not only tore the thief's leather and shirt, but also tore his skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Dragon looks at the caster, the soul of the alien world can see a hint of ridicule from its eyes, it looks for spells, but those powerful spells It may directly affect the Druid who was bitten in the mouth by the black dragon. The black dragon lowered his head and changed to use a paw to catch the shield hippo, but its teeth did not loosen. This can be seen even if it is McGee. It's going to be - it wants to tear the druid directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired spellcaster sings a spell loudly, even if it hits Perant, it must do it - it's that kind of preoccupation, a pair of opposites The soul is unprecedentedly strong on the tip of the tongue and on the fingertips, but just before it is cast, one hand is placed on the shoulder of the caster, which scares the soul of the other plane. Almost jumped out of the body it shared with the Lich - his flight has not expired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, all, including time and space, are like solidified, silent everywhere, the only remaining eye of the Black Dragon is like a side The pure gold mirror reflects what it sees - a woman with a silver flame in her eyes, she floats in the air, the white velvet is open at her feet, she is so beautiful, so dangerous, but The black dragon that was forced to mature is like a complete neglect of the latter point. There is a strange impulse in its body, its roots are itchy, the kiss is dry, but it is not craving for flesh and blood, no, that It is another equally ancient desire. It wants to fly, wants to move, and expands its wings to show the most powerful and elegant side of this woman. It puts down the neck and gently puts the hippo biting in the mouth on the meadow. Then, a softly screaming, "This is food..." It is saying that it was forcibly deprived of its inheritance. It does not even know how to show love to a beautiful female. Its actions are all from instinct. Admired The dragon gives food, if he has, maybe there is gold coin - it has no gold coins, Black Dragon shouts shyly, and then pulls it out the biggest, and the most beautiful scales are sent to her, it only has this, but later ...after...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who suddenly appeared did not speak, she smiled and “walked” to the black dragon without fear, kissing its kiss. A silver flame slid into the mouth of the black dragon, flowing into its throat, burning in its body in a bursting manner, accompanied by a slamming sound, everyone watching the black dragon burning, the flame of the bunch From its eyes, nostrils and ear holes, it wraps around its body like a beautiful silver ribbon. Between a few breaths, the black dragon that makes them wolf is turned into a blackened skeleton. The beautifully colored flames reluctantly wrap around the skeleton for a while before returning to their masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the flame stretched out his index finger and gently clicked on the black bones of the black dragon. The skeleton suddenly collapsed into ash. After a while, the breeze on the swamp was blown into the mud and white velvet pile, and no trace left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meme?" Gülen shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman looked at the thief, did not speak, just shook his finger to the black hair caster, the soul of the outside world only felt a heavy body, flying He lost his utility in advance, and he fell. Fortunately, this body is not just a mage. He promptly let himself fly back, but under the warning of the Lich, he did not continue to fly to the "Mei Mi". The flat position, but landed where Gülen was, and lifted him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is almost no place in Gülen that is intact, but a terrible foreboding has taken his heart. He didn’t even think he should take the therapeutic potion and drink it. But directly to the sudden emergence of plum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She should accept the flattery of merchants and mercenaries on the warm and cozy Longhuo Island, enjoying soft silk beds and delicious food. She should not drink here, she should not be here, this place where death and pain will occur anytime and anywhere, she looked at her eyes so strange? The silvery flame that flashes in the eyes of the familiar gemstones is as daunting as the harshest winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not plum, who is she? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Gülen was going to move forward, Kerry was using his "silver crown" to stop the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Perant asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman, at least the woman who looks like plum, just shows a sweet and deep smile, she raises her hand, but before she can do something She suddenly fell down - the thief slammed up, and the speed even made Kerry's silver crown leave a deep scar on his chest. He rushed over and caught her, plum Closed his eyes and fell in his arms, no different from the previous ones. Gülen turned his head and looked at the black hair caster. The expression on his face was very strange, and it seemed like crying and like Strong smile, "She," he stuttered, and said with hope: "She... is plum, right? What is this? Is it a ghost possession, or is it controlled by someone... you can Help her solve this spell, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
