			<div id="content">"If he becomes a skeleton in the room where he is imprisoned," the prince's confidant knight reminded: "He will climb out of the window."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then we will find a room without windows to shut him down." Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think he is more suitable for a grave. It has no windows and no doors." The gorgeous knight said so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is indifferent to a human being, whether or not he is alive, although he does think a bit To the thief - he wants to study the curse of the thief, he has not seen a similar curse for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new god of death, Cranmo, is a god of ignorance, he has never greeted the vanity of the main material world, his temple is tall but The emptiness is simple, his servicemen live like an ascetic, he does not ask for sacrifices and gold, if you want to pray to the god who symbolizes the end of life, just bring some Spices, oils and peony (Risha is the holy flower of Cranmo). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that Cranmore’s pastors are as weak and incompetent as Fro’s priests, who have a silent but indispensable part of human society. The position - the pastors are responsible for presiding over the funeral, dealing with various death-related matters, and supervising the execution process and results of the wills at the request of people (mostly aristocrats or consuls) - the Lich thought he was accepted at the White Tower. Beavis’s “heritage” can see a pastor of the god of death, but not, perhaps because Beavis has not established a real will and no one has a controversial relationship, or because Standing in the sanctuary of Rosada in the White Tower - although Rosada, the god of morning light, vitality and revival, is not hostile to the death god Cranmo (the latter is indeed a fair neutral god), but because The priesthood of the two does have a conflicting relationship in some respects, and it is almost impossible for their pastors to calmly stay in the same small town as the white tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their number is really small, the goddess of death has experienced one or more deaths - their own, or close friends The gates leading to the mourning of the wilderness were opened only a stone's throw from them. Their noses were filled with ashes of dust that was blown by the cold, declining wind. They had seen gray, no stars. There is also no sky of the sun and the moon, breathing through the dry air there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the lich's mentor is still roaming around on this continent, the old god of the god of death is still sitting on the throne of the god of death. The priest of the god of death is not as small as it is now, in any case, the god of death. The service of the servants is profitable, the gods are on, it is really a group of greedy, ignorant and fearless puppies! They are better at praying and casting than by praying and casting, by intimidating and extorting the living by the power of death—they often work with an undead spellcaster who sends his undead to attack a town or city and die. The priests of the gods will wait until the lord and his people have given enough gold coins, land, slaves, and sacrifices to extend their noble hands and cast the gods of the god of death—they will Destroy some of the undead, but let it go more, but leave it for your own use - and the immortal caster will get a portion of the gold coins and plenty of experimental material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between the priest of the god of death and the undead caster is as sweet as the honey of the sugar, and the curse of the god of death is often the priests. Used on some stubborn humans, they never mind selling one or two of them, the Lich once saw one in his mentor - but since the mortal Cranmo took over from the former god of death After his powers and responsibilities, the days of the undead are not so good. The new god of death hates these casters who have rid themselves of death by their own wisdom and strength. He believes that this is a shackle and harm to death. His pastor is committed to bringing every undead creature he sees back to death, killing the wicked who made a lot of death, or the caster who created the undead. Sometimes they do not hesitate to launch the so-called "Jihad", with the help of worldly forces and adventurers to achieve their goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Lich, Cranmo’s pastor, who will have a gray string on the outside of the white robe, is like a semi-disguised death. The spirit-like bastard is even more annoying than the priests of Angris or Rosada, because they were originally a country, they sat together and sipped the sweet blood of mortals from the golden cup. Tough tears, taste the fear and sorrow, now? Half of them bowed to the prey and sacrifices they once enjoyed and enjoyed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead person once thought a lot on the way back to his room, much if you are willing to write it as a book, then the thickness of the book It may be more than a foot, but the moment he returned to their tower, he interrupted all the thinking and simulation - simulating how he got the thief's body, preferably intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is awake, even the lich, can't see anything from the calm face of the elf - he doesn't have too much gratitude, no Asked if Crimmar had used this method to save his life, and did not reveal any signs that could be called suspicion and alienation. But they couldn't talk for a long time, and Baldwin and his attendants walked into the Ranger's room, and the face of the owner of the Thunderbolt was covered with frosty heavy worries and uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that my people have brought you very bad news," said Kerry Ben. The toxins and corrosiveness that almost killed him have been removed by blood with strong vitality, but he still needs time to recuperate. Really healed, Baldwin made a gesture to keep him between his pillow and cushion: "Yes," Tyre’s knight admitted. "They confirmed my speculation that we will face 10,000. More than one orc soldier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has tightened his shoulders and his back, he did not say that there should be so many such things, this It doesn't make sense and doesn't help the current dilemma. "What do you need us to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elves will not participate in positive confrontation," Birdwin said. You have sacrificed too many people, sorry, Kerry Ben, but I need your warriors and mages - as long as they can let the war follow our pace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kerry has cast a glimpse of doubt: "You are making a dangerous decision - I am You will pass this secret to the next owner of Fort Rey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meaning of the weapon is to use it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know how much damage it will cause."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It won't hurt more than the orcs," Birdwin said. His eyes fell on Kremar: "In addition, I still need two mages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar and Riewen." Kay Reuben said without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does he want us to do?" After Bydwin left, The Lich asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thunderbolt humans need to evacuate as soon as possible - given that this place is about to become a bloody and dangerous battlefield," Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave?" The Lich said: "Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hidden and wide Underground passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the dragon's abdomen is a vast plain, with human wheat, rye, sweet potatoes and vibrant grasses, and the grass can grow to the waist of human beings. High, people with their mouths walking in the meantime, it is good to be able to walk out for forty miles a day, and the orcs can stand in a grid even if they don’t rely on mounts (gilves, horses and horn deer). Within six hours, he ran sixty miles to ninety miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first king of Norman in the Highlands never considered evacuation when building Thunderbolt. In his eyes, Thunder Castle is a lonely and cold military fortress. Soldiers and generals live and fight in it, at most with their Wives and children, if they resist the attack of the orcs, they can safely continue their lives. If not, then the dead do not need to escape - he does not leave craftsmen other than blacksmiths and chefs. With the position of the merchant - but fifty years after the establishment of the Thunderbolt, dare to get out of the Thunderbolt, more and more merchants dealing with the orcs, the whistling plain is not rich, but it has the thickest fur The most pure gold, the most embarrassing gemstones and the hot stones that can be heated - one of the most favored goods of the merchants - it is no exaggeration to say that there are three pyroxene burning in the small stove of each aristocratic woman. The second is from the Wuthering Plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business people need warehouses, need homes, need workshops - the beasts have only undergone a simple scraping of fat and flesh, and the dried skin needs further restraint, gold and Gemstones need to be honed, and pyroxene needs to be broken down from associated ore, grinding boxes... and horn deer, bison, giant wolf, small creatures, insects, plants, feces and other strange creatures that the priest and the caster will be interested in. They exchange cloth, salt, slaves and bronzes for them, and occasionally smuggle some of the most needed weapons and armor for the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of Thundersburg more than once wanted to refuse to sign a single chart, but without the loyal followers of Woking, he did not Income (the curse he still owes a lot of money to the dwarf), his soldiers have no wine, no horses, no armor, no weapons, their wives have no clothes and their children can’t eat even one The small grain of black sugar, so in the end he can only make concessions, so there is the inner city that we can see now and the single city wall outside the inner city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the inner city were summoned, and the commander read Baldwin’s orders – this is not the first time, nor is it without warning, all Everyone is as calm as possible, no doubts, no hesitation, strong young men and women are left behind, stored food is distributed, children, old people and injured soldiers can ride a carriage or cart (but If you are the owner of a oxcart or a carriage, you can continue to hold one-half of its ownership. People without a oxcart or carriage are allowed to bring a rucksack that does not affect others and their actions. With what they consider to be the most valuable property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich stands on a high place overlooking them, the port of the underground passage is a strange cave, so it is because its opening looks The narrowness is like a house that can only accommodate the next squirrel, but as soon as you walk in, you will find a magnificent hall for hundreds of giants and a passage that allows four carriages to walk side by side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground of the passage must not be very flat, the wall and the top surface are kept in the original state when the chisel is cut. The imprint of the chisel and the hammer is clear in the eyes of the lich. It is just like yesterday: "This is not like the dwarf. Works.” He said that although the dwarves would not climb the dome like the elf, carving the honeysuckle, clematis or ivy, the traces they left would not be so messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was humans," said Ruiwen. "Humans occasionally discovered it when surveying groundwater. This channel was originally very narrow, and some places were still Blocked, they excavated for a full 120 years, and the people who died here can almost be equal to those who died in a battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich turned Going over and staring at her face, contrary to what another soul thinks, the undead who once thought that she is not like Ilyu, the color of the Elven Master is biased towards rose gold, which is the kind that adds a percentage. The fifteenth of the brass gold, her eyes are not the blue of the lake, but the gray-blue, the sky color of the twilight moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many times did they use?" The Lich asked: "I mean, this channel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the second time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too much, the lich said in his heart, then he turned back and looked at those humans intently They are very noisy, of course, they have tried to be patient, but there are always some unreasonable stupid things - stubborn old people, capricious children and dirty animals, businessmen who mutter their workshops and warehouses, a girl Wanting to run back to find her own lover, her father hit her, the wounded soldier couldn't bear to swear and swear - there were thousands of humans gathered here, and Baldwin divided his army. Protect them, including several knights with special identities - such as the knight with armor on the armor, his armor now on a brown-spotted white Moma, a squatting bag Tie, his master is wrapped in a gray-white giant wolf cloak, slightly annoying He repeatedly checked his weapons, wide swords, short swords and daggers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers took the rope from the carriage and ordered people to hold it in a row. There were about fifty people in each column, and there was a torch in front and behind. Soldiers are responsible for lighting and maintaining order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry and three other elves who were injured and unable to fight are also evacuated - a sentimental and wealthy young widow is seeing these beautiful Like a glowing elf, she only felt that her heart was broken. She did not hesitate to donate a travel four-wheeler that can be described as luxurious in any way. This car is a human copy. The gnome's work is made of iron-wrapped wheels, a car framed by a belt on the frame, brass double masts, and two docile Moma horses standing in tandem, from time to time. With a sniffing nose, the horseshoe slammed the "shoes" with nails, and the mane was woven into a cute little scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it weren't for her dignity and the identity of the surviving, she might still be a temporary maid, um, after all, they are so...weak...this certainly can't, but those civilian girls can, they follow the carriage, but Kerry only allowed a pregnant young woman to get on the bus. It was better to take care of a future mother than to have a waitress, and then they accepted two more babies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man once walked through the road buried in the mountains. He told his grandson that they entered the passage when the Milky Way appeared. And when they walked out of the passage, they were greeted by the beautiful morning light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what about this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it will be night," the old man said: “A calm and serene night.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bats, snakes, and worms living in this cave don’t think so, their peaceful and quiet life is disturbed by humans. In retaliation, the worms rushed to the torch, and the bats rushed to the worms. The soldiers waved a short-handled dart to hit one or two bats. Of course, they couldn’t suddenly have an elf-like agility and sharpness. Eyes - Bats are too many, so you can grab one when you open your hand. More than one person stepped on snakes, lizards, and large beetles. Fortunately, most of the lazy days in the bat feces are non-toxic round-headed snakes, which can pose a threat to human beings. Only the snakes and giant pythons are not so toxic. When a giant python poked its head out of the crack of the cave, Kerry's cockroach screamed. Ruiwen cast a spell, the stone above the crack was crushed, and Kreima only saw the bright yellow spots disappearing in the dark, while others, especially humans, didn’t understand what happened. Whatever they do, they will be stepped on the heels by the people behind them, and they will be scolded by the soldiers, so they can only walk quietly - this is a good thing, but there are thousands of people crowded here. There are horses, scorpions and cows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich made a common gesture between the wizards to Ruiwen, silently falling next to a goldsmith or scribe, he walked on foot, dressed Neat, fair-skinned, always stumbling, because his eyes don't adapt to the darkness like other people, his hands are tightly clutching the ropes, the index finger, middle finger and thumb are not twisted and deformed in the scribe, but the fingers have The scorpion, the palm of the hand, the burns and the tiny stab wounds, should it be a goldsmith? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person behind him is a scribe, he has been muttering to himself, asking the god of knowledge to give him protection, the lich does not think this will Useful, creatures crawling on the ground with their stomachs don't mind if they are swallowing mud or ink in their mouths, as long as the prey is fat enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in the crowd with a two-wheeled carriage for carrying goods, it is really boring for a boy to complain about this road with his companion. He wants to catch a beetle or fly a bug. Instead, he was taken a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich doesn’t think this journey is very boring – what did he find? Anyway, it is more lovely than a big beetle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold, suffocating wind extinguished a soldier The torch, when the soldier re-ignited it on the torch of his companion and returned to his position, he did not realize that there was one less person in his queue - the person who walked in front would not know that the person behind did not keep up. And the person who walks behind can't figure out from a vague back that it is not the original person who walked in front - he thought he was slowing down unconsciously, so he quickly ran a step and filled it. The sudden vacancy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You surprised me," said the Lich: "You are How to escape, Ge Lan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's words:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point of hard work, rewarding less, a little heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purple-style princess rewards Jiuyu 588 starting currency still loves you Jiuyu Da ~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point Hard work, harvest, but less reward, a little heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jiff rewards the Nine Fish 100 starting point book This book is great!
