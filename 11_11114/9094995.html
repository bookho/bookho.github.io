The thief says that he feels that this slippery thing is more like a snail's secretion. Any insect in the Dragon Fire Island will become huge. It is as long as his arm, but it is not a dragon fire island, but a northern land that is very different from the former in terms of climate, but no one guarantees whether there will be an undead snail. The whole ramp is only about About a hundred feet or so, after a slamming, the thief found that he might have bottomed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and touched his pendant, saying that their team was not as described in the bard’s songs... complete, or even arguably A little cumbersome and shortcoming - they don't have a priest, this is the most deadly point, but fortunately they have elves and wizards; but they have two warriors and two rangers (one of them is Druid), Bird Warm power, experience and equipment may already be comparable to a legendary warrior, but the problem is that his heart is not always strong enough - Gülen is a thief, but since his life is more and more black because of the caster After becoming colorful, he also learned to be able to read and live quietly, so he guessed that Baldwin had met a ghost after being separated from them, and the ghost could be attached to a main material plane. On the creature, but if the creature that is possessed is strong enough, the possession will fail and the creature will never be threatened by the same ghost. The thief briefly estimates the time. It may not be enough for an elegant lady to drink a small cup of tea slowly from the stinking martyrdom. The thieves never overestimated themselves, but if they encounter other people with the ghost , like Kreimaer, Perant, or Kerry Ben, even Leona, as long as it is not the gnome who only knows how to hold his head and run around, it may not be so terrible to this terrible The enemy bowed his loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Grams thought that Baldwin always hated himself, and he hated Bedwin himself, first because of plum, and then because of Lee. Oona - No, it's not that he has any thoughts about the king of Norman in the Highlands. He just thinks that Leona's love is a bit violent for Birdwin - the man with a tall figure and a majestic look is the bottom line. It’s just a cowardly coward. There is something about his wife. Gülen knows a lot from Mei Mi. The death of Norman’s Pharaoh is still an unspeakable secret, but obviously, this guy used to be a Face the authority, the heavy duty and the sinful warrior, but now these things have run out of him - then he knows? Gülen thinks he knows, otherwise he will not be so sensitive and alert to Yadel, but what is it for? It’s not because this pastor is simply a mirror image of him. It’s said that Yad’s shackles in the soul may be heavier than Birdwin’s, but this does not seem to prevent him from getting love from people. With respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, Yadel received Rosada’s forgiveness, and he still couldn’t get the slightest response from Terrard. Birdwin never admitted the crime of rebellion and rebellion, but he also had similar charges. , even the more terrible Yadel is forgiven, but he has no movement here... will people who have trusted and respected him ever shaken, will they think that he really does? Is it a sinner who is not worth following? Perhaps even he himself must be shaken. Is his memory real? Does his anger really overwhelm his loyalty to Pharaoh and his duties? Was he facing Norman's soldiers and knights, and when he faced Leona, did he have a face with a twilight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking like this, Gülen almost sympathizes with Byrdwin, yes, almost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief seems to think a lot, but in essence, Byrdwin only takes up a moment like a flash of light, and this simple thinking will not hinder In his actions, he jumped silently from the mucus, flipped his wrist, and let the liquid on his arm slide down the cuff protruding from the wrist, no matter what it was, he didn't want to get it. He stood in the dark, his eyes saw something limited, but his sense of touch and hearing had been magnified to the limit. The air here was very muddy, or sticky, and he could feel something flowing slowly— - The thief gently sucked it, there was no tar or animal smell in the air, and there was no pungent smell of acid. Only the extremely faint smell, he gently moved a little. It was discovered that the scent might come from a ubiquitous mucus that gathered in a low-lying area and drowned his sole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German hesitated for a moment, pinch the pendant in his hand, slightly remove a finger, let the light shed from his fingers, he The fluorite inlaid on the selected pendant was originally small, and the occlusion by the finger was even weaker, but this did not prevent the thief from seeing what he wanted to see - this is an adult male only standing With the small stone room with open arms, there are wide gaps between the stone bricks and the stone bricks. The strange thing is that these gaps also reflect the light, which is brighter than the stone bricks which are at least smooth on the surface. The thieves will hold the fluorspar. The hand was lowered, and the flowing voice he had just heard came from there - and then he saw that the flat, solid and liquid-like thing was constantly spilling from there - the thief immediately retreated In two steps, the wall and the ground have already accumulated a part, and now they are constantly spreading and squirming. At this time, he has been able to distinguish it, that is, a group of hungry worms, which are very huge. Otter, even if there is no ge Arms so long, one is enough to cover the entire live Gülen's boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief swayed his ankle and the erected heel was on the ground - let's just say it, the ground hit a few times, and the bottom of his boots suddenly bounced out a few small but very hard nails, the nails were mixed with steel. With the fine gold, the price of a nail is more than a pair of so-called dragon leather boots, but value for money - the skills of the gnomes are no worse than the elves or dwarves, in terms of fineness and sinisterness, even far more than The latter - the nails pierce the ground, and it is no longer too laborious to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more insects spilling out of the gap, and the gap between the spilled bugs is getting higher and higher, the bricks are shaking, and the gap is getting bigger and bigger. Like a giant pushing behind, Gülen can almost see, the wall side may have a rumored bug, they are happily wanting to rush to eat too much - he no longer hesitates, turned and rushed out of the ramp, he heard The sizzling of the stone bricks falling into the insects, and the horrible squeaking sound, when he found himself avoiding the pressure-sensing plate that might cross the entire ramp, Not surprisingly, this pressure sensor is specially designed. From top to bottom, it will not touch it whether it is walking or sliding, but if it is from bottom to top, it is almost impossible to avoid it - especially for When you are not pulled down by the greasy mucus, your steps will become extraordinarily heavy and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is also a bad place. For example, now, Gülen will never think that the pressure-sensitive plate is only used to light the torch. He slammed himself up without a trace of pause, like a piece of paper burned by flames, almost at the same time, the powerful arrow that pierced the position that should have been his thoracic spine— - If Gülen does not avoid it, then he should now be nailed to the center of the wall like a butterfly that has been customized into a specimen - but this is not to say that the crisis has been lifted, and that the arrow has been hit. The weakest part left, the wall made the last crying, splitting and collapsing from the center. As Gülen imagined, the tide of the worms poured down, and the front of the "tidal water" covered the part below his waist. Stayed, and some of the bugs that were thrown far away fell on his face. The thief did not know whether the god of destiny was licking his handsome face. Anyway, it was the second devastating blow today. The liquid spit from the insects destroyed his face in an instant, if not Ge Lan Dang arbitrarily waved the fine gold dagger and cut off the muscles attached to the worm. His eyes and nose were afraid of escaping. He screamed and stood up, grabbing a worm that tried to get into his arm and pulled it out. It became two pieces, and the remaining body was still drilling inward, and the acid further corroded his nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that after he dies, it will turn into sand. After being swallowed by the worms, can the cute little sands meet the body of the worms? No one knows, but the bottomless abyss is down, it hurts too much, and it hurts that Gülen wants to give up - hope that the black hair's caster can have a way to extract him from the insect body - in a large glass jar, He even had a big laugh when he thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man shouted, Gülen’s ears were full of acid, but he accurately captured the familiar tremors, he exhausted Raise your hand with all your strength. A spell should be a spell. The light that it produces instantly engulfs the thief and the worm. The worm suddenly shrinks in the magical lightning and then bursts. It sounds even loud and rhythmic. Feeling, the current not only created an unprecedented worm meal, but also burned the acid in the body, but did not cause much damage to Gülen. The thieves’ clothes and boots were covered with metal. Lines, the circuits flowed along them to the ground - when he did not completely fall, a pair of hands caught him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan is awakened, he gasps and finds himself lying cold On the ground, a piece of fluorite was randomly placed on the base of the torch, and his clothes were taken off, but there was nothing to be ashamed of. He had traces of bites and corrosion by the whole body, if not lightning. When they arrived, they had already penetrated the thief's body into a riddled hole - and Leona was pouring a therapeutic potion on him. Seeing that he woke up, he was given a bottle of water for life given by the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." The thief said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona made a slight smile to his kindness, tearing open a reel, the white light of the reel shines on Gülen, and he is happy to see that his injury is Faster and better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful with Byrdwin." When Glan slightly got a little strength, he immediately said that they are not legendary figures in the bard population, he is also I don't want their team to have casualties due to unnecessary misunderstandings. "He seems to be possessed by the ghost." He then said, regardless of whether Leona doubted him with ulterior motives, though, if Liona Adhering to her blindness to love, he will only go far, anyway, he has expressed gratitude and reminded the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is neither his responsibility nor his obligation. For the companions in the team, her significance to Baldwin is the most important, but For Kreima and Gülen, her presence is not necessary - the thief even thinks she has called a lot of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
