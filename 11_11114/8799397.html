			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light disappeared in a blink of an eye. If Cremari is just an ordinary person, he will think that it is only the remains of the flame left on his retina. Imprinted, but the fact is the opposite, so he not only did not be confused and deceived, but stood up vigilantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw a wolf." Cremari Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, that is a lone wolf," said one of the former pastors: "I saw it more than once when I was hitting the water, only It has no breasts, is a male wolf, has one eye, and has a little leg. It may be the position of the leader of the wolves. After being injured, he was expelled from the wolves. It sometimes sneaked in the woods. Hey, we are doing it, but we haven’t attacked anyone. It’s not necessary. There are rabbits full of grass seeds and berries.” He looked at his skinny arm and grinned: “They are fatter than us. Much more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world has only seen wolves in movies, television and zoos, but has never seen wild wolves and wolves. But as far as he can see, this wolf is not like a lone wolf - although it has been wounded, its body is still strong and strong, and the speed of separating the blades of grass from the back is smooth and light, silent. It’s like a bird flying across the ground, not like a lame, or that lame does not affect it at all. Action, and back generous, thick gray-black fur soft, fluffy and clean, not stained with blood clots or other contaminants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it is still a beast," said Kremar. "You need weapons that will keep you safe."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about a small hammer?" Pastor II said, with a bitter laugh: "We can use it to knock nuts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The chief pastor erected a palm, his skinny face also bears the brand of the sorcerer, but in this group of people he still maintains some authority, the laughter disappears immediately: "I know what you said Every word comes from goodwill, Master," he shook his head calmly: "But we can't take more things, whether it's from you, or from the Grey Ridge, from the Silver Crown jungle. No, we Not so strong self-esteem and excessive sensitivity, our rejection is also from goodwill, young people, your heart is pure and upright, but you must consider one thing...that is, if anyone is watching us all the time If you help us, it is very likely to become a gray ridge or even a silver crown. Contrary to a group of filthy sorcerers - this is very dangerous. For you, and your people, you may be accused and suspected by your peers and friends."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are also a victim," said Kremar. "The culprit has another person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have a conviction or not," The priest pointed to the brand on his face: "Our God, our lords, their judgments are correct and clear--ignorance, credulity, neglect, arrogance, our crimes are irrefutable. So, Master, we need It’s not a weapon, not a drug, but the most profound confession and atonement.” He looked at Kremar, his eyes filled with love and access: “But I thank you too, you will never think of you giving us How warm the flames are, children, if I can regain my God's care in my life like a dead leaf, I will pray for you - it will be more than just the magical star river. There is also a bright and brilliant morning light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Do you need me to translate for you? The Lich said, simply put, it is: "Thank you, you are a good person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I don't want to pursue any of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Yes, dear, you are just constantly giving your attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world raised his hands and said to surrender - I know, he said to the lich and to himself, I am a bit too eager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered what Kerry had said to him outside of Bibi Dibao, he had to admit that the Ranger said it was right, here, good deeds also need careful Thinking and cautious engagement are even worse than evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I think you need to calm down for a while, once the undead said, you should find out, just like some people indulge in alcohol, some people indulge in women Some people indulge in power, you indulge in doing good, it can bring you peace and pleasure, let you forget all the troubles, you can not get rid of it, do not want to get rid of, but it is destroying your reason and spirit, idiots, It will make you the kind of person you absolutely don't want to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I thought you would like to hear about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-When you want to ruin us? Do not. The lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel looked worriedly at his young new friend. He felt that his teacher’s words were too harsh, but he must admit that these words are not without reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey!” the person sitting next to the chief pastor suddenly shouted, “I don’t think so,” he said, with a bit of disapproval: “At least I like the ointment he brought.” He told people Showing his legs, he used to be an obese person. He was not able to eat a few things during the days of his imprisonment, so he drastically lost weight. The skin hangs on the bones like a wrinkled silk cloth. On the top, and the face of Yadel is covered with bright red scars, "And rabbit!" He lifted the rabbit legs he had not finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I don't think I am guilty," another person said coldly. "I never appointed an untrustworthy person to take charge of it." The position, his dereliction of duty and slackness has never been heard - I do not hate the people who expel and judge me, but I will find a way to eliminate the brand, return to the crowd to be a mortal." He turned to Crimdale Nod, "But I still want to thank you, Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up from the ground: "I have to go back, the cave is still hot, I I haven’t been warm and have slept for a while.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two or three people apparently had the same thoughts as they left the fire After a slap in the face of Kremar and the chief pastor, they left silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry," said Crimal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resentment?" The chief pastor said: "It already exists," he said quietly. "Even before you thought it - but they have a sentence." The words are quite right, that is, the cave must be still hot," he smiled at Kremar. "The old guy who doesn't know well now is leaving. May the gods bless you, the child."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male wolf lies in the grass, breathing regularly and lightly, its ears are high and vertical From the outside, listening to the outside world - the rabbit jumped over the bushes, the skylark sorted out its feathers, the ants busy cutting the leaves and moving them back to the nest, the snoring of the human-fired fire was gradually weakening, they were walking around Farewell, someone brought water from the creek, poured out the embers, heavy dragging - they returned to their caves and blocked the entrance to the cave with a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stood up, stepping out of the woods lightly, looking up at the sky without leaves and branches, the sky is dark blue, as deep as the pool Dark blue, the stars shine in the meantime, like broken diamonds, like pearls, the warm air by the flame is rapidly getting cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
