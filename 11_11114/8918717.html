			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war between humans and orcs ended in an incredible way, the elves did not immediately return to the silver-crowned jungle, and they used their talents to produce plants for the thunder. The mankind of the fort provided food and shelter; the mages focused on burning the orcs' bodies, which was cumbersome and heavy, and unusually disgusting, all small in the hair and skin when the fireball was thrown onto the corpse The worms will fly and slam, and flutter everywhere, perhaps because the orcs habitually apply grease to the body to keep the hair glowing, they burn quickly, and the black smoke whirls into a thinness as the hot air rises. The long pillars, the stinking smell that comes out is still substantial. The priests of Rosada and Ilmot were busy treating the wounded, purifying the water, expelling the poisonous insects and the plague - although Baldwin had severely ordered it, but some people risked running to the collapsed inner city to find food. With clothes, there are some people who sneak into the tunnel and try to converge the bones of their loved ones. They have gotten their wish or not, but there are always people who bring back the deadly devils, they are not conspicuous, or just a thin hairy scratch, Or just a cloud of dirty air, but soon there will be fever, skin spots and diarrhea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yalale!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was originally thinking that this is another Because of the erroneous thoughts and the misunderstandings caused by the faint shackles, but the soul from the outside world did not make a second mistake, he grabbed the man’s shoulder, completely ignoring his stinking, dirty, and After a little hesitation, the man raised his hand and took the arm of the black haircaster—he just wanted to hug it lightly, but Kreima didn’t seem to think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was even thinner than Kerry’s last time he saw him, his hair had completely faded to white, and the old man’s hair was dry and dry. White, his eyes and mouth are densely packed with small wrinkles, his face is twisted and black, and his back is narrow and sloppy because of overwork, disease, and lack of diet. The only thing that allows people to compare with memory is probably only His bright, warm brown eyes, under his feet, a rattan basket with a broken mouth and transparent leaves, second only to his waist, wider than the arm, filled with elderberry and honeysuckle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is no longer hesitant, he extends his hand to Yadel, so the former service of Rosada got a second heavy and warm hug . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around Yadel looked at it with astonishment. He frowned and took two steps back. His head still hurts, he was evacuating. Was stunned, and when I woke up, I found myself running with a group of soldiers. The devil knew why he was full of stinky fish: "Are they your friends?" he asked angrily and angrily. Feeling that he was deceived, he thought that Yadell was just a sinner who had nowhere to go, but Yadel had two friends, one was an elf, and the other was a mage. For a lonely, gloomy jailer, They are all big and unattainable big men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Yadel said softly. "Like you, they are all my friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jailer did not speak, he continued to use that kind of anxiety The fearful eyes looked at them. Kremar noticed that he also carried a whole basket of herbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are these herbs going to be sent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"West Side, Ilmot The priest needs these," said Yadel, who lowered his knees and prepared to put the basket back on his shoulder and accidentally found it to be light. He looked at Crimall and Kreima blinked at him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also blinked at Kremar, and then slammed his head to his new friend, almost immediately, he heard a jailer Exclaimed, the weight that suddenly disappeared made him uneasy, and he slammed back and almost fell into his ass. Yadel was a little worried that he would be angry, but when he turned around, he found that the jailer's face was full of excitement: "Is this magic?" He whispered, Thunder Castle is not lacking the Master, but these Masters Not to have a relationship with a despicable jailer, he saw magic, but never had the privilege to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Kremar replied: "A little trick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get The answering person showed a clean and awkward smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, people greet Cremari and Kerry, and they all got the favor of both, and called Yadel to him. The people of water and food are not in the minority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They seem to like you very much," said Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the jailer replied: "The reason they are so intimate is because they need free treatment and herbs from Yadel, after all, pastor It’s still too little.” He glanced at Kerry Ben. “... Are you his friend? If so, take him away. He is a noble person. He shouldn’t fall here. Here is a little. It’s not for him either.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadale reluctantly showed a bitter smile, when he was about to say something, a cockroach fell down like a dive Come over and slam into Kerry’s arms and scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants of Dylan Don Cray arrived, and they brought in slaves, thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves decided to return to the silver-crowned jungle on the second day of the arrival of the slaves. The elves hated slavery and torture, but this was not something they could interfere with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadale did not leave with the elf as his jailer friend thought, he stayed in the Thunderbolt, but the lord of the Thunderbolt, Bywin, gave him As a medical officer, he lives in the fort with the soldiers and receives a fixed salary every month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't quite understand what you mean," said the Baroness, she Lazily burying himself in a pile of fluffy and silky velvet pillows, and pulling the robes high, extremely rude and tempting to reveal the ankles and knees of the **. "Don't you still be able to pull out her heart? This is really It’s too disappointing, oh, think about how many little girls are dying in your blue eyes and sweet words – I don’t want to repeat their names one by one. But now,” she raised her toes and used 臆The shiny nails of the antelope's fur rubbed the nails and poked the chest of the so-called Earl, "Let me tell you that you are helpless to a stupid spinning girl?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not to that extent," the young count smiled and kissed her to the face of the balm: "I just hope to be perfect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Have you kissed her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the lips," said the count: " It was left to her husband."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baroness gave a sharp sneer: "Only lips?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a good person who keeps his promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you hug her? Cares her? Have you ever been with her... A common understanding of the beauty that Fro gave to the laity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what are you still hesitating?" The baroness looked at him strangely: "Isn't that enough to make her dying to die for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is really willing to die for me now," said the count proudly. "But we don't need a dead village woman, you know, ma'am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"She still loves her husband?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe as much as me," said the count, gently massaging the toes and feet for the Baroness. Bottom: "If you give me time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long time to me The owner feels impatient.” The young count, Dylan’s nightingale lamented, “He will punish me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh,” Baroness Say: "That may not be, you still have a title after all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The title without a land is like a seat set in midair," he Naughtyly squeezed the baroness of the Baroness. "If I really want to sit up, I will be killed alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baroness is true Funny words What makes her even more enjoyable is that the young count is not empty-handed. Apparently he is quite accurate in rules and games - he took a bead from his bag full of blue roses. The mother fan, the fan is inlaid with pearls and red sapphires, and the fan pendant is a golden bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the Baroness opened the expensive and heavy fan and blocked it in front of the delicate red lips: "Let's add some chips to you." - If you don't mind... Poor Penny, she wants a child crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You are sitting under the big tree flashing silver,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westerly blowing the dense leaf will sizzle ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside this creek, my lyre <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will urge you to close Eyes, go to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I have not touched the sitar piano for a hundred years," the king of the Silver Crown jungle said calmly: "But I think my skills have not yet regressed." To the point where I can't bear to listen, or did I sing again?" He asked gently and seriously: "But believe me, my son, I have practiced many times before."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
