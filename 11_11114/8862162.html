			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves showed a hateful color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably nothing can be more disgusting than the orc who has endured the magic of the Kawu luxury waiter - the orc was originally like an upright beast, and It is a diseased beast. Layers of accumulated sores and pustules are hidden under thick hair. There are sarcomas on the face and neck. The ears and nose are covered with rough short hair. Their eyes are sharp and look like It’s all chaotic, and the reproductive organs of female orcs and males are unobtrusive – even deliberately revealed. The stench and mucous odors are the most ferocious and longest in many creatures or bodies. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical form of the Kawu luxury waiter presented to the warriors and the princes is to add a horrible addition to ugliness, and this The change can not make these blind believers return to their original state even after the magic is exhausted. Of course, the orcs believe that this is the grace given by the gods - just after Denver completed his call, Gersh’s nephew began. His change, but because his magic is the most of all the warriors, his change is the end of the end - the other orcs can be said to quickly complete the part of their own, an orc's arms stretched out Long, the claws are getting bigger, the nails are dragged on the ground to make a sound like a metal interlaced, and on his back there is a fleshy wing that the bat has; the other orc has a pair of strong and powerful hind legs, his forearm is narrowed, But two pairs of arms extended from the shoulders and ribs, the head stretched like the extension; the third orc fell to the body, his head became bigger, his eyes became smaller, and the hair became fluffy and hard. Stand up Waiting like a lever - their jaws have been greatly expanded, more increases with teeth become sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc who gave birth to the wings excitedly yelled and yelled at the dark sky, the wings were new, but he used it. It was as familiar and familiar as its original owner. He laughed and slammed from top to bottom to an elf mage who was casting a chain of lightning spells. Kerry was rolling and pulling a sharp arrow from the body of an orc. Shooting the bow, the Mithril arrow flashes like a meteor - the orc attacking the wizard agilely raises the gray-black wings all over the blood vessels and mucus. He was shot, but was shot, the pair It seems that the thin and thin, but the tough flesh of the dragon skin grips the arrow tightly, and does not let it penetrate or penetrate. The elf wizard is curled up into a mass of orcs and slams into the air. He fell to the ground and the spell was interrupted. When he was about to stand up and continue, something pushed his back heavily, and the wizard was forced to return to the ground. Then he saw Kerry’s Silver crown and "starlight", but in Former Swiss themselves are wielding orcs three pairs of arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc can easily cross the distance of nearly ten feet with a simple jump, and the floor is silent. He opens his mouth to Kerry, whose pink tongue is almost as long as one-third of his body. Should belong to a dragon lizard (that is, the lizards that are used to living around the dragon, both the food of the dragon and its guards, the merchants often use its skin to impersonate the dragon skin), the tip is like a hollow needle The poisonous pouch attached to it was hidden under its tongue, and the tongue slammed into Kerryburn so fast that even the elf could only find its afterimage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has moved the "Silver Crown" to the front of his nose, and then he heard a "squeaky" thanking him for his experience and instincts. Intuition, the venom is sprayed on the blade of the "Silver Crown". Only the tip of the needle passes through the defense of the Ranger's beloved weapon, splashing on his cheek, bringing pain like a burning flame. Fortunately for the elves. Most of the toxins in the material world are not effective, it only brings a short stun, and the wizard after Kerry himself has finally completed his spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning illuminates the face of the lizard orc, his face covered with dark red scales, and the lightning makes them black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Kerry Ben heard the scream of the elf, which was like a little more furry orc who contracted his muscles and projected it. Those mutated hairs, like a needle that has been enlarged by a hundred times, pierced the faces of the elves, arms and legs, the most severe one was pierced by the eye, and the gray tip of the hair was infiltrated with blood. Afterwards, they quickly bent to form a barb. Some orcs were surrounded and wanted to smash their heads with a hammer when they were weakened by injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar, still floating in the air, also saw that he threw a flame, the flame passed between the orcs and the elves, and several savage orcs thought I was able to penetrate the flame by the fur that was soaked in the snow, but the result was that the high-hot silk spouted out by the wizard's elemental servant was entangled and tied, and they burned up, violently like glued by solidified grease. Made of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fire Element Spider beats his cheeks satisfactorily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winged orc found Crummar, he flapped his wings and threw his claws into his chest, while rubbing his teeth sharply, toward Kao Extravagantly swears that he will never miss his prey again. He puts his wings away, sneaking around a prominent rock and watching the spine of the caster. He longs and imagines how he holds the thin and tender The shoulders, bowed his head and slowly bite off the neck of the panicked prey, sipping hot blood and the pain and despair that flowed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't get what he wanted. At the moment he was flying again, a paw caught him, his flesh was torn off, and his body was rudely crushed into pieces and swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch and eat the same kind of monster, a deformed Chimera, combined with the characteristics of three fierce creatures of argali, lion and viper, standing One eye is like a red charcoal-like ram sheep's head. The size of the horns rolled up on both sides allows an adult male orc to stretch his hands and feet to sleep on it, with acid-sparing saliva dripping from the uneven teeth. On the ground and the chest that flows to it, the surface of the chest is covered with steel-like scales, and the saliva infiltrates into it, not only does it cause harm but also makes them more shiny, and the scales extend backwards, one on top of each other. One piece, until the tip of the toe like a dagger or a machete, or a thick and flexible tail, the scale is gradually smaller at the point where the body is connected to the tail. In the reverse direction, the end of the tail is a viper, which telescopes its tongue in the air, intoxicated. Smell the sweet smell of life and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original part of the body’s original remains only a pair of orc arms, they become thick, also covering the scales, still holding an axe and a Hammer, although for him now, these two weapons are a bit small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t seem to be so satisfying, Chimera waved his arm and threw an axe into the air, an elf wizard almost hit, the axe passed His forehead left a sly wound on it. He sank in horror. Chimera screamed and rushed over to him. Its voice was very loud, and it could even be used as a weapon, but it was like a scorpion. The elf warriors jumped on its backs, or followed it, slashing its neck and ribs with a sword made of Mithril and fine gold. When they found that they could not pierce the scales like steel casting, they Try to use the tip of the sharp edge to pierce the gap between the scales and open the scales - just like fighting with the dragon, but Chimera's scales are smaller than the dragons, and their swords are drawn from the scales again and again. After that, leaving a deep and deep scratch and small blood, can not even cause obstacles to Chimera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremarar flew over and grabbed the mage, and threw a mucus ball, right in front of Chimera’s face, its bark immediately became blurred But then the monster spit out the cold airflow, the airflow freezes the mucus, and it pulls them down with their claws, and of course it becomes more angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell only delayed it for a short time, but it was enough for the wizard to get out of danger. He was even re-concentrated when he was being held by Kremar. The spirit, throwing a Thunder's spear, the spear is in the chest of Chimera, it screams, waving its tail, the snake on the tail bites an elf warrior, and the hammer in his hand flies out to hit In the abdomen of an elf mage, Mithril mixed with the silk of the white-bellied spider blocked some of his impulse, but the rest of them left blood in his eyes, ears and mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several warriors managed to pull back their arrows from the dead orcs. Chimera’s red eyes were a conspicuous target in the dark, but it closed his eyes as the arrow whistled, and it and the dragon The same has a double-eyed face, the inner layer of the face is translucent and smooth and hard, even the secret silver can not penetrate completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, two other monsters transformed from the orc warriors rushed up, and the orcs with six arms knocked an elf warrior down to the ground. The former's three pairs of arms hold his enemies tightly, let him move, and then spit out his tongue, letting the venomous spikes align with the emerald's eyes - but what surprised him was his The back was pierced by countless sharp needles that rolled in his muscles, causing unstoppable pain. He snarled loudly, dropped the elf, and turned to the guy he thought was a companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easy to think of the porcupine orc confusingly scorning his families. He doesn’t understand why he is doing this, but with the six-armed orcs He bit his nose, and he abandoned the little reason and madly killed the new enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oaks screamed angrily - it was his warrior, he whispered, madly leaping, trembling, black spots in his muddy eyes a small, uncountable black spot, and then a wet, stinging fly flies out of his eyes. It flies into the air, drying its wings in the cold air, and its many people follow it. After that, they are as invisible in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar is the only person who can still overlook the whole world. When the elf warriors fall down one after another, he throws a flame without thinking, the stars are a little bit, The bursting fireball suddenly caused Kerry's vigilance. He shouted and the elf warriors danced. The short sword and the machete were rotated in the air in an elegant and precise manner. The whirlwind of the whirlwind immediately put these vicious bugs. Winch to smash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elf warrior leaped to the Oaks priest, his scimitar crossed the neck of the Oaks priest, and made him two, and the orc priest only told him There was a gloomy smirk that disappeared into the air—only a few dozen steps from the Oaks priest, and the head of an orc soldier suddenly fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chimera bent down and spit out the elves, the body of the warriors and the wizards who were unable to escape were frozen, and they bowed their heads and rushed over to them. The huge horns and hard head are like a hill that moves by itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black sorcerer's fire element servant beats his eight legs and blocks it between Chimera and the elves in time. It is smashed and shattered, and the broken body becomes a small flame. They are like swords. Pierce Chimera's face, body, ice, burn and melt them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has cut down two orcs, and Kremar’s flight reel has expired. He falls to the right side of the Elf Ranger, holding a spell in his fingers. Material, Kerry estimates the spells he and other wizards use, and he sees his soldiers are covered with scars, tired, and they have to face more enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar," he asked. "Can you still hit it once? In the same place?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use your strongest spells," Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar nodded again, while quietly gazing, Kerry Ben looked down at his sight - not knowing the two giant trebuchets When did you get a lot of small wooden boxes that were quite interesting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have to run very fast." Kreima said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry had a slight smile, and he vaguely called, the elves began to move closer to each other, and the wounded and dead elves were carried by their companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elves are always so stupid." The Denver priest muttered that if they gave up the dead and injured companions, they might be able to escape a few, but now ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can be considered is that the wizard wizards use teleportation or portals, but he also holds the two spells that can contain and destroy the spells. Scrolls, humans are sometimes stupid, even though they think they are smart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar tears a reel of serial lightning with the help of Elf Mage, this scroll is copied by the lich, lightning flashes in Chimera's chest The bang bang, the monster's scale armor is split, revealing bloody wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has put away the "Silver Crown" and "Starlight" and took a short shot of fine gold from his pocket, which is a dwarf In order to kill an evil red dragon, specially created, in order to enchant above, they made a deal with the king of the silver crown jungle, the king of the elf enchanted this short gun, so that it can resist the energy and acid Damage and injury, and sharp and unmatched, sharp, but after the dwarf used this short gun (hey, for the dwarves to be a long gun) to kill the red dragon, the gun was owned by the king of the silver crown jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves of the Silver Crown jungle agree that this price is very reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the jungle before leaving it to Kerry, Kerry would have thought it would be safe in his pocket until he Go back to the silver crown jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is the original intention of the king of the jungle. In the poetry of the bard, the powerful magic of the king of the elves gives him a glimpse of the past, present and future. . But Kerry quickly put this idea behind him - the king of the jungle has always dismissed this ridiculous cognition, as it has been in the long river of time for thousands of years, tens of thousands of years or possibly more For a long time, the king of the elves, when he is staring at the void, the current, the flame, he can occasionally see one or two silk threads falling from the spindle of fate, but this is not from the magic, but from the true emotion. With deep thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of Mithril's goblet falling from the stone table to the ground Crisp and loud, it echoed in the empty hall, and the calm water surface caused a slight embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord of the King of the jungle picked up the cup that rolled down to his feet, "Wang?" he asked worriedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing," said the ruler of the Silver Crown jungle: "I just saw it..." He suddenly paused: "I saw..." He didn't say anything more. Instead, he stood up and his attendants had followed their king for more than a thousand years, but for the first time they saw the confusion and anxiety in the eyes of the king of the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the elf closes his eyes, and when he opens the eyes that are like the sea and the sky, the extra emotions that will cause the restlessness of the people. They have been deeply hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Berlin," he said quietly: "Open Wan Welin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short gun was not handed over to the king of the jungle, the dwarf's blood and dragon's blood remained in its engraving, the elves Rinse it with the water of the fountain of life, the dwarf's blood is washed away and the dragon's blood turns black. They seem to have merged with this silver-blue fine gold short gun and cannot be removed. For this reason, the elves Call it "Dragon Blood." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is clinging to him, the evil dragon's blood makes the carvings hot, and the short guns tremble, as if they have their own lives, they will be free from the control of the Elf Ranger. The wizard's wizards and warriors revolve around Chimera and compete for it. Attention - he clearly knows that he only has one chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chimera’s chest has lost the protection of scales, but that’s right instead of left, Kerry doesn’t know if its heart is still on the left The ribs beat, but he had no choice. He ran fast and silently, holding the short gun with both hands. The short gun was smooth and light when piercing the monster's chest. Chimera didn't even feel the pain at the beginning until the short shot. The tip of the gun shattered its alveoli, and it roared and sighed to Kerry for a cold, but the Ranger's hand was still on a short gun. This cold and beautiful can make an orc instantly freeze into pieces. Pulling the body can easily corrode the steel and the blood of the rock and can't hurt the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Kreima tore the third flight reel, he quickly escaped a dart thrown by the orc, and took Kerry The waist of this book, with a gust of wind, was thrown into the air as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a reminder, a summon, the wizard wizards took the reels from their pockets, and the elf warriors firmly grasped them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no! No!" The Oaks priest was the first priest to discover that their prey was preparing to escape. He jumped wildly and squatted from his pocket. A thorny seed, spit and blood on it, then waved his arm and threw them to the elf closest to him. It was an elf warrior, carrying his dead friend, and the seeds fell into it. The ground greedily drew blood and snow to grow up. In a blink of an eye, they wrapped around the two elves tightly under the master's will, and the thorns of the thorns pierced their bodies, sucking fresh blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oaks priest laughed, and he shook his cane with a string of elf phalanx, making the thorns entangled tightly, but did not kill them, and one Elf Master, he is trying to get his friends out of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have not noticed that a human being, a humble, fragile, stupid ordinary human being is slowly getting up from the mud, dripping black sewage. Holding a broken arrow between the fingers, the arrow of the elf, inlaid with a sharp Mithril arrow - his steps are even lighter and quieter than the elves, with a fatal accuracy in the broken Mithril Arrow He didn't make a little extra sound before he got into the back of the Oaks priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oaks priest opened his eyes in surprise, because he felt the pain and the passing of life. When he remembered that he had been killed once, his soul was out of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest’s soul uttered a fierce roar in the dark air, pointing to the daring human being, trying to cast his last saved spell, this is the orc The sacred priest of the sacred priest gave him the special ability to avenge the little worms who dared to kill his servants - but the wizard also cast out his already prepared spells and dispelled the mankind. Plague and poisonous fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After their owners died, those thorns also lost the strength and tenacity that made an elf warrior unable to move, and he easily got rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man rushed over and helped him to pull off the branches and vines that were attached to his friends. The elf warrior unexpectedly found that he still had a lot of strength. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me away!" he shouted: "Please, take me away! I am human, not an orc, nor a half-orc." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if I can bring up three people." Elf Master said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very light," thief Glan pleaded. When the prisoners turned and fled, he slammed and did not escape with them. His choice was very correct. Those people were killed by orcs and humans under the wall—he was hiding under the mud and the body, but could not find a chance to escape. There were orcs everywhere. This may be his last chance: “I am very light and light. It's like a rabbit! Take me away, just let me go here! You don't take me away, I will die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elf Master looks The warrior, who silently put down his friend's body, took off her pin and put it on himself. The wizard bowed to the deceased and tore the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still have a fireball, its flame can melt the metal." Master said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," said the soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan hangs in the air, he looks at the wizard throwing his spells, the corpse burns up, and it is ashes between the beards, The flame warmed the air and the wind. He looked at the gray ridge and knew that he was only temporarily safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
