			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The spirit of the dying is an elegant and profound name, but the Grand Duke called it the stucco, and his people called it It’s a stinky mud pond, then, the name comes from here, I think the lich is knowing, but he just won’t tell me – but I’m used to it, he’s been so stingy, he’s cumbersome... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——by the soul of the outside world<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They set off on the next day, the soul of the outside world thought You will see a place like a snow covered marsh or a similar terrain it has seen on television, but in fact, it is a dry and desolate mud. It is said that hundreds of years ago, water from the snow cover swamps flowed through here, creating such a vast and moist likeness in the sunken places. In the distant memory, they once brought rich harvest and coolness to human beings. Water vapor, but I don’t know when it started. First, the source is exhausted, and then the accumulated marsh water begins to smell bad. The fish floats on the water on the belly, and the reeds and ferns fall down in pieces. The smell can be transmitted to dozens of miles away. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, I still insisted on the epidemic in my life here. The governor of this place burned the village with the vegetation of the trees left by the water, which was completely eliminated. After that, it has been forgotten forever. When Kreima asked the grand prince, he was even a bit stunned. He didn’t remember that there was such a place on his territory, or that there was such a mage. Of course, he can't refuse the demands of the Grenada people. Really, Dagong thinks he is still very fortunate. After all, these uninvited guests are not as cruel as people think, nor do they ask for what he can't do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too stinky." Keou said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other eagle lions are also complaining that a warlock is for himself, but also to carry his own beast, almost free to throw a small Spells, this spell can drive away the stench that lingers around them, even a talented person who has never systematically learned can be released, but he only gets a burst of bursts of light, he screams and falls down And the knight around him jumped abruptly from the back of the mount literally, and another warlock suddenly threw a protective spell - a twisted protective spell, like an invisible monster, just one bite The second half of the eagle lion was bitten, and the flesh was torn into a pink fine in the hurricane, but there was no part of the transparent barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon tooth knight knew that his mount had no hope when he fell, and his face was gloomy and paused, and the sword was pulled out and the sword was opened. Only the bird's head is still called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bottomless abyss is down," said a warlock. "This is a frantic magic zone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The existence of the frenzied magic zone may be longer than the magical star river, but the flood is still thousands of years ago. The wave of the plane and the war of the gods almost destroyed the plane. After miraculously subsided, everything seems to be It becomes orderly and regular, but the frantic magic zone has not disappeared with the turmoil. They can appear anywhere. It can be said that the only natural enemies of the casters are apart from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic that is released in the frenzied magic zone will fail, produce extreme effects, or deflect the caster, and other casts that may be fatally devastated. The strange consequences that can no longer be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world checked the warlock's face, but fortunately he just wanted to release a small spell, so the damage is not very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is there something wrong?" A dragon tooth knight asked: "How could a frantic magic zone live with a mage?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hole," said a warlock. "The frenzied magic zone has never been complete. If it must be said, she is like a piece of cloth with a marginal edge and a hole in the hole. These holes are what we call 'holes'. In the holes, magic can be cast as usual. And it produces results.” He looked at the withered trees, and his eyes passed a trace of greed: “It’s just to stay in this hole, and the price to pay may surprise us.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we need to go there." The Dragon Knight said: "In the case where our caster can't cast spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Exactly," the warlock said in a humorous tone that was quite common in the Grinada, with a bit of cruelty: "We just have to be agile."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Knight has never missed his mount so deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Krimaar had to leave the human face lion beast in a place where these savvy creatures could barely endure, they were drying Loach (not the wrong word, every place where the foot is covered, the surface is covered with a layer of salty and salty salt-alkali shell, which can be thick and slippery mud), this feeling makes habit The dragon-toothed knights in stone bricks and sand are as uncomfortable as repeatedly stepping on the gonad secretions of a thousand pounds of gerbils, and they are always wary of the threat from this strange land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have already been attacked by a group of mud magic bats, which are a kind of ice magic bat that Crimall met in the far north. It’s not so cute, but from the appearance, they are like hairless bats with a surface covered with mucus. They have the height and weight of a six-year-old child. When their flaps are flapping, they will Corrosive liquids are applied to people's eyes and faces. If not, they will generously replenish the acid that spits out of the sharp mouth. This liquid will hit the leather armor and the leather will immediately Melting, steel hits them immediately and becomes dull and colorless. Cracks appear when there is a blow. The warlocks use the dragon language to intimidate them. They have not achieved much success. They are forced to throw flames at them. Can be regarded as the most sharp weapon to deal with this monster, after all, it is difficult to have acid can break through their sticky skin, lightning and ice is also ineffective. The mud bat escaped after leaving a lot of burnt corpses, but the irritated little monster left them a gift before they fled—the acid ball thrown from a distance, and the thick stinking fog. group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog group caused several warlocks and knights who did not leave in time to vomit uncontrollably, and the mucous membranes in the eyes, mouth and nose were burned. When they feel pain, a violent stream of water descends from the sky and pushes them directly to the ground, but thanks to Greedy, it is indeed clear and pure water, which not only dispels the fog, but also washes away. The acid that sticks to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not fair." A dragon tooth knight said that his hair was half black and half yellow - the warlock was supposed to drive away the one who was clutching him. The head of the mud bat that spit up the acid, the flame arrow turned into a fireball in half, and its flame did drive away the mud bat, but at the same time burned the other half of the Cavaliers' hair: "They seem to be completely unaffected by the frenzied magic zone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They seem to be used to living here." A warlock said that he was The mud bat that he had imprisoned was walking away, and the mud bat tried to spit acid on him, but the acid suddenly exploded in its throat, like someone who put a cannon inside, warlock The barrier was subconsciously erected, and the acid and broken internal organs in the mud bat were splashed everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barrier was distorted in a time when it was not breathing. The warlock was suddenly dragged out of the magical coverage by a huge force. The air where he originally stood was sent out. Sharp whistling, the invisible blade rubbed the warlock's forehead past, his forehead floated to the ground, no one more than an inch... The warlock paused and swallowed a bite, "Thank you very much," he said, one side Turning around, then he saw a little devil with regrets, don't ask him how he saw the regret from a hamster's face - a slender silver rope stretched out from this slouchy hamster One end is also tightly wrapped around his ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for his gratitude, the rope accepted it, and it slipped down from the warlock's ankle. When he left, he nodded to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you very much, my Highness." The Warlock found the right person this time. The little devil and the rope are all black-haired dragons. He needs to thank him too. There is only one such one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful." The Highness simply reminded me. Then he turned to the knight who was a bit stunned by the connected accident: "I think it is quite fair. If we have to say it, we can only think that the heart of the lucky god is always very variable." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You may be blamed,” said Ostal: “The mother loves the child very much. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young red dragon glanced at him, if it was another person, even her son Kelmen, dared to rebel its willingness so bluntly There is almost no other ending except for the painful long death. But standing in front of her is Austal. In addition to the status of the leader of the Dragon Thorn, he is still a lover who has not been long before the Red Dragon, or even one of them. The Red Dragon’s love for him is still in full swing. Before the love faded, the Red Dragon was still willing to condone him once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
