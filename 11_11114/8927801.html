			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid removed the last silver hair clip and used the ivory comb to comb the hair three times for Leona - under the yellowish fluorite light, each The root hair is like a polished copper wire. This is a symbol of the Norman royal family. Her father, aunt, and cousin are the same, but Leona’s hair is the most beautiful. Its color is like a flame. It can always be kept from the shoulders. Dangling to the heel, and thick and dense, if there is a skilled textile girl who can cut them and spin them into a woven fabric, then this cloth is enough to give Leona’s father, the body of the bloated Highland Norman Make a robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, apart from the hair, Leona has almost no merits to be sincerely praised. She inherited the king’s five senses, for a man. Said that such facial features are not handsome, but at least can be said to be tough, but for a woman, the thick edge of the blade, the nose of the microstrip hook, the thin white lips and a pair will be reminiscent of the eagle The brown eyes were too unpleasant, and Leona remembered that her mother had played her face more than once against the window when she was still alive, lamenting that she would be a son if she was a son—she clearly remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, if she is a son, it would be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Leona is a boy, then the king of Norman in the Highlands does not have to worry so much, a orthodox and healthy boy, he will be brave and strong And maybe it’s a bit violent. When he is riding a new stable and yelling and rushing back and forth in the courtyard of the palace, how gratifying the father of this scene will be from the window...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, no, the incumbent King of the Highlands Norman has no son, although he can already say that he is exhausted - he has sacrificed to the temple of Gredi. A thousand pregnant mares prayed for a son to the glamorous god. After that, his queen was pregnant, but he could not give birth to the child. She entered the grave with Leona’s younger brother. Then the King’s Majesty also raised a lot of lovers. He hoped to smash the seeds and promised. Who can give birth to his son who can become a queen - a woman almost succeeded, she gave birth to a son, but this child was blinded by a crow before she could wear the crown in the future, in a row After crying for two days, I died because of fever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, no women have been pregnant. When Leona was 14 or 15 years old, she was suddenly taken back to the palace. She had been ordered to live in the palace outside the capital of Wangdu. She saw her in an empty and cold room. Father, he is old, his face is gray, his face is dry, and his clothes are also unable to cover the decaying smell that comes from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, Leona thought that he just missed himself and wanted to regain a daughter's respect and love for her father, but this idea was quickly overthrown by herself. She was educated to belong to a future king, then the king. Her Majesty told her that she had to be a queen - Leona didn't know where this crazy thought came from, she only knew that her father was clearly controlled by it, she tried to persuade, but he was furious The scepter thrown in it hurt his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will never give my throne, my country, my people to an enemy!" The king of Norman in the Highlands declared this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few years, perhaps because of Leona’s status as a heir to the heirs, it’s no longer so isolated and blind, she is blind and ignorant. Slowly pieced together an astonishing truth - her father may have been cursed, and he lost the ability to prosper. In Norman, Highland, such a man would be scorned and neglected, ridiculed as a castrated old sheep, which is deadly for a king. He killed all lovers and closemen to ensure this secret. It's still a secret, although it seems that this is just a remedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, who will come to curse the king of Norman in the Highlands? The most doubtful thing is that the Duke of John, or the Prince, the brother of the King, was the first heir to the kingdom before the Norman law in the Highlands was modified. The Duke of John gave Leona the impression that he had The cockroach of the flesh, or the ghost of the coagulation, his body is very poor, often coughing, and even dancing with the lady will make him tired and panting, and the Normans in the Highlands have always been brave and strong. Rong - he is not a good heir, but at least he is still a man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona doesn’t know if her father wants to kill her uncle, but the Duke of John is really careful, and Norman’s nobility will not allow The king does that unless he can immediately have a male heir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what the king is doing now is to fight for them to recognize a female heir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't want this position at all!" Leona shouted silently in the darkness, she didn't know that the inherited hills and whites What does the tower's heiress think, but she is more willing to be a powerful ranger or warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of lilac came from the crack in the bed, and Leona’s maid inserted the cloves in clear water before leaving the room. In the golden cup, it reminded Leona of Baldwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she first met Baldwin, she was still a child, and her father was not a king. I heard that Pharaoh had intended to hand over the throne to his youngest son John and exiled his eldest son to Thunder Fort. At that time, many people thought that they were incumbent. The king will become the owner of the new Thunderbolt, but what they did not think is that Leona’s father managed to obtain the support of Morton Don Cray in Thunder, and he not only returned to the king but also succeeded in taking it down. The crown of the old king was worn on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this goal, Leona’s father stayed in Thunder for five years, and he lived with his wife, daughter and soldiers in the rough fortress. In the small, Leona’s favorite thing to do every day is to stand on the box and squat on the window sill to peek at the knights and servants in the courtyard. Especially the knights often use sandbags to hold their chain mail back and forth. Throwing (one of the ways to scrub the chain mail), it looks like it's juggling, but it's more fun than juggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was too fascinated and didn’t pay attention to her too much, she fell, if there was no arrow that Billwin’s shot like an elf Living in her robes, the king may not have to worry about his heiress now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Header sees that Bedwin is upside down - she is embarrassed upside down, but this does not prevent her from recognizing that it is a bright It’s like a smile in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Li Ona remembered the smile and remembered his name, and every morning, she kept looking for that person, like a certain After the ceremony, she can do other things with peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She began to pay attention to listening to her father’s conversation with her mother, because they occasionally mention Baldwin, who both sighed at his fearlessness and had to pity him. Born. Leona doesn't know if the rumor is true - but she feels that a knight like Bondwin wouldn't care about a so-called aristocratic identity that needs to be disguised as a disguise - he is brave, fair, and loyal. A good man, a follower of Tyre, a pure, rock-solid, mountain-like, real knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Li Naona knows that he has a wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Leona knew that even without a wife, Baldwin would not be her husband, and the other half of his body would become a group. The target of attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t even dare to let her father notice, when he still expects a son, he thinks she should have something with Norman Norman Marriage or lord of interest or ally relationship; now he wants her to inherit his throne. This candidate has been changed to a minister who embroidered the surname on the tapestry. He hopes that she can raise a male heir as soon as possible, then he Her husband can be killed to prevent him from seeking the throne by the identity of the Queen’s husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
