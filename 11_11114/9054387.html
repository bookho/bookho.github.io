			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female Warlock, the priest of Greedy listened to the complaints of Drake and the Sea Devils and turned a blind eye. She only focused on the situation of another caster, after the violent The baptism of thunder and lightning, the pirates are no longer as unscrupulous as they are. In fact, they can't wait to put both feet above the surface of the water. Some pirates simply stand on the body where their companions lose their vitality. The person to escape, but Ruiyite immediately cast a fine flame, the flame is only as thin as the hair, the fingers are so long, but suddenly penetrated the eyebrows of the pirate running in the first place, in his hard A hole was burned on the skull, and the people behind him screamed with sorrow and hate - both to mourn their companions and to themselves, their sights were like red robes daggers thrown into red robes On the warlock's body, they know that they have been seen by this evil caster as a victim of the enemy's mage, and if possible, they will tear the rein in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go forward, lick the children," Rui said scornfully, revealing a bright and cold smile: "The people behind you can compare with me." There is more kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think so." Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects they describe are observing the pirates who were put to death by him. The undead who once died are more than once glad that they are reading from another After all the memories of a plane's soul, it was immediately decided to send the transfer to the port of Jianzhi. Jianjian Port is a place of criminal assembly. There is never a lack of disgusting criminals in the eyes of the devil and the devil. They are like walking a dog, even if they are already full enough to vomit, they will not let go of any prey that passed by them. At the beginning, the thief from another plane even has such dregs. Unwilling to take their lives, the Lich did not force him, but it soon discovered that forgiveness of these people's lives would only cause misfortunes for themselves and other good people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blunt pub is not the first place where they came or returned to the main material plane. Prior to this, the most important and difficult task of the Lich was to teach another cohabiter to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes the lich is amazed at the prosperity and peace of another plane, it is so vast, rich, peaceful, no war, no famine, even No gods. Only human beings, once undead are simply unimaginable. If they are ≥↗≥↗≥↗≥↗, m.¤.co$m, God knows that there is such a plane, how crazy they will become, seven billion Humanity! It is ten times that of all humans and human beings on the main material plane. Most importantly, most humans have no faith. What does this mean? If the god can get the way to the plane before other gods, He/she may gain the power to believe in the God of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both it and the Lich should be thankful for their good fortune, and it is probably only the god of the dementia that can see through this soul. And because he does have a relationship with Alzheimer's, he doesn't seem to care about getting more power, and he doesn't care about those who are eager to move. He acts more like a childlike waywardness and whatever he wants, just like he made it. This so-called law of redemption lichens, this can be a bad but exquisite game, just like the human "do not think about an elephant" - when you think about not thinking about an elephant You have already thought of an elephant, just as you can't redeem for redemption - it is not that the lich wants to be a living again. That would only make him want to vomit, and what is the "death as a kind person"? ! Even another guy in his body can't recognize this return. Even if you can't get a long life, at least give him the number of lives he deserves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, anyway, the Lich didn’t expect to be able to get the good deeds. His line of destiny was already woven out when he was not born. However, although he can be desperate to hold it in his own hands, it is not a soft silk thread. Instead of tough steel and boiling blood, the lich can see its beginnings and see its end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the lich thinks, he may be embarrassed. He is holding another soul, so that he can be born and raised in such a warm and peaceful plane, licking its parents, its friends, a calm nest, every delicious food that An An heart has eaten, Every hug and greeting it gets, even the rose flower it once stared at will cause the lich's embarrassment - this plane also has rose flowers, but it only gives the lich the memory of the lichens - in order to Filling the hunger, the branches of the rose were once his food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can also swear to the Styx, his guidance and training (perhaps indeed harsh) is absolutely necessary, in the plane of another soul In murder, murder is a great sin. For a human being who has passed away (whether or not he is innocent), human beings will give the greatest tolerance and compassion, but here, I am sorry, even if the elf Ranger Kerry Ben was sent to mourn the wasteland. The soul is also enough to sustain a city of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a cruel and rigorous plane, everything is built on power, even in the ranks of good gods, the white robes still A dazzling record is needed to maintain status and dignity, which is a clearer and more eternal law than the will of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world has passed, it will never get used to watching life dies, yes, it swears it will not, but it has learned to accept, I can also watch how they breathe and leave in pain. This is not only the Lich’s request, but also because he has lost his vigilance because he cannot face the person he killed. The consequences are The soul of the outside world does not want to recall, you only need to know that since then the soul of the outside world has never turned before the enemy really stepped into death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates were driven by Ruiyi, like sharks driven by killer whales. They had to move forward. Despair and resentment provoked their anger. A pirate shouted at his companions, using dialects that only they knew. Controlling the actions of several others, they plan to have two or three of them entangled in the caster, interrupting his spells, as long as they can reach the range that swords and daggers can reach... But before they act, Baldwin has Jumping into them, the warrior stretched out his arm in the silver glimmer. His only arm held a wide sword with a soft luster. It was like the extension of the arm and the solidification of consciousness. Rotating through the bodies of the pirates, the blood screamed together with the screams. The general wide sword was used more and more to beat and slam, but Baldwin’s wide sword had the same sharp edge as Gülen’s fine gold dagger. When it swept the enemy in a hurricaneous manner, the enemy's weapons and bodies were broken like sugar cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates flocked forward. They attempted to use their large number of advantages to kill this strong warrior. After all, he had only one arm, and Baldwin kicked the sea hard. The sea pierced the eyes of the pirates he was facing, and they closed involuntarily. The eyes, stopped, and the former owner of Thunderbolt sank, not only avoiding the stab at the back, but also leaning forward. The wide sword broke two pairs of knees and the fifth leg. Birdwin slammed his shoulders into the swords of the pirates. The sword bounced off the chain of Mithril. He was like a huge bowling ball. The pirates who were filled with the ball were opened and they were freed from their encirclement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the pirates are indeed too many people, and Bydwin’s initiative to attack is in the middle of their minds, when their companions are still fighting with the pirates. . The caster should not cast spells, and their distance is so close. I can shave each other in the near future,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Kerry’s, and the elves’ swords are not the same. Baldwin's wide swords are poor. After flying like a petrel in the shadow of a cave, there are always one or two pirates holding their necks and scratching their chests. The wounds left by the elves may be as thin as paper. They are all in the most deadly position. A guy who is more burly than other pirates thinks he can grab the elf. He wears heavy iron-covered leather armor, an iron collar around his neck, and his fingers wrapped in mittens. Perhaps because of This reason. He would think that it would be a good idea to use his body to bind the Ranger. His movements are not agile, and there are two pirates who assist in his work. Others seem to be like Kerry. Inevitably, he slammed into his arms - the pirate immediately tightened his arm, his arm strength over the ordinary orc, holding the person in his arms, tightening his arms, letting the other slowly The inability to breathe and suffocate to death is his greatest hobby - but the next moment, after he saw him, he found himself caught an empty space. He looked around in confusion for a while until the two pirates who assisted him pointed at him. Shouting in horror, he just wanted to turn around, and a smudge of white light spit out of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has taken back the "Starlight" and wiped his love knife on the idiot's coat. Although he will carefully clean and maintain them after the war, he will pierce the knife into the fat back neck. Spelling out of the dirty mouth can really make the elf feel sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea devil turned to Reyote, this time did not wait for half What the Orc had, Reiite began to cast spells, but her cast spells were not used to attack the enemy, but to protect themselves, she wore a rune seal that protects against energy shocks and injuries. She also added two protection spells to her, and finally she thought for a while, and cast a spell that protects her spirits. After doing all this, she checked her spell potion and reel, Dimension The bag was near the bloody battlefield under the cover of another spell used to conceal the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I send a signal." She told Drake and the Sea Devil: "You must be dispatched immediately, or I will give up this mission."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt, honey," Drake: "I will not let you be in danger."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea demon sent out a laugh like a crow's tweet: "Me too," she said in disapproval of Drake's false feelings: "A beautiful person like you, if you die, there should be What a pity.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reiite sneered in the shadow of illusion, and then temporarily threw these two humans (one and a half humans) Behind the head, the battle between the casters can't be half-hearted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thinks her spells can get her first hand, but in fact, she was discovered when she was about a hundred feet away from another caster. Reyte has raised his hands with his instincts, preparing to cast a powerful spell instead of waiting for a closer distance, but the opponent's caster has already preemptively issued a spell, and he distinguishes it from his gesture. It's a flame-like spell, "This is a good opportunity." She is against her, the rune seal of protective energy damage can guarantee that she will not be swallowed by the flame, and the flame will obscure the other's line of sight, when he thinks that Rui Yi Te When the fire has been solved, the female warlock will give him an unforgettable lesson. Of course, if he can still have a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the fireball did not rush to her or any pirate, but rushed to the sea that became muddy during the battle. The seawater that has been guided has not passed the human foot, but it can still be called a large number. The fireball that may exceed the melting of the steel directly hits the cold, what will happen to a large amount of water? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
