			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello. WwW.XsHuoTXt.com"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caubert from the sparkling sea Retracting his sight, the leader of this group of exiles, a knight called Xiu is coming to him. He is a middle-aged man who is more than six feet tall and has become thin and embarrassed because of the pain of being displaced. The skin that clings to the bones presents an unhealthy grayish white, double-pitched depression, and cracks in the lips. Even so, no one mistakenly believes that he is just a serf or a soldier - know that each inland person is first When I boarded the Shanghai ship, I suffered a lot of earth-shaking torture. Compared with the land that has been stationary since the existence of the plane, the ups and downs of the sea are as large as the gods’ breath and never stop. Even on a clear night, the waves that hit the three-masted boat still make people feel that they are sitting on the back of a violent wild horse. The companions have almost returned to the cabin - the knights have Qualified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His soldiers are lying neatly in the shadow of the cabin below the ship's side or leaning against each other, looking at which position will make them feel comfortable A little bit, the sea breeze is as strong as a strong man pushing Cobbert, but the deck still seems to have a smell of sourness, probably from some stains on the clothes, but the total Said that the situation is much better now. These landlocked people neither complain nor plead, and even rarely pray to the gods, or more correctly, most of them don’t say a word - this makes the little bird The owner of the number picked up his thick eyebrows in his heart. When Alva gave him the job, he did not hide the origins of these people. Cobbert had a sympathy for them with 120,000 points. With experience, he knows that these people are in fact extremely dangerous - their innocence, grievances and pains, the confusion of the future and the constant betrayal and frustration. Like the lava under the volcano, it was fiercely tumbling - which made Cobert worry about the black hair caster. He said that the young man was introduced to Alva and Kerry Ben through him. When he knew that Crimall "returned" to the Gray Ridge, he was sincerely happy. When he learned that he became a lord in a blink of an eye, the owner of the Little Birds was really surprised. Destiny seems to always play with something that makes people feel at a loss. Little tricks. No? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a good thing for these highland Norman’s abandoners, they can’t go north, the Whistling Plain is the orc’s territory, where humans They can only be slaves and food, and they can't go east. Every country that borders Norman Norman has had a terrible war with it, and because of the scarcity of the Norman royal family. They have not been married to the outside world for hundreds of years. The central part is the land of the Grand Duke of Luzer, worth 500,000 gold coins. Further south, along the edge of the land, there are some narrow-minded territories, and the kings with false names. Occupy, the Grand Duke and the Cavaliers, their territory can afford one or two people to spend the extravagant days, but can not afford to support a thousand or so troops, not to mention they also bring their own family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cobbbert never guessed why they didn't go west. On this continent, everyone knows that it is occupied by evil dragons. The kingdoms they created are filled with breathtaking sulphur and blood, and the dragons are at the tip of the pyramid, and their descendants occupy the position of the king and the nobility. The red warlock with the dragon's blood is as dense as a star. The average human is not much better than the slave there, especially the outsiders. It is very normal to be monitored. If you have anything worth mentioning, whether it is you or not The ring is still your face, then it is commonplace for your bed to suddenly vacate one night - but you can't say that it is not prosperous, and some businessmen who regard their interests over dignity, life and conscience can always rely on inhuman The madness and ingenious means of excavating the sands from the feet of the dragons, not to mention the sinister evils who have never thought of paying the price of a half-country in exchange for a powerful warlock service. The paradox that can't be placed in the face and the sacred wealth of the day and night, like the rivers into the sea, is endlessly invested in huge caves - the strongest of them is also the country with the most vast country, Grenada has A huge market that no country can have, you can find everything you want to find inside. And some things may not appear in your most arrogant dreams and the most fearful nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for going west again, the north side is the dark sea and the seventy-seven islands. The seventy-seven islands were occupied by the gray robes thousands of years ago. It is no exaggeration to say that there may be a lich on every reef there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the seventy-seventh islands is the Azores, an island that is shrouded in evil and darkness, although the female grandfather of Azores claims Azores. It is a land of freedom without camp, but only pirates and thieves think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longhuo Island is indeed their only choice, although it can’t be said, because there is no lack of war on the Longhuo Islands, but the least, they can Their wives and children compete for a meager property and shelter, so that they will not be expelled like a wild dog, and eventually die of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Lord," Cavaliers bowed to Cobbert: "Please forgive me, but I want to know, how long we have to sail Can I get to the Dragon Fire Island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call me Cobert." Captain of the Little Bird said: "I am neither a jazz nor a mage - I think If the sea breeze can consistently blow in one direction, we can go to the Longhuo Island to eat a second meal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers have been indulging for a while. Nowadays, few people on the mainland have only used two meals a day. Then the second meal that Captain Cobbert pointed out should be the noon of the day. He gently spit out a breath from his chest. It is so eager to see new ones that can belong to their own land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you very much, Captain," he chose a moderate title: "The favor you give us will never be forgotten."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is my pleasure to be able to help you," Cobbert said. "Everyone on the mainland should thank you. -Thanks to every soldier and knight who is stationed in Thunderburg. There is also a mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s eyes passed a disturbing shadow and revealed a sly smile. "Maybe," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was preparing to leave and returning to the cabin he shared with his companions, Cobbert stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old friend of Bituminburg gave me a pretty good blue cheese." Captain of the Little Bird said: "Maybe you are willing to have a drink with me." With cheese, I think you need these."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repaired for a while: "Thank you." He succinctly said: "But I am now everything. Can't eat," he said. The voice was hoarse, but the tone was high, and the light in his eyes made Cobbert think of the gamblers who sat silent on the table and left the last one. "So," his body is tight, like With the bowstring in the shooter's hand, Cobbert thinks his spirit may be the same: "I just want to go back to rest for a while, I am very sorry. Captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bo features a nod, his worries come to his mind again, the black hair caster will certainly get a sharp sword, but obviously, it is double-edged, the captain of the little bird has no doubt, slightly The poor pool, its owner will be cut by his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the waiter at the top of the mast suddenly gave a small, small whistle, and he came out of the barrel. Gesture down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caubert stared at the watchman for a moment: "There is a merchant ship, not far from us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new little bird flies past the calm sponge, and the speed is amazing. They soon saw the merchant ship that the watchman said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like it is not good, the hull is full of black, it can be seen that the fireball shot by the gun is hit and then burned, the masts on the ship are all different. The degree of damage, the main smashing, the sails and the sails have become things that can't be said to be a thing, the terrible silence on the deck, the moonlight and the stars shine on it, so that people can see the miserable scene after the catastrophe - The body is lying on the deck. The clothes were stained with blood, and the broken sword and the arrow that turned a wooden barrel into a hedgehog showed how intense the previous battle was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hear it," Captain Cobbert said. From the inside of the merchant ship, there was a weak cry for help, and some people were alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is not uncommon in the sea. When pirates robbed ships, they only left property and valuable ransoms, and those who could be sold as slaves and experimental materials. They did not keep the boats, they only spilled oil, lit up, or Cut a hole in the boat and let it sink on its own; but in rare cases, the ship attacked by the pirates can escape, just like the ship they saw, this boat is a dual-purpose boat So, after the mast was broken and the sail was burned, it was still able to escape by the oar, but now it is already at the end of the battle. Cobbert suspects that the pulper inside is fixed at the bottom of the boat, although there is a The law has repeatedly stated that this practice is wrong, but there are still ship owners who will do it. These pulpers are generally not fugitives or poor worms who cannot pay their debts. They even dare not even treat them unfairly. The consul complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we going to be close?" asked the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain nodded and had many unwritten rules on the sea, one of which was to rescue all who could be rescued, because you never know if you will It will be the next unlucky one to soak in the sea. However, the Cavaliers found that Cobbert was squinting at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He certainly wouldn’t think that the captain suddenly fell in love with him at first sight, and the knight once again stared at the merchant ship about a hundred feet away from them. What concept, but also feel that something is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you help me find Gavin?" The captain said: "I remember that he is a good doctor. I think those people will need a doctor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The exhibition reveals a smile that is a heart-felt smile. This smile is much lighter than before: "I will go right away," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Cobbert said. "Maybe you can also look at the boxes underneath you, the blankets in the boxes, take them out, I think they will need this too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Xiu said that he took a sneak peek at Cobbert and left in a hurry. Special envoy is passing a sailor around to inform other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Dragonfly" hides itself behind a cabin with broken sails Covering myself and peering out at the movement of the beautiful ship, for a while, he didn't even want to destroy the ship. Maybe he could drag it back, paint again, and sell for a good price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach may be difficult for other pirates, but it is not very difficult for "Red Dragonfly". He has a precious big rune in his hand. He told others that this rune can cause fog on the sea so that his ship can hide and escape. In fact, it can also create a illusion - it disguise the "Red Dragonfly" ship as a dying, non-threatening Merchant ships, the ships that come to the rescue will come over like the birds that jumped into the net, and board the ships. When they mournfully put down their knees and want to find survivors in the pool of blood, "Red Dragonfly" and His pirates will jump up quietly and give them a big surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rescue boat may leave some people on the boat, but the pirates will split some of the territory that jumped into the opponent via the springboard and the hook rope, unprepared Few people are able to respond in time – so the “Red Dragonfly” does not have to go through the formalities necessary for other pirates – throwing spears and rockets into their prey in advance, and the ship he plunders can be almost completely preserved, except Avoid blood and other traces. Sometimes, the value of a vacant vessel outweighs the total price of the cargo and passengers it carries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Dragonfly" can also save time for chasing and siege, which makes his work just quick and good, although this time he It is possible to give a little to the Sea Devils and Drake, because they were originally agreed to enter the waters of the side island at the same time. Now he may need to delay for a while, just for a while, see the big fish and let it go in vain. It’s not the usual style of “Red Dragonfly”, but he can imagine how angry the other two companions will be, but as long as there are gold coins, there is no hostility that can’t be eliminated – he can almost come out in the void. Their appearance, from questioning, to surprise, to anger, then to rapid calm and greed, he will give them a little, but not many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
