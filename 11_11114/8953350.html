			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar tears a reel and throws it at the foot of the appendage, and the spells in the reel can turn the rock into sand— It's not a very powerful spell, but it's just right here - the appendages are stunned, leaving only the newborn head and many arms outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it tries to get out of the way, the bad means it takes is finally letting the souls of the outside world understand why the lich will say that the appendages are only in the devil's group. Little cute, it actually chose to be invisible at this critical moment. The torches in the round room were extinguished because of their battles, but the flames created by the Cremari spells made the entire room bright, and the huge sand holes were full of bulging and sag. The shape of the soles of the feet and the palms are also clearly printed. Kerry Ben looked at Kremar and shook his head at the monster in the pit. The caster raised his hands and let himself return to the state of absence from the spell, and put a pistol of spiritual energy into the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appendage demon touches the invisibility in a scream that is enough to shake the entire court, and it moves quickly, if not, almost shred it into pieces The rifle, maybe it has climbed out of the sand hole - Kremar casts a second spell, touches the magical effect of fossil sand, regenerates the rocky ground and walls to make an unpleasant hum, appendage The devil's broken body is confined to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames cast this time have played a considerable role, and the pieces of meat that have lost the magic of the appendages are quickly drained like ordinary stumps. The water, curled up and burned, turned into a blackened ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has cut off the woman’s head, and the appendage demon cried and raised a child’s head under the cover of the bones that moved to the outside of the epidermis. With the remaining three legs and four arms fleeing to the left channel, it is not as resourceful as other devils, but at least has a normal human IQ, and it remembers the Tyre Knight who has deep hatred for the human beings it possesses. It was thrown there, by the ghost lizard watcher, he rolled his lips and made a whistling whistle that humans could not hear, ordered the lizards to block the rear chasing soldiers and bring their prey to it - he would attach to the man On the body, come to paralyze and assassinate the Elf Ranger and the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been called many times. The ghost lizards that were originally raised in the other two passages have also climbed out of their caves, but there is no movement in the left channel, and the appendages quickly climb into it, and ten black lizards are arrogant. Ground loops - they must follow the commands of the appendages. But they can't make the human being anyway. The simple little brain of the ghost lizard can't stuff too much. They are spinning around the iron box and wanting to get the thief stuffed inside. . They squeaked the iron box, and the tongue slammed against its surface, and the body continually hit the box and wanted to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?" Mei Mei asked. The voice is low and hoarse. Every word is like swallowing a charcoal fire. In fact, she wants to ask why this man who vowed to take her to escape from the birth is still in this terrible prison, but she dare not - She and Ge Lan huddled on the chandelier shelf, thanking the king for his sire, because he often came here to admire the horrors of the enemy, so there are denim chandeliers besides the torch, although there are no expensive candles on it now - that would have to wait for the king The squatting squat will be inserted temporarily, but its quality is even better than the torture tool, which is extremely firm. And it's all-iron. From slings to shelves, you can put four dozen candles on the shelf. Of course, you can accommodate two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before getting the command of the appendage, there are several lizards that want to emerge from the rocky zenith, catch or kill Gülen and Plum, but their movements are too slow and the reaction is too slow, and the thieves can easily pierce their eyes and throat with a single removed iron strip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fall to the ground. It rots and weathers at a speed visible to the naked eye, and only the closest of them can bite a bite of meat - the only thing left is the stone and the sniffing air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan sat on the edge of the lamp holder, his feet hanging in the air, and tapping his hand with a piece of iron - carefully avoided The part of the lizard's blood that is corroded - a relaxed and relaxed look and a sling. The priest Froe, who shivered in the middle of the lampstand, formed a stark contrast: "That is Bywin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Budwin Ferguson," said the thief: "The Elf Ranger and the friends and comrades of the Master Crimmar, they will not watch him die, and are not honored. The death, in fact, they may have arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the next moment. As Gülen said, a deformed monster rushed into the cave, and he found Gülen and Plum, and screamed angrily, turning to the box surrounded by lizards. - It turned the whole box over with just a flick, and the cover opened by the thief opened with a bang, and Byrdwen moved, but he could not get out of the box - it was only built for the thieves. The box is too small, even if the former Tyre Cavaliers had lost one hand, the thief still broke his bones and stuffed him into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not pose any difficulty for the appendages. It erects the body and the semi-dissolved face extends to Birdwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Elf Ranger's sharp arrow broke into the air. This is a precious enchanting arrow. It collided with the appendage to create a fierce shock. It almost smashed the stalks of Gülen and Plum, which shattered the appendages. The lower half of the body, it cried and fled; the caster cast a group of crystal clear crystal spiders, they beat the cheeks with excitement, scattered apart, chasing the slow-moving ghost lizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at other times, in other places, the Ranger must be able to catch up and kill it completely - the appendage is a less common devil, It's too weak, so it's unusually rare, but every time they come to the main material world, it will inevitably bring countless tears and blood. Sometimes they can even destroy a whole village and city slowly - but they have already spent it. Too much time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar took out the Mithril Staff, knocked on the iron box, made it bigger, and Birdwin twisted out, Kerry Ben took over a bottle of Cremari's potion, and Byrd Weng gasped heavily, woke up, and then coughed fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now we can go." Gülen whispered in the mouth of Mei Mi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair caster raised an eyebrow when he saw Gülen: "How come you are here?" After Baldwin returned to the kingdom A small trial ceremony was held in front of the temple of Tyre. The thief was found guilty, but at this time he had already redeemed his sin, so Baldwin released him. Only he was not allowed to stay in Norman Highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is thanks to the Duke," Gülen said, coming over and kicking the iron box. "I have not been able to get out of the king and I am put in." The box - he told me that although he knew that I didn't kill his illegitimate child, it didn't prevent him from sending me to the penalty table - he vowed to come up with a particularly interesting death. Law. Of course, before that, he didn't mind letting me try the gadgets here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief took a look at the caster, from him I found something he wanted to see in his eyes - "So, please take me away." He continued: "I am sure I can't live here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "And me, beg you." Mei Mi followed him and pleaded. "They want to kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is she?" Kremar asked, he looked at Mei Mei and saw that it was bare. The bones of the bones wrinkled unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plum is cold, the caster doesn't remember her, but she still remembers how the caster cast her on the wall coldly, as if she was throwing a withered flower – not to mention She is now embarrassed, and even the ugly ones may not have a glance at it, or it will become a burdensome scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She grabs Gülen, and Gülen holds her arm. Mei Mei doesn't know if he wants to push her out or pull it. More likely it is the former. She has dealt with thieves more than once. They are all mean and vicious guys, and vows to them are like blowing. Breeze over the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She almost despaired, but she immediately saw Baldwin, who stood up under the help of the elf, with an elf from the pocket The robe that was taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, Sir Alex," she shouted in her loudest voice: "I heard - their conspiracy. I heard it, for you!" She let go of Gülen and eagerly took a few steps forward: "The conspiracy - starting with your wife, Penny... They framed you, I know everything. I can testify for you!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin looked at Kerry Ben, the elf hesitated, "I can't guarantee..." he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will bring her with me," Gülen interrupted. "You don't need to care about us," he said, holding the plum again. Arm: "We will follow you closely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soul felt a slight guilt in the guards and knights swallowed by his spells, because people have discovered the same underground. They brought bows and arrows, and no fewer than three casters are coming. The situation has not allowed him to be kind to Kerry. Fortunately, his spider servant has created more confusion, it shakes his body. Hundreds of flame spiders jumped out of the cracked flame, each of them only as big as a human fist, but they burned, and the golden and red Mars spread as they jumped to what you can see and see. Not in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the servant of Kremar also plundered the biggest trophy of the Norman King of the Highlands - a strong middle-aged man, dressed in gorgeous, hands Wearing a ring on the wrist, a bracelet on the wrist, a crown on the hair, a necklace on the chest, every piece of jewelry is pure gold and inlaid with various gems - Dylan Donkre if he meets him Feeling intimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a crystal of fire element, a wise servant with wisdom also has his own preferences, like this one of Kremar, it likes things that are not easily melted by flames, shiny and bright, and it feels its owner also I would like it, so as soon as I saw the owner who came out of the dark underground, it ran with a male human weighing 150 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor man was hung from the head down, breathing the hot air, his eyes were grilled and unbearable, and the shaking hands and feet were touched from time to time. The iron whip that was burned red - he felt so, but it was only the foot of the spider servant, although the latter did not make much difference, he could not see, only heard the terrified call and A chaotic number of chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he was not happy when he was thrown into a huge manger with cold water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Luther of Luzer," he said, looking at the man in front of him, he is not like a knight, or guard, although he The robe is white and only goes to the knees, but some of the features of the body remind him of the casters around him instead of the pastors: "Grateful!" He said, "Brave people - tell me Your name, I will let your king give you the honor and reward you deserve!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," said the man: "I am not Highland Norman Man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther blinked, he looked around, two people, one male and one female, rags and dirty, being soaked from him Drinking water in the manger, while another person, sly, gray and gray, isn’t it the Baldwin of Thundersburg? But he doesn't look like a grandpa, it looks like a prisoner, the kind that is under the prison tower; then he sees... that, or that he only pulls him out of the warm and comfortable blanket in the cold wind. The culprit that blows and puts on the fire is like a spider as big as a horse. It is no longer so burning. It looks like a large piece of charcoal isolated from the hearth, black, some places. It is white, and the crack is full of glaring dark red. Just give a gap and you can burn it again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard before that 'Pharaoh is dead, Long live the new king.'" Luther said: "So, since the king of Norman in the Highlands has no way to reward You, then how about Luzer Dagong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say?" Gülen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
