			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irmot’s followers saw a strange thing, that is, the magical energy that should have been whizzing out of the broken wand was annihilated It is like a flame rising in the water - this is a scene he has never seen before, it was so close to him, the wind of energy has even wiped his forehead - he clenched With the hammer, I couldn't react at the moment, and the young wizard of the black hair was again fighting with the shadow tree monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the dead branches behind him and grabbed a twig that was still squirming and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the blood phasing can have a face, and this face can make an expression, then the soul of the outer world thinks, it may put a Zhang Tuzki's == expressions - or yelling bugs - anyway, the person who will bear the bloody back is not uncommon in the main material plane, even if there is no need for magic, the devil, the demon and the dragon can also be with the elves. The orcs and humans have their own descendants. The only difference from the latter is that the former can decide for themselves whether the intimate relationship between them needs to bear an evil fruit. But probably no blood stasis will have to face a weird problem at the time of the attack - that is, the object it wants to destroy has changed one without warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich tells the soul of the outside world what the blood means to him. The buff varies from person to person, and he is still a living person. At the time, what you have to face is the intimidation of its fragile ridicule and death. It is a never-ending, fascinating dream that cannot be broken and cannot be destroyed. It is like a huge stone, heavy and unshakeable. Grinding your body and soul, like a fine needle with a hook, has been drilling into your bone marrow and spiritual gap, looking for your weaknesses and regrets, and treating them as their sharpest Weapons - it is generous, except that all kinds of negative emotions such as cold, hunger, despair, etc. are poured out to you. It will also leave a little bit of bait in the very bad way - confuse and drive you out of breathlessness, running in pain, but in the end, you will only find yourself standing on the cliff. Here is the swamp that is suffocating. You think this can be regarded as an end point. You think you can get a rest after a short torture. No, it is just the beginning of a new round of games. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he became undead, the impact of blood stasis on him was drastically reduced. The Lich’s mentor had studied this situation. He came to the conclusion that the power of the counter-attack comes more from the body than the soul, so the body of the lich is filled with cold negative energy. As time goes by, the flesh Withered, blood dried up, and bone marrow turned into ashes, this abominable regular visit has naturally followed suit – although before that he has learned how to use meditation to resolve the effects of blood stasis on himself – this is important In the tower of the mentor. It doesn't change any plans and schedules for a small disciple, and everyone is searching for the weaknesses of their peers to turn them into meaningful benefits at the right moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, thanks to the god of divine dementia and the nosy of the nosy, he lost his beloved bone shelf, got back the useless body that he abandoned without reluctance, and that should be cursed into endless Ten thousand times of blood in the abyss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not he is still facing a demon, a monster that grows together with the shadow tree monster, the power can almost be flush with the pre-stepping monster, witch The demon can certainly cope with the past. Just like every time before - the branches of the shadow tree are curling, shaking in the dark sky, it is not immortal, the pure positive energy contained in the blood of Kremar is like a hundred thousand times concentrated Sunshine. It burns it while nourishing it. The part of the monster that belongs to the tree monster is both fearful and longing for him, and the part belonging to the succubus is almost completely mad - the succubus is all the devils. Most greedy for flesh and blood, they sometimes even give birth to themselves and demons or children of other races, and then fill the blood, but for the time being, they are still weak and thus unable to resist or escape the semi-magic to make a hearty meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irmot's pastor clung tightly to a stone statue. Of course, he also saw the woman - she had seen him, and she had imagined that it would be more beautiful with the poet's inventing, but the atmosphere surrounding her was extremely unpleasant and depressed, and he forced himself to hang his head and avoid it. Open her gaze and tear open the robes so that I can breathe more smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If placed in the past, the priest of Ilmot is also one of the favorite foods of the succubus, but she can now ignore the spur of the gray She was engrossed and only wanted to catch the feathered bird - but to her disappointment, the image she had changed suddenly lost her original deterrent - the wizard had lost the power of resistance. Suffering from two serious injuries, he almost squatted in front of her and let him be slaughtered... What helped him? The combination of the tree monster and the succubus glances at the priest who whispers behind the statue. No, not this human being, she shakes her head, and may also be some kind of magical tool that can make the spellcaster immune to mental damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thinking, the attack of the demon has never stopped - the instinct of the attack does not require the mind, and countless roots are slamming Come over, without leaving a gap, they look like a living cage, the seams are tightly connected to the light, they are entangled, creeping, every drop of blood will make them completely mad... then Yi The priest of Almat heard the most violent and angry shouts in his life. If he was not standing here, listening, he would not have thought that this was the sound of a tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was able to feel that the pressure on his body was reduced abruptly. The red light shook in the darkness. He opened his eyes and saw a big fire. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; &&& <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Lich broken wand to cast out a pastor of a fatal Il Mott The spells have already anticipated how they will be punished - just as he tried to kill a dirty toe with a thunder, he was quickly smashed by the invisible and powerful force and deprived him of his body. The control, this time does not need the alien soul to slowly rise, because it is on the surface of the sea, it immediately replaced the lich, to face everything outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this punishment will last longer than he thought, the lich is thinking, the speed of his suppression and the emptiness he feels More violent and profound than the last time, but he still has a little time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Shadow Tree Monster immunizes all effects that affect the mind, toxins, sleep, paralysis, shock, and deformation, and it is difficult to completely destroy it by slamming and puncture. The lich said. But the other half of it is the devil, even if it is a demon, she is immune to the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——So what should I use? The soul of the alien world shouted with a low head and shouted, using roses and diamond rings to get the lady's understanding? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich issued an order. Very timely, only a little bit worse, their bodies were caught and tied up by the black branches, the branches caught a few strands of hair from the caster, and the hair turned into a light spot in the branches. The vitality allowed the succubus to stick out his tongue: "What a wonderful smell..." She exclaimed: "My child..." She called softly and forcefully: "Come here, come to my side-- Don't let me down..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world coughed, he didn't know what to say. The counter-attack caused by the battle between two hostile blood vessels has changed its practice. Simply put, it is beginning to break up – it is not that you don’t want to drag the soul from another plane into its field. However, this guy is more difficult to deal with than a non-dead person after he is familiar with it. It can hardly grasp the core of the mind of the alien soul, and some of the leaping sporadic fragments cannot understand it at all - the network is what? Magical net? So what is a magical girl? What is the rabbit's destruction of the world? What is the Big Rabbit Country? Is there a rabbit to establish a country? Ok, what is it that is said to be omniscient? It looks a lot like a runeboard...404NotFound? The endless abyss is enough! The monster I created in my consciousness is not to satisfy your appetite! Why do you imagine a piece of iron and then add oil to it? Start grilling its tentacles... stop! Even if the devil and the demon of the endless abyss want to torture the enemy more, they never thought of sprinkling pepper powder on its body, but also brushing the honey! This is simply an insult! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said... stop! stop! stop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It tries to show what it’s peeping, and the only weakness that might break the weird soul, but it’s almost no longer affecting the alien soul. It is still very strange to the world, and it is very clear that for a house that is a different world than a street park ten miles away, consider how to return from one plane to another - the difficulty is not inferior to Earth walks to Mars, though. In this high magic plane, the previous question may be answered, but for him, it is still too far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world has long been planned. First of all, what it has to do is to survive, yes, to survive, not to be forcibly destroyed by the power of justice and light as an evil undead, nor as the Lich said. After the redemption is completed, he will die as a good man (it doesn't know if this is a reward, it only knows that he is not a cold), but it is a long-term, complete, intact (existing) place to survive and become A powerful caster who will not be instigated by any force, and then try to find a way to walk back from the main material plane back to the original plane - ah, that is, go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It knows that it will take a long, long time, and the long one may make the undead feel tired and tired, so it is not impatient, too Don't panic, the world is colorful and vibrant, there are so many new and interesting things waiting for it to discover, why is it impossible to achieve the goal that cannot be achieved? This is certainly a long and arduous journey. But it feels that you can still see it as a journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the "nose" smashed thoughts are almost like the soundtrack of the game for the souls of the outside world, and it only has to fight against it. The demon's projection character, the problem is that it is aimed at the lich, not it; of course, she is really beautiful, but after the initial stunning, the small heart of the alien soul has long subsided, after all, in it In the fragmented memory, there are many wonderful images similar to this one - the difference is that they are all 2D, this is 3D. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry." It was a bit shy, and said innocently: "Auntie, you seem to admit the wrong person."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......All the branches of the tree blame suddenly paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—— Damn, why did she become violent? ! - The soul of the opposite world shouted in consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
