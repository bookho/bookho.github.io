Hey, in addition to the gift bag, this time the 515 red envelopes must be seen, the red envelopes do not grab the truth, set the alarm clock ~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the smoke slightly vibrates For a moment, Kuluth did not say a word, but Ostar knew that he had been touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you have seen the little guy, what do you think of him?" Austal said: "I have not contacted him. But there was a little devil who managed to mix around with him for a while, and my disciple, my disciple’s sister had also been against him, but the feedback they gave me was that this little guy was more than the mage. Like a warlock, even if he is a mage, his method of practice and manner of action is not a teacher who can be taught by the Dragon Island. Alva and Kerry are not obsessed. Things, they are born good, always love to think about people, but we are not, dear Master, we are not, although you have been a good person, but you are now a soul, and belong to the Grenada, your heart Full of resentment and hatred, your vision is always dark and the mouth is filled with the dust that mourns the wasteland. You work for your enemy in exchange for a one-and-a-half-point residue to maintain your existence when you just lost your life, maybe Lun is that Rosada has called you, but unfortunately their voice can't reach Greed's feet, and now, as a poor soul, you can no longer hear their voices, even if you come to mourn The wilderness, the devil or the devil will not take care of you. You are like a chewed cane, even if they don’t want to squeeze more magical energy from you than tell me that you are What do you think of when you see a healthy, young, energetic life, is it a hungry or hungry?" Austal smiled happily. "Your pain will make you see more of those who are in a better position." What people can't see, isn't it. Kremar," he cautiously spit out the name: "Obviously, this is a variant, what is his original name. He is a half-elf, does he have Is there a name for the elf? No, I don't think it will be so simple. Dear 牟路斯, please think carefully. Your disciple, I also heard about Beavis. After all, he served on the fleet of Beitburg. For years, with the elves The relationship is not bad, my children used to hate him very much, just like we hate you, maybe because of this, we know him more deeply than others, you think if your disciple has a Apprentice and even a heir, will he be Cremari? Even if his wife is a half-elf? No, his character is like a flame and a hammer, like a dwarf. Frankly can be said to be a bit rude. In those people, if I have to choose one, I think the chance of the former paladin is more than the black hair caster we see now. He is not like your disciple at all. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage image of the smoke is suspended in the air, his hands are inserted in the robes of nothingness, and his face is expressionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am also a caster and a mentor. I know what the relationship between a disciple and a mentor is." Austal said: "Although there is Many people think that the warlocks of Grenada will abuse and kill their apprentices or disciples on a regular basis. Of course, I don't deny this, but a child who is an apprentice in a blacksmith shop will not be handed by a blacksmith. Did the thrown slag hit the head and die? The master of the bread shop will also throw the apprentices who have eaten nuts or honey into the oven. Not to mention the apprentices who are cooking factories and fishing boats. Are they not? Often only one of the ten can live one? Otherwise, why should the parents of the child swear in front of Tyre’s balance that the teacher’s responsibility will not be pursued because the child is injured, disabled or killed,” he said quietly Hands: "Compared to those mortals, even us, we must love our disciples, let alone you. The relationship between us is sometimes more intimate than the father and son, look at it, even in front of the temple of Tyre Such a law, The disciple's disciple can inherit all his assets if the tutor has no other orthodox heirs. Even if there are, then those who have magic are also inherited by the disciples of the tutor... We are different, Kudus You must admit this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My disciples are not many," Ostar followed. "But will you not recognize them?" Lucus, watching you attentively, observing the extent of their waving arms, listening to the way they change the syllables, even the way they tear the scrolls and break the wand, don’t you even notice the clues? ? No, you can, each caster has his own habits, and they will not consciously bring out a little after they teach their disciples, and their disciples will inevitably transfer them to their disciples after inheriting their characteristics. I can find your child from one hundred casters, you can, then, Luluus, tell me, do you think there is a trace of Beavis on that child? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want me to do? "There was finally a saying that his mouth was tight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, right?" Austal did not answer the question of Balus. "You didn't find the part of Beavis from Kremar, and according to himself, it took me a few years to leave Beavis. A young, wizard who just left his mentor can do this. Establish your own habits and styles in a short time? No! So how did he get the magic mark of Beavis? You know, three people have checked this mark. The guard of the White Tower may be excluded. He is just a mortal. So, Master Alva and the Master of the East Crown Lord of the Dragon Fire Island? Are they blinded or perceived? And what kind of treasures that Beavis wouldn't have known, even those that were not discovered by a real lich? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, now I have to wonder if the little guy is really a disciple of Beavis. You think, of course, in addition to this speculation, there is another speculation to be more credible. "Austal said that while he was throwing a piece of sulphur into the fragrant boat, a smoky slammed up, and Lulus shouted in a panic, retracting the finger that was about to touch a magical text: "Let's talk," said the red robe warrior. "The soul is not so good. Look, you are not interested in the next content." I can send you back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak your request! "The mage's wandering voice shouted, if he is still alive, he will be ashamed of his own embarrassment, and even struggle to give up his life. But as Austal said, after he was killed, The soul is brought to a hot and evil place, where he has suffered numerous tortures and ridicules, and the most beautiful and precious of his souls have been destroyed. Only those who he thought he had long abandoned were left behind. Weakness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No request, 牟Lus," said Aostal: "Let's continue talking, 牟Lus, your disciple will Bevis All his remaining life is spent on meaningless revenge. Maybe he thinks it is worth it. But for more than a decade he can be said to be in vain, and as far as the traces he left during his stay, he does not seem to have had an apprentice or It is a disciple, everyone who sees him... Oh, Luluth. Don't stare at me like this. I didn't have time to pay attention to an ordinary mage before. Although he is also excellent, but a human being, his life is destined to never climb the summit we can reach. Fortunately, He at least knows where to go to find a lich, the seventy-seven islands, and among the seventy-seven islands, there are many friends of Grenada, they can be said to be quite lonely. Humans are rarely seen on the territory, so even after several years have passed, they can still recall something, and there has never been another human being around Beavis. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That again...how? "The road is indifferent:" Beavis has left. He will never come back, he has no children. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to the previous question," Ostall said: "How was the magic mark of Beavis leaked out?" Only the disciples who have signed a contract with the instructor can get the mark... Or, have you heard that the Lichs have a spell called Advanced Discovery? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;牟路斯 looked up, the condensed body of the smoke produced a slight invisible distortion, and Austal seemed to have never found this strange Situation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have talked face to face with the most powerful lich. There are still a few lichs who have always been my most loyal customers," Austal lowered his voice. "So I have a certain way of doing things for them." Understand that Beavis' enemies are not prominent among the lichs. They can even be said to be a little mediocre. There are many eternal casters who are not satisfied with his acting methods. He believes that he succeeded in pulling down with his own power. The IQ and taste of a whole seventy-seven archipelago (it’s really a bad thing to say), especially since he was entangled by a human caster for so many years, he couldn’t kill him, so... they sent a second A lich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the spurs trembled fiercely, and the smoke that was regularly entangled was disordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The outsider only knows that the lich was killed by Beavis, then Beavis, he is the last curse of the undead, or give up on his own Life is possible, but the biggest possibility is that he died in the hands of another lich, which explains very well so far, no one can find the soul of Beavis, whether it is mourning the wilderness or something else. Where he disappeared, disappeared, as if it never existed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think he will go there?" Austal finally asked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cremar is not a lich." Lulus replied hoarsely, his body was completely unshaped and looked more like a deformity. The demon, or the potted plant that is full of fangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Austal nodded. "Otherwise, it is impossible to walk with an elf, especially if the elf carries him like The mother of the chicken carries its chick but I think you must really want to know where the imprint spell was learned from him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want this secret "牟牟斯 said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal is a bit regrettable. If he is still a living person, he may have been convinced by him, but after becoming a wandering soul, negative energy will Let him become evil and embarrassed: "I will give you some freedom for a while, Lucus," he leaned forward. "In this time, I promise that no other warlock will call you to work for them." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am working for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you must say this "Austal said: "But what you have to do is very simple, 牟Lus, I just want you to follow them, tightly, don't leave, watch them, monitor them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And return to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't do it," Ostal said generously. "I can look for other souls." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will also ask for compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only want the king, the caster, and the elf "You can take it away." Austal made a gesture. "That's it, don't try to irritate me. It will be a very long time. For the wandering soul bound by our 'mother', It’s a very good reward. It’s not a good thing to be greedy. If you make me have to summon another soul, I will torture you until you scream like crazy when you are still alive.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master’s wandering soul has apparently cringed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will follow them," said Luluth, "When did it start and when did it end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the next moment," Ostal said: "After I get the message I need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "There was a sigh of relief, and he disappeared from the smoke." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The main plane is always full of countless idiots." Ostal said, reaching out to extinguish the fragrant boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to White Tower, Bibi Dibao and Grenada, the East Coast side of the Dragon Fire Island has fallen into a strange calm. Among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan has got a new message from Kremar, and after hearing the departure time, he can't help but sigh, and hit the black hair caster. On the day of the Jianjian Port, Gülen’s baby has been not very good, being blackmailed, threatened, betrayed, fighting with orcs, fighting humans, fighting with deformed monsters, fighting with half-devils, fighting with pirates, and The Master and the Warlock fight, even as a bloodthirsty thief, he also felt that he should take a good rest for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei had the same thoughts as him. "I am a Pastor Fro!" She shouted at Glan more than once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
