			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the middle of the Longji Mountains began to cover a layer of hoarfrost, there was a tall and ugly warrior outside of Doring, she had The twilight and hair color that are very common among men, and the thick skeleton. In the south, this woman may be regarded as a monster, but it is very common in Norman, but her skin is smoother than her child. Let the guards hesitate for a while, they looked at the woman, from her dress to the luggage, the elf did not allow the ugly chicken to enter the silver crown jungle, but they gave the brave human female all generously all they thought she would need Something - but most of them have been replaced by Perant and Kerry Ben, as well as some elves who have traveled all the year round, because the clothes and accessories that can only be seen on the elves, and the weapons will only give the ugly chicken. Brings a fatal disaster. Even so, those silky silk fabrics, delicate leather goods and a knife from the orcs (yes, the ugly chicken's own spoils, the elves have a fish skin sheath), let the guards produce A little awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you from?" they asked routinely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gul." The ugly chicken said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is Gul?" The guard asked vigilantly: "We never seem to have heard this name."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it is too ridiculous," said the ugly chicken. "But our lord is the nephew of the niece of your nephew's nephew's nephew. And I am the daughter of his daughter, I am coming. Here is to send important letters and gifts to the relationship between relatives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard looked down and thought about the uncle's second sister... ...and so on, he didn't know if the stranger was cheating on her, but since she said that she was coming to see the noble lady, then the lord's uncle would not know if she had this relative - say To be honest, the relationship between the aristocrats and the marriage of each other was really a headache for ordinary people, so he quickly called the garrison captain, and then the garrison captain and a team of soldiers "escort" responsible for escorting the ugly chicken to the fortress. In a small house on the periphery - in an unidentified Under the condition, of course they can not directly to the front of the ugly chicken lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only in the past few years, the identity of the wife may not be as important, for the people of the multilingual, she is only the brother of the city, the wife of the husband and Daughter's mother, but after the disappearance of Mullen Lorenos, the respectable woman took on the responsibility that should not be borne by women - she firmly denied that Mullen was dead and more A tough attitude ousted the three singers who bought the Dorothy dominion from the unscrupulous Norman king John. One time they were even forced to fight a battle against the city. Of course, the multi-spirited people won, although suffered To the terrible threat (the despicable bastard threatened to sell every daring man who was daring to be a slave), but they persisted, and now the Lady Lorenno fulfills all the duties of a city owner and Having the same power, she has been assassinated several times for this purpose - perhaps for people who want to get more spirits, or for Norman. Fortunately, the latter has no way to mobilize the army to punish this dare to disobey. The woman of the king, now Norman is full of fissures - more people than Mrs. Lorenos are more arrogant and arrogant, their knights and soldiers are more adequate and dangerous than a woman who only has this city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have any tokens?" The garrison captain said gently, maybe someone would wonder why a lord's daughter would have such an ugly maid, but he could From the smell of ugly chicken to smell the sword and the smell of blood, this woman is not an ordinary woman with no power, and Norman’s noble woman often has such a maid, in order to ensure her safety, let alone A strong and good-natured maid can sometimes play an unexpected role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give this letter to my wife." The ugly chicken said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter was identified as non-toxic and did not have a curse, and soon arrived in the hands of Mrs. Lorenos, although she did not remember whether she had this relative. But she only slightly swept, and found that the lacquer stamp on the letter tube was nothing else. It was the coat of arms of the young lord of the sorrow. She felt an ecstasy and then became depressed because the size of the coat of arms was obviously not Mullen. Leaving the heraldic ring, she picked up her own heraldry pendant and found that it was something they had given to a friend—after the plague almost destroyed the entire multi-spirit, Mullen presented the three coats of arms to the master and benefactor of the city - His Royal Highness Princess Liona, the Elf Ranger Kerry Ben, and the half-elf pedigree Master Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garrison captain watched his mistress take out the letter, she did not reveal any suspicion, just like it was indeed an insignificant relative The greeting letter, but she looked twice, then she looked up, "Let the lady come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit down." Mrs. Lorenos said slyly, the ugly chicken sat down on a chair. The seat and the armrests of the chair were covered with goose down satin. It should be said that it should be very comfortable, but the ugly chicken test A few times, I found out that it couldn't hold her own butt. Before the lady ordered her maid to take a bigger chair, she simply abandoned the chair and sat down on the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You all retreat," said the lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But let Mr. accompany you." The maid said - the ugly chicken's weapon was left outside the room, the problem was to look at her thick arm alone. It would be a difficult thing to know that she had to twist her lady's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady nodded her permission, the wizard was a multi-linger, and his mentor was Gavin, who was originally played by the lord of the Thunderbolt, Birdwin, this young People are still trustworthy, and he is very intelligent. Although he has been left behind, he has not stood upright and puts on a posture of "I think you are an assassin", but walks to the desk at one side. Down, just in the lady and the ugly chicken (may be closer to the ugly chicken), about ** feet are enough to let him cast a spell already stored in the rune seal, even if the devil eats this It's a bit unbearable, but on the surface, he seems to be just a clerk. He has ink and parchment in front of him, like to record the conversation between the ugly chicken and his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then what he heard almost made him jump literally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the Norman’s enemies are using Norman’s people to produce more enemies.” The lady calmly said that she was already on the elf’s letter. I saw it, so I can barely keep calm. "Is the lord of Thunderbolt, Dylan Donkley already aware of this important message?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't know," said the ugly chicken. "But it is said that he is now in the kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what about Thunderbolt?" The lady asked in surprise: " The autumn is short, the winter is coming, the invasion of the orcs is close at hand, and the lord of Thunderbolt is still in the kingdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know very well "The ability to get this information is also attributed to the elves, the ugly chicken shook his head, and then she heard the lady ask the people who had escaped from the orc's minions with her, and could not help but show a sad and hateful look: "They, they are all dead, ma'am," she said. "They are hanging on the wall. From the skull down, almost all of them are skeletons. The generation managers of Thunder Castle tell people that they are the spies of the orcs.” Only one woman was locked in the cage, and the elves guessed that it might be to lure the ugly chicken. She did go to Thunderbolt, or heard about it, appearing in the crowds for the sake of proof or other reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the ugly chicken came to Doring, she weaved a little lie. She did not return to her village. She didn't even touch the edge of the land. On the way, even if the city and the village were close at hand, she would rather rest and find water in the wilderness and jungle, even though it meant her. She must fight against the beast, but she knows that mankind is much more terrible than the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage looks at his wife, and the spirit is far from the king, farther away from the Thunderbolt, but they are too close to the southern countries. It is. "Can we hope that Deron Don Clay of Thunderbolt can pay attention to this news?" he muttered in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady is looking at the ugly chicken, she is also heard about the chaos of the Thunder Castle today, because the Dorsett is also a commercial city, the businessmen who come and go complain more than once The greed of the generation manager, and the jazz who forced the inclusion of Mrs. Dolling and Mrs. Lorenos into the bag also mentioned that he would sell those who dare to defy him to the orcs, and also merchants. Seeing his wife, ask if she wants to sell the soldiers captured in the battle - even before, this can not be said to be a rare thing, the 骑士, the knight and the lord will be redeemed, but the ordinary soldiers are all The property is on oneself. If they have a wealthy relative, they will not be willing to do a consumable in the battle, but if they stay, many lords will doubt their loyalty, and not every village. They are willing to accept outsiders, especially those who have looted and slaughtered them. Therefore, it seems to be the best choice to exchange these standard chicken ribs for some shiny gold coins. But at that time, they will only be sent to the Norman lords who have no connection with this battle. Although they may not be able to survive for a long time as serfs, they are better than being food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Norman's people, the wife even hopes that the victory of the previous year should not come so easily. Although she is a woman, she knows some men, especially like A young man like Dylan Donkre, who has a high weight and possesses the talent of the caster, is almost born to be at the top of glory. He is not Morton Donkley, nor is it Bidwin Donkley... even Bird. Wen. Tang Cray, twenty years of hard work, but also once lost the Thunderbolt, if not to destroy the entire city as a last resort, the orcs may have entered the Norman's hinterland on the Norman bones like a wolf It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
