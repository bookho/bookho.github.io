			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they doing?" asked the governor of Longshan State. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray, and..." An older mage around him replied solemnly: "The sacrifice."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gredi's priests prayed and sacrificed to their god, Red Dragon, on an empty field, and hundreds of people were sacrificed at the Obsidian Festival. On the stage, the blood flows down from the blood trough reserved by the altar and flows into the soil, while the followers of Greedy, including the young red dragon, have removed all the obstructions, and they show them without shame. Their graceful and long body, centered on the red dragon of human form, six high-ranking priests violently jumped and steadily rotated, red or reddish-brown long hair violently shaking, the daggers in their hands flashing cold, Squeaking in the air is like fighting a presence that people can't see or screaming loudly in a dragon language. This practice puts a huge burden on the throat of the dragons other than the red dragon. The sounds from those throats quickly become hoarse and broken, blood from their lips and tongues Splash out, but this is undoubtedly please the goddess who terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle-headed lion beast, and the fearing claws are restless, grinding their claws, shaking their heads, and the mercenaries stand wisely in the distance Watching them, only those who know nothing about these monsters will approach them at this time. After the restless shackles expand, the knights of dragon teeth and dragon claws have to personally appease them. The residue left after the sacrifice—that is, the last thing left by the unfortunate humans on this plane, was thrown at these evil creatures with sharp claws. After hesitating for a moment, they began to tear with vigilance. Crack their food today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?" The governor of Longshan State whispered to himself, some people saw their enemies fall into chaos I will be glad, but he is very clear that if there is anything that will make these monsters feel uneasy, then they will only bring greater panic and danger to the people of the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master moved his lips, his voice was not captured by the Archon, but there is no need for it, the Archon, and the soldiers on the walls. The knights, the lawmakers, have already seen the suddenly raised ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing people see is a stone pillar. It is like a rectangle that has been carved by people. About one person is so thick and so tall. Then around it, there are four places where the land is also swaying, and the priests of Greed are staring at them with enthusiasm and excitement, and the legion has slowly retreated to give up a wider flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich gently licked his tongue, until today, he had a clear understanding of the power of Grety, if possible, he hoped that he The long redemption career did not include an enemy of this noble and old lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five pillars now, their heights are almost the same, the soil is like a life flipping, the earth is undulating, the small animals and insects hidden in the grass They fled and even let people's eyes be disturbed, but the most helpless is the dust that covers the earth. The wind here can easily blow away a weak one. Warlocks, they constantly blow away dust, but underground things are constantly creating new dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the pillars rise to the point where people need to look up, their identity can already be identified by any caster who does not sleep during the tutor’s lecture. Come out - the five stone pillars are not just stone pillars. They are connected with wide palms and thick arms underneath. The arms, which are also aggregated by large and small stones, extend out of the ground and are bent over. On the ground, the ground was thus sagged, but it quickly climbed up with this support—it left a bottomless cave like a big mouth connected to the esophagus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a soil elemental creature." The Master around the governor of Longshan State said bitterly: "But I was the first to see such a large earth elemental creature. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth elemental creature is the same as other elemental creatures, and there is no difference in the camp. They can serve any summoner, if there is a difference. That is, earth elemental creatures are more lazy than other elemental creatures. You will find water elemental creatures in some deep seas, lakes and rivers. You can also detect the traces of wind elemental creatures in the whirlwinds all day long, and lively. Fire elemental creatures may even appear in fireplaces with a certain number of years, but earth elemental creatures, unless summoned, are only occasionally encountered by dwarves who are good at and willing to dig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The trebuchet is ready"The governor of Longshan State said<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than one earth elemental creature like this. The priests of Greedy summoned three, and the two slowly and firmly squirmed toward the wall. At that time, one took the slinger of Grenada and put it on his body with a light movement that was completely out of proportion to its body. It was like a movable mountain, carrying these Heavy machinery climbs forward - of course, if they just look out from the sky, they seem to be slow, but only those standing next to them can know that their huge bodies are destined to behave faster than running horses. Faster<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two earth elemental creatures approached the city wall, the trebuchet of Longshan State issued an anger, and these trebuchets were more than the trebuchets of Grenada. Tall, tougher, and less manpower on the top. After all, they are all the works of the dwarves. Unlike other countries that have been paralyzed by Grenada, the Longshan state has not stopped the reserve of ordnance. On the long wall, every protruding corner stands a trebuchet. The people of the state use not even polished round stones, but a mixture of gravel and a kind of melt. It is like another The plane's concrete, which is also doped with iron slag, is smaller than the stone, but heavier and more damaging. This can leave a stone elemental creature after each stone bomb is thrown. Deep pits can be seen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the Lich said, the earth creatures summoned by the priests of the Great are too big, and the stone bullets even shattered one of them. Half of the head, and the other arm, but still can not stop their pace - they bowed slightly, hit the wall ... once, once again, the stone rolled down, wrapped in tons of soil There were cracks on the huge stone bricks of the city wall, especially some places where the wall was set up (for shooting). The stone bricks were broken into the hollow, and the soldiers who had not had time to withdraw from it screamed, the monk of the state. They waved their arms and cast spells. The water flowing from the sky hit the earth creatures, and their movements caused a slight stagnation—“Continue!” the older mentor shouted, “We need to make rivers!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at the moment the earth elemental creatures appeared, they have already begun to prepare the spell, but the casting process of this spell is undoubtedly quite lengthy - one with water Elemental creature The magician's warlock kissed his friend, like the water elemental creature of the two-winged fish, screaming a few times, quickly plunging into the ground from the footwork of the earth elemental creature, the power of magic in the air. Trembling, supporting it, it eagerly crossed the sand, crossed the rock, and led the dark river under the rock to the tenters of the casters, the tentacles entwined the water, and led them to the ground<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of the earth elemental creatures produces a real lag, they are retreating, the earth elemental creatures will not melt in the water, and in the case of compulsion, Walking on the bottom of the water, but now they are not without choice - the soil under their feet becomes wet, black, and the body of the earth creatures sag down, they squeak, like the depths of the tortuous tunnel. The humming sound, the rumble of the earthquake, the squeaking of the stones and the stones, they hate the water, and the damp and soft ground, but for a while, they were violently washed by a new river.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the city of Longshan, at the beginning, there was a moat, but like the original wall, these moats could not be connected to each other, so After the merchants had been negotiating, they dug a wide ditch on the outer edge of the new city wall and filled it with the floating soil that is most easily melted in the water. When people and horses walked on it, there would be no collapse or other danger. But as long as there is enough water to wash them, they will become a watery moat<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth elemental creatures retreat in the roar, the faces of the people of the state are smiling, new dangers appear again, and the trebuchets of Grenada stand tall On the back of the last earth elemental creature, it is not much lower than the trebuchet at the top of the city wall, and unlike the trebuchet manipulators of the state, their manipulators are hill giants, one of them can be compared with ten people. Comparable, and when humans are busy throwing stone bombs, the Grinada people throw out the white phosphorus bombs that make the Lich a bit familiar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jar containing white phosphorus shattered on the wall, everything it touched was burning, wood, iron, stone, human, treated by warlocks The temperature of white phosphorus can instantly melt a human flesh completely, or instantly burnt black and corrode a piece of hard wood. Even weapons can be deformed and distorted by extreme heat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also produced a lot of smoke, a mage’s apprentice rushed out of the smoke, his mentor grabbed him, the child was not injured, but he was When the instructor touched him, he fell down. He seemed to want to shout, but there was a thick liquid pouring from his nose and mouth, and his eyes were like a layer of tulle. Unclear, this layer of tulle is getting thicker and thicker. In the end, he is shrouded in darkness... The pastor around his mentor is elderly and travels all the year round. He only knows what happened after a glance, he will A healing theology throws a spell on the child whose eyes have been covered by white, and throws a spell to himself. So everyone within 100 feet "hears" his shout, reminding people not to Stay in the smoke because they are toxic<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
