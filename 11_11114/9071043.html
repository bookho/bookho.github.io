Take that group or a lot of small creatures from the shadow cast by the ship, but always being disturbed will bring a lot of troubles, such as the elves who are not allowed to disturb the waters in normal times. With this rare opportunity to hold them in their arms, the two children in the white face are counted, the white face is the father... No, the water is smashed, it needs an adult male leeches. Dignity, what is the matter of being caught in the belly of your hand and being caught by your chin and stomach? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that it will refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more elves coming to the Grey Ridge. They come from all directions and bring a lot of good things. They smell very bad from the smell. Good fermented shark meat to the wild boared pork baked with honey, as well as salty and shredded shrimp, they also have dried fish to give a white face, but unfortunately no one can always wear a white robe than that. The black hair is half-human, and although the white-faced wife and the child feel very good, the white face believes in her tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White-faced wife moved, in this dark and warm lair, in addition to the white-faced couple, there are two of their children, among them The big man who was born in the white robe black hair has not left yet. It also specially took the children out and showed them to them. Now its eldest son has already faded the milky white fluff and replaced it with a layer of grayish black. Fine hair, it has to change the color of the coat to show the enviable dark brown color of the white face and the white face of the wife - the smaller one was born after the semi-humans left, I do not know why this white face The wife of the child still only gave birth to one, but it was as strong as its brother, but unfortunately the half man could not see it - it was a white group when it was not open, and it was curled up. The time is exactly an inflated dough, and if that half man sees it will be very happy. The white face knows that he loves this more than any elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few months, gray-black hair has replaced some of the white hair, making the smallest otter look like a layer of ash, but It is also very cute. This point from the three otters in the nest is always eager to see for its bristles - it is also awakened by the sound of the flying wing when landing, although the flying wing has been lighter than other ships More, but the heavy anchors were thrown into the Starlight River, the dull clinking sounds when hitting the rocks at the bottom of the river, and the regular slaps of the Star River's currents as they hit the hull. It is impossible to hear the otters that live on the river beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," said an elf when he jumped from the winged ship. "Are we bothering you, white face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a white face The otters stand upright on the river beach. When the elves fly up and down the wing, they don't need the springboard like humans. When they fall down, they are like flying feathers. When they jump, they are like being blown by the wind. The white face is seriously Among them, the magical star river traversed the sky, and the mortal can't see the dark blue sky. The Starlight River is illuminated by them. As its name suggests, every wave of water is covered with thousands of stars. The elves' flying wing ships are like moored in the Milky Way. The elves who are going up and down are like the messengers of the gods. They are covered with a transparent layer of starlight, and their eyes are bright and clean like gems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s waiting for Crimmar," said one elf, and the other two elves laughed happily: "It seems that it likes grams very much." What about Rimal's small fish?" "But we also grilled the dried fish for it." "Maybe because we didn't sit on the ground and share it with it, the white face might take Cremari as its Brother." "If you calculate according to the ratio, it is almost the same."...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some elves who have never returned to the Grey Ridge and the Silver Crown in a few years. Some people have heard from friends' letters that a cute little friend has come to Gray Ridge. Some of them are completely new to this name. For this reason, they can't help asking, and their friends are always embarrassed to explain in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then he is now with Kerry Ben."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the previous year Going to the Thunderbolt service together. They will not leave again.” An elf sighed slightly: “Although this is not from their intentions.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also heard a little about Baldwin," said the elf who had been outside for decades, enough for a human being to become a grandfather from a baby. "But I have heard that they have already gone to the Long Fire Island. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the arm of Birdwin." His friend said: "Specific you may be able to ask Kerry Ben."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, according to the prior agreement, he should also arrive in the gray tonight Ridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as they spoke, another swan-like elegant white-winged flying ship slowly landed on the blue-green starlight river with strong wind elements. The exquisite skills of the elves made the difference between the first ship and the second ship only a milliliter. They are so close, like a reflection in a mirror. After the flying wing and the sail are down, the elves are on board. Falling down in turn, just talking about Kerry's elf, I found a dark green cloak embroidered with the emblem of Su Lun. "Kerry is back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;All the elves still stranded on the river beach turned and looked at them. When they saw the elves falling on the pebbles and pulled down their hoods, they showed a more beautiful pale blond hair and a beautiful face than the moonlight. Involuntarily, fortunately, although in the silver crown jungle, the identity of the royal family and the nobility more represented a responsibility than a right, but the elves all deeply and sincerely respect their king of the jungle, a thousand years ago In the catastrophe, his lover died for the jungle, leaving only Kerry Ben, who is still in the middle of it, and the only heir to the king of the jungle. Because of this, Kerry is not only unable to obtain any privileges and care, but also To accept far more than other elves Hone and discipline, although this can be said to be a special kind of father and king's love, but they can occasionally see a slight sorrow and apology from the king's eyes - sorrow to him even the lover gives him the only The souvenir can't be saved in the arms, apologizing for the fact that he can never be a true father to favor and pamper his own children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry couldn’t even live with his father for a long time, he and other adult elves would spend almost unlimited time outside the jungle. Make friends and peep into the enemy. The outside world can't escape their keen eyes. They bring back not only shark meat, dried pork or stinky cheese, but also precious weapons, materials, scrolls, talisman, and most valuable experience. The small gatherings they hold in their rooms every night are more to ensure that their people can get shelter from the jungle swamps and the Starlight River, and they will not be blinded by their eyes and ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention that every piece of information they receive will be compiled into a book by Perant, which is part of the King of the Night’s reading every night. More than humans. Even the king of the elves, who may have surpassed any living person on the mainland (excluding the dragon), can organize and comb the complex and broken lines, weave them into a clear page, and search for those It may be placed in front of a mortal person that he will also turn a blind eye to important clues. For thousands of years, the Silver Crown jungle has been following the path designated by the king, avoiding the swamp, or facing the crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the jungle put down the scrolls in his hand. The dense text on it is like tiny ants. The contents described in it can make everyone who sees it tremble, but for the king of the silver-crowned jungle, this is just a small drop. Water drops. What worries him is that these tiny water droplets are gathering together. Maybe in the near future, they will become streams, rivers and even tides. Their power will once again shake the whole continent. If the king of the jungle will power Let go, he can even see their future - something that the king of the elves, who is infinitely close to the demigod, can see... it devours all life, everything is destroyed and disordered, the stars fall, the earth breaks, The river is exhausted. The ocean is boiling - but it is not without hope, but that hope may need to be built on the bones of countless people, and it is such awkwardness and emptiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then. Just like every poem you and I can hear, there will be brave, but equally ridiculous is...they...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The branches and leaves of the silver-crowned tree swayed, and the wind ran through the branches and leaves, making a whistling sound like a tidal wave hitting the shore. They slammed the body of the King of the jungle violently. The long silver hair of his long knees and the silver-gray robes overlap behind him, just like his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not welcome. Said Ruiyite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so nice to see you still the same, dear sister.” The warlock who came without a visit said that he had a Bedwin meeting. I feel a familiar face, because the bard with this face won his favor at the White Tower's contest, and he was brought back to Thunder Fortress, and he was inexplicably there. The suspicious guy who disappeared in the fierce battle, his face was as pale as before, and the shadow under the eyes still made people feel that he had not slept for a few days, but that did not include Ruiyite, from the blood point of view, they may be closer than other warlocks. Anyway, one of them has to call the other brother, and the other person wants to call the other sister, but Ruiyi knows that this is just a kind of Camouflage, can be changed at any time according to the needs of the owner, like the ominous shadow, when he got a lot of contempt with this, and those who despise him are not the food of the devil, or the block Class-mounted The possibilities even the soul irreparable accident glass house, or occurred. Yes, in the tower of Grenada, the death that was not directly caught was an accident. No one would look for the murderer unless the stupid guy missed a mentor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of mistake, of course, her brother will not commit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should know that Baita is mine," said Ruiyite. "Dear brother." Although she would feel sick when she said the term, But before that, she had been disgusted by the title of this bastard. She couldn't help but fight back, but she soon regretted it, because this kind of counterattack may not be as good for her brother. And effectively exposed her jealousy and cringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not here for your white tower." The former bard said softly that his voice has changed and become less rich. But as clear and low as other casters, he also took off the decor of the bard and changed to wear a luxurious dark red velvet robe with a rune embroidered on the inside of the robe and a gemstone on the belt. Hanging a reel with a pouch, the long, wide sleeves cover his fingers, and Reyote can guarantee that his sleeve may have a pocket, and there are more in his robes, waist There must be no less than three wands in the fixed apron. After all, this is a warlock's usual equipment in Grenada. In comparison, she is much more shabby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that she doesn’t, her “tobacco” planted in the hills has already received her first harvest, and her majesty and warlocks have been deployed. A variety of medicines to make it into various forms, to ensure that it can be used most widely - there is tobacco, which is almost unnecessary to say, there are pills, in the wax coat, or as a potion, can be used as a resistance Various diseases, especially those caused by trauma; there are also pancakes mixed with honey and flour. The elves have had small cakes made of vine powder, which is very popular among merchants and mercenaries. Because it is not easy to spoil, and only a few points can fill the hunger, and their cake is better than the elf's cake, as long as they eat, they will not feel hungry, and they will feel the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They even told others in advance that it was a bit toxic, but for the poor civilians and mercenaries, the toxicity is far from covering its advantages. And, are those mandala flowers, those belladonna, those elderberries not toxic? As long as they can achieve their goals, are they not using them constantly? However, this will prevent a priest from Ilmot from being aware of what is wrong, but as long as a few years, three years, five years or seven years, less than ten years, they do not need to worry about this, these "tobacco" will Will let them have countless slaves and believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the wealth of the original merchants of Baita has already accumulated in her inner library, although a large part of it needs to be sent back to Grenada. However, she will not have too much objection if she extracts some of them. After all, the managers of other places do the same. The problem is that she is now in her bedroom. Baita can be said to be the safest and most dangerous place. Her bed was no less than a dragon's lair, but in this way, when she suddenly woke up from a nightmare, she saw that her brother was sitting at her feet, his wand was facing her, a fierce The spells are coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
