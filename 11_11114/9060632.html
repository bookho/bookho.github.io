			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found a very delicious handmade cookie shop that can search for Taobao: "Miao Lei Handmade Cookies" or "Miao Lei". There is an assorted cookie with more than 10 flavors, super delicious! It is very suitable to eat while reading a book! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman’s egg looks small in the distance, but in fact it has the size of another plane basketball, the root is connected like an umbilical cord The fixing cable, the gray-white fixing cable is very strong, and the end connected to the fisherman's egg disperses a lot of thin tendons, covering the whole egg, and the soul of the outer world reaches out and pulls it, and finds the other end of it deep. Deeply embedded with dark black stones, there is no way for him to pull it out at the first time. Of course, he does not want to pull it out. Who knows what it does, he doesn’t want to His own curiosity ruined a living little life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman's egg surface is smooth and elastic, the skin is translucent, thin and flexible, through which you can see the jelly like jellyfish inside. The gum contains luminescent components. The light of the fish's egg comes from this. The soul of the alien world rotates around it. His fingers gently touch one of them, and he is surprised to find that it is warm. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squid is almost the same as the air in the water that wipes the mage of the mage, but the speed of the harpoon seems to be completely absent. Affected by it, the black-eyed caster did not act like a deep water in hundreds of deep waters. He not only escaped the attack without warning, but also grabbed the weapon that attacked him. The steel harpoon is intentionally plated with iron powder, so it is hard to find its trace in deep black water. It has six sharp teeth, each with an ominous barb. ⊕,..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this may not be a sign of a small war, at best it can only be said to be a warning, because after a layer of fluctuations, there is No less than 50 fish people floated out of the deep darkness. The fisherman is not as sweet and lovely as the mermaid in another plane. In terms of appearance, it can even be said that it is a bit ugly and fierce. The upper part of the body and face. It is quite similar to humans. It's just the flat features, especially the fin-shaped outer ear. It can be said that it is close to the skull of their triangle. There are no traces of obvious scales on their skin. It is like a dolphin or a killer whale. The color is gray. The souls of the aliens are estimated to ensure that the fish that the predators do not find in their water in the deep water are generally not too bright unless they are toxic or spiked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have five rows of laterally split necks that are very thick, and the muscles of the arms and chest are quite impressive. They are proportional to their lower body. The souls of the different worlds still remember his square market in Bituminburg. I saw two fish people selling seaweed for clean water. If the fish people have a tail, the idea may not be realized, so they have separate legs, but their legs are relatively smooth compared to the upper body skin. The skin can only be described as rough with the sharp eyes of Cremaar to see the tiny shield scales. It is the kind of sharp scales on the shark. The scales are like touching a large grain of hard stone sandpaper. Their feet are as wide as a fishtail, and they have no toes and look like a flat piece. Only terrible hooks grow at the end, just like those with curved nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn't come here," said a fisherman. His voice sounds like a human old man, hoarse, low and slow. "This is ours." He also looks like an old man. His scales are white, his clefts are wide, his body is thin and small, and he needs a fisherman to support him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I remember correctly," the soul of the opposite world replied politely. "I am the owner of the side island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are many owners on the side of the island," said the old fisherman, who is more dense than other fishermen. The wrinkles trembled as he spoke: "But they all know that the bottom of the eyes of the sea god is the fisherman." He swayed his feet. "We are here longer than humans, and we are east." The crown lord is in service."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have not heard of this before I came here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe they forgot." The old fisherman said slowly: "But now I can tell the contract in detail to the place where you gave us spawning, and we can guarantee There will be no disgusting snakes on your island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Snake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The surprise of the black-eared caster made the fisher misunderstand. They thought that the new owner of the side island had not seen or heard of the snake, although they were confused. The person should know the value of a snake man), but he patiently popularized this knowledge for Kremar. The dragon island is a paradise for snakes when humans have not yet set foot in it, but a thousand years ago humans The catastrophe left the mainland and came here. The snake people are both vicious, but they are incomparable to humans anyway. The snakes quickly disappeared into the dense juice, and the rest Hunters who are not raised by humans into dogs are turned into a page on the recipe. Snakes are more like snakes than people. The places below their waists are not legs but snake tails. When those hungry mercenaries kill After a snake man, they quickly learned how to cook their enemies into a pot of hot soup,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are still some snake people who have sneaked into the deep villages of the jungle to survive. They often tow away those slaves. Although the flesh and blood of these slaves have an unpleasant smell of medicine, they are easy to catch, even young ones born two or three years old. The snakes and the aging, slow-moving elderly snakes can also easily grasp them, which makes the "Shantou" and the eunuchs have a headache, and the advantage of the side island is that it has the "eye of the sea god", the fisherman Physiological characteristics are destined that although they spend most of their fish in the sea, they must lay eggs in fresh water, wait for the eggs to hatch, and become small fishers before they can return to the sea. Most of the fish are in the silver waterfall. And the estuary of several other rivers to find safe spawning sites, but the flow of silver waterfalls is urgent, which is not conducive to the growth of fish eggs. The estuaries of other rivers gather a lot of humans, they will salvage fish eggs and treat it as A delicious treasure to sell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishermen around the side of the island can climb up the gap in the bottom of the island and then sneak into the lake to lay eggs, which is not only quiet, but also clear in water, there is still The rich fish is the fish that the black hair's caster saw before, and these fish are freshwater fish. The bone spurs are small and numerous, and the fat is not as thick as the outer sea fish, but they have nothing to watch out for except the speed. It is very suitable for the small fish people to try their teeth and claws, and when they return to the sea It can also minimize the distance, so the fish people have a contract with the owners of the previous side islands. The contract states that the fishermen will help the owner of the side island to drive out the wild snakes, who must allow them to lay eggs in the Eye of Poseidon without any disruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this contract does not seem to indicate that you can have it here." The soul of the outside world said that in fact he was touching the "child" of others. I’m a little embarrassed. If it’s not that the Lich insists on letting him stay, he may already be in his room now: “You can lay eggs here, but that’s it.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Humans are always so greedy," the old fisherman said in a fisherman's language: "The fishman is not rich," he replied in GM: "We may be able to find something for you." Tourmaline, and amber..." he said. While staring at the new owner of the side island with his murky eyes, this master may be more dangerous than any of the previous masters, because the other masters are mortal, unless they must, they will not want to dive so deep. The place is only to see the eggs of the fishermen, although they have asked the fishermen to offer: "Do you want to taste the fish eggs? Yes," the East Crown lord also has 20 dedications a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the soul from another plane almost makes his heart scream out. Fortunately, it stopped in time, but this does not prevent it from fantasizing the taste of the fish eggs, although it is also a bit disgusting. Because this feeling is a bit similar to eating a chicken that has not yet been shelled and a pink rat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an egg, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bigger egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever eaten? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, as a reward, the Lich said, but don’t think that is a good thing, the fisherman is the thief in the sea. Their lies are more abundant than the bubbles in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, the Lich ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishermen were very dissatisfied with the new contract proposed by the new owner of the side island. They shook their heads one by one, taking turns to beat their feet (in the fisherman) This means anger. "This is impossible." The old fisherman said: "We are not humans, nor snakes. We are not employed and will not be supported. The loyalty you want is not available." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you want to re-select a spawning ground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't In this way, the lord of the East Crown has given us," the old fisherman said: "You have not vetoed its rights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, side The island is exactly what he gave me, the entire side island," the black-haired caster said: "He did not mention that some of them need to be removed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "We can give you more mermaid eggs. The price of mermaid eggs on the mainland is five hundred gold coins. You can also use it to replace some of the things you need."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am not missing gold coins," said the soul of the alien world, and then he paused for the message the lich gave him: "And not everyone will be yours." The fish eggs that have been deceived are worthless in some people's eyes. They have no life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what you are saying." The old fisherman said in a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich smiled slightly in the sea, and he was somewhat worried that the soul of another plane could not understand him, but it can be said that he immediately understood the mystery. "These are unfertilized eggs," he said, and it caused a slight panic: "For you, or for those who really need fish eggs, unfertilized eggs don't make any sense, it's just An unprocessed meat scorpion," the soul of the alien world said in a statement: "Your real children are not these... eggs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand what you are saying." The old fisher insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world no longer says anything, but sticks out a finger and casts a small spell before the fishman can't react. The spell vibrates the ground. Pulling a piece of dark stone out of its original position and falling into the hand of the caster, the fish people suddenly panicked, and some of them even cast a harpoon, but the black-haired caster disappeared and the fish disappeared. Some of the forks pierced the eggs, some pierced more stones, and the fish made a sorrowful cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your child." The soul of the outside world said that he stretched his hand, and the fish people discovered that his spells made the harpoons The fact that the fish eggs can really penetrate into the stone is a lot of rupture, and the water has a slight astringency, but the fish people's expression is relaxed, like the fish eggs that are broken are not related to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older fishermen are always staring at the "stone" in the caster's hand, it looks like a stone, cold, irregular edges, take It is also heavy in the hands, but as long as it is compared with the real stone, it can immediately detect the clues. In any case, its weight is much lighter than the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s amazing, the souls of the outside world admire that the fish people’s eggs are like some fish, they are in vitro fertilized, and the eggs that are not fertilized are in the eyes of the fishermen. It’s just food, and pretending that they use the shiny, unfertilized eggs to hide the fertilized eggs that hatch the small fish. When humans or other creatures are confused by unfertilized eggs, their fertilized eggs have been solidified. Black blocky body fluid wraps into the bottom of the water. If the lich has not been deceived in this respect, today he will probably be confused by the attitude of these fishermen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishermen are reluctant to sign a new contract, and they should use this idea. If the new owner of the side island does not understand the fisherman, then he It may turn a blind eye to what these fishermen value most, and the fisher can use this freshwater spawning ground as long as they are cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Considering," the black-haired caster said, "I only ask you to work for me for a year."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish people whispered a whisper. "We agreed, the old fish said with anger, "but only one year. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete. "The soul of the outer world is easy to say.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
