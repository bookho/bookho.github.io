			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 52—Judges<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author has something to say:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous chapter has been slightly modified... ah, sorry, but it is recommended to take another look... that...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen is eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table is full of food, which is hard to believe that it is offered to a half-elf rather than a giant or a group of halflings, but it is suitable A rich lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closest thing to Anzhen is that her two favorite foods are meat rolls and mud cakes - the meat rolls are cut from very thin salty bacon. Wrapped with fresh meat, the process of roasting requires constant oiling and then cut into pieces for consumption; the mud cake sounds very ordinary, and even makes people feel a bit dirty, but in fact, it is A very extravagant sweet food with a core made of almonds, raisins and mixed cocoa fruit. The cake is quite dark in color, with whipped cream like snow-capped mountains and cocoa on top of the cream. Powder and honey, the three colors match it and make it look like a piece of snow that has been trampled. Its name comes from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these two, there are dried ham, fried cheese pieces, stewed chicken, squid soup, crab soup and boiled fruit pieces with bones. The wine for the meal is a black wine with blackberries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the young lord who can only be called a girl is elegant and decent. But the servants are often amazed, because she ate at the same time as other aristocratic women, but the food they eat is often twice or three times as much as they are, almost comparable to a knight, but still so thin. The beautiful figure of awkwardness - there are always people in private who can't get rid of her non-human mothers - they always do, all bad, abnormal, strange places will be pushed to the blood of her other half. Go up and be exaggerated and distorted without limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hidden argument that has never disappeared is like the whispering of a mouse on the beam at night, completely ignoring the attention of Anzhen, and will not let She was upset or annoyed. Her father told her a long time ago that this kind of discussion would accompany her for a whole life. Even if she is not a half-elf, she is also a woman, or too short, too impulsive, too Clumsy... Her enemies will spare no effort to smash her, and those who are full of sorrow will also provoke a problem in her, unless she is no longer the owner of the hills and white towers, no longer Have this great wealth and rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she turned to the fried cheese pieces and stewed chicken, the restaurant's door was pushed open, and one of the amphibious maids walked in lightly and silently - she knew that Anzhen didn't like to be disturbed while dining, but she still Come in, said that there must be something more important than food waiting for Anzhen to solve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elves want to meet with Yadel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Rosada Pastors," the maid said cautiously: "Kerry is an adult, and there is a young Master of Antonio and a black hair, called Kremar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The one who inherited the property of Beavis," said An Zhen. "I heard that it is also a good mage. Hey, I have not refused the reason for this request. I promised them, but the time is not too long. Please ask Antonio Master for your own discretion. - Ask Kerry if you want to dinner with me? Of course, there are his friends, but if they want to see me in the afternoon, please help me," she yawned: "This is my hard time." From the rest time that those members and businessmen had come back, I haven’t had a good nap for a few days.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid deeply bends down The knee said that she was obeying, and then she said, "There is one more thing," she said. "The Demon Master sent you a gift. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a great honor to be missed," said An Zhen, rubbing his finger on the linen napkin embroidered with a small rose: "What is this time?" "It's funny, she thought, since she came to the White Tower, the cousin who has always turned a blind eye to her has sent a few gifts, from a short hymn to a bunch of dew-stained roses to a furry little Cats and silk dresses with gold rims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon's gift was packed in a small bronze scorpion, wrapped in a sable fur, and the half-elf with a slender finger from the scorpion Take it out, it is a round amber that almost occupies half of her palm. It is extremely clear golden yellow inside and outside. There is no one-and-a-half-point impurity. The ebony bracket is connected with a secret that can adjust the length. The silver chain, the back of the bracket is engraved with the sacred emblem of the god of life - the amber as a lucky charm can avoid disease or plague, and the white tower at this moment is a perfect gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stroked for a while, put it next to the squid soup, and put it with the squid's lips: "Go tell Demon," Ampo Picking up the honey wine and drinking a big bit, said: "I like his gift very much," she rudely tapped the spoon on the plate with the crab: "Oh, still, you think," she seems to be unintentionally Said: "The previous thing related to Yadell, do you think I should tell him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creimal, Kerry Ben and Antonio Master followed the guards into the prison of the White Tower - on the way through a hustle and bustle The big kitchen, all kinds of kettles, pots, chopping boards and knives that are carefully suspended along the way, dogs and cats rushing through the mage's robes, the scoop handle and the barbecue fork protruding on the greasy wall But as soon as I left the kitchen, the noisy and heat disappeared. They quietly turned down a narrow step and walked into an oval room with some barrels, stools and long tables, light and A little voice came from the top of the room - there was a big hole, facing the well in the middle of the room, squatting up on the well, seeing the truss of iron and wood, hanging the bucket, and a few looks Very familiar claws, they turned back to the kitchen, just below it, the kitchen people can go directly from here to play on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world does not understand what the people who built the city are thinking about - the prison of the criminals is set in the inner city, the official residence of the consul Just below the lord's castle, there is a kitchen on the road to pass, and a well that can be used by the entire castle to drink the washed wells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brain is so beautiful that people can’t watch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They continue to go down, this time the stairs are only fifteen grids, the height of each grid is inconsistent, the short one is very suitable for halflings, the tall ones even the elves They all have to jump - Antonio Master is a personal class, and he is older than Alva Master of Bititelburg. Finally, it is entirely Krymar and Kerry Ben carrying one of his arms and carrying him down. Fortunately, although this step can kill a dozen patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder in height, considering that there are often guards dragging criminals up and down, it is quite wide in terms of width. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard lit the torches that were inserted into the wall, and the light and sound caused a slight commotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Tower’s prison is a long, dark corridor with hard walls on the walls and tops, the ground is rugged, and the left side is a Large or small caves with rusted and strong iron bars in the hole, you can smell a complex chilly stench without approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people are locked in the nakedness, or, in the inside, the caves of each big point - probably the carriage of the carriage Big, there are dozens of heads or more than two dozen feet, and the small cave, that is a cold hearth, the prisoner can only curl up like a fetus, his knees pressed against his chest, his head and his buttocks Sharp stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, no one in this place would think about the drainage facilities. The stolen goods discharged by the prisoners were all piled on themselves and on the ground, accumulating a thick and thick layer. The strange smell they smelled was from this. The people who are locked up here will soon be festered. If they are not dragged out and judged, they will die because of fever. The dead will still be with the living, and the living will breathe the dead. The corpse smells, the deceased draws the temperature of the living, the worms crawl up and down in their wounds until the cave is not enough, or the people in a cave are all dead, the guards will urge the new ones. The prisoners dragged them out and threw them away - at the end of the gallery, there was a cave that was said to go straight to the endless abyss, and the body could never hear any echo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests of Rosada were kept in the innermost, and as they passed through the prisons, the criminals inside struggled to make a few shots from the hollow chest. A syllable, trying to get some pity from them, most of the voices are calling the name of Antonio Master, and some people call the name of Kerry, and Krymal even heard someone shouting himself, he turned his head. Look, but can't find anyone. His eyes can see things in the faint dark night, but they can't penetrate the overlapping human body, and the guards follow behind them, with a clear and straightforward body language. Urge them to go inside as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are criminals?" Kremar asked, White Tower is not a city with a dense mouth, but is locked in this living hell. Two hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Part of it," the guard did not answer so reluctantly. He knew that the problem was raised by a caster: "There are some people who have committed madness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it not that there is a potion for treating madness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is The guard said, "But who can guarantee the madness will not happen again, even the venerable Demon Master can not be sure, so the best way is to shut them up, anyway, there is no innocent person here, "He meant to say: "Even the priest Yadel also killed his brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The author has something to say: thank you adults Generous reward!
