			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wire is rolling, not the arrow, but the black iron spears roaring out of the machinery made by the dwarves, their power is so large, It’s like an invisible hand that pushes the enemy trapped around the tower and the goblin’s head bursts open in an instant, and the orcs are entangled, and the giants yell in pain, trying to pull them out, but The barbs of the spear caught their bones and internal organs<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are giants holding spears and wanting to throw their spears back to their invisible enemies, but the dwarves have already anticipated this, the soldiers are pushing The machine that fired the spear rumbling and moving in the arrow tower, which covered the rock, was essentially a small door that could be opened and closed by a number of small doors that would not reveal a trace when closed. Can also withstand the assault of a giant, the giant who dared to rush to the tower again can only get more spears - they desperately retreat, with two or three spears, and then shot the arrows from those small mouths, There are some disputes in the parliament of the state on the arrow. Some people disapprove of it because they insist that only the evil generations like the Greinada people will do this, but Soon, they were convinced by another saying that Longshan is now facing the Grinada people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblins were the first to escape. They only saw the companions around them falling down. No goblin would go to the rainstorm with arrows. Check if it's really dead. When you find that you can't continue to get any benefit from humans, they can't escape faster than when they rushed up... If they don't hold some loot, Longshan The soldiers of the state are almost naked, the goblins are omnipotent, and even some soldiers have been cut off their hair or part of their limbs. The orcs and giants are hesitant. They are smarter than the goblins - Greiner There is no supervised team in the army, but they are...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, mankind has regained the advantage of the wall, and the human soldiers did not With the chaotic strikers of Reinada intertwined, the casters can let go, the flames and lightning strikes on the monster's body, the feet and the ears, and even the giants start to cringe back, just in This time, grid Rinada's white phosphorus bombs and gunpowder bullets once again passed through the air, cracking out the brilliant light on the barriers set up by the Masters and Warlocks of the Longshan State, and the monsters were not affected by the protection. Fatal blow<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon erected its wings, "is now," she said, echoing in the ears of every Grinada.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first goblin that ran down from the body of the earth elemental creature collapsed was the Dragonclaw Legion, and the goblins waved their hands in horror, hoping for those whole body armor The knights can see them, but neither the Deinonychus nor their masters have the slightest hint of stopping for these humble existences. The stabbing sword fixed on the saddle is shimmering in the bleak sky. The light, the dwarf goblin was trampled under the feet of the Deinonychus, and some of the more greedy goblins that fell in the back, as well as the orcs and giants, immediately turned to the body as soon as they saw the dragon claws, the human mage Flames and lightning, the spears and arrows of the soldiers, the swords of the knights are terrible, but in any case they are absolutely incomparable to the Dragon Claws of Grenada - the horrors of the latter are deeply imprinted on the monsters. In my heart, the line of defense that is continuous and continuous is constantly slamming, shaking, and will always break and collapse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat warlock throws a spell, a flaming sphere erupts in the mouth of the giant, and his mouth emits a thick black smoke, falling down – but like Such giants may have several dozens or more. Their greatest threat to human beings is their tall and strong, and the spears of mortal forces, unless they hit their eyes, will not be able to harm them at all; The orcs bowed their backs, using their own claws and teeth like a hyena or a jackal. They would bite the spears of the soldiers who slammed their mouths, and they would drag into the herd in the future. Once so, the poor The people have almost no chance to escape; the rest of the goblins are interspersed among these huge body companions, they are not willing to face the human arrows, and they are not willing to be trampled by the Deinonychus. These little ones The monsters are looking for gaps and gaps, but as soon as they jump into the crowd, they become sardines in the sardines.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too confusing"A dragon claw knight said<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't this what we need?" The warlock behind him said that on the wide ground covering the two recessed positions, the Knights of the Dragon Claws They are arranged in a simple cone array, the head of the spike is covered with warlocks, and the warlocks around the first head of the tip are their leaders. When the warlock leader raises his hand, the other warlocks are already done. With the preparation of the spell, although there have been drills before, but cautious, almost no warlock will care to remove the line of sight - the first three columns of warlocks throw a chain of lightning, in addition to killing the enemy, More is to cover the walls with dazzling light, human eyes will fall into the dark under the glare of white light, and the fourth column of warlocks will make the surrounding light dark, although the dragons can look directly at the flame like a dragon After that, the warlocks search for the position of the hostile caster with the help of spells or talents. Their leader will throw a magic on him, and then the other warlocks will concentrate and fight.  that place<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the warlocks threw the spells, the knights of the dragon claws had slightly lowered their eyes and tightened their legs. When the intense white light exploded in front of the eyes, the fine gold spikes embedded in the heels slammed into the fear. The claws of the claw dragon intentionally leave a gap, the pain makes these forelimbs short, but they have a pair of monsters that are strong to the deformed hind limbs. They jump fiercely, crossing the goblin and the orcs, and the hind legs are accurately falling on the mouth of the city wall or On the giant's back neck, sharp claws pierce the rock or the flesh, and then jump into the defensive soldiers before the humans have yet to react, or the giants try to get rid of them because of the pain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deinonychus only bit his head and bite the shoulder of a soldier, then he will tear it off from the shoulder to the arm, but half of the chest, but The beast that had used a rich meal before the battle was not eager to enjoy flesh and blood. Under the drive of the master, it turned to a human knight. His armor and wide sword showed that he was not an ordinary sergeant. He shouted and held it. The spear soldier gathered to his side, and the sharp-edged spear tip formed a dense circle in the body of the Devil's claw. The Devil's claws made a horrible threat, and a soldier stabbed before others in panic. The spear, the knight almost rushed out at the same time, the wide sword flashed, and cut off the spear that not only did not penetrate the enemy's body but was bitten by the deinonychus, followed by experience and vigilance. He rolled on the ground and returned to his soldiers. At this time, the fragments of the armor fell on the stone bricks, a crack extended from his back to the arm, and his rune in the tights hung. The sink became cold after a short period of hot, even if the knight It can be observed at this time, know that the most precious While this rune has been of no use<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human knight wants to stand up, but he finds that he can’t, the Rune’s protection doesn’t completely block the enemy’s blade, or that In a short moment, the knight slashed more than once, ruining his protective runes the previous or two times, and cutting his back and lungs for the last time, he could still hear and see, But he will soon die - his soldiers are trying to protect him, his powerful arm is holding him, he wants to take him to a safe place, but the Cavaliers can only see the soldiers who belong to him in front of him. One was cut off or torn open, but he breathed three times, and there was no other person in front of him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paw of the dragon claws reveals a scornful smile<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he wanted to make a wonderful ending, his mount suddenly jumped without warning, jumping from the top of the wall Above the cornice, the stone brick left a deep scratch under the paw of the Deinonychus, and in the original position of the knight, a flame was burning ominously - the knight of the dragon claw spit a sip and made a decisive Implied that he would not directly confront a mage - but his body suddenly disappeared, he fell to the ground, pressed a fat ram, screaming, still struggling to kick his own hoof<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then an invisible but sharp blade pierced the knight’s head, and he was silent, but full of hatred and unwillingness to die.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master reveals the trail. He didn’t leave the mentor’s tower for a long time, or, just to respond to the call of his home country, he left early, his mentor was This is very worrying and sad. He also knows that when he returns, many people are running away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out his Mithril dagger and made up the neck of the sheep, otherwise the people still have to face a mad after the spell expires. The Devil's Claw Dragon, the hot blood immersed his fingers, and rendered a bright trace on the sheep's white fur. The Master turned his head and wondered that he did not hesitate or fear because of the tangible death. "I am not a cruel man.He said to himself, but his heart was filled with a thirst for killing. He pointed to a giant who was climbing the battlements, read a spell, and the power rushed out from his fingertips, throwing the strong body high. And thrown into the air<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little regret passed over my heart because he could not see the bloodHis companion saw that the wizard was approaching the enemy quickly. He shouted, but the latter did not seem to hear it. He constantly throws invisible sharp edges to the people of Grenada, and each shot can be brought up. The stratified blood flower, he did not reserve a spell, and did not have the power, a strong impulse occupied his mind, his companion wanted to help him, but the three dragon-claw knights kept him firmly in place, Let him move<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage found himself exhausted, and when the spell was exhausted, he had already been deeply encircled. He looked up a little, his rune flashed, and he was protecting the spell. After being broken, he was immediately swallowed up by a group of orcs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his companion, with a spell filled with transparent viscous material in some areas, got rid of the enemies around him, three dragon-claw knights, several goblins, There is also an orc who is full of anger in this area to move, but no matter what kind of movement, it is slow like a snail or a turtle, he carefully retreats two steps, gasping, looking around When he found out that his friend had disappeared, his eyes passed a bit of hard-to-disguise pain, but it was very short--he immediately noticed that a dragon-claw knight’s squad was concentrating on attacking a group of city-state soldiers, so he put his fingers Set up a triangle, this spell will produce a flame shield<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
