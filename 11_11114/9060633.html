The soul of the outer world reaches out and pulls it and finds it. The other end is deeply embedded in the dark black stone, and even his power can't even pull it out the first time - of course, he doesn't want to pull it out, who knows what it does. However, he does not want to ruin a living little life because of his own curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman's egg surface is smooth and elastic, the skin is translucent, thin and flexible, through which you can see the jelly like jellyfish inside. The gum contains luminescent components. The light of the fish's egg comes from this. The soul of the alien world rotates around it. His fingers gently touch one of them, and he is surprised to find that it is warm. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Be careful, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A harpoon almost flies past the mage's cheeks - the resistance of the water is much more than the air, but the speed of the harpoon seems to be Absolutely unaffected by it, the black-eyed caster does not act like a deep underwater in hundreds of deep waters. He not only escapes the unwarranted attack, but also catches the weapon that attacked him. - The harpoon of the handle is intentionally plated with iron powder, so it is hard to find its trace in deep black water. It has six teeth, each with an ominous barb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this may not be a sign of a small war, at best it can only be said to be a warning, because after a layer of fluctuations, there are no fewer than 50 The fisherman floated out of the deep darkness—the fisherman was not as sweet and lovely as the mermaid in another plane. In terms of appearance, it could even be said to be a bit ugly and fierce—the upper part of the body and face. It is quite similar to humans, but the facial features are flat, especially the fin-shaped outer ear. It can be said that they are close to their triangular skulls, and there are no obvious scales on their skin. It is like a dolphin or a killer whale. It is dark and dark. The soul of the outside world is estimated to ensure that the predators will not find them in the water at once. The fish in the deep water are generally Not too bright unless they are toxic or spiked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five rows of laterally split necks that are very thick. The muscles of the arms and chest are quite impressive, and in proportion to their lower body, the soul of the outside world remembers that he saw two fishermen selling water at the square market in Bibi Dibao. The seaweed used, if the fish people have a tail, the idea may not be realized, so they have separate legs. But compared to the relatively smooth upper body skin, their leg skin can only be described as rough - Krimaar's sharp eyes can see the tiny shield scales, which are the sharp ones of the sharks. Scales, the scales touched like a sturdy sandpaper that touches a large grain. Their feet are as wide as a fishtail, and they have no toes. They look like flat pieces, only terrible hooks grow at the ends. Just like those with curved nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shouldn't come here," said a fish man. His voice sounds like a human old man, hoarse, low and slow. "This is ours." He also looks like an old man. His scales are white, his clefts are wide, his body is thin, he still needs A fisherman can support and stand firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I remember correctly," the soul of the opposite world replied politely, "I am the master of the side island."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are many owners on the side of the island," said the old fisherman. The denser wrinkles than other fishermen tremble as he whispers: "But they all know that the bottom of the eyes of the sea god is the fisherman." He swayed his feet. "Our time here." Longer than humans, and we serve the Lord of the East Crown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not heard of this before I came here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe they forgot," the old fisherman said slowly: "But now I can tell you this contract in detail - you Give us the place to lay eggs. And we can guarantee that there will be no disgusting snakes on your island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Snake?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the black hair caster surprised the fisherman, they thought that the new owner of the side island had not seen or heard of the snake, although they felt Confused (a caster should know the value of a snake), but he patiently popularized this knowledge for Kremar - Dragon When man has not set foot in the archipelago where the snake is a paradise for people, but a thousand years ago as a major human catastrophe left the mainland, come here. Snakes are both vicious, but they are incomparable to humans anyway. The snakes quickly disappeared into the dense sap, and the rest were not hunters that were raised by humans. It became a page on the recipe—the snakes are more like snakes than people. The place below their waist is not the legs but the snake tail. When the hungry mercenaries kill a snake, they quickly become unsuccessful. Through how to stew their enemies into a pot of hot soup,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but still some snake people sneak into the deep jungle village to survive, they often drag Take those slaves, although the flesh and blood of these slaves have an unpleasant smell of medicine, but the victory is easy to catch, even the young snakes and aging people who have just been born for two or three years, the slow-moving elderly snakes can easily catch them. This makes the "Shantou" and the eunuchs have a headache, and the advantage of the side island is that it has the "eye of the sea god", and the physiological characteristics of the fishermen are destined to spend more than half of their fish in the sea. Raw, but they must be in fresh water Spawning, waiting for eggs to hatch, and turning into small fish before returning to the sea - most fish people are looking for safe spawning sites at the entrance to the Silver Falls and several other rivers, but the Silver Falls are rushing. It is not conducive to the growth of fish eggs. The estuaries of other rivers are crowded with many humans. They will salvage fish eggs and sell them as a delicious treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishermen around the side of the island can climb up the gap in the bottom of the island and then sneak into the lake to lay eggs. It is not only quiet, but the water is clear, and there is a rich fish production - the black hair's caster saw it before. Those fish, these fish are freshwater fish, the bone thorns are small and numerous, and the fat is not as thick as the outer sea fish, but they have nothing to watch out for except the speed. It is suitable for small fish people to try their teeth initially. With paws. And when they return to the sea, they can also minimize the distance. Therefore, the fish people have a contract with the owners of the previous side islands. The contract indicates that the fish people will help the owner of the side island to drive away the wild snake people. The latter must allow them to lay eggs in the "eye of the sea god" without any interruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this contract does not seem to indicate that you can have it here." The soul of the opposite world said. In fact, he was a little embarrassed after touching the "children" of others. If the lich did not insist that he stayed, he may already be in his room now: "You can lay eggs here, but only this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Humans are always so greedy," the old fisherman said in a fisherman's language: "The fishman is not rich." He replied - In the lingua franca: "We might be able to find you some tourmaline, and amber..." He said, while staring at the new owner of the side island with his muddy eyes, the master may be more than any previous master. It’s dangerous because other owners are mortal. Unless they have to, they don’t want to dive to such a deep place just to see the fisher’s eggs, although they ask the fishermen to offer: “You either want to try Fish human eggs? Yes," Anyway, the East Crown lord also has 20 dedications a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the soul from another plane almost makes his heart scream out. Fortunately, it stopped in time, but this did not prevent it from fantasizing the taste of the fish eggs - although it was also a bit disgusting, because it feels a bit similar to eating chickens that have not yet been shelled and pink mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Like the egg, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s a bigger egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Have you eaten? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Occasionally, as a reward, the Lich said, but don’t think that is a good thing, the fisherman is the thief in the sea, their lies are The bubbles in the sea are still rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--How to say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——As I said, the Lich ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishermen are very dissatisfied with the new contract proposed by the new owner of the side island. They shook their heads one by one, and they beat their feet in turn (this represents anger in the fisherman). "This is impossible," said the old fisherman. "We are not human. Nor are we snakes. We are not employed. It will not be supported, and the loyalty you want will not be available."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you want to re-select a spawning ground?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't do this, here is the lord of the East Crown," said the old fisherman: "You have not vetoed its rights."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the side island is exactly what he gave me, the whole side of the island," the black-haired caster said: "He did not mention that part of it is Need to be removed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can give you more mermaid eggs, the price of mermaid eggs on the mainland is five hundred gold coins, you can also use It's going to replace something you need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't lack gold coins," said the soul of the alien world, then he was a witch He gave him a message and paused: "And not everyone will be deceived by you - these fish eggs are worthless in some people's eyes, they have no life."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what you are saying." The old fisherman said in a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich smiled slightly in the sea, and he was somewhat worried that the soul of another plane could not understand him, but it can be said that he immediately understood the mystery. "These are unfertilized eggs," he said, and it caused a slight panic: "For you, or for those who really need fish eggs, unfertilized eggs don't make any sense, it's just An unprocessed meat scorpion," said the soul of the alien world, according to the slogan: "Your real children are not these... eggs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't understand what you are saying." Old fisherman insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world no longer says anything, but sticks out a finger and casts a small spell before the fishman can't react. The spell vibrates the ground. Pulling a piece of dark stone out of its original position and falling into the hand of the caster, the fish people suddenly panicked, and some of them even cast a harpoon, but the black-haired caster disappeared and the fish disappeared. Some of the forks pierced the eggs, some pierced more stones, and the fish made a sorrowful cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
