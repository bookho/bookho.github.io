			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I am going to meditate. The lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In. This. Wtf! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It seems that my understanding of you is not as deep as I thought... The Lich said, your memory tells me... well, yours Thought is quite open, and you seem to be very keen to have more than one lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Where did you come from this conclusion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The ones you chase... The novel, the Lich says, many men, one woman, or many women, one man, I must admit your The taste is quite extensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s just a bad taste, the soul of the outside world retorted weakly, it’s not my real thought, it’s thought for a moment, I think My three views are still quite correct and solid, and I hate chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I hate chaos, but this does not hinder chaos. Your plane does not allow a man to have many wives in law and morality. Or a woman has a lot of husbands - in the written sense, you seem to prefer elves or dwarves, although this is not the case, the former undead cross fingers, but in our plane, especially Grenada This boring theory has no place to stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——But I don’t even know my gender, the soul of the outside world growls, I don’t want to find my lily when I restore my memory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich went looking for another dictionary of the plane, "Lily"...Oh, found it - why not, it was sweet, he Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If I am a bystander, maybe I will think so, no, wait, we should not discuss this issue again, what is important is that I I don't want to have any close relationship with women I have never seen before. Of course, men don't, don't help him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It seems that I did ignore this problem before. The Lich said that when I was on the island of Longhuo, yes, it was my negligence. After all, I already I haven't been a living person for a long time... I thought... Well, it's not too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What is it too late? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the important courses of Grenada. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Don't tell me that you have also taken this course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Not very happy, the Lich said, but it does, when I left Grenada, I was more than a hundred years old. How do you think I am still a child on the bed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world is silent, from the sorrowful tone of the Lich, it finds that this guy may not be as good as he did when he completed this subject. So dissatisfied, it can feel that the two smooth and bare bodies are lightly touching him in tandem, and the plump part rubs his skin with the waves of water, and the slender fingers His shoulders wrap around and stroke his chest and neck - but they are likely to be assassins, it said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Perhaps, the Lich said, but no dragon will give up on it, he will be laughed at, and he will be treated as timid. The aliens in the group...like the ones that used to be me. You know what we will encounter, we have no more power to deal with people like Gredi and their children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, maybe the Lich didn’t quite understand why the thief was so stubborn in this respect—on this point, the soul of the outside world was also surprised. Because he found that the bottom line of the original lich is sometimes very low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you really want to try? The lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-No! The soul of the alien world is categorically saying that np novels (both men and women) are viewed as humorous essays, and they don't want to be the protagonist of the text one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Okay, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Of course, the Lich said, do you think they can force you? As long as your thoughts are consistent with your speech, they will only leave quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Then? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We can try to get a scroll that can summon the succubus. The lich says that the succubus is a messy and evil creature. The wonderful thing is Although they regard men as food, they will be embarrassed, or they will be angry because food is taken by others, so if people are told that you have a succubus around you, they will not want to approach you unless that person can Determine the succubus that defeats a rage. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- But that's because the succubus... um, basically it's the sorcerer's lover, don't you want me to invite her and me Running towards the sunset together? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- You have to believe in your charm, see, you can even confuse the otter, or a male otter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——......Do you know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I think you are teasing me,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——...that is your illusion ,Dear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitute’s attendant is not heavy in the Galaxy Before it became bleak, a baby was sent, which was in full compliance with the previous requirements of the Lich. The umbilical cord had not yet fallen off, and his mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world has to acquiesce in the behavior of the lich, the only baby in the kingdom of Grenada that can guarantee no evil. The type of life, the Lich's spells caused him to lose a lot of blood, he became extremely weak, but as long as he can get enough nutrition and care in the future, he can still live, he and his mother are raised in the ground. What makes the souls of the opposite world ridiculous is that if these two humans are still slaves, they may die silently the next day or the third day, but as a test material or sacrifice for a dragon and warlock Products, they can get better and longer lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich has completely silenced, but before casting the spell, he has copied enough reels, and they have runes and wands around them. Some of them were obtained from the North Sea, some from the trade and the dedication of the merchants of Longhuo Island, and others are the gifts of the new king and Mittite as fathers and brothers, so that the souls of the outside world feel Unexpectedly, Austal actually sent hundreds of blank scrolls and rare ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, the new king and the gritty, the black-haired dragons were not summoned by any of them. Greed seems to have been sleeping in his own nest, and the new king has not left his home for decades. His solitude and eccentricity are known to every Grinada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world conjectures that the new king may be waiting for their visit, but the Lich said that it is best not to call before Greedy summons them. Going to see the nominal rulers of Grenada, this has nothing to do with whether or not it will cause Gritty's dissatisfaction, mainly because they must determine their position in the heart of Gree to determine how much they can negotiate with the new king. - Even the soul of the opposite world does not believe that he will really be a kind father. Dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich asked curiously why he was so wary of someone he had never met, and the soul of the outside world answered him because of that Nothing else, it is the king of Grenada, even a nominal king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Knowing that there is a saying in our country, there are three kinds of people in the world, men, women and kings, the soul of the opposite world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We also have a sentence here, the lich is a rare smile from the heart, the king is a monster. It’s amazing, the difference between the two planes is such a disparity, but when people comment on a ruler, they are almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the return of Cremal, this vacant and abandoned mansion reappears the original brilliance, it is always so quiet, Silence is like a waiter who surpasses a two-handed index. Of course, this is just a metaphor. The black-haired dragon is no longer a powerless baby. When he returns, he may gain amazing power and strength. Now these attendants are just doing what they should do, and observing their new owners. Once their status is confirmed, whether they are high or low, they can make the final choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
