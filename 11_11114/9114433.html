The dragon in the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white dragon opened his eyes as they moved their feet, like all white dragons, and their eyes were covered with a translucent instant. Membrane, this layer of nictite looks like a layer of polished, very fine parchment that resists extreme glare, leaving White Dragon not as unprepared as it is when looking at its vast, shimmering territory. Fall into the predicament of snow blindness. It shrugged its shoulders, and the wings spread out behind them. They were ice blue like the scales. It was a good protective color in the snow and ice. The white dragon is smaller than other dragons, but it is also small. Not much, at least after it completely broke away from the ice, it is still as high as four Kerry, it moves on the cracked ice and snow, its feet are long and sharp, very suitable for smooth ground. walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf only heard a very soft slamming sound, he only had time to grab the gnome, but the bursting arrow has been strongly ejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t shoot anywhere in the white dragon, although McGee’s goal is its eyes, but the white dragon’s claws are as agile as the flying seabirds. Accurately, it grabbed the little smashing arrow at once, and the smashing arrow burst in its claws. The white dragon made a painful cry, like the red copper dragon that the thief Gülen met, it didn’t flow too More blood, some debris fell out of the claws, and then turned into a light spot disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot!" White Dragon roared: "The most despicable one I have ever seen!" It turned to them, spewing out a cold current, the elf took The gnome jumped away, and the gnome's bow hit the ground and immediately turned into a fine powder. The gnome shuddered. If he was hit by the cold current, his result would probably not be much better than the bow. Perhaps he unknowingly uttered this inference, and the elf immediately gave a negative answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," said Kerry Ben. "White Dragon really likes to swallow frozen prey, but that's too small."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't feel comforted at all." McGee said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the rare courage of the gnomes brought them a little trouble. The white dragon chased them like crazy, and it is fortunate that this cave is very large and empty, and this is not a real white dragon, it can only be said to be a phantom left by the dragon. Otherwise the elves and gnomes may really turn into an uncompromising frozen package - the elf is the main meal and the gnome is the dessert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the elf can only hope that the phantom of this white dragon is subject to certain restrictions. If it is as he infers, this secret may involve more than one dragon. If there is also a good dragon, then they may be at work. Before I became irreparable, I found a little life, but it didn't seem. In the process of running away, the white dragon spewed out the cold current and wiped the elf's arm. Although the white air is a few feet away from the elf, the elf's arm Still immediately lost consciousness, his shirt became a piece, fell to the ground, and made a crisp sound. The shirt of the white-bellied spider of the gray ridge was woven into a line to resist the black iron sword. Under the spur of Bailong, it is like the fragile leaves in the late autumn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome fell from his fingers, and a white dragon’s paw immediately held it down, it did not immediately tear the gadget away, instead Turning to the elf, it is filled with bizarre golden eyes with endless malicious and ridiculous, mouth open, revealing a bright red tongue and white teeth like ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry knew that he was waiting, waiting for him to walk into its net, but he had no choice, the gnome thought he had betrayed it, But his behavior is not evil or even a proof that he is not so gnome. He certainly cannot compare with Kreimar or Birdwin in Kerry's heart, but since he has already recognized his identity as a companion. The Elf Ranger could not throw him away in the white dragon's paws and walk away. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Bai Long was engrossed in watching the elf slowly hang his arms and move his feet, the sudden fate came to his head inexplicably - Elf and gnome can't see, white dragon can't, but can feel a cold breath - white dragon is just a projection, but it remembers that kind of breath, it likes all the colored dragons like to torture prey, taste their Fear--When White Dragon is manipulating, even if it is hit by the cold current that it spits out, the part of the prey that freezes instantly is only a thin layer outside, but they can neither break free nor kill themselves. As Bai Long hopes, he is desperately waiting for the arrival of death, and this process is often extremely long and painful. Occasionally, White Dragon can smell a dusty, indescribable smell on them. It comes from the fate of the deceased, mourning the winds of the wasteland, which symbolizes death and the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it smells this breath now, it thinks they come from the gnome under the claws, but it is wrong, it feels like it When countless snakes got into their nostrils, teeth, and ears, what they wanted to do, but there was nothing they could do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf was surprised to see that the white dragon raised his claws. The gnome was lying underneath, and he did not dare to move. After he found that the white dragon’s claws fell on his side, he was as fast as a crab. Moving laterally, after he thought that the big claw would no longer pose a threat to himself, he jumped up and ran wildly toward the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let your bow and arrow, elf," the white dragon suddenly said, its sound sounded like it was from the deepest deep sea, and Hey and cold: "I am not your enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your performance is not that." The elf said that his sharp arrow on the bowstring Wandering around the dangerous magical light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are talking about the white dragon," White Dragon said strangely: "But I am not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you?" The gnome asked subconsciously, then slammed into the back of the elf's knee as White Dragon looked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Dragon lifted a paw in a word and pointed to the direction of the elf, Kerry would almost release the sharp arrow, gnome It fell softly. At first the elf thought he was dead, but almost at the next moment, they heard a loud grunt. The strength of the gnome was about the same as that of an ordinary adult. The same was true of the grunt, in a quiet cave. It sounds especially shocking. The white dragon licked his ear with the thinst claw tip before putting down his paw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No harm," "White Dragon" is so guaranteed, it says: "It’s just a small spell, because our next words are not suitable for him to hear. - Can you put down your longbow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to tell me?" The elf asked, he let go of his fingers, but he promised to be in one He can continuously shoot no less than six arrows in the breath, and can guarantee that they can find a suitable position on the body of the white dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a ghost." "White Dragon" said that the stern vision of the elf is invisible, "a ghost of a wizard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few devout believers in the Master, and the Master and the electorate have not appeared, but the rare number is like the stars in the gravel, so death The god of Klanwo, the tall and broad, almost impossible to find the marginal wall, the soul of the mage can be no longer a few, but the powerful mage has more ways to choose, in their life as a human or humanoid is coming to an end. At the time, they will either be converted into a lich; or they will sign a contract with the devil. After they die, they will skip the stage of locusts and inferior demons, and directly convert them into small devils or devils, and transform them into abyss. The high-level devils of the class are not without, as long as they can get the favor of the devil lord or the demon prince; the above two are quite good choices, but there are also those who fear death but lack money and experience, and willingly accept the red robe. Association "Transforming themselves into half a Golem, a clay or metal instead of their own flesh and blood, of course, the last one is the worst way, because you do not know when it will go crazy a red robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More mages become ghosts. They carry their powerful power to mourn the wasteland. If they are not captured by demons or demons, they may return to the main material plane by their living arrangements. They will cast some spells. The effectiveness, if the latter mastered their names, but these casters are often evil, so the elves did not let go of their vigilance: "Who are you serving for?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For my enemy." "White Dragon" bent his neck. If a human is to do it, this pose is a simplified wizard, all The Master has this habit, even if it is only through communication spar or portal dialogue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An evil enemy." The elf said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be said." "White Dragon" raised his paw and licked his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to be free?" Kerry suggested, but he knew that the proposal might not be approved, and the Master was extremely arrogant and arrogant, even though It’s a tool that’s completely in the hands of others, but only if they still have magic, then they’re not going to the end of the mountain – getting rid of them means they’re going to be destroyed and purified, like those who’re getting “free” The deceased, the ghost does not want this, the ghost can ignore the passage of time, he has countless time, and all he wants is just a small leak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." So when I heard this answer, the Elf Ranger was not surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you want to know why I am here?" asked the ghost in the body of White Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your master's order?" Kerry asked: "Is your own will?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Half and a half." The ghost replied: "My master ordered me to tell you an interesting secret, and I am very willing to do this, for my disciple Beavis."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bives?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's amazing?" "White Dragon" says it Once again, decapitate the elf and lift the front paw slightly. This is a more formal mage ceremony. When a wizard introduces himself to others, they will do this: "Elves Kerry Ben, in your long life, There is a companion you should remember, he is called "respectable 牟路斯", he has been working hard with Grenada's red robes all his life, fortunate enough to fight with you twice - you remember That sweet potato, it looks like a running man, you insist that it is like a woman, and I insist that it is a man because Apparently not so flat between the legs "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Kerry’s eyes narrowed, and the ghost’s words reminded him of the night’s battle again. They were trapped in a valley and they didn’t have much to eat, but he still found some sweet potatoes. Until now, he still knows I remember that a group of mages rushed to use the "Mage's Hand" to look through the hot embers to look at the ripe sweet sweet potatoes. Yes, there are 牟路斯, he was born in an ordinary blacksmith family, but his Talent is such a greatness. At that time, he was very young, but he could already confront a warlock: "Remember why you want to be the enemy of the red robe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Because my sister was taken by an apprentice in a red robe," said Lucus. "One day I went home and found that I suddenly lost everything, my grandmother, my father, my mother. , my sister and my brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You caught them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I didn't expect that they would be willing to make one so expensive. The spell is applied to me," said Lucus. "I thought that I would become the feed of the dragon at the end. To be honest, I am going to be flattered. What do you want to know? Dear old friend, should I Feeling heartbroken, because you don't want to believe me, even if I have given so many proofs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know one, or more spells Being able to read all the memories in a person's brain.” Kerry Ben said that he is trying to keep his mind steady, he is facing an enemy, the least, a beggar controlled by the evil red robe, he is no longer A human being, his words cannot be trusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great." said Luluth, raised his paw and patted it. "I was thinking about it, since you already know about it." ......" He licked the head of Bai Long: "So you may be able to answer a small question that has been lingering in my heart for a long time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not sure. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter." Luluth said: "You will find this is a simple question, in fact, if you are willing to open your eyes to see Open your ears and listen, maybe you have already found the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have a lot of time." The Elf Ranger said coldly, Maybe this ghost is indeed his companion, but he also knows that after a creature becomes a ghost, his thoughts will gradually become corrupted by evil like his body is swallowed by locusts. He will become evil and full of envy and hatred for life. Only a small number of determined people can escape this sad ending, but it will not be a 牟路斯, if he is really like Before said, was Grenada's red robe were caught, they will stop at nothing to force him to fall, if not, he would be completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What makes you so impatient?" said Lucus: "Because your new child, your half-man?" Then he was satisfied to hear that Kerry's breathing became disordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know that I am the mentor of Beavis," said Lucus, "My poor disciple, I must admit my actions and teachings to bring him It’s coming to the end of the disaster - you should have heard of it, yes, this is the revenge of the red robe, when I have not completely died, they brought me the embryo of the Beavis child, one has already seen The face and the sex fetus, the umbilical cord attached to the mother's placenta. They turned it into a monster, soaked in a jar, it accompanied me for a while, I can hear it crying every night and day. - At that time, I didn't have much thoughts, except that I wanted to see my Beavis. You know, I don't have children, no wife, Beavis is my heir, I took him from Longhuo Island. Bring it out, teach him, raise him, the relationship between him and me is deep and sincere. If there is no red robe, I think we may live together, in that small building, in my old man, When you can't move, you can sit in a rocking chair and squint at the sun. The children of Weiss are spinning around my knees - of course, now it has become a joke, but really, after I finally became a tool to satisfy the red robes, I got... um There is limited freedom, and my first thought is to find Beavis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you found him?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but at that time, I can't do anything, except look at him," said Lulus. "The curse of the red robe, you know, and my work. It’s also very heavy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry hasn’t asked herself what the red robes would assign to Balus. "When did you find Beavis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before he has not recourse to the Seventy-seven Islands." said Lulus: "And then As long as I can find the opportunity, I will go and see him. Later, I can slowly talk to him or leave a little symbol that only we can understand. Unfortunately, I can't let him give up revenge. I know that he will die, and finally one day, I know that he is dead, but fortunately his enemies are also dead, no, maybe I should not say that a lich is not going to die, they have already got eternal life. They will only purify or be swallowed up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
