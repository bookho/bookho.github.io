			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rui Wen takes a petal of the silver crown from the branch, puts down his knees, kneels beside the spring of life, picks up a spoonful of spring water, closes the lips On the other side, the sweet and clear cold spring water becomes warm and pleasant when it comes into contact with the tongue. When they flow into the throat, a rich force spreads from the heart of Ruiwen to any part of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female elf’s abdomen has a small bulging bag. She and Peland’s children obviously welcome this drink. Its small fist is in Ruiwen. On the belly, Ruiwen covers the palm of his hand, and the snare bag will start to move, like playing games with his mother. When Perant is still there, this game is his patent and favorite. When Ruiwen remembered that Perant first saw her belly appear bumpy, the jaw-dropping look made him a poor idiot. At first he was awesome about this scene, just like Ruiwen was not pregnant. There is a fetus but a miracle given by Angris, the god of life, but these have not been able to resist his love and curiosity to the child, although he did not have the courage until he left the druid. Use the palm of your hand to sense the movements of the fetus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ricken put his hand on the snare bag, the druid could pull the finger of the long chord of the steel string and trembles strangely, he 跪Go down and look for the baby's little hands or feet with your lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Ruiwen sighed slightly, she could give birth at any time, and after Perant returned to the silver-crowned jungle, it would be two people to meet him - His wife and his children, this may be a pity for him - every father who is a father will be guarded by his wife, watching the child born, listening to the first sound of the child in the world The bright crying gives him/her a kiss that symbolizes love and guardianship, but this is Perant. His sense of responsibility and mission has always been the strongest in the Singer, which makes him sometimes like a stubborn Human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rui Wen’s palms slid down slightly, and at the same time picked up her eyebrows. Her abdomen appeared two or three snare drums at the same time, and the fetus was shaking in uneasiness. But here is the jungle, the lock has been opened, there will be no dangerous intruders... The heart of the female elf suddenly violently jumps, she trembles, stands up, sits two or three or three under the silver crown tree or The elf lying down is also wary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole lock is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves heard the sounds of the strings or the bowstrings coming from the farthest places. It is like the dragon on the lake. The center emanates and spreads thousands of miles away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingway put down the feather pen, stood up and quickly walked outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deepest part of the Fountain of Life gives off soft light, like moonlight, and like starlight, some impatient elves have pulled out a double knife or lifted Longbow, Ruiwen looked solemnly to cast a gesture, a powerful spell ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she saw Perant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring water washed away the blood on the druid and made his injury clear at a glance - his skull was missing a piece, the forehead was sunken, and the throat was cut open. Lost a left foot, these are the most terrible, so that some other messy but deep scars can even be said to be gentle touches compared to the former. There was a constant black mist rising from the depths of the wound, and then it was surrounded and swallowed by the light. The largest silver-crowned tree on the spring water shook the branches, and numerous silver-crowned flowers and grandmother green leaves fell from the branches. Fall into the spring water. As soon as it falls into the spring, the flowers and leaves are like ice and snow, and they melt into the sun. The force of life contained in them penetrates into the body of the Druid from all sides. His wounds no longer bleed and begin to slowly gather. With recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rui Wen took a step back from the abdomen, pain came from inside her body, she gasped, took a deep breath to calm her emotions and pain, and an elf ran over Holding her, she found that Ruiwen had no control over her body, and she was falling hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She wants to give birth." The female elf shouted: "Call the priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In fact, even if no one is going to inform, feeling that the lock is touched and opened, the priests of the silver-crowned jungle have already arrived in flight. They have taken a part to take care of Perant, who has sunk in the spring, and others. Look after Rui Wen who is about to give birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the king of the jungle came, they had already set up a comfortable little tent for Rigi, with the cloaks and tents of the elves. Pulling up to the side of the spring, let Ruiwen see his husband - this scene is not so rare a thousand years ago, in the endless battle and chaos, how many couples fight side by side, and accept side by side for treatment? Let them see each other, both to encourage them to support each other, to encourage each other, and to avoid their regrets to go to the kingdom of Angris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a new life born today, but the pastors sincerely hope that there will be no other life to die away - the elves are not afraid of death, their death Just returning to the kingdom of Angris or other good gods, they will continue to fight, sing and dance, friends and relatives can see again there, but they do not want to be today, is Perant, his children Not born, he did not kiss the baby's bloody forehead, did not hold his/her finger with only peanuts, and did not put his short sword or longbow on his/her side. The priests prayed to Angris, and then it was not unexpected, a clear and sweet voice joined them, this is the English singing is singing - although he is singing for his wife and Kerry Ben, even The dormouse under the window sill will also escape. But this time the song is not dedicated to any elf, person, or other creatures, but to the god of her god, Angris, who sings the power of Angelis and sings the glory of Angelus. Singing the kindness of Angris, singing the tolerance and gentleness of Angris, the voice of the tall king of the jungle is as fast and powerful as the mountain breeze, no mistakes, no offset, this is not from his chest It was sent out from the vocal cords, but from his soul, and his piety made all the pastors cry for tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rui Wen’s gaze was blurred, but she insisted on looking at Perant’s direction. The pastors did not dare to pull him out of the spring water. The physical injury was indeed healed, but the fatal wound on the throat and head was still so At the horror of the eye, Ruiwen could not see the lover's situation through the priest's cover, but she knew that there was hope before the singing was over, although the hope was so embarrassing and fragile, she wanted to pray, but There was only intermittent screaming from her mouth, this was Perant’s first child and her first child, and Rieven only felt that she was about to be torn – she subconsciously wanted to find Perant The hand only caught the short sword that Perant had given her. She had never taken it except when she fell asleep - but when she held the hard short sword tightly, she shouted involuntarily. Her full muscles were pushing hard, pushing something out of her legs - after a moment of silence, she heard a cry that never shone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the singers’ sings suddenly increased to a point where they could not continue. Even so, the voice of Ingway was so clear, Riewen 睁Open her eyes, she was gently covered with a velvet cloak, her body suddenly warmed up, the female elf squinted, because the bright light was thrown at them from the gap between the leaves of the silver-crowned tree, the king of the jungle Ingeway, priest, Ruiwen and other elves, but the most is still pouring into the spring water, Perant's body is shrouded in starlight, his face becomes gentle and serene, no longer entangled with pain and nightmares, green leaves Extending from his head and throat, as well as the wound in his left leg, he stroked the broken flesh and bone like a gentle hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices of the pastors suddenly became low, and the king of the jungle put their knees down on the spring water and the silver crown tree, lowered their heads, and sincerely expressed their sincerity to their fathers. Thanks, when the last syllable disappeared into the sound of the silver-clad branches, they had to return to Perant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When Perant woke up, he slept on a large bed, the window was open, and the sun and the wind blew through the silver-gray curtains from the window. For a moment, he thought he had come to the Kingdom of God. But he turned his head and immediately saw Ruiwen, and the little parcel around Ruiwen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat up cautiously, his vision was clear and bright, no more than half of the darkness was in it, he opened his hands, his palms and fingers were as clean as white porcelain He lifted his feet and saw his ten toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant’s movements failed to wake up the ridiculous Raven, but woke up his daughter. The child’s cockroaches were placed between him and Ruiwen, because the package was not very strict, and the child’s hand was impatient. Stretched out of linen, just like a small fruit fist is almost translucent in the sun, nails are like a small shell. Perant gently returned to her position, holding her head with one arm, lying on her side, covering her own body with too hot and dazzling sunlight for the baby, the baby became calmer, but she The little nose was still sucking from time to time - the smell of Perant was strange to her, she was a little uneasy, but her mother was there, and her familiar heartbeat and breathing made her feel safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a sprout-like little pointed ear, like every newborn elf baby, her ear flaps are not unfolding, close to the head, but looking at Kay Perrant, who grew up with Reuben, knows that they will expand like leaves in twenty days. Before that, the baby's hearing will be affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant is willing to touch her small head covered with fine fluff, the fluff is now creamy, but soon they will fade away, being sun-like The blonde replaced it; he was also willing to kiss her forehead, although the eyebrows under the forehead were still very light, but I could see the approximate shape - she completely inherited Perant, a pair of eyebrows like a bird Open the wings, stretched out to the two, making her little face look a bit harsh; but her nose and lips, is a replica of Ruiwen, the nose is tall, the little lips are fuller and richer than the autumn berries. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I caught it!" The gnome McGee groaned, and after the water troll stunned in the master's call, the black-haired caster used a flame spell to melt a smooth top-down On the ice road, they joined forces to move their boat down and pushed it along the ice road and pushed it into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They should feel hungry after the fight, but losing Perant makes frustration and sorrow fill their stomachs (although McGee has always hated Perant, but this At that time, he didn't dare to say anything more. Even so, no one wants to mention the druid first. But Gülen thinks things may not be as bad as they thought, because he can only see confusion and sorrow from his master's face, just like he doesn't understand what he has encountered, and Perant's death may be against the grown-up. It is a big blow, but it should not be enough to make him unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
