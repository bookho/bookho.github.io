			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 148th chapter team (seventeen)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half dragon resisted tenaciously The power of magic, his tail wrapped around a stalagmites that were as big as a double, and the hands that bent out the nails firmly grasped the edge of the crack, and the flame spewed out of his teeth - this is he did not As expected, this wizard still retains one or more powerful spells, but the half dragon does not think that he will estimate the error anyway. He has fought face to face with so many casters, even in a half lich. The man is lucky to escape, no, maybe it should not be said, because he did not escape by his own strength, but was thrown back to the endless abyss by the half-lith that should be purified 10,000 times, he hated and full of Suspiciously looking at the black hair caster, because the two methods are the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poor mixed-race hybrid has half the succubus's blood. He is much weaker than the real devil, but he can't avoid hentai. Call of the Abyss - After the devil is killed, he will return to the endless abyss, where he will be imprisoned for a hundred years before he can once again look for opportunities to return to the main material they are craving. This is the most common caster of the main material world. One of the methods used; but if a powerful priest casts a correct expulsion, the mouth of the endless abyss will open in obedience and swallow its children back in the belly - half dragon sees The priest suddenly remembered this when he applied the magic to the little demon, but he had already been caught and cast a black crack. The endless abyss is a never-frozen monster that will catch everything. The prey is dragged back to its field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-eyed caster blinked at him, smiled, gestured, and a slam dunk hit half a dragon, full The scaled monster made a twisted roar, not only for this heavy blow, but also because Baldwin was cutting his tail like a felled tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the festival knows that if he persists, he will only suffer more damage, and he will have to face countless times after a long time. Devil and demons, he struggled to let go of his fingers. Before the crack was completely closed, the Elf's Mithril arrow followed him and flew in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"弩弓?" The thief asked, his vision was very good, and saw the little smashing arrow bounce off in front of the semi-dragon scales. A dazzling light flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little hint." Kerry Ben smiled and said that this kind of arrow is used by the elves to communicate with their distant companions. People are eye-catching and will hang in the air for a long time. There is no sun and moon with the main material surface in the endless abyss. Its light is always dark and chaotic, and the signals of the elves are very similar to those of the white robes. The products in the abyss can't wait to chase the past, want to find out, as for the half dragon It’s not that they’re going to be a fresh meal, it’s not something they can decide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Ranger put the bow back into his pocket, and he noticed that Gülen's hand was also carrying a black, silky soft bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I took it from that monster." The thief did not mean to hide, he straightened his arm. Let everyone see their loot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When?" Baldwin asked in surprise, he did not retrieve the double-edged axe, it had been corroded by the blood of the half dragon, the axe There was a crack in the article - the thief looked at him - the former Paladin had a clear vision and did not seem to have doubts and responsibilities. Gülen blinked his eyes. "Just just now," he said: "There was only that time. At other times, I couldn't get close to him at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He handed the Dimensional bag to Kremar: "Look, Master. There may be something you want inside." Something about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar looked at him a little bit meaningfully, even if it was a slow-moving alien soul in some ways. The thief is trying to win his favor (he doesn't know that the lich has given him a good sign before entering the swamp), but Gülen is right, and the half-dragon with the devil's blood is also a caster. Although he seems to prefer to fight, the personal items from these evil creatures will basically have spells for protection and cursing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey took two steps forward, she was still a little weak, and even if the half dragon disappeared, the bat and the moth fight each other and die, the swamp he summoned It still exists. She hated to pull off a multi-legged worm that climbed up along her calf. Even if she was separated by boots, the feeling of her feet immersed in the mud still made her feel like she was going crazy. She felt that no matter what they were doing most. Don't put it here, it's time to do it - but now the attention of several other people seems to be attracted by the little pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic." Kerry originally said that there was a voice that made him snatch the pocket and take it for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very strong." Kreima went on to say that he would hang the pocket on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly a little bit." The thief said, "It seems that its impact on people is mainly reflected in the caster."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry is also a caster?" Mei Mi asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the elves are just sensitive to magic." Birdwin replied, then he turned to the thief: "Really," he said. "I really don't understand why they gave up on you. You see, one can The devil's expert in stealing things - even if it's only half a devil, and weak, but it's also a terrible enemy. Haven't they thought about trying to save you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope you are not satirizing me," said Gülen. "The real reason you should know...because you have seen it," he said. "And you have to look at it again." When I finished speaking, I fell down and fell on Mei Mi. A few breaths became a real dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no!" said Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster who also saw this strange scene immediately reached out and turned the mud of the fallen position of Gülen into a solid ice surface, the body of the thief Straight and fell to the top, making a dull sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei suddenly felt a whirlwind, she thought it was because the spirit of prayer before consumed her too much power, but her feet were shaking all the time, Even the ice on the thief's body was shaking and cracking - she looked instinctively, and there was something in the dark green mixed with dark green mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slender stalactite fell and then more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" said Bywin, "This is going to collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The magical energy contained in the array would have been to nourish the human beings in the village of "concave corners", giving birth to an evil but powerful fruit. Now its roots are destroyed and blocked, but the juice is still flowing, they are The key parts of the fault accumulate, and the lines engraved in the circle are increasingly difficult to load as the magical power increases. Now they are going to break through the obstacles and restrictions, and they will burst out without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair caster hangs the pocket on his own belt, making a gesture, and a spell rushes to the top of the cave. The top that was overwhelmed was shattered, and a little bright white light shot into the dark cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the second spell was shrouded in Kerry Ben and other people in time, lest they be smashed into a small cake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled at others while making his third gesture. "Would you like to try to fly?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Gülen?" Birdwin shouted: "The gods are on, he is turning into powder!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers are hurt. Hungry and tired, except for Kremar, whether it is the spirit or the body is already strong, Mei Mei can only rely on the limbs to crawl, in fact, she feels that she can actually persist until now is a god-given miracle, and Baldwin's pale face is like the bats. He lost too much blood and was tortured. He fled all the way to this place and has not had a chance to rest so far. Kerry seems to be okay, but it is just "looking" okay, with Gülen's pocket being held by Kremar, who also carries the elf's bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woods sank behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took a break on a small open space, Kremar turned the pocket upside down, and the scarlet powders began to condense because of the squeeze of the pockets. They are somewhat knotted and distorted - Mei Mei leans against Baldwin and frowns. "Do they still return to their original state?" She whispered, "If..." She licked her lips. "If, I don't mean, but... I just assume that if there is a little less. After all, we are in a hurry, will he be missing something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Kreima looked at the pile silently. To be honest, its look and feel was even worse than that of the melt glue. He recalled that when they discovered that Gülen was becoming a powder, it was really a mess. The alien soul swears that he really didn't think about it - fortunately he had time to interrupt the spell, otherwise he really didn't know how to get back the scattered powder in an empty cave - and he, When Kerry was grabbing the powder into the bag, he could only say that there was almost no omission. He didn't know if he had lost a small finger or an incisor of Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey no longer speaks, just staring at the change of powder, she did think of the opportunity when the caster and Kerry was busy packing up the powder. Something, but she is exhausted, can't guarantee that the little means she plays with is not discovered. For the caster and the elf, she is just a useless gift, and they must hate a guy who tries to murder his companion. She may be driven away, and finally she decided not to take risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiting time was not very long. After Gülen resumed the first dull breath, everyone was relieved that they were fighting side by side. Even if Gülen was a dangerous and gloomy thief, they didn’t want him because of this. The ridiculous reason is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A move." Ranger reminded: "Is there something uncomfortable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue Slowly stood up and did a few moves, "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took his clothes from the elf and then went to Bo Devin took a look: "You know why I am being abandoned." He can die at any time and turn into powder, even if he can steal things from the gods - the curse of the god of death is not Dismissal, every task he accepts is likely to fail - the guild does not need such a member, Gülen feels that he may have to thank the Duke of John of Norman, oh, now he is the new king, if not his persecution, the guild It is very likely that he will be sold to a red robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do we do after that?" he asked the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take the 'concave corner' for the time being," said the caster. "We need to take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes," said the elf. "We can take a good night's sleep, take a shower, and eat something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up to two days." Ranger said: "We will leave early in the morning of the third day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Why don't we stay for a few more days," Mei Mi asked, and she felt that she had to rest for a whole month before she could recover: "You said that it would take at least ten days for Wang Duo's order to be transferred here?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Once the festival disappears, the priest of Ilmot will immediately rush to the nearest city to inform the temple about the incident - and the nearest city, The horse riding is three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does he sell us? We saved him and his villagers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, Elf said gently: "Do not test the people." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
