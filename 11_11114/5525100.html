			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author has something to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous chapter has been modified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should not let Yadell do this," A man came out from behind the screen of the house, dressed in a common black mage robes, a sea of ​​green fireworks gems flashing on the gold collar, he has the same hair color and ochre as Yadell, but It is much thinner and much taller than the former, and it has more appearances that we can find on the face of the consul. "He is not good at this. I can almost imagine his dry manner of persuasion - the gray ridge is very good. But the White Tower is better, stay here, we will give you money, give you power, and so on, and so on, even the ghosts that he can't move," he slaps his palm and makes a face to his father. Maybe he will still blush and stutter, oh...this is probably the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consul was teased by his second son: "No, I didn't Let Yadell do this," he fell back to his chair: "He probably heard some gossip and wanted to give me less Point pressure - the mage lived in the sanctuary of Rosada - what do you think of him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I walked over again before they left The route that started, starting from the hills - I can only say that even me, I can't do better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So lose him It’s a bit of a pity.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not necessarily,” said the second officer of the consul: “Let me give it a try.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casino, bathroom, theater, dance, Froth's temple," Yadel's brother Bend your fingers and list them one by one: "Those things that are not in the Grey Ridge, so even if he goes to the Grey Ridge, he will definitely miss it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archon Laughed: "Yes, this is the case, you are more aware of the man's preferences. If these can't touch him, then I will give you two more weapons - the entry and exit voucher of the hall and the 'independence Giants' right of pre-order, had Beavis is because these two things left behind "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"I have to marry him," said the black robe mutter. If he said that he could still turn a blind eye to the entry and exit voucher of the record hall, then the "Cyclops" is completely another concept. It is a secret, small but numerous. The magic and luxury shops that are rich (although some of them are not so bright and straightforward), there are some rare and precious materials, scrolls and classics. Pre-purchase rights not only mean you get it at a surprisingly low price. They are more beneficial to you, and other mages are likely to always know nothing about it - even if he is the second son of the consul, his pre-purchase rights are only in his third year after he officially leaves his apprenticeship. I got it: "So, wait for good news, father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second son took a trip to his father freely, not as solemn as Yadel A little more intimate: "Speak back," he said half-heartedly and half-heartedly: "You really don't want to let Yadell grow up? It's always so dull and clumsy that it's not suitable for a chief pastor."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&& Nbsp;&nbsp; "Because he is going to be the chief pastor of Rosada," the consul replied: "So he must keep his purity and enthusiasm. This is what Rosada admire most, a good at trickery, old-fashioned The human being is unable to win the favor of the god of morning light," his tone suddenly became harsh: "I know that the wizards will rarely be pious and respectful to a certain god, your tutor is like this, so are you, I can tolerate this, but I definitely don't allow Yadell to be affected. I arranged your three futures as early as ten years ago. I will never allow them to be broken. Do you understand?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second son stared at him for a while, then he smiled: "Don't be so serious, just a joke," he raised a hand to promise: "I swear It’s just a joke.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage in black robes stepped back and left to the door, and then bowed shallowly before turning away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the threshold was closed behind him, his smile receded like a tide and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The future," he stroked the ring on his finger: "I don't remember what you have given me."<br /><br />&nbsp The black robe mage did not waste a little time. He walked out of his father's official residence, jumped onto the horse, and rushed out of the inner city. The house of Beavis Mage was surrounded by a group of white robes, and they sang the morning light. Praising the gods, the light and the warmth in the sunlight resemble the entity. He hurriedly glanced over and did not find Yadel. His brother might not have left the inner city and went directly to the recording hall or elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hesitate to jump on the horse again. The white tower of Rosada stood in less than five miles. A pastor who was coming out of the sanctuary of the sanctuary answered his question. The caster was disappointed to learn that he came. Late, the wizard who always wears a white robe has followed the Elf Kerry to the dock of the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe mage slips his hand into the inner pocket and holds a wand. This wand can send him to the dock in a blink of an eye, but what does he say? Then, in front of Kerry Ben, let a half-elf jump into the slump of lust? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the White Tower is special because of its direct connection to the river A tributary of the Starlight River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Starlight River originates from the middle section of the Longji Mountains. Because the river is narrow and extraordinarily rushing, it will not slow down until it enters the silver-crowned jungle. The most gentle water flow area, after leaving the gray ridge, it has become violent and renewed, and this bad mood continues to its end. Unlike other rivers, the estuary of the Star River is a strange and huge. The cliff, as seen from the map, is like a gap that is slightly recessed inward - the dwarf insists that he/she is wielding a hammer and smashing the solid after drinking too much holy water (also known as mead) The anvil, and the half-body thinks that this is his/her can't help but take a bite after baking the pie on the mainland, but no matter what kind of statement, it can't affect the roaring river from the height of three thousand feet. A daunting fact that jumped into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the safest and most convenient way to get from the Star River to the Grey Ridge and the Silver Crown behind it. - The Starlight River has only one large tributary that allows the double-boat to travel. This tributary is scattered around the White Tower and integrated into many lakes. The river in the city is one of them. The half-elves who lived in Gray Ridge used the rapids of the Starlight River to carry their cargo to the White Tower, and then transported what they needed from the White Tower. In general, the transaction was only carried out and completed in the White Tower, only very A few people - trustworthy businessmen and good priests can directly enter the Star River and the Grey Ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves’ ships are as long and slender as all the ships that Kerrimal saw before, and the narwhal-like bow stern is high up. The cock is lifted, the sails are white, the vines and waves are carved on the ship's side. There are no paddlers. The wind and water from the magic control the movement and steering of the ship. The beautiful sailors and long sailors work on the deck. Hume, laugh and talk, mostly wearing a single coat or leather armor, some with pointed ears, and some without, Singer elves have a light blonde color like a morning sun, and the eyes are not the color of the lake or the sky, half The hair color of the elves and the color of the eyes are much more complicated, but even if there is a dark color, it will not be as dark as Crimmar is like a late night in a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like some light wine?" Kerry asked, sitting on the top deck, that is, above the captain's room, this is the place that will not affect the sailor's work, and the place is big enough. Evening, the sun shines through the sails and their gaps, and the silver-gray wood exudes a strange scent like tobacco and steel in the hot light. The light wine brought by Kerry is not the kind of "wine" in the usual sense. It is not the fruit and wheat that is cooked in the water, but the tender branches of the pine tree. The wine tastes refreshing and delicious, but it doesn't make people feel too excited like the water added with snow honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maple Sugar is one of the specialties of the jungle. It was the only source of sweetness besides honey before the extensive cultivation of sugar cane and sugar beet in Longhuo Islands. —Kremar thought of the sugar he had tasted at the market in the Port of Point, the Little Bird and the Beitburg. He didn’t pay attention at first, but now it’s really the taste he is familiar with. However, if sugar cane and sugar beets have spread to the point where the roadside stalls can still use sugar, will the price of maple sugar be affected? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact," Kerry smiled tiredly and tiredly, he had been connected for a few nights without real sleep, only restless, short-lived meditation "The king of the jungle, after savoring the sugar of sugar and sugar beet, ordered the export of maple sugar to be reduced to one-third of the original one. 'Since those humans already have sugars that are more suitable for them', That being said," he stretched his limbs, lying loosely on the sun-drenched deck, and pulled down his hood to cover his eyes. The sly look made Kremar think of him. A hamster, "So now, our sugar can be exchanged for ten times more material than before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"喔!" Kremar Mingming Shouted low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you think that the lich is so versatile, do you think that the elves are so hateful because they are so beautiful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The sun is really warm, the soul of the outside world is lazy, it is very suitable for a sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said so, he did the same, lying on the deck, on the right is his Mithril Staff, the ruby ​​is like burning in the sun. A flame, and the two steps on the left are his friend Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sprite jumped up to see them, went on again, and after a few breaths, he jumped up again and did not shelter in Krimall. Two pieces of cleaned laurel leaves were placed on the eyes, and the shade brought by the leaves and the subtle laughter of the elves gave the souls of the outside world peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
