			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," has been whispering, praying to her goddess for a healing nectar suddenly issued a weird syllable, seen by everyone When she was at her, Fro's pastor instinctively stepped back, but obviously, she was no longer so nervous, or finally let her curiosity pass the jealous heart, after a short hesitation, she decided Asking my own question - before she spoke again, she unconsciously licked her lips: "But you said that you want to be a blacksmith," she honestly pointed out: "But if you really say it, just pass you. The hands of ordinary steel will rust, then how do you make a living through this profession?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Tyre Knight vowed that he never thought of this problem - because a knight who can get the favor of Tyre is not favored by the lord or valued by the king. Rarely will need to rely on their own strength and hands to make a living in the bleak end - in general, there will be only ordinary knights who need this, they often lose their land and property in the contest or war Armor and horses exchanged as mortgages, if they can't get a little compensation from others, then there is only one poverty-stricken situation to meet him. They must engage in another profession that does not require armor and horses to fill themselves and their families. The empty stomach, and the most common choice is to be a blacksmith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important income of the blacksmith is not as we misunderstood, from the farmer’s hoe and pot, few farmers can afford a shovel, plowshare Or the scorpion, the iron pot will only be seen on the stoves that are in charge, and the poor and slaves can use stone pots or clay pots. Therefore, the blacksmith's biggest customer is nothing else, that is, the knight and the soldier - the soldier's spear tip is iron, and the horse's four hooves are also tied with iron palms. In other words, the locks and armor of the knight, the helmet must also be Less, the iron fittings on the bow, what about the arrows? What about shortswords? What about wide sword? Even the daggers used by the knights to eat. It also needs to be built with the best iron, and which blacksmith can understand their mind and needs better than someone who has done the knight? Thinner, thicker, how to deal with joints. What is the most appropriate distance between the rivet and the edge? What is the relationship between the length of the sword and the user's arm and height? The engraved pattern should be as deep as one or two to withstand long-term wear and tear and not affect the firmness of the armor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say that a good knight may not be a good blacksmith, a blacksmith will be a good knight, this sentence is a bit exaggerated, but Birdwin I know that some old blacksmiths know more about weapons and armor than many knights who are more important than some who value their names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the friends of Birdwin, there is a good man who is brave and good at war. After being caught in a rare cold for a hundred years, he had to withdraw from the army after he had six toes and three fingers. He had a small seal like a button, but because he did not want to leave the Thunderbolt and was entrusted to others, he was in Thunderbolt. The wife, gave birth to a child, and then opened a blacksmith shop, especially good at creating wide swords and triangular arrows... Bywin did not know if he was still alive, or was already in the tunnel full of stench and greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows who made the first chuckle, but Kerry is following the laughter, then Mei Mi, and then to Bedwin himself. . He smiled and put the branches that had been baked by the flame into the fire. Finally, the thief Gülen, he held his arm and lapped his knees. It was a smile that was twisted after the corner of his mouth. It was a bit uncomfortable, but it was indeed a The smile is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit embarrassing, especially for Baldwin, but it’s nothing bad, at least it temporarily drives away the indescribable sorrows. , depression or fear of an unpredictable future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Magic Horse, they left Norman’s king and pursuer far behind – about three hundred miles away. . Kerry Ben signaled them to stop, and Kreima tore the reels, cast a transfer spell, and randomly route them anywhere within a hundred miles. Fortunately, they were not sent to the direction of the king, but fell into an inaccessible valley, and then they continued to drive the magic horse all the way according to Kerry's instructions until the magic contained in the obsidian statue was Exhausted - because there are spells that can find the direction of the transfer, this way of travel seems cumbersome and useless but is the safest and safest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally they came to a stream. At the end of the creek is a village. The appearances like Baldwin, Plum and Glan are not so suitable for a sudden appearance. The people unanimously decided to take a break from the little woods and make arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we enter the village?" Meimi asked uneasily, grabbing the cloak - the one that the Elf Ranger found from the pocket, the cloak of the elf Aesthetics and toughness are impeccable, that is, not very warm - the elves can keenly capture the warmth and chill of a feather or a drop of water, but they can also resist the burning sun and front Sharp cold, so the requirements in this regard are not so high, this cloak gives Meimi more comfort than its practical value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not so fast." Ranger said that as a believer in Su Lun, a kind and powerful ranger, Kerry has received many copies. The reward instrument, "The reward instrument will first be handed over to the lord and the consul, who will send a messenger to inform the knight of the news, after which the knight or the governor will ride a horse, or a donkey in a village and a village. Run--Reading the contents of the document to the villagers, this process must be at least ten days or more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is there in the reward book?" Gülen asked, his eyes flashing in an unpredictable light in the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't have it," Mei Mi said without thinking, "You will escape alone, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief hit her in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin stood up, and Kerry was unhappy to put his hand on his "Starlight" and "Silver Crown" and was spinning The fish's Cremari was shocked, and the fish fell into the fire and splashed a red star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be too nervous," said Gülen, smiling scornfully, staring at the plum as the snake stared at the bird trapped in the lair. "I am right." She is not malicious," he said. "On the contrary, I saved her, before you - I beat you," he said to Mei Mi. "Just to remind you, you are not smart, so don't play only smart people. A trick to play - you can use your head and anything else to go... He," he glanced at Baldwin. "Or they are flattering, but don't want to use me, I am the leader of a thief guild branch, and I can't stop anyone who wants to kill you. Or you think one of them is willing to guard a Fro priest forever. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey pale, the thief's that is not merciless, her mouth is full of bloody smell, but also lost a tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Kremar turned his head and looked at him with surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will," Bird said calmly. "I will put her under my protection. Thieves, don't let me see the second time." Otherwise, my wide sword will take the first step and cut your hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to thank you for not cutting my head?" Gülen stood up With your hands on your waist, "you may have to find the sword and knife you can use first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will betray us?" Messer shrank and asked, nervously pulling the corner of the cloak: "He will not go to the lord here... What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He won't," said Kremar, who said that Baldwin was dissatisfied with Gülen. Mayme made Kreima feel very uncomfortable: "I am looking for him." He said, pull the cloak Out of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was watching him go out. Sighing from the fire, it has long been a black charcoal, a fish that smells bad, "even for himself," he said softly: "Glan will not do this - there must be a reward The two people will only be him and Bywin, maybe you, but I and Kremar? The new king will not do that - he will not forgive him because Gülen sold us. He also knew that Gülen was not the murderer who killed his son, but he did not want to admit that he had made a mistake, and he was fooled by fools, although in the future he might come up with several times of gold coins in exchange for the real murderer. Life. But it’s only Gülen who kills his son. Gram knows this very well. He won’t vote for himself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——True Glad you are not too stupid, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The greedy and idiotic Fro. The Lich said that sharing her with her for a while, I am really worried that your brains will be absorbed by her - after all, she lacks this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Ha, the soul of the opposite world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Are you aware of it? She is constantly calculating you, she wants to drive away Gülen because he is only a threat to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- But Gülen did save her, and the soul of the opposite world said sadly. At that time their attention was almost on Birdwin. But he also saw the location of plum and thieves. Obviously, to avoid the ghost lizards, he knew from Kerry Ben that the carrion lizards could walk through the rocks and corrode with the venom in their mouths. Living creatures, let it die as soon as possible for them to be big and fast - the place alone can't climb up alone, she can't even go down on her own, and on the way to escape the kingdom, with Her inconvenience is not someone else, it is a thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The best that Pastor Fro is good at is ungrateful. Maybe she is still complaining that the thief has ruined her plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Plan? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The gods are on, Fro is on, the lich says sarcastically, have you not noticed? She has different general ideas about Baldwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world has opened his mouth in the sea of ​​knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——God, he said seriously, where did she find out the free and energy! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I am also very surprised, the Lich said, if there is a chance, please remember to keep my head for me, I will cut it open to see It is different from other heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they heard the screams of thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar immediately rushed over, and he found the thief under the brown bear's ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their residence is the brown bear. After a winter torment, this bear with a bear is in desperate need of a lot of food, the Elf Ranger and It talked many times over and over again - he was not a druid, the symbiosis was only a scorpion, and it was only a little better than humans in this respect - after enduring several loud screams and awkward threats, they finally reached a preliminary Compromise - brown bears live in the woods with bears, and the elves evoke branches and vines, which produce sweet and juicy fruits and berries, and a decaying pine filled with mushrooms and fungus that are as big as palms. Kremar casts a spell and fishes nearly a hundred fat fish from a dark, icy lake. The fish they eat also come from here. Birdwin borrows the elf's bow and arrow for it. Shot a hive hanging high in the middle of the cliff - and humans and elves have an oval cave that borrows only one day and one night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because the thieves just stood by and watched the whole process, the brown bear remembered this human being, when he stared at a group of wild ducks resting in the bushes by the stream The bear has caught up with him when he wants to give himself a fragrant roast duck. It thinks that the prey that this human being captures is also one of its rents. When the thieves prepare to take a few ducks back, The angry mother jumped out without warning, and waved him to the ground and sat on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf who arrived after Kremar was simply crying and laughing. He gave the duck to the mother bear and made some effort to finally get the thief. Out of its ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief’s face was touched by the therapeutic potion that Krimeral sent, and his ribs creaked during the healing process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
