To read the book ww·1kanshu<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand knew nothing about what happened in the Temple of Fro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting sun hangs at the junction of the water and the sky, the blue sky and the calm sea surface create a red-like flame like a flame, and the thick clouds are strange. The familiar shape is like a group of giants holding weapons to closely confront each other with the last afterglow, and behind them, the sparse star river and the light new moon have outlined their outlines in a purple-blue background. The sea breeze lost its original heat, became warm and affectionate, and passed over the cheeks of human beings. The seabirds who homed in this kind of gliding slowly in this kind of warm air, cut the air, their sounds sounded like a Only the loud flute is blowing a few bright trebles repeatedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan is going to be a pub that has been around for nearly 50 years on the side island, just like the blunt pub in Point Harbor. This pub with the "single-legged" sign also has an intermediary and sales business. It has a fat but glamorous hostess, let Gülen see that her body may not be more than he saw. How much is the sea magic, but her movements are even more agile than the sea magic. The wooden tables and stools in the pub are like the roots of the jungle. No one knows what their cheekbones, calves and ankles are. I will squat on it, but when she shuttles, even the squirrel can hardly match her dexterity and freedom - still holding a grilled squid with a few plates, whale patties And a large tray of ale and light wine in gallons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are pirate thieves in her pub, and occasionally I can see the apprentices of the sorcerer, the thieves have to take up the vast majority - but the thieves appearing on the Longhuo Islands There are only three kinds, one is a fool idiot who claims to be a thief. Their poor methods and skills make them want to run errands in the thieves' guild, but they are only scared by tattoos, fierce faces and deceptive bullying. The dealers who are not familiar with Longhuo Island are the second ones; the second is not the exiles who have been defected from the guild for various reasons. It’s because of the old age, or the poor wounds that are hard to heal in the mission (if the guild thinks he is not worth a higher treatment) and the poor worms expelled by the guild, of course, this is rarely, thieves There is almost no concept of old age, but if you can see a thief with wrinkles and hands and feet shaking, you must be careful, even if they seem to be going to mourn the wasteland in the next moment, it is also a head that has been smashed. Viper. If you want to read the book www.1kanshu, even if you can't live, they can bite your key points with sinister poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third one is a strange thief who has never received any guild solicitation. They originally had a very good identity, or they used to be pastors or knights, but in the ******, they instead It is more fierce and cruel than the thieves that people are familiar with. The talent they have not lost is even more powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, sitting at the side of the small round table today, the small round table he occupied is the closest to the hearth, the warmest. The closest to hot soup and barbecue, people only have the strongest person to sit there by default. There is also a bar. The person sitting there is not trying to hire someone but waiting for someone to hire. Gülen has been familiar with these people. He walked straight through the damp and sultry crowd. The hostess of the pub, people called her "puffer fish." Behind the bar, lazily wiped a silver cup that was as big as a normal male head. The silver contained in the silver cup was not pure, and some places even produced embarrassing rust spots. The depression inscribed with the pattern is red and black, and it is not fat or blood. The cloth used to wipe the glass is very thick, but when the hostess of the pub puts down her hand, Gülen discovers that it is her velvet chest. clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long time no see, honey," she rudely and intimately said: "Is finally willing to come back from your sweet peas?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a bit too embarrassing to say this," said Gülen, pulling her hand and kissing her on the back of the soft, thick hand. Well, to be honest, he felt that his entire face was printed on the flesh: "Swear to Mask, I really have something to do - I will run to you as soon as I finish, Look at my clothes with sea water and blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His words are of course not credible, but the "puffer fish" is still artificial. Laughing a few times, this is also a kind of tacit understanding of the insiders. "It seems that I have to ask you to have a drink, what do you want? My dearest, how about blood wine? Or is it honey?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood wine," Gülen said: "But don't add beet sugar inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong with sweet mouth?" "Blowfish" dissatisfied, but still gave him a large glass of blood red wine - blood red wine was added during the brewing process Wine, but in the Longhuo Islands, even if you don't add fresh blood, you can't really have blood and red wine. The "puffer fish" hesitated, and chose the latter among the guinea pigs and the small petrels. They were all kept in a well-woven cage. Haiyan is more expensive and scarce. The key is that Gülen is not only a frequent visitor, but also a generous frequent guest, and she knows that Gülen’s owner is the new lord of the side island. Gülen is working for him unless she does not intend to continue. The East Crown has lived, or she will not offend such a guy.壹Reading·1kanshu<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She grabbed a black-headed gold-faced petrel, twisted its neck with one hand, then lifted it up, and the blood flowed into the wine glass from the petrel's coffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have any fancy people?" By pushing the glass, the "puffer fish" is close, the pepper crab she eats at dinner The mixed smell of honey rushed up, and Gülen set a few people from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not needed for the time being," Gülen said. He will leave after a few months. He doesn't want to bring the thieves together, but instead let the other guy He occupied the position of the leader when he was innocent, "but you seem to have a new guest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand is talking about sitting on the hearth The man on the side, he gave Gülen a feeling like Kreima, who appeared in the port of Pointyman - he wore a thin black silk coat, and the same texture of the cloak hangs on the legs casually, without the gold collar With a mask - because the thief god Mask is also known as the black mask, many thieves will wear masks to show their identity when needed, but the uninvited guest may wear a mask far more than a thief All the possessions that can be owned - it is a black skull mask that covers the forehead from the forehead to the cheeks, forming a beautiful arc at the nose. There was no space left in the eyes, but it was polished to an almost transparent level. When you look inside, even the color of the iris can not be distinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A guest with outstanding skills," "The puffer fish" seemed to leisurely wipe the bar, squirming lips and said: "Only three days, But the thief who fell at his feet could almost fill my pub."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan snorted slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How," said "Puffin", "Would you like him to have a drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of expensive wine often represents the intention of recruiting and hiring, and Gülen does not want to be born or not at this time. But just as he wanted to refuse, the stranger looked up and their eyes crossed in the darkness, and Gülen found himself suddenly changing his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please ask him to have a bloody red bar." Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the anti-theft part, which will be revised around 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what happened in the Temple of Fro, Gülen knew nothing about it, the setting sun was hanging over the junction of the water and the sky, the blue sky and the calm sea A red-like red flame, the thick clouds present a strange and familiar shape.

This pub with a "single-legged" sign also has an intermediary and sales business. It has a fat but glamorous hostess, let Gülen see that her body may not be much smaller than the sea magic he saw, but her movements are even more agile than the sea magic, in the pub The wooden tables and stools are like the roots of the trees in the jungle. No one knows what their cheekbones are, when the calves and ankles will squat, but when she shuttles, even the squirrels It's hard to compare her dexterity and freedom - or while she is holding a grilled squid with several plates, whale patties, and a large tray of ale and light wine in gallons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are pirate thieves in her pub, and occasionally I can see the apprentices of the sorcerer, the thieves have to take up the vast majority - but the thieves appearing on the Longhuo Islands There are only three kinds, one is a fool idiot who claims to be a thief.

The dealers who are not familiar with Longhuo Island; the second one is not the exiles who have been defected from the guild for various reasons, such as Gülen, because they are old and weak, or they have suffered in the mission.
