It doesn't need to get too much knowledge for the birds. It just suffices to know that this place is no longer suitable for rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar’s job today is to clean up the elves from the near-river area that has become chaotic due to the slippage of the rock mass – the broken gravel A large piece of cracked maple tree that is in its infancy is crushed and a small nest of water rafts is blocked; at the upper end of the cot, there are several rock entangled by the roots of the tree, in order to avoid greater harm. The elves want to remove them completely; the caster first moved a lot of soft soil, pebbles, extending the entire area of ​​the cot to the beach, and then using a small spell to make them greasy - The big man, which was originally not so safe, was pushed by the big man who was released after the roots were cut, and went along the newborn trampoline to the Star River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river suddenly became muddy, and there was a strange scar-like bulge on the flat riverbank. The elves grabbed the vines and slowly descended along the landslide wall. Use their short swords and daggers to puncture each of the wide or narrow cracks along the way, looking for fish that have the potential to cause a second landslide. Their movements are light and elegant, and they are joking with each other, not No elves have been buried by the mudslides of the second landslide - but as long as they are dug up in time, there is basically nothing to lose except clothes and self-esteem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill’s knees in front of the cave in the water, which was originally a good location between the two roots of the cracked maple tree, only from the Starlight River Ten feet, the female elf's fingers sway gently above the approximate hole position, sensing the breath of life - the otter usually leaves several holes, one of which will lead directly to the river, but now they seem to be completely The land was buried - a small, impetuous voice came from a place, and Il's fingers stopped on it and began to dig up the dirt and gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, she can clearly feel the vibration under the soil, perhaps knowing that she is going to be saved, the following small creatures are more and more eager and violent It crawled the earth and shouted loudly. Although the sound became blurred and low after passing through the soil, the elf's ears could capture every detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Kreima walked over and looked at Ily curiously, she was kneeling there, her fingers inserted In the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little child," Il said. "I think it should be a leeches. I want to help it out, but it seems to be hurt, so It's getting a bit violent—do you have a spell that makes it quiet?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Wait, the lich grabs before Krymar nod . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——No, no, promise her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Is there any problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——She is testing you. Maybe after a while she will ask if you have a spell that is not relevant to today's work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar cast the spell, and it was affected by the spell. The docile and calm otter was quickly dug by Il, and she checked it. The body, found that its tail was pinched off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at other times, Ilva will finish the whole thing - wash the poor animal, treat it and let it go, but today She just handed it over to another elf - "Can you do me a favor again? Kremar." Il said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Oh, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill's help is very simple, cutting Ma Teng and Upi Man, the former is used to collect maple sap, the latter is kind of food, that is The ones that Kerry had once eaten for Kremar, the squid is a parasitic plant, the thumb of a male human is so thick, the black outer skin is peeled off, and the inner core is ground and dried. It is something like wheat flour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves and half-elves are mostly jumping on the branches with a machete or dagger when they are collecting them, but the caster's spells are the most efficient. Especially in places where trees and vines are too lush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Fenway. The Lich said that he was a nasty guy - he must have doubts that we are warlocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We are warlocks? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Only you are, because you are too stupid, the Lich says, if you want to be a mage, you have to live as long as a dragon. Only then, you must have a god who is good at self-abuse, like Lauvita, to be your mentor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-In fact, the soul of the outside world is careful to say that I can’t understand your metaphor. Well, maybe I understand a bit, but I want to know the most. What should I do next? Tell her I am not prepared for the spell? Before that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s not uncommon to encounter a violent animal in the gray ridge. As for cutting the vine - hey, it’s okay, let them know that you are a warlock. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- But you are a mage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The problem is that you can't cover the past with lies, peace of mind, idiots, I have expected this, just like my father's blood, if they are true If you ask, tell them that you don't know what it is. This is not a lie. You really don't know, this is fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- OK? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Yes, come up with your innocent idiot, and I promise that it will always be unprofitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What is the problem with the Warlock? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The magic of the warlock comes from the blood – the lich says, and this blood is almost all from the evil dragon, the devil, the demon, the orc... In short, for these elves, it is like a nightmare - so they are very sensitive to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-And you still want me to refuse to answer! The soul of the alien world screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You are just as it is, and they are only ashamed of their actions, the sorcerer laughs because they suspect a friend and want Forced him to say something he didn't want to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the soul of the opposite world sighs, because Ilva barely dared to look at his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar may have a secret, but he does not seem to want Concealed meaning - I am embarrassed, I have to admit that she has been affected by Fenway, but she will never do it again - even if the child is a warlock, what about it, like gray The managers of the ridge said that the warlocks are not all vicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood on the slightly swaying suspension bridge, hesitating whether to talk to Fenway, she told Fenway, Kreima not dozens of times It’s just a child. Before, now, and in the future, she will not have the so-called affection for him. After a while, maybe she will transfer this duty to a more suitable person, such as Kerry. this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fenway always has an indifferent and disdainful attitude towards this, he still hates Crimaar, and also refuses to mention the name of Il Hey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window inlaid with glass and crystal was shrouded in darkness, and Ilva knew that he must have studied it again in the closed, fluorite-lit room. The evil spell book that needs to be destroyed as soon as possible - she hesitated for a while, or turned and walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illu did not guess, Fenway did indeed in the room without windows, but he did not open the spell book, he stared at a bright light Mithril Mirror, which was placed at the bottom of the last box of spell material, with a delicate rune on the back. He drew his blood and a drop of devil's blood on the mirror according to the instructions on the letterhead. The blood was in silver. The mirror surface is constantly spreading, deepening, and deep enough to be able to absorb light - then it lights up again, and the slight light can only make Fenway see another person's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the Magic Star River shine for you and me, Fenway Master." said the person at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the Magic Star River shine for you and me, Master Demon." Fenway said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menro felt that he had made good luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
