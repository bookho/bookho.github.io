Of course, more people are for the value of the Medici family, just like every festival, interesting shows and excellent works of art can be rewarded with great rewards, and those who give the enemy’s first level to Lorenzo can Get 5 to 100 "Florin" (the most popular gold coin in Florence). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two archbishop’s entourage was so dragged by the two trainee monks from the Benedictine monastery near Badia Palace. . Each person received 150 Florin. Of course, in order to show respect for the government and the law, they were handed over to the "just players" and the ruling officials by the Medici family. After a formal trial, they were hanged on the window of the ruling palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pach’s widow and daughter will be sent to the monastery and will not be married for the rest of their lives. Of course, there will be no children. The Pazzi family assets throughout Europe were traced and confiscated in the following years, and their family names and badges were destroyed on the spot wherever they were found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bianca of the Medici family married the Guglielmo of the Pach family, she is still young, but asked if she would like to marry again in Lorenzo She refused, her eyes flashing with wisdom and tired of the world - her husband killed her brother, and her other brother hanged her husband on the window, even if there is no evidence Explain that Guglielmo participated in the conspiracy, but as long as his surname is Pach, he is guilty. The only thing to be thankful for is that they still have no children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernardo Bendini has not yet achieved his due ending, his portrait was painted upside down, slings clasped his feet... "Evil brings death to the wicked, and those who hate the righteous should compensate," Lorenzo whispered. Bendini’s whereabouts have been discovered by the Medici agents in Constantinople, who, while delivering the secrets, obtained permission from the Sudan at the expense of all the silk and spices that could be mobilized around him. The locals pursued the hunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ugly monster hidden behind the Archbishop of Pisa and the Pach family, offering them rare poisons to satisfy their own lusts in the name of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope Sykestus IV was furious, especially learned that the Archbishop of Pisa had been hanged, and Cardinal Rafaelo di Riariodi was After Dicci was detained, the successor of the apostle Peter did not hesitate to confiscate the property of the Medici family and threatened Florence. If he did not give Lorenzo to him, he would expel all related to the Medici. The teachings of the personnel will also usurp the teachings of the whole of Florence - in fact, Naples has joined forces with the Pope to prepare for the invasion of Florence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midici’s parents seem to be able to see the people happily putting the same noose around their neck. Before Jack had not completely turned into a corpse, he walked away from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He faltered - the Patki family's rebellion was like a thunderous plague, it took Juliano's life and took it away. Lorenzo's health, youth and gentle tolerance are a bit naive. Now his eyes are gloomy, gray and white, and the cheeks and loose skin can hang down to the wrinkled neck. These changes are completed in just a few days. Medici's parents don't seem to have to go through middle age. At the stage, the young and vigorous young people entered the deadly leap year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo goes through the dark corridor, down the stairs, through the atrium, the gallery, the hall, into the second courtyard behind the Palazzo Vecchio - There was an abandoned chapel, which was later converted into a sewing room for the women, but now it is used as a temporary delivery room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest room has nothing but a special shape production chair and a big bed for the maternal rest. The doors and windows are wide open, but the stove and hot water bucket And the Medici women who came to comfort and encourage the mothers still let the steaming here. According to custom, any factor around the maternal may interfere with the factors that hinder production. All the rings, laces, braids, buttons and shackles have to be taken away. All the women have solved the silk rope, ribbons, buttons, and the neckline is open, revealing bright, wet skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Production has been going on for a day and a night, and the mother who was hugged in the arms of a strong servant maid gave birth to a girl in a sitting position and no longer had the strength After giving birth to a second child, after a few hours, the fetus still in the mother's abdomen no longer visibly squirmed. The doctor made a judgment. The midwife took out the hook with a knife on the head. This is what any mother sees. When it comes to something that will be trembled, it will go deep into the *** and chop up the children that cannot be laid out. The mother who is tortured by her own child is the first to produce, although she is obviously Knowing and understanding what is going to happen, just as the women turned their heads to escape this bloody scene, the girl’s mother suddenly broke free from the maid’s arms, and she stood up and held her raised Abdomen - After a brief silence and a screaming scream, blood replaces the depleted amniotic fluid and wraps the baby down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lorenzo arrived, everything was over. His wife, Clarity of Orsini's family, cut out and greeted him and brought him to a room specially prepared for the baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twin children. Girls are born first, boys are born, very healthy." Clarice whispered, she has always been cautious, silent and courteous, But today Lorenzo can feel the joy and enthusiasm from her voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midici’s parents looked at her intricately. They also had a pair of twins six years ago, but they died before baptism because They did not elute the original sin, they were not able to bury themselves in the Medici family. The two small bones that hug together can only be secretly buried in the corner of the courtyard. From the time of Caesar, people here have this custom - they buried their dying children under their own eaves, thinking that this can make the child's soul peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliano’s twins were transferred into a room that was already prepared next door, dark and quiet, so that they would not come to a stranger suddenly The world is frightened. Through the glimmer of the gap between the gaps, Lorenzo’s eldest daughter and the servant are bathing the two children with a mixture of hot milk and red wine, and the fifth-year-old woman is applying hot water and honey to the child’s throat so that They can speak and swallow smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo walked lightly, the newborn baby was not very beautiful, the skin was red and wrinkled, and the soft baby hair was wetly attached. On the small scalp, the eyes are closed, and in order to avoid deformation of the hands and feet, they are wrapped in linen like a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the legacy of Giuliano de Medici and an illegitimate child, but wanting to obtain a legal marriage book is not for Medici difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lorenzo’s gesture, the maid carefully pulled up the heavy shackles hanging in front of the window, letting a thin line of sunlight swing on the cradle. He carefully looked for Giuliano's shadow on the baby's face, and he regretted that, apart from the tall nose and the slender and tightly closed eyes, he had not yet found a family belonging to the Medici. That part; perhaps because the mother is a relationship between the hair and the skin that is white to the weird Sisla, the color of the skin at the retreat of the blood is lighter than expected, and the contour of the face is very soft, but the color of the hair is very Deep - the child's mother should have a pair of light gray eyes, Lorenzo searched in his memories for a few impressions left in a short glimpse, he hopes the child can inherit Juliano's brown eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the newborns who were repeatedly harassed by the light finally opened their eyes impatiently, though only for a moment - except for Lorenzo, all the people present were sent out Breathing in general, being exclaimed by the death and death - the child's eyes show a moving pale gold under the sunlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, another child, the boy, opened his eyes, and some were still suspecting that they had hallucinations or parallax in the dark. The person has to admit the facts in front of him... The color of the other child's iris is more pure and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo is a little surprised, but that's it. The Medici parents who have tens of thousands of books have read that a local person if and Another combination of opposite sex, which is far away, makes it possible to give birth to a child with amber eyes. It is rare, but it is not a disease, nor is the devil doing it. And the color of the child's eyes will change with age, and maybe one day, it will become plain black or brown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But women, especially those who have no knowledge and knowledge, are panic-stricken, constantly crossing the chest and expelling the devil's gestures. If it wasn't for Lorenzo's entourage who had mastered the door in time, they would probably run out and mess around - it would be awful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can be alarmed?" Lorenzo calmly turned from the cradle and put his arms across his chest: "Is this?" Is it an evil color?” he asked in a loud voice: “Before Ludwig had not yet fallen from the sky, the Father used gold as his armor; the angel pointed to the holy city of Jerusalem, which the Apostles saw. The ninth cornerstone is the gemstone; obeying the Father’s intention, when Moses built the tabernacle at Mount Sinai, was he the cabinet that he made for the Lord, was it not inlaid with fine gold, the cherubim on both sides of the mercy seat? Isn't it made of gold, and the bottles, the lampstands, and the wine princes on the table are not all gold, hanging on the chest of the high priest, the badge of the name of the Lord, is it not the fine gold? Is it true that when Jesus Christ was born, the three doctors who came to worship him in the East did not offer gold, myrrh and agarwood as gifts? Herod used to exchange for him from Salome. Isn’t John’s life a yellow jade like a tiger’s eye? The shackles of Wickendes in St. Saragossa, the rabbit ear leeks of St. Ricardos, the buttercups of St. Anthony, do not have the most distinctive golden yellow? And, as a good, pure, sincere The symbol of piety, used to engrave the icon, grind the rosary, inlaid on the bishop's ring, is not the sun-like precious amber? What is it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
