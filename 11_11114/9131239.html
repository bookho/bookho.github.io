No one can understand the desert better than those who live next to the desert. Cruel and terrible, if the sandstorm is desert-like anger and temper, then the quicksand is the cold and viciousness of the desert hidden in the heart, especially the desert where the Grenada is surrounded. The quicksand has no omen in its creation or disappearance. Once it appears, it can also engulf an entire caravan. It is more terrible than a swamp. If it is unfortunately swamped, people can find it with their eyes and fingers. Opportunity, but in the desert, all you can see and catch is the sand and the quicksand here is more dangerous than any place. The warlocks have studied that the weight of the sand and the size of the particles just blend with the water. It becomes a sticky vortex with great grip, and the buoyancy of water is not enough to float a person. Once an ordinary person falls into a quicksand, it is impossible to climb out with his own strength. The caster can, but It must be fast. At this point, the warlock has an advantage over the wizard. After all, the latter can only cast spells that have already been memorized. If there are just no suitable spells at that time, then...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is becoming sharp, suppressing the power of Keou into the deep underground, his pressure is lightened, the lion beast is almost instinctively, and as soon as he lifts his wings, he plunges into the sky. From this height, he can clearly see that a beautiful round shape has been revealed below, the sand dunes are sinking, and the original depression is in the bulge, and eventually the sand dunes are assimilated into a flat sand and the curtain formed by the sandstorm has already been Clear and legible, they are like being invisibly hand-picked and closed in the middle, and the actors on this huge stage, that is, the sad desert barbarians, are coming to the curtain call."Chinese" novels..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keou suddenly has a little incomprehensible black-haired dragon, unlike his wife and son, he is happy to contact humans, of course, At that time, the barbarian was not so greedy and stupid, and those who were not Grenada had at least some human emotions. He did not feel that he would be deceived by a dragon, even if he was older than Keou. But there are always things that can't be concealed. Of course, I don't know that I have similar views with Captain Cobert and Elf Kerry. But he is also beginning to hesitate that if there is only an adult male, he may still be able to Use this as a war to comfort yourself, but he has seen women, and children on their backs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine will lie on the back of the eater, because the eater is like a giant wasp, so it’s not so humans riding on them, It’s better to say that they are half-slipped and half-squatted in their slim waist compared to a strong chest and a fat abdomen, but this is nothing to her, just like the Normans in the highlands of the North, both men, women and children are good at driving horses. In that way, they also learned how to ride on the arachnid and hunt for prey from the time of toddler. This time she gave up everything, her hands and fingers were deeply embedded in the forelimbs of the spider beast. Where the body is connected, the place is like a curved exoskeleton that is specially prepared for humans. It connects the nerves. When they can't make a sound, they can press the finger to make the spider beast understand what they mean.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the eater is not following the human command, but obeying instinct and running desperately, the speed of the sandstorm is so fast, and It’s so stubborn, it doesn’t change direction, and it doesn’t weaken. When the wind winds over the sand, it’s like a needle stuck in a spider beast and human body. Jasmine is not covered by a headscarf and clothes. Blood is dripping, but that is not the most fearful for her. What makes her fear is that the speed of the eater is slowing. This is not because they have lost their strength in the long flight. Those sands continue to Strike on their membrane wings, although the membrane wings of the eater are not so fragile, but they are life-giving, composed of flesh and blood, jasmine is not seen, but it is heard that those membrane wings are being shredded at first Some small holes that the mortal eyes can't detect at all, then the small holes are connected together and become narrow slits. The gaps are slowly torn apart under the double vibration of the wings and the wind and sand, and finally break... they In the wind, a shrill scream was heard. When a broken film wing fell on Jasmine’s face, she grasped it tightly. Now she can only pray to the gods they once said, and pray that the spider beast can persist. At the end of the desert, there is a limit that sandstorms can't pass. When it comes to gravel, they can stop and rest. Maybe most of them will lose their spiders, but as long as they have eggs in the belly of the spider. Then their tribes can continue<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But jasmine is a bit reluctant, her eater is her own from an egg to become an adult, not as elders like most people The worm was taken in her hand, but there was a baby in her arms. He was the grandson of an elder and his only relative. The elders fled with them in the sandstorm, but his eater had somehow rioted. He was taken to the sand... The specific situation Jasmine is not known, she only remembers that the old man shouted loudly at the baby, desperate and sorrowful, but no one dared to stay under the threat of sandstorm, maybe there was a bit of anger if they After obeying Moussa’s decision, there is no need for such a raging and miserable escape.Only Jasmine swooped up the child, the elder's eyes were opposite to her, but the moment was too short, and it was too short for Jasmine to read anything from it, but Jasmine thought he regretted it, everyone in the tribe Regret<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby is between her and the back shell of the eater, the eater's back shell is extremely hard, and there are raised thorns, even if there is a thick gerbil skin, this child must feel very uncomfortable, and Jasmine didn't have her hand to hold her. She could only lower her body and wrap her child in her arms, but he didn't cry and didn't struggle. His little face was wrinkled, his eyes closed, and the sand was still in him. A few clear blood marks were left on the soft cheeks destroyed by the wind and sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is so soft and so hot, even if he is separated by clothes, the strength of his small heart can make Jasmine clearly feel She bit her teeth, she knows that she shouldn’t cry now, there is no time and place to allow her to cry, but her chest is bloated, and the uncontrollable acidity of a stock is pouring out of her throat and nose. He lives, she wants to live, but the desert is so big, and the speed of the sandstorm is so fast. It seems that the fate feels that Jasmine is not desperate. She heard the cries of the people, but not the shout of joy. It was a cry of horror, a spider eater that surprised her to come face to face, and the barbarian above had a face that seemed not so strange. Jasmine seems to have seen him at a tribal gathering. At the same time, Jasmine has already seen the white line, not the one that pursues them, but the interception before them that they are being sandstormed. Two sides of the interception, this is not a natural punishment, Moussa is right, the Grenada people did find a way to control the sandstorm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The desert barbarian has a total of ten tribes," Mitt said. "We seem to see only seven now."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the third squad smashed a slap to Mitt and the Lich, and given that they are all in the air, the lich casts a spell so that they don’t have to Dialogue in the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two tribes have disappeared into the sandstorm," the third captain said respectfully: "Our knight is making sure it is 'clean', and another A tribe seems to force their spiders to dig into the caves, they are hiding inside, expecting to be lucky from the sandstorm." Here he smirked evilly: "Our warlocks have repeatedly burned there three times with flames." "He opened the palm of his hand and let the two of His Royal Highness watch. With the vision of the dragon and the half-elves, Mitt and the Lich could see what it was without any effort. It was a turbid glass, like amber. Wrapped with insects wrapped in a blackened hand bone. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich’s heart suddenly jumped, no, no need to fear, he did not intervene in any spellcasting related to sandstorm or flame And the alien soul that may have problems with this is also suppressed by him in the deepest part of the sea, where he can only get the most vague information, then, the judgment he will make in the law of fear But wait, since he did not be punished when things happened, it shows that his actions have not been judged in the "bad acts" like the paladin of Tyre, they will also participate in the country. The war with the state, the ensuing death will not ignore the innocent people, but as long as they do not personally order or kill those people, their camp will not change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid being aware of the violations on him, the lich even cleverly played with the tricks in the words, he never clearly Point out how to annihilate every barbarian, but there will be those Grenada people who can't understand what it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he is evil, and hesitating for the death of a mortal baby is neither sympathetic nor reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity," Mitt said. "I prefer to watch them mourn and die in my brother's spells." His words mean very much. Understand that Gredi is willing to enjoy death and despair, the more life that can be offered, the more the Cremari will be able to get her favor as the host of this action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," said the Lich. "I'm sure I can get the most."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he didn't appreciate Mitt's quirky look, but raised his hand. The fire rushed into the sky between his fingers, and it would be immersed in a gray-yellow sky by sandstorms, just between a few breaths. The sandstorm suddenly weakened, and the speed of the barbarian who had fallen into despair thought that he had encountered a miracle, but the smile had not yet appeared on their faces and was regained the position by fear, after the falling sand They are the lions and their knights. They hover in the air to form a ring, or that is a noose, and this noose will be placed around the neck of each barbarian. Dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spider eater is trying to rush outward, but an eagle lion is immediately rushing past, like all cats Like the animals, the lions and beasts used two claws to hold the front and back of the eater, and only slightly used force to disconnect it from the waist. The barbarian on the spider was on the ground, his waist. There is a golden machete in it, indicating that he is an elder. But in the eyes of the Grinada people, he was just a boring plaything, because he did not dare to pull out the enemy even the weapon, but the knight did not kill him, but let him squat on the sand. Crawling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
