			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amos, more correctly, his father is obviously very urgent and important about this matter, he did not even prepare and raise the black hair caster Time - he sent his son, his boat and his warlock, the warlock is the one they met when they saw the lord of the East crown, she was as graceful as when she first met. It’s beautiful, especially her body has a halo that women like Mei Mei can’t match – not only a beautiful young woman, but also a powerful warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world always feels that there is an unspeakable familiarity in her body. This feeling he encountered in the previous enemy, no no no It doesn't mean the vague threat, but the other - his eyes stay on the red warrior of the female warlock and the waist and hip. It is not the hair color of this plane, but so far. They have seen three red-haired women in succession - especially this red hair, which is different from Leona in the same way as polished copper wire. Their red hair is like being soaked by blood and flame. of. Although the hair color of the female warlock who appeared on the side of the island with Drake is not as pure as that of the lady - the hair color of the former is dark and gray, while the color of the warlock of the East Crown Lord is brighter and more vivid. But when they smashed her round hips like a tumbling wave, even the singer Kerry couldn't help but reveal a hint of appreciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because she left the main island, or perhaps because she appeared as a warlock today, she did not wear a silky silk gown, but I chose a crimson warlock robes. The sorcerer's robes are slightly different from the mage's robes. The sleeves and the hem are shorter, and the sleeves are above the wrists (unlike the sleeves of the mage draping to cover their hands), the hem It is similar to the white robe that Tell gave to Cremal, that is to say. Wearing this robes can be worn over the knee boots without making people feel uncomfortable, and there are openings in the front, back, left and right, it is said that because the warlocks are better at the relationship with the likes of violence and solving various affairs than the Master. Therefore, the Warlock Robe is better than the Master Robe in not affecting the body movements.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is wearing a lizard leather belt with Mithril. There is a delicate pocket on the belt, which is very small. If it is just an ordinary velvet bag, it can only hold the egg. The surface of the bag is painted with dragon words, pressed against the plump thighs. The scrolls and the syrup are heavy, and the back of the waist is filled with a fine gold dagger, and Mei Mei's eyes can hardly be removed from her wrists and neck, even if they are not the magical seal of the rune. The jewels that are as big as the eggs can be said to be a coveted wealth - and the warlock's line of sight is almost in the next moment to look at her. If it is not the thief who takes a step forward, forcing the priest of Fro to move his body. Then the invisible blade may pull out her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mi’s heart violently jumped, and she knew that the thief had saved her again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock showed a sweet smile, of course, facing Kremar, she could say that she was interested in this young mage, they I have seen it once in the hall of the East Crown lord, but the meeting was too short. Shortly after she didn't get much useful information, then on a moonlit night. She perceives that another person with a dragon's blood is invading her field, which makes her very unhappy, so she gives up sleep, walks into the courtyard, and casts a peep into the distance with the water in the silver plate held by the statue. The spell, she saw the battle between them - also recognized her family, Baita's Ruiyite, it seems that she is not too satisfied with the little city, but her claws are too long . In particular, she stretched out on a site where the bloodline was deeper than her, and she put a spell through the water tray. This spell doesn't have anything to look at, and it doesn't pose too much threat. But for those weaker families, there was an immediate effect, so she immediately fled with her new lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this - Beavis disciple, a...mage, she thought, the East Crown lord has assured her that his property, body and reward All belong to her, the lord only needs to take back the side island, the other has never asked - for this reason she also carefully observed this wizard with a bloody elf in that battle, she is deeply regretted by the black hair caster It’s not the fledgling “chicken.” He’s calm, calm, accurate, and can endure or ignore pain. The last point is very important. When the warlocks are apprentices, their mentor will practice spellcasting and cursing at them. When you torture and disturb them in a variety of ways, each warlock apprentice must be burned by a candle, pierced into the eyes by a silver needle, and bitten by a poisonous ant. Dancing the tongue and fingers will be allowed to start learning the system's spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the inside of the other side, she feels that this little black guy is more suitable to be a warlock than the mage, but unfortunately he was not born Grenada, or a newcomer who can make her wary may have to add a name, or it is possible, he will be killed by his companion before the first cast, or for some reason (sometimes just fate) The masterpieces, for example, because they have been eliminated by a violent mentor, or unfortunately have been chosen as sacrifices and experimental bodies, sometimes the mentor of the Master Tari is not too picky, and the one that catches that is that - Unless he or the soul is engraved with the symbol of the mentor, it means that he already belongs to someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, at the last moment, she will cast a spell to determine it. It is said that he has followed his mad master to find a killing tutor. The lichs of their wives and children, they even chased the seventy-seven islands - even the dragons are not willing to set foot, and his mentor can finally end up with his enemies - she has not seen Weiss, but she is able to get information about Beavis, although almost all of his things before entering the Seventy-seven Islands, but also can be measured from Beavis's cast level - Beavis is a powerful mage But his strength is not enough to fight against a lich, then does he realize this, and even more, if he realizes this, what will he do? Beavis is the son of the Dragon Fire Island. His heart is not as good as his appearance. His temper is hidden under his love. At that time, there was no one who could comfort and suppress him. What would he do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do whatever it takes. She can imagine how crazy he is, then. Will he be crazy to sacrifice his disciples? It is entirely possible that the devil is always interested in pure and pure children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar may not know about it. However, she can always detect a strange sense of violation from his actions - for a master who left the mentor (still forced to leave halfway) but only two or three years, his growth rate is too fast, it is a bit faster Doubt - not that disciples can't surpass the mentor, but at least for a short time... almost impossible, the magic of the caster slowly grows with the passage of time, this is the rule of the magical galaxy, no It can be shaken, otherwise the warlocks of Grenada have already built their caster army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a possibility that Kremar is the son of a god. And this god has more than one descendant scattered in the plane. The descendants and descendants kill each other. The winner can take strength from the body and soul of the loser and grow rapidly, but if so, the elf around this wizard will not Nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It seems that our little cute has a lot of secrets that cannot be made public. The female warlock in the red robe said in her heart, but this is not a complaint. On the contrary, she is eager to try, no one knows better than her. There is a huge potential behind each secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can almost feel her blood boiling, she is eager to learn about this young brunette mage, from his body to his soul - she It is so urgent. Even the heart is twisting the pain, but she is not the lord of the East Crown, even if she does have his orders, but when Kremar proposed that it takes time to arrange the management of the side island, she still had to give up one step. , postpone the start of the flight until after sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The boating at night may be a bit wrong," she said. "But the island is so close to the main island of the East Crown. I don’t think we have to worry too much. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar only nodded slightly to her, where he was the owner of the side island. The warlock is nothing but the caster hired by his lord, and their status is not equal. Despite the fact that the two are in the opposite situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry Ben," the black-haired caster said, "Can you stay on the side island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has obviously hesitated. He understands the meaning of Kremar, his identity is special, and now they are facing different situations than before, and there is something that Baldwin reminds him - he can no longer look like a chicken mother. I have been watching Kreima, so it is not a good thing for him and for Kerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take Gosula," said Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar nodded, "And you," he turned to Baldwin: "Badwin, your knights and soldiers need you, if It’s true that we are forced to face situations that we don’t want to face...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will direct them.” Birdwin said that his arm is no longer It’s so swollen and sore, but he knows that he’s only a cumbersome thing for a while: “Three thousand soldiers can only form a threat in a blink of an eye – on the main island.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I feel a little bit of the feeling of the owner of the East Crown," Gülen said sarcastically: "He must have been short of sleep lately - I am going with Kremar... adults."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And me," said Yadell. "They know that I am a pastor who was expelled by the gods. I must be very happy that I can occupy this quota," he said. Blinking to Kremar. "Then there is one more." Mei Mi said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it won't be you." Leona said bluntly, although Mei Mi did not want to go to such a dangerous place, but still for this sentence I am angry: "Not me," said Leona. Her martial arts still have room for improvement. Another reason is the same as Kerry, Kerry is the sole heir to the king of the Silver Crown, and she is the Highland. Norman’s prince, even if she has used this identity in exchange for the forgiveness of Byrdwin, but more people are looking at the blood instead of a surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." Yadell turned his gaze to the corner of the room, always on the silent knight: "Repair?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Repair?" Birdwin asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing," said Xiu, "I will go to the main island with Master Craimar," he said with a slight slightness on his thin face. Smile: "Of course, I hope we can come back together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will be back." Yadell said happily: "I still have my beets." The land needs to be taken care of, and there are a few rabbits I have raised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure those rabbits will not light your beets?" "You should give them an iron cage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be back when I come back," said Yadel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the room suddenly became a lot easier. Although they were still worried because of the things that followed, they were relieved a little heavy, Leona Light Stroking Baldwin's shoulder, I don't know why, since Yadell opened his mouth, his emotions suddenly fell, others could not feel it, but Leona, who had been watching her lover, would not feel it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin extended his left hand and took the hand of the king, from the hand that was no longer as soft as a cloud, let him The heat and strength of peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is Badwin?" Maymi asked, "He The face may not look good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan glanced back, they had left the room very far, but he knew there was another elf and a half elf He thought for a while, and thought that the next words might make them heard. It would be extremely interesting: "Oh, Mei Mi, I really don't know what to say," he said angrily. "You are asking. The thing you loved before, or through your present lover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about that? Glan, you are not the first time I know that I am Luo's pastor, don't pretend to be a model, no one knows better about things between me and Byrdwin than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, simple I said that he is jealous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of you No, Mei Mi, tell the truth, you didn’t have that. Important, he is jealous of Yadel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Me rolled up his lips: "Because he can walk with Kremar?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t think that the relationship between Birdwin and Kremar is close, but it’s not yet close to this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the Cavaliers repaired." Gülen said: "Because the revision is a subordinate of Birdwin, but now it seems that he is more inclined to listen to Yadell. The instructions, but this is normal. When the soldiers and knights in Thunderbolt, including their families, were expelled, Baldwin was still struggling to survive. At that time, they were guided by Yadel, who surrendered to him completely. It is expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
