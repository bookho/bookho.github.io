			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 432 Black Market (3)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry is a The merchant, who has been working for the new king of Grenada three months ago - maybe some of us still remember him, he is the one who lost the entire caravan in the sandstorm but was lucky enough to have a life. Very ironic, the arrogant and intelligent savior is dead, his blood is sucked away by the gravel sand, and his body has long been the mouth food of those monsters, but the one who has been merciful to him The unfortunate people who came down are still alive – the loss of a caravan will make him hurt, but as long as the new king does not recover his trust, as long as three times, no, he can lose the black market twice. Get back twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this time the black market has been invited by more than ever before, they are either the spokesperson of the Grenada Wang Ting, or both The identity of the warlocks and merchants, or the leader of the guild, and some of them are believed by the Grenada people to be credible, that is, as tested before, the tested outsiders are brought in by Larry’s messengers. The dwarf's mansion is gathered under the swaying jujube trees, gum trees and acacia trees. They are surrounded by roses and jasmine, and surrounded by lush boxwood, myrtle and mother-in-law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Larry who is waiting for this?" A businessman asked, is there a more honorable guest than them? You know, standing here is eagerly inquired by the new king. Larry is a newcomer. He shouldn't be so crazy. Even if the new king didn't punish him for losing his entire caravan. But no one answered his question. In the absence of immediate interests, the Grinada people are best at protecting themselves. There is a sudden commotion in the crowd. Some people in red robes are alert. Retracted into the wide sleeves, while others placed their fingers on the protective runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be nervous, don't be nervous," Larry said, hurriedly out of the hall of the hospitality, he was short and in the desert. The wolverines are dry again, but this is only because of tension and panic. After returning to Grenada, he continued to eat and drink for several days. He used fat venison and cow's chest oil, sweet honey wine, and jujube to re-feed himself fat, although it has not been restored to the past. The form, but it seems to be not so bad: "They are my guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should tell us when you send out the invitation," A warlock who is a businessman is bored with annoyance: "A gray robe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forty thousand please forgive," Larry said, exaggeratingly For a moment, he laughed very stupidly, but no one would think so: "But it's just a gray robe, and we have more than twelve red robes here, here is Grenada, not another. Where is it, dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too strange to chat because of a special color robe?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is right, the king of Grenada may be the only one besides the seventy-seven islands, you can see the death Where the Master walks freely on the street, it is well known that many Warlocks have some ulterior motives with the Seventy-seven Islands, but in general, Necromancers are veritable dead houses, and where they appear often means this. The place is about to be conquered by plague, blasphemy and death - a small gathering of businessmen is not very suitable for laboring their noble toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, she, and him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Necromancer has taken off the black hooded cloak, revealing her grey robes, this gray robes hanging to the feet are silky, Compared to other dead spirits, the black and gray or soot of the rigid old-fashioned, its gray is more similar to silver-gray, with a metallic texture, in the fire like a stream of water under the moonlight, in the rim of the robe There are magic lines on the cuffs, which are cleverly hidden in the pattern of saffron. There is a bright red blood chalcedony hanging from her chest. The black texture inside is constantly changing. Sometimes it is like a shouting. Humans, sometimes like a monster with tentacles and claws - a small velvet bag on her dragon's belt, and her slender feet wrapped in soft salamander boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at this dress alone, if she is a pampered lord, some people will believe that if she is not, she should be beaten. Hundreds of faces and hands - from the latter, she is the same as the Necromancer who has been infiltrated in negative energy for a long time. Evil and gloomy are not because of her being a woman - she is so thin, The parchment-like crisp skin hangs on the protruding bones. The sharp cheekbones are like a dagger. The neck-like neck of the chicken neck is exposed, making it impossible to determine whether she is forty or eighty. Her nose spreads to the sides, almost half of the face, and the bottom is a colorless lips, even more faint and paler than the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the young man around her has an unusual beauty. He wears a black robe, but the black robe is inlaid with a gray edge. Gray robes rarely care about how their apprentices and disciples choose to wear them - as long as they are not annoying white robes, of course, if you must wear them, there is no big problem, as long as you can match them. power. Don't say it is a white robe, a gray robe or a black robe. If you can become a demigod lich, you will only get a false compliment if you are willing to wear a pink robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if they can, they are more willing to have their disciples to be able to score in peace and do not hurt their eyes, wearing the black robes of the established gray side, which can also reduce some Injury (although many times accidental injury can not be said to be accidental injury), in addition, the gray robe is also aesthetic and vanity, and sometimes it may be more sensitive than the mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gray robe is obviously one of them. She puts one hand in the disco of the disciple, revealing the finger of the ring, her disciple is almost She is about a foot and a third taller than her, but she still speaks slightly with her own tutor. When they move, he will also move to the mentor's slow pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several warlocks exchanged a meaningful smile, which is also common in the Warlock Tower, when an instructor’s apprentice or disciple has an outstanding look. When he or she is in shape, his/her tutor will not mind continuing a short relationship with them. This relationship is generally not very long, because it is like having a person too familiar with you is to send a knife to him. In the hands, and the mentor’s speed of being tired of new ones is much faster than the change of their robes - but those who have not yet become warlocks are always eager to see this relationship, others do not say, the tutor is choosing When you are in the product, you will put you in the last place - you will not feel wrinkles, stench and quirks unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People thought they were the guests Larry had to wait for, but no, Larry just eagerly expressed his sincere welcome and surprise to the gray robe - - But the people they are waiting for are not them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just before the gray robe frowned, Larry suddenly ran out, the atmosphere in the courtyard suddenly changed slightly, the disciples of the gray robe thought When moving the footsteps, the hand of the gray robe moved from his arm to his shoulder, the cold breath infiltrated into her robes from her fingertips, and the young male disciple immediately stood still, but a stinging numbness still made him Involuntarily exposed a little bit of pain. Dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry’s welcoming people let the people in the courtyard reveal a clear look. They are always swearing, and the warlock is a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world looks around - the house here is like a square divided by the cross, the line at the bottom of the square It is facing a row of narrow houses behind the colonnade and colonnade on the street, and behind them is a luxurious courtyard and mansion. The center of the cross is a square pool. The extension of the cross is a canal. Since the underground - the underground water does not automatically flood into the ground, the water in the canal and the pool is not exhausted all the year round, not turbid, and it takes a long time to cast magic to maintain, although Grenada is not lacking the caster, but Over the years, the cost may make a small king of the country go bankrupt, but these are all necessary. Gold coins, sometimes like swords, can also become a force to deter others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These drains remind the souls of the opposite world of the sanctuary of Rosada, but the canals and pools in the Rosada sanctuary only make people feel the morning light. The god's love and compassion, the water here is cold and dark, the light of the flame shines on the water, it is as dazzling as the falling gold, but the soul of the outside world just turns his head quietly - he sees the number The little red robe, just like the one he is wearing now, is red silk or velvet. Mittite next to him is wearing the red robe of the warlock today, instead of the chain and tights he is used to, indicating this time. He participated in the party as a warlock, but no one would be stupid enough to regard him as an ordinary warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet is set in the courtyard, people sit around the pool, with a smooth ivory mat underneath - from the exquisite craftsmanship of the Seris, they can The ivory is ivory like a thick group of hair, and then they are specially treated to make them soft like the bulrush, and then they are woven into a fine mat. For such a mat, the value of each foot is Mithril is the same, but no one will deny their value - touching their skin is like immersing in the water, but also like being breezy, unable to say comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them is the crepe of the gauze, the ice from the sea of ​​the North is placed in the silver and white porcelain, when the wind blows There, the chilly scent is broken down by the spun yarn, leaving only a slight and lasting coolness that neither makes people feel hot or cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
