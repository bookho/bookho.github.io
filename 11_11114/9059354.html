McGee replied in a rough voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you just need a dark environment," the Lich said, indicating that Baldwin had drunk the bottle of medicine: "My spells may help a little." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With you," McGee said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who used to be indifferently made a snap, and then, if the gnomes had once been to another plane, they might yell " Who shuts the lights," but now they only think that the sun is gone, or their eyes are smashed by the spells. The lichs hear a few repressed exclamations, the collision of necklaces and bracelets, silk and linen. The sound of friction, he waited for a while in the dark, until the weak fluorescence gradually floated, first Baldwin's lips and eyes, then the skin close to the heart. Let an ordinary human being see that he is like climbing a glowing vine, but these vines are not climbing outside his body but spreading in his body, silky, from thick and fine The heart radiates out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnomes who had gathered around Bywin have moved to the place they think is safe in the short darkness of the past, without the gnome and his own When the companions are close together, their little hands are pinched into fists. From the perspective of the secret silver or the fine gold chain hanging outside, it should be the rune seal in the caster, the powerful or intimate relationship with the above. When people have a few special magical tools like this, as the initiators, the gnomes have applied this power from the magical river to the extreme. Every piece of jewelry on them is hidden for one or two. Attack, protection, and transmission spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other hand is mostly holding a thorn sword, and the thorns used by the gnomes are naturally pocket-sized, saying that it is better to say that it is a thorn sword. It’s a slightly longer dagger, they are arbitrarily hung around the gnome’s waist, without a scabbard, but the gnomes cleverly put a layer of gold on them (the technique of gold on the fine gold has so far only been mastered by them), and Gemstones are placed on the handles, so that some people who don't know much about these creatures like humans will ignore the lethality of this gadget. You never imagine how a dwarf would make a weapon that only belongs to him. As far as the lich is seen, there are two spells that are not suitable for being seen by the Elf Ranger Kerry, and are attached to the little swords that are like a bee sting, and a thorn-like sword with a strangely twisted handle. This kind of handle lich has been seen in an apprentice of a red robe. What is special is that when the body is pierced, the handle will have venom from the tip of the sword. This method of poisoning is Sword on the sword is quicker and more reliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one who didn't move the position was McGee. He sat on the folding ladder with his pedals. He had a vicious smile on his face. When he overlooked his people, he did not see the warmth. Instead, he took a little regret. It seems that he did not die, which made him regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After holding your breath and watching the jokes of the tribes, McGee turned and hurriedly ordered: "Extend your arms, the left side, Also on the right. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the initial fear disappeared, Birdwin was also interested in the potion. This medicine made him cold when he touched his tongue. Trembling, this chill extends all the way to his stomach and then from the stomach to the place. He doesn't know how it works, but the black-haired caster has said that they are used to check blood vessels. Then the thickness of his distribution is different. What is the vine-like thing is his blood vessels? He looked down and looked at his own vines and covered his whole body in an orderly manner, but he could be seen blocked. With the entangled part, the stinking gnome pulled out a slender stick and clicked on those shadows. "Old wounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former lord of Thunderbolt nodded: "Yes, it was once caught by the claws of an orc." "While the treatment can reconnect the broken bones, muscles and skin, the surface will be smooth and smooth, but it will become fragile. It is like the fact that many retired soldiers and knights will still be there. It is the result of the itchiness of the bones before the arrival of the harsh winter or the thunderstorm. This is the result that the pastor can't change. The only way to make the pain really disappear is that the gods directly give or curse, like Gülen. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a lot of old injuries. McGee said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any problem?" "Bedwin asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some little troubles. McGee said that he used a small stick to poke the left arm of Birdwin's stretch. "Look here," he said, raising his voice. Birdwin turned his head and looked at it, but he was heavily pumped: "I let me." The tribes come to see this, what do you see! ? McGee said: "What can you see? Is your flash poop? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Baldwin heard the gnome of the gnomes, "Okay," he said without a good voice: "This has to be credited." For you, Kreima, I don't want to have such a glorious title. Do you think I can't see you laughing? Although very subtle, I can see, anyway, I am shining. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wants to compare the blood vessels of your left and right arms," ​​the Lich rarely had a hint of guilt. After all, a warrior really shouldn't have such a bad nickname that would make the enemy laugh and not retreat: "Every person's blood vessel distribution is different, but in the same person, his symmetrical limbs basically have a very similar blood vessel distribution. Your right arm has been cut off for a long time, its blood vessels are already Become deformed, they need to be sorted out, and the best reference is of course your left arm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will cut me?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...you can say that, peace of mind, my friends, gnome's sewing skills are still quite good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "As long as they don't fill the straw in the line, don't you just take it for granted? Your tone makes me think that I am standing in front of a red robe or gray robe."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He probably never knows how much he is from the truth The lich wants to, while reaching out to help McGee draw the direction of the blood vessels on Baldwin's arm with a Mithril nib, after all, the fluorescence is invisible in the bright place, and they are impossible in the light. Such a weak place cuts Baldwin's arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Lich gave Baldwin the above explanation, Birdwin wrinkled his nose: "So, then I can't take a shower for a while." Or you decided to cut me off today, the gods are on, I am not ready yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have not been hurt. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Injury is one thing, but lying there being a group of gnomes cuts apart is another matter," Birdwin sighed and said: " Or do you have a potion that can make me unconscious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the Lich draws an elegant on Baldwin's skin. The curve: "But you can't use it. If I don't understand it, you need to stay awake throughout the process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes immediately heard Bird The curse of Wen, they began to whisper, but not because of Baldwin, but they suspected that McGee had revealed their skills to a human being, when they put the protest on McGee. The dirty gnome shook his head with a very clear impatience still seen in this situation, and several gnomes immediately retired because his head was gray when he was shaking his head. The swarf and some small worms fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No,” McGee said. “Not all human beings are stupid, the elves are not stupid, the orcs are also, the dwarves are also, the gnomes are not the smartest and only intelligent race in the world, I thought I have said many times before. Do you still want to continue watching? Those who don't want to continue to participate can leave immediately, I won't shoot arrows behind you, although the gnomes are said to be very good at this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The gnomes who prepared to scream angrily swallowed words that had spilled their tongues, and none of them would go out. McGee’s father used to be the best and most intelligent craftsman of their ethnic group, but his head was a bit Rigid, after his death, the gnomes rushed into his room and ransacked his work and drawings, but no one could find anything that was truly valuable. He hid everything in McGee’s head. They are so precious that the gnomes are not willing to let a gray robe come to turn McGee’s brain, fearing that he has damaged something, especially when McGee decided to share some of them with them.  Rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the prosthesis that this human warrior needs, the most outstanding work of the gnomes is the mantle that the Eastern Crown lord mentioned. The arm, which is connected by a large and small, layered curved piece of nails, can be rotated and bent, and the fingers can hold things. The inside can also hide the bow and sleeve arrows, but McGee proposes The idea is more subtle, it can be said that it is bizarre, they are eager to see it immediately, installed on the warrior's residual limb, let them see how this can be said to be a worldly work in danger On the glow of the color. But in contrast, this prosthetic has more to connect with, in addition to controlling the nerves that operate, even the blood vessels, muscles and skin are included, which is also a new cross-domain for the gnomes. They even don't want to be afraid of this, which may cause the jealousy of the red robes (when they have to, they still have McGee). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it’s absolutely impossible to let them go now. As for whether McGee has said that the dwarves are also very smart, they can temporarily erase this memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you know this?" After the gnomes regained their silence, Birdwin whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mentor, Beavis, has been tracking a gray robe for several years," the Lich said softly. "He needs to know everything about the gray robe." Once, he almost caught the gray robe, and several times, he was almost killed by the gray robe, we used to go into the gray robe's residence, these are all I saw from a book that was left behind. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Birdwin really began to worry: "What about the book?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been destroyed."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great." As a paladin, Birdwin did not deal with the gray robe, although because he is a lord, he only needs to bear a small part of the work, "Don't look at the books, they are all evil," he paused. "Evil, but powerful. There are many people who are so tempted to think that they can gain strength from them, but they don't know that this power will end. Drag them into the abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw the black hair caster smiled in the faint light, he had to admit that Cremari had a Zhang belongs to the face of the elf. Although his eyes and hair are as dark as night, he laughs like Kerry Ben is very refreshing, but Birdwin always feels that this smile is especially meaningful, but he soon Throw this thought away, because the gnome's nails are licking him, that weird Lee's pain made him uncomfortable shaking a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." McGee took back the hand that had smashed the skin of Birdwin. There was a tangled blood vessel under the skin, maybe inside. There is still nerves, it seems that the next work will not be very simple, "Mage," he said: "Let it shine, we no longer need darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This time, even the sound of the ringing sound did not ring, the darkness faded silently, and the pale golden sunlight poured down. Baldwin discovered that they had just spent a lot of time, and the red star had moved from the center. To the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him, "Oh," he said. "You painted a tree on me." I also used two different colors of ink. In the lack of light, as a mortal Bedwin can not be distinguished, but when the light is sufficient, he can easily distinguish that it is a deep green and deep blood red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When is this to be kept?" The Dragon Fire Island is not a Thunder Fortress. The climate here is hot and humid. If you don't bathe for a day, you will find yourself stinky. Like a stranded and dead whale, or a pygmy McGee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ink is insoluble in water," said the Master. "You can throw yourself into the water, hot water, cold water, fresh water or sea water." All right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
