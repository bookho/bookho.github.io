The two eyes are as cold and ruthless as a shark: "I have seen him. He is a disciple of Beavis, the follower of the dark-haired wizard, and a sprite and a saint."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A fallen Paladin," the thief said: "And my master is a mage, not an elf, and it does not affect my belief in Talos."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respectable God can not leave a thief with a double heart," another pastor ridiculed: "No matter what your host wants you to do, unfortunately, he will Lost such a loyal slave." He cast a glimpse of the chief pastor wearing a blue-and-white robes. Gülan knew that he was seeking the consent of the chief pastor. Next, not a lightning is a flame, he immediately raised his hands. , unfolding the palm of the hand, a bright thing falling out of his fingers and hanging from him Near the wrist: "I beg you," the thief said loudly: "As long as you take a look at it, you will understand that what I am saying is not a false statement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The priest stopped his movements. Under the direction of the chief pastor, he approached the thief and grabbed the coat of arms. The coat of arms was made of black iron, and their guards searched the body of the uninvited guest and collected it. Leave it behind without a weapon, because it is a miniature horseshoe. People who travel on the sea often wear this accessory for peace, because if they don't belong to any god, they leave it on the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to make a disguise on it," Gülen explained. "Otherwise, I can't bring it out." He said sincerely: " You can see what it is by tearing open its outer casing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief pastor nodded, the black horseshoe pendant was opened, the previous priest from the inside I took out a piece of broken fabric with traces of burning by the flame. "What is this?" The chief pastor asked, he felt that part of the fabric was a bit familiar. In fact, it should be the end of a lightning bolt, embroidered with gold thread. So after the soft silk was burned, it barely remained as it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The corner of the robes of the East Crown lord," Gülen said: "Because the blood of the dead was contaminated before the embroidery was completed, it was abandoned. I burned it out before it was burned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is also possible to dedicate only to the sacrifices of my Lord." A pastor said eagerly, yes, whether it is in the Longhuo Island or in the Bituminburg, or the White Tower and the Grey Ridge. Humans, elves, dwarves, etc. will wear robes or armor for the statues of the gods they believe in. These are summed up in the offerings, embroidered on them or engraved with the holy emblems or holy flowers of the gods. Permitted - although the priest was excused for the lord because he was one of the objects that the lord focused on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief gave a sneer without fear, and he boldly retrieved the broken fabric from the priest and placed it in the palm of his hand, showing it to the director. The priest, the piece of fabric was adorned with gold rims, so it is easy to see that it was originally a robe horn, and it is easy to figure out the size of the whole robes from this horn of the palm that is not too big. This belongs to an adult male, not to any statue belonging to Talos. Talos is not a good-tempered god like Irmot. All his statues are extremely tall, at least high. Ordinary mortals can't easily look directly at his face. If there is such a robe, then it can only wrap one foot of the statue of Talos - it can't be a sacrifice to Talos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest who excused the lord immediately wanted to return to his peers, but the chief priest bounced his fingers and the two pastors around him immediately placed their hands His body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, you may want to look at the dress of the grown-up," the thief added in a timely manner: "That would be a big surprise." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief pastor called the name of a person, and a pastor came out of the crowd. His priest's gown is longer than other priests and looks more similar to the wizard's black robe. The thief Gülen knows that there are many eager wizards who will honor Talos. Maybe this guy is one of them. "Do you have memories of peeping into the distance?" asked the chief pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said the mage, "I have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put it, The chief pastor ordered: "Let's see the East Crown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master took a nap and accepted the order, he grabbed it from his pocket A small crystal ball with a big fist was released. After the spell was cast, there was a grayish white mist in the crystal ball, and then there was a sea breeze blowing. The fog dissipated, revealing a colorful image, and everyone present, including Gülen, watched intently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is holding a ceremonial." A pastor said that it was impossible to suppress his anger. They knew that the lords of the East Crown would sacrifice Talos regularly, but they always thought it was just a small ceremony - some devout believers would indeed be themselves In the mansion, he worships the statue of the god and presents him/her with sacrifices. But if the ceremony will offer more than ten sacrifices, it must be given to the priest of the gods, just like white. When the female lord of the tower was engaged in a marriage contract with her husband, they could not slaughter the livestock to sacrifice the Greedy, but the priest of the Greedy had to take the knife. The East Crown lord used to do the same, and the first Talos The priests will also secretly monitor and observe, but as time goes by, they can't help but slack off. After all, every ten days of summoning storms or a devastating violent action is enough for them to exhaust their energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A grand ceremonial." The chief pastor gloomyly pointed out that the priests saw the slaves struggling in the sea, and said hundreds of them, and In addition to the rounded heads of the dolphins and the iconic long kiss, they also saw the triangular fins of the sharks, but these bloodthirsty tyrants in the sea were temporarily blocked by wires and wires intertwined in the shallow sea. In the situation, the priest of Talos is no longer familiar. Talos likes to destroy and chaos, but occasionally he will also appreciate some elaborate ritual techniques, such as the servant who first sat down with his servant and then sat down with his waiter. I have done it more than once, but there are only fifty slaves in the ritual that he gave to Talos. He had to deeply doubt the lord’s attempt, what the mundane ruler wanted to do to savour Does Talos shake his position? His stern eyes swept to other pastors. Did anyone among them reach an agreement with the lord, and wanted to exchange the ceremonies for the love of Talos, to change the position of the two, and even let him return to Talos Husband? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief pastor’s gaze fell on the face of a young pastor who looked bad and would it be him? But the chief pastor immediately discovered that his panic did not come from this festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard who cast this spell moved the crystal ball slightly. The perspective of the picture also changed. The young priest saw the robes worn by the lord of the East Crown. "Let's see more clearly," the chief pastor who also noticed this point shouted: "The robes Embroidered with blades of grass or lightning? Let me carefully!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master manipulated his other eyes. The picture trembled and stabilized after a while, and the priests saw the gorgeous and delicate robes, and the patterns on them made them fall like ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have almost seen the thunder of anger, the hurricane and the bottomless abyss, they will die. The souls after death will mourn and struggle in endless torture, and everyone’s eyes will involuntarily show extreme fear and hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a mistake," the chief pastor said immediately, his reaction showed that he could not be the chief pastor of Talos, but he was not lucky: "but there is a chance to recover." - and we are not not discovering...we, we are just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just the first time he did that," his disciple added immediately. "And we immediately discovered it and are preparing to make up for this mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A penalty," the chief pastor corrected: "One is as fast as a thunder With violent punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Destroy them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to be grateful!"<br /><br />&nbsp The pastor said with a slap in the face, as if in a literal sense, "It’s great." The chief pastor said: "All are ready, we have to finish before the ceremonies are completed." The entire operation. "Lest this grand festival really attracted the attention of Talos, then both the East crown to the Lord forever or do they have to wallow in anger in the Talos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," the chief pastor suddenly said, at the same time, he silently cast a spell and seized the thief who was stealing in the shadow: "And our guests, my God's messenger - he said so, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other pastors don't know how to interface, only the chief pastor The disciple knows the teacher's thoughts the most: "Yes. It's true," he said with a smile. "This man said so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So Give him a chance to smelt." The chief pastor said broadly: "Know that my god believers will never fear fire, storm, earthquake or other disasters."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gülen hadn't had time to say anything, and the thunderbolt hit him from the hands of the chief pastor of Talos. He made a scream and fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you are not devout enough." The chief pastor said, then he led the priests to walk away in a hurry, and the beasts they raised would solve them. After that, if it is normal, perhaps one or two pastors will stay and watch. But now they have more important things to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, before Talos was aware, destroy all those who might reveal their misconduct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; The sturdy vine covered by the table: "It seems to have been abandoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet." Yadel said that while hurried but methodical The ground takes the things he needs from the pockets, the soldiers who hunt them have been thrown away by them, and then the screaming puppies are also irritated by the powder of herbs thrown along by Yadel, and can no longer provide soldiers with Track the clues you need, but the chaseres have started a net-like search, and finding them is only a matter of time, but fortunately they don't have a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" The Cavaliers questioned, because Yadel took out the rituals: "Do you want to sacrifice Talos?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you think so?" Yadell poured clear water from the silver flat pot that she carried with it, and the water glowed with golden light - from the original light The holy water blessed by Rosada, that is, the kind of drink that Kremar first drank when he arrived at the White Tower, the Cavaliers could not detect the mystery of the water contained in the crystal cup for a while, but he did I smell the breath of the sun, the smell is hard to describe, can only be said to make him more awake and eliminate some of the feeling of exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to sacrifice my god," said Yadell: "a powerful and glorious god, the god of morning light, Rosada." I remember the first time I called the name - after a year of torture, he was finally able to say the name again, his tongue twitching slightly, as if he were still experiencing The pain that ordinary people can't imagine, his heart beats violently. He almost thought that the name he called was just an illusion or a dream, but the smile of the Cavaliers made him understand that it was true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
