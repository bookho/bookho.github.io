			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold is suddenly coming, overnight, everything is solidified and slow, water, trees, weeds, animals, birds and humans - - Even the elves who are not sensitive to temperature are covered with fur cloaks, and their diets are gradually shifting from nuts and berries to meat-based – although the lich always claims that their new body does not require diet. Keeping it working, but the soul of the outside world still feels that even a large bowl of berries will only make him chilly, and soon he will feel hungry and thirsty. At this time, nothing can be richer than a piece of oil. It sounds like a scent of venison, lamb or wild pork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They drink the goat's milk like the soldiers of Thunder, and they cook with butter, and Baldwin also brought a small jar of winter wine. The retort that has been steamed repeatedly is as pure and innocent as ice. Drinking it is like a flame burning in the body. In the fort, only Baldwin and the elves and knights who need to go out and explore the city are in the fort. There is a supply - every elf who goes out to inspect every day has a small bottle, mixed with winter honey and water of life, by which the blood in their body can flow normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar is naturally taken by Kerry Ben, their ten-person team has gone out six times, and the steep cliff is a human It is difficult for ordinary orcs to climb the place where they are left, but for the elves, it is just a change of walking style. Kerry's Ji Yun and the other elves' brownstones are the most reliable eyes of the elves. During the day, they are brownstones, and at night, they are flying in the air. They observe the front and the top, and they call and The way of flying to remind the elves to pay attention to falling rocks, beasts, snakes and orcs, when they are tired, they will return to the big friends' rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at this time someone is flying over the Longji Mountains, the elves who are covered by the gray furry hooded cloak are like a cloud that is flying fast. With the illusion of the uncertain sunlight, they climbed in the rock of the scorpion with twice the speed of human walking on the flat. They only need half a day to climb the dragon ridge, they hide like a nose and Under the shadow of the rock sticking out of the tongue, the sharper gaze than the eagle can make it easy for them to find the target they want to explore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs gather on the plains north of the mouth, and the orcs don’t like to use the flags, but the tents of the princes will coat the enemy’s blood, and the orcs’ priests’ tents The wooden pole will be erected, the enemy's head, hair and skin will be hung, and each tribe, big or small, has only one leader and one priest. The priest and the leader's tent are next to each other, and the warrior's tent is surrounded by them. And there are orc slaves, half-orcs and human slaves without tents. They sit and lie together with the animals. In this bad weather, this may still be a great boon. The orcs have dry manure and branches, priests and The leader has a pyroxene, and human slaves can hardly find anything that can heat other than themselves and their livestock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways for the elves to estimate the orc's military strength. One is to count their tents. Each of the big tents can live forty or so orcs, the medium is twenty-five, and the small tents are fifteen; The second is to see if there are a few horn deer or a few sheep in the fence of the daily tribe. In the case of lack of food, those horn deer and argali will be given priority to the warrior, and each orc warrior under normal circumstances The weight of the ingested meat is twenty pounds to thirty pounds - just do a simple multiplication and division to know how many warriors are hidden in a tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of tents they saw has not changed since the third time. According to Kerry’s estimates, the orc warriors are about 4,000. There are about 3,000 half-orcs and human slaves together, and the number of soldiers and knights in Thunder Castle is about 8,000. This ratio is basically the same as in previous years, and even more reassuring than in previous years. Perhaps because of the large number of deaths of livestock in the warm winter, the number of half-orcs and human slaves is only two-thirds of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen it, Oaks Priest?" In the black-blooded tent, the image of the mirror of Mithril, which has been infected by humans, demons and dragon blood, is positive. As the elves faded away, the Master reached out and gently touched it, and the mirror instantly returned to its original cleanliness and brightness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See," said the Oaks Priest: "A group of sharp-eared mice that are raised by humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If their vision is really like a mouse, we don't have to worry about it." The wizard said, taking the Mithril mirror into his large red robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The powerful Kawu luxury will dig their eyes," the priest said grimly. "They will never see all our warriors." In front of the campfire, a piece of dirt like condensed blood clots was thrown in. The suffocating stench and smoke suddenly filled the tent. His human female slave crouched on the edge of the tent, closed his eyes, and tightened his nose and mouth. Against the cold mud, the mage in the red robe seems to be completely undisturbed, and even enjoys the snakes and cockroaches formed by the smoke in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the blood of the elf?" asked the red robe mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A female elf's ** is mixed with the male elf's testicles and dried and crushed," said the Oaks priest, snarling and smudging with a big nostril. The fog: " Mix with fresh wolf dung and some secret medicine and mix well - the great Kawu luxury likes this very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Really,” Master Red Robe agreed. “This is quite rare and rare.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s not so rare and rare.” Arrogant and ominous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is certainly unable to hear their conversation. He looked at the sky, layered, and the clouds covered with cold and ice crystals were as heavy as lead. It’s gray, “We should go back,” he said. “It’s going to snow soon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second snow coming to the Dragon’s Pass It is bigger and more urgent than the first snow. The elves have not yet reached the wall, and the snow has covered their hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The torches on both sides of the entrance have already ignited the torches, the elves put down their hoods, the snowflakes fall on their blondes and faces, the square iron gates Was pulled up slowly, every fence of the iron gate has the thumb of an adult male, and the guards counted the number of elves. When the tenth, that is, Crimmar walked by him, he immediately relaxed. The handle of the winch, the tough and thick rope on the pulley like a snake, screaming and screaming away quickly, the heavy iron gate is almost immediately behind the back of the crummar, the end of the gate Eight sharp pointed spears pierced accurately into the reserved pits on the ground, because people often oiled and corrected the position, so only a very light clang was made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inlaid with fine gold studs, the black iron gate, which is separated from the iron gate by a thick stone wall, slowly opens in the guard's call, Crema When he passed through it, he looked curiously. He saw something similar to a spring. He installed it on the top of the black iron door. He fixed it on the threshold and the wall with two pairs of hooks that were as big as the human head. It was a bit like his world. The door closers commonly used on fire doors make this door easy to close but difficult to open, and the springs absorb the power of the hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dwarf's work." Kerry Ben said: "The pulley is also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Gnomes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gnome's work is to be smaller and more refined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarf built Thunderbolt, all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...嗄, no." Kerry Ben said that there is absolutely no "low" in the dictionary of the dwarf, any Bargaining will be seen as a contempt and insult to their skills, and the guys who want to get a discount from them are smashed by their axes and hammers by their axes and hammers – in order to ensure that the Thunderbolt can stand for hundreds of years. The first two generations of Thunder Castle, a sparrow on the ground, couldn’t wait to change it into coins. For more than a hundred years, you can’t see a beautiful tapestry in the castle of the Lord, the lady of the Lord. And the daughter is sitting in the airy room and spinning and embroidering to make money. Every time the lord is invited to the Gray Ridge, he will bring all his family and knights. Seize the opportunity very much love to eat and drink on several Dayton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
