A few years ago, we were escaping from the roaring snow, the fierce beast, the hungry stomach, the constant death, and the generous acceptance of the saltwater goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the salt water is too small to accommodate too many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly, in order to compete for food and where to live, the people began to bleed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking for a suitable place for the whole family to live, to leave the homeland that is familiar and inferior, to leave the aging parents who can not travel far, all the way, came here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who are still awake, sigh, they understand that although the salt water is good, it is not the beauty we are looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people looked at the patriarch and waited for his orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, you don't want to leave the salt water, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch's sister 蝣Xi smiled and asked the silent patriarch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed, the face that was smashed by fire and completely ruined was even more terrible. But before she was killed by her brother, she was the most beautiful woman of our family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ethnic group, the woman who lost her husband can't refuse the marriage proposal of other men. If she wants to keep her body for her beloved husband, it is only that all men have no idea of ​​proposing to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brother killed her husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be our patriarch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch is still silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people know that the patriarch is not willing to leave the salt water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of salt water falls in love with him and worships him as his guest. Every day is a delicious and delicate meat, fresh and delicious berries, thick and warm tiger skin padding underneath, wearing silk satin clothes with delicate flowers and flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day after day, the beautiful goddess accompanied him, watching the morning glow of Mingli, watching the moonlight of the enchanting; or listening to the singer of the birds on the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long been unable to see the eyes of the people suffering and resentment, can not hear the tragic despair of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is tired of endless hard work and trek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother! But you are our patriarch, you must find a vast beauty for your people."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蝣溪 smiled and snorted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch looks at the people, and the eyes of the people are cold and resentful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are our patriarch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, you were not on the altar, killing your opponents mercilessly, even friends and relatives. Is it to be the patriarch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the deceased, some are brothers, some are sons, some are lovers, some are husbands, some are fathers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No resentment is because you need a strong and decisive decision to bring you a patriarch of a rich and prosperous new land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, do you really want to stay here?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the goddess of salt water loves you, you are the guest of salt water. But the life of the goddess is better than our mortal Longer, the goddess' mind is also easier to change than our mortal, one day, when you are no longer strong and handsome...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D, still leave the salt water吧.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are our patriarch, always."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of Tunxi still twirling Soft as the body of a water snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch was wrapped around his hands and feet and controlled his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave the brine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! You are not allowed to leave the salt!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of salt water, water, wind, and living things are all loyal to the goddess of salt water. The decision of the patriarch was only known to her in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her long hair is only held in the green vine grass, the pale face is not the usual rosy red rose, the fingers are slender, crystal The stone-like transparent nails are only half-coated with cardamom, and there is only one simple white long dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is so rushing to stop her lover's departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the saltwater goddess is still vulnerable to the mortal woman in front of the ones she loves. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribe did not want to see the patriarch once again being dragged by the goddess in the salt water, but she was so petite and beautiful, all the people naturally let go A passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears of the saltwater goddess fell on the ground, and the ground immediately opened a small white flower with a golden core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My lover, my lover... please don't leave, don't leave the salt water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The patriarch retreats to open the sad eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goddess, we are leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go, don't go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your ethnic group feels hungry, I can make all the fruit trees in the salt water bloom all the year round, and the rivers will always catch constantly, rabbits, donkeys, birds... one year ten Breeding offspring.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your family feels cold, I can make the salt water warm forever, and three times a year in the cotton, and he will grow seven feet a year." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of salt water stretches out the white arm and pulls the patriarch's cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you are willing to stay, I can do everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people have appeared A slight commotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, I saw that the brook was burned by fire and smoke, and the eyes were red and swollen every moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to ensure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蝣溪 approaches the goddess and looks at her soft and flawless skin With black eyes as the eyes of a newborn baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected goddess, how do you guarantee that everything you say now will last forever? My brother is just a mortal, and one day he will die. At that time, will your love also be buried in the loess with him?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you really care for our people and their descendants forever?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smirked and smiled, Tunxi did not wait for the answer from the goddess, turned and returned to the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch struggled to push the soft hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of salt water reveals an abominable look, and she is humiliated by a mortal rejection. If it is someone else, she may have been driven by the beast to tear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch moved a few steps back with some fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess’s face is blue and green, and her hair grows. Everything in the world is dimmed. Only the twin eyes sparkle with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost bite the white teeth, the goddess looks The patriarch, said proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't, so let you leave me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———— ——————————————————————————————————————————<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place where the sky is connected to the earth, you can't see the blue sky in the ordinary, only the gray dust that changes shape and flutters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s getting closer, only to see that it’s a cloud of countless living creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this season, aphids that should still lurk in the loess; or those that have long since disappeared, have brown-white stripes and slender hands and feet; Small body, dark scorpion and woven mother; pale green cockroach, fat moth, black beetle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass and dead on the ground In the branches, there are also highly poisonous spiders and mites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few people who went to explore the road, smart and powerful, but did not enter this boundless invisible, there is no trace of sound after the insects' mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to leave the salt water is thus covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scare of the goddess is not illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Temporary rest. Going into the night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quiet people, sitting on the ground in twos and threes, Tunxi They walked back and forth to see if there were people who needed to look after them, because then, they would walk for at least a few days and nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is dark and the insects are really gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people picked up the torches of the pines and cypresses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still can't go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain road is rugged, the vines are like a snake on the ground, the original flat place is suddenly full of thorns, the flame on the torch is not beaten by the mountain wind, is the Suddenly urging, the person holding the torch will ignite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the people no longer look at the patriarch, it seems that he no longer exists. They support each other and return to their original place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch looked at Tunxi like a help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Tunxi are full of sympathy. She loves her brother so lovingly, straightens out his hair, and comforts him gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what do I do? The tribe no longer trusts me." The patriarch said with distress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蝣溪 thought for a moment, taking a golden ring with pomegranate red pebble from his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch looked at his sister in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to ask you first." Tunxi can even say that he said in a happy tone: "Do you really no longer care about the goddess of salt water?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch did not speak, but nodded in disgust. The day before, his beloved, unrecognizable goddess is now his most hated enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't hear what was being said. I only saw the patriarch's expression changing rapidly, and finally revealed a firm and relieved expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, the patriarch did not come with us, but everyone did not react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in Tunxi, she sat by the fire all night, her eyes burning until dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray insect cloud has accumulated again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch took out his proud longbow, which was made by the best craftsmen of the whole family, the bow made of ebony for centuries, the string made of gluten The arrow made by the deer's leg bones and the eagle's tail feathers. He used this bow and arrow to know how many birds and beasts were shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike yesterday, the patriarch looked at the people with confidence and announced loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today we can leave the salt water!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look at the patriarch to the highest At the top of the mountain, watching the worm cloud. Quxi leaned beside him, slowly raising an arm and pointing to a point in the gray cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I followed the past, in the gray cloud, there is a small, indistinguishable red dot that refracts the sun and gives off dazzling light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people in the tribe have screamed, they must have been like me, and found the light, the garnet that was originally on the fingers of Tunxi. The light emitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart Tunxi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of salt water, the clothing and accessories on the body are salt water, they will protect her, cover her, only the things that are not salt water, will rebel against the goddess, exposed Her whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, the patriarch easily made the goddess take the situation that pointed out the direction of the weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of the returning lover, the goddess is also covered by tenderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch’s lips have a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a well-thought-out arrow pointing the red dot that is indefinitely flashing, the bow is gradually full, and the knuckles are white because of force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诤!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crisp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow flew out at an unseen speed and fell into the gray cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are holding their breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch once again caught an arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray clouds slowly spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of salt water appeared in the air, the arrow pierced her right chest, and she was like a big butterfly with broken wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently said this, the patriarch’s arrow is once again pleasing The tweet, flying out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the eyebrows are in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people were quiet for a while, and suddenly thunderously cheered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They once again cast a trusting eye on the patriarch and lifted him up and threw it into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pushed out by the crowd, and in the lingering light of my eyes, I saw the Tunxi that had already receded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蝣溪笑笑. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is laughing, the smile of Tunxi is not strange, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tribe suddenly fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
