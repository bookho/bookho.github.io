			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Barbie!" The caravan owner shouted in anger, crushing a rune coat of arms disguised as a pendant on his chest, fragile The magical energy contained in the jade spurts out from the smashed gems, and the spells throw away the fire elemental creatures that are attached to the head of the caravan's master, so that everyone on the reel is spared from the bad burn of the head. . Www.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gray-white shadow invaded his field, the owner of the caravan put the index fingers of his hands together, chanting a spell, and the frenzied air formed around him. A violent whirlpool, even his image has become blurred. The elemental pet of Kremar, the spider of the eight feet, slammed the cheeks uncomfortably, and made a frictional steel-like squeak. The flame on it was like being swept away by the wind, and it was like being immersed in water and gradually changing. The small, transparent, black-haired young caster glanced at it and cast a flame dagger. This spell was used more in melee, but Kremar did not cast it for the battle - the fire elemental creature After a brief hesitation, jumped into a blade-like flame—general spells are hard to threaten elemental creatures, but some spells can be fatal. In general, they have almost two endings, one is magic. Depleted and dissipated in a corner of the main material plane, the other is that their owners are willing to release a spell of the same essence as them, the magical nature and pure elements contained in them can be in the plane of the elements they were born with. Create a channel so they can go home and get a proper rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlocks are usually gloomy and selfish. For them, elemental pets are indispensable. But not only one can do it, some warlocks even kill pets that they feel are not powerful enough to be able to re-call better elemental creatures, and others are hard to give up an attack while fighting. The enemy or the opportunity to escape to cast a spell to let their little pets leave first, but this is not Kremar, more correctly. Not in control of this body. What the soul from another plane can do. Although it is a bit stupid to give up the elemental pet that can be summoned again by giving up the opportunity of the first attack - the owner of the caravan and the old mage with the disciple, that is, the old Bab thinks that it is not a bit stupid, but Very stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Cremaar has just cast a different spell against the caster, the situation he faces may not be that bad - he has to face now For two enemies, both enemies are masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ten thousand sorry," the old Pakistani flew up, with a disgusting kind. Hypocritically panting: "I have used my flight, dear, and I almost didn't find my reel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up." The car owner said with anger: "Put it in a more useful place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laoba shrugged and squatted When "old" and the like, they swayed and searched for so-called casting materials from their bags. The owner of the caravan can't help but regret it, because this mission is led by him (you can use this as a kind of comfort), so he has the right to choose the person he needs. There is neither a lack of a wizard nor a warlock in the "bad" guild. There are even a few priests, but after considering it again and again, he chose the old Bae. The old Ba Shu’s assessment in the guild is not very good. Because he is too timid and lazy, he never looks at those expensive rewards. He only looks for work in small, innocuous tasks. It is not without high-level cadres or the leader wants to remove him, replace or not The problem, etc., the problem is that he can always perform at a critical moment, and the pursuit is nothing more than a squeaky gold coin, his eyes are not aimed at the chair of the superior, nor aiming at the peers. The Dimensional Bag, even if it is bullying the newcomers who have just entered the guild is occasionally (and can also ensure that novices who are resentful to him can never become veterans), so everyone does not like him but he is too lazy to deal with him. He survived so slowly and slowly in the "bad thorns" like the endless abyss, and he was unassuming that he was one of the guild's veterans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the caravan has a lot of people to choose from, but he finally chose Laojiao and his disciples, because Laojiao has already passed the greed and Intended to murder his peers and his superiors, he is like a dying candle, and it can be turned into a blue smoke at any time - even if he seeks a higher position, he can't sit for a few years, his appearance. It can also reduce the vigilance of many people, especially for those who always have good thoughts, wrinkles and white hair is simply a fruitful charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he didn’t think was that the old Bashu would not threaten him, but he would not threaten his enemy. Damn, he should have I think how old Barbie can live to the present - this old guy is to solve every task by perfunctory and dragging! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find them!" The caravan masters sullenly commanded - just as they intertwined, the black-haired caster slammed down, along with the elves. Disappeared in the reed, Lao Ba Shu bowed to him, "Follow, my master," he said, making a weird gesture. An arrow condensed by a flame penetrates into the reed, and the reed burns rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about your disciple?" asked the owner of the caravan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked him to capture the two beautifully colored birds." Old Bae's face is honest and indifferent, he knows that his boss is very annoyed, but when he makes a choice, he should think of Lao Ba. It will be a capable person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the car owner said in an ominous tone. "I saw the two birds, obviously, they are free." Very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Bar has a hard time, just like he doesn't think his disciples will make such a simple mistake. But in fact, he is not as surprised as he has shown. Lao Pai’s disciple has a better talent than him – he even threatened his mentor and demanded to withdraw the contract between them, the contract that the tutor used to constrain the disciple – he told me vaguely After the old Pakistani, he has found a real backing in the guild. If Lao Ba is stubbornly unwilling to hand over the contract, or if he wants to do something with this contract. His new master will teach the old Bashu, and he vowed to ensure that the suffering of the old Bashu will be one hundred times a thousand times his. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of the old Bashu was as timid as ever, he only begged his disciples to complete the work assigned to them by the caravan owners and agreed to The most valuable part of the job and the most gentle and harmless part are handed over to his disciples - "So you have better content to reward your new owner." Lao Ba Shu said: "I also I will hand over the contract... Maybe you will be willing to give me more gold coins? I don’t want much, you know.” He said so, he did the same. Leona and Plum are undoubtedly the two most weak and poor prey. It’s as simple as trying to catch them – but Laojiao seems to have forgotten that his disciples have a bad habit that few people know, that is, he likes women too much, especially the priest of Fro. - What's more, he has a common problem with men, that is, always love to treat all women as fools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laoba knows that his disciple is dead when he sees Plum and Leona innocently with the Byrd Wenglan round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what about it? No one can pick out the mistakes of the old Bab, not to mention that there is no idiot in the guild that will make it difficult for a dead person to live. He will go back and comfort in the room that the guild gave him. Dressed up to his days. Not very good, not too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the caravan and the old Bardot have fallen, the former gestured, and a dark gray cloud of fog formed on the head of Birdwin and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close your breath!" First, I found the wrong Gelan shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the caravan showed a smile of the caster. These people won't know that this group of poisonous clouds can penetrate your skin like you can seal your ears and nostrils with lead water, and let your nerves be deeply paralyzed in a few breaths - and then as he thinks A shimmering wall rises from the feet of the prey, blocking the clouds from the outside, and before that, the old Bae's spells have been thrown out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know that these people’s companions will not leave themselves to escape, and as long as they are in danger. The black-haired caster, Crémac, and the Elf Ranger, Kerry, will definitely try to rescue them. The goal of the old Baba is Kremar. The spell he throws is the most powerful one he remembers, if Cray Mar is hit by this spell and he will be torn into countless pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell hits the black-haired caster, and the old Barbara reveals a sly smile. This smile forms a completely different face from his appearance. Make all the people who saw them creepy. Now, in this old mage, you can no longer find a kindness and calmness caused by the increase of age. He is like a curse doll who has been abandoned for hundreds of years. Every crack and spot indicates evil and ominous. He grins and laughs. The white hair flies in the hot wind driven by the flame. He is a hyena that is no longer strong because of old age, but is more mean. He can't catch. To the vibrant prey, it is more adept at finding those injured and sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his smile solidified in the next moment, because he also felt severe pain, he waved his hands and cast a reel to hide himself, but he I couldn't find a trace of myself being cut by a sword or hit by a spell - he determined that there was only one wizard in the prey, the priest of Fro? Or is his disciple still alive? Endless abyss is down! He should have expected that women will always be soft-hearted - he heard the owner of the caravan shouting his name, God, dear, he complained in his heart, you can't live without me? I have killed the wizard, and there are more than 50 soldiers fighting with you. The rest is only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laobay should listen to what the car actor is calling, because his spells have hit Krymar, but they are only ruined. His robe, causing certain damage, and of course, deep pain, the soul from another plane had to thank the once undead who had done bad things to him, the kind of thing that was called torture. It made him not too sensitive to the pain when he first arrived. He not only could tolerate and correctly released two spells according to the Lich's instructions, one was to see the invisible enemy, and the other was to use the mind-crash and squat. Hold the goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The embarrassing old Bashu was so dragged out of the invisible state by the caster who temporarily threw the old and the young and the young to the other side. He lay on his back on the ground, his feet twisted strangely together, and the pain beneath the chest was faintly- - He must have been hit by a few ribs, and he hasn't been able to find the one who bumped him, but the old Barbie is not a newcomer to the beginning. He falls and flips his fingers and casts another spell. Although he couldn't help but widen his eyes when he saw the enemy of the black and white robe, he had a full rest before, restored his spirit and remembered all the spells that can be remembered, and this young black-haired caster, he not only Didn't get a break, the spell and the two-legged gnome dragon battled nearly half a day, but also worked hard to make up for the many loopholes that the old disciple's disciple deliberately found out - what kind of height he had reached to have such a height How many spell points? Or is he not as old as he said, but one hundred and nineteen? It must be the latter. Otherwise, he can't be so alert and calm. The curse, every spell he remembers is extremely effective and targeted. Laojiao doubts whether he has peeped into his mind. Over every fold in the gray cortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But anyway, Laojiao cast his spells, this spell is not the most powerful, but equally deadly, but he disappointed to see it I didn't have any effect because it hit a soft, sticky skin, and the skin was like a marsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the grassy hills, the giant piebald that emerged from the mud twisted and twisted unhappy, as the elf said, the lightning beam could not even penetrate Its skin, but the itching it still makes it open the mouth, the huge mouth, even if a giant standing inside is more than enough, maybe even slap on his wife - old 戟 戟 crazy Shouting, tearing the reel before the mouth closed at his waist, he was smashed out by a gust of wind and landed on the edge of the marsh. He was busy getting out of the water and wearing a red-necked crane Then, before he could do anything, Cremari's spells ripped a gap around him. He struggled, danced, and reluctantly was sent into an unknown ectopic face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the caravan had no time to take it, but Leona smashed a small rune, and the magical energy that overflowed from it would her The enemies around them condensed into snow-white and translucent ice sculptures, and Birdwin mentioned that the wide swords were lightly shot, and they turned into countless crystal fragments that piled up in the ground—the human hair could be seen in the fragments. With the dirty, the "bad" soldiers stepped back uncontrollably. (To be continued.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: Black?
