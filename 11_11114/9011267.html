			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wizard of the Elf Ranger and the black hair, and the thief returned to the ground with a bad smell, Baldwin’s battle here At the end of his life, Baldwin was in a very unfavorable position because he lacked a hand when he was wrestling with the gnoll. His ears were torn off and there was a deep scar on his cheek. The left side of the forehead to the right ear root, only a little bit hurt the important eyes, plum honey got some clean water, wiped the blood and dust and then sprinkled some elder wood ash - if Birdwin He can still heal, and the wound will heal soon, but now... Kerry has gone and took out a bottle of light green ointment: "The priest of Ilmot gave it to me." He said, It is handed over to Mei Mi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the ointment is good, and the cracks that can not be bridged by the connection of the bone ash are no longer bleeding and painful, but it is better for Birdwin not to use these two days. Speak loudly and drink some porridge to avoid tearing the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you give me a cure?" Gülen asked slyly, he scratched his arm during the fall and broke a Toes, he thought that he could get a white eye from Mei Mei at most, but unexpectedly, Mei Mei raised her hand without saying a word, the white tiny light fell from her fingers to the thief - thieves I almost couldn’t control myself and slammed back to avoid the light balls that might curse him for life - but it was a healing technique, and the light ball penetrated into the horrible skin of the thief just as the dew penetrated into the dirt. Inside, there was a burst of light like the morning sun, and those that were scratched were immediately ready, and the broken toes were creeping and re-restoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief stunned at Fro’s pastor, “What do they use for me in Norman Heights?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The iron box." Mei Mi replied: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Gülen said that he thought this plum is The morph is fake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you find those sheep?" asked Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Founded." The elf said, "Under the depth of several tens of feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp They spent a lot of effort to get these sheep out, the damn stupid sheep, for whatever reason, they are not willing to follow them on the will of the savior, when you drive them away. They will run around and bite you with their teeth—four male adventurers bind them with vines summoned by elves. One by one, they were dragged to the ground, they kept screaming, and their eyes were filled with sad tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How about we baking one for lunch?” Gülen suggested, and kicked a goat that wanted to use his horns where he couldn’t see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not good." The elf said: "We can buy a sheep from the villagers after returning to the village."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to their valuation," Gülen said: "Five sheep are worth a silver coin, then we only need twenty copper coins to buy a good sheep."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gullen," Birdwin warned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief sneered at him with a sneer: "I almost forgot that we have a follower of Tyre here, oh no. Former followers, Apologize to you, respected lord." He ignored the gaze of Mei Mei and said happily: "But even if Tyre came here, he could not say that I was wrong. Look, this price is what they proposed. Twenty silver coins, one hundred sheep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are just poor people," Birdwin suppressed his voice and said, "You don't apply them." The scales measure their own value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am a thief," said Graan, of course: "And. The ferrets carried by the ends of the black iron balance The code does not include poverty, because poverty is also punished according to the crime of sin. You should be clearer than I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay," Before the plum can't help but want to say something, the black hair caster interrupted their conversation in advance: "Go tell the villagers, Ge "He pointed to the sheep, "Let them come here to bring back their own sheep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&&&&&;; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you talk to Baldwin?" Mei Mi whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Li Ona asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is degrading Baldwin...Adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just explaining different Idea," Leona said quietly: "Bedwin was once a paladin, and Gülen was a thief. It is normal for their ideas to differ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"But adults are right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bedwin is of course a good person," Leona said, standing under the bitter tree, while the men are Handle the bodies of those gnolls. Unlike stupid goblins, the gnolls can be said to have some wisdom in the monsters, and occasionally find something of value in them - within this distance, as a human Baldwin can't hear them talking. What, but the caster and the elf may not be: "But Glan... I may not be able to say that he is wrong, can only say. He is intentionally misinterpreting - I must say that he is seeking another kind of justice, although this Fairness is ruthless and cruel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to be supporting Gülen." Mei Mi said. "But you said that you love Birdwin, an adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I speak in a neutral position," said Leona. Wen won't want the kind of blind and selfish love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey's answer is to turn away without saying a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Aona sighed, she did feel that the thief was targeting Baldwin, but as far as she seemed, Gülen was a thief, but he Already laid the foundation of this team in this team, it is impossible to exclude it in a short time; they still have a long way to go, the companions always argue that the enemy is not right, but alienated, strange to each other It’s a bad thing to know nothing about it. The black-haired caster Kreima has a sorcerer to ensure that Mei Mei and Ge Lan are not, so Gülen and Mei Mei are willing to say that she is willing to listen, she needs to understand them. Test them and know where they should put them in order to make mistakes - if they become enemies, she can find their key points in the fastest time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers soon arrived, and they happily brought back their sheep by the colored signs on goats and sheep. They also brought My own dog, the violent flock of sheep in front of the dog is like a cloud in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village head stood on one side and counted, except for those who fell and were injured in the cave, and were eaten by the goblin. The remaining sheep still had a whole dozen dozen. He gave Kerry a broken bag with a lot of copper and silver coins. "Don't mind," he said. "I guarantee the quantity is right. The adventurers, a total of 60 silver coins, know us. Silver coins are rare here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf found about twenty silver coins in the leather bag and handed the rest of the money back to the village head. "We need to stay in the village for a few days. Please give us a sheep, bread, wheat porridge, and other foods you have. We still need... three rooms, hot water. Bathtubs and essential things. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village chief licked his thick lips: "Everything else is good," he said. "But the room, we have no extra house here - but I have a big barn, if you want, you can live. There, I can let people move the tub there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "哞..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the cows in the village are here," the thief murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village chief’s barn is indeed very large, and has two floors. The bottom has six cows. They are a little uneasy about strangers and can’t stop their tails. On the hoof, a shy little cow also opened his hind legs and slammed a lot of fresh faeces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at all dirty," said the village chief with no sorrow: "We bathe them every day, every day," he stressed. "I promise that every The cows are all clean, no mites and no scorpions. And you don't live with them, come with me." He licked his head and took the lead to climb the trembling long Wooden ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper level of the barn is full of straw bags, although last year. It is still dry and clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can sleep on it," the village chief said. "But it is not allowed to pee on it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; A small shadow screamed in front of them, and the head of the village slammed the boots and stepped on the foot - it was just a fat mouse. It was slammed on the tail, frantically struggling and screaming, and the village chief handed it up with a straw fork resting on the straw bag: "Don't worry, they don't bite, they only eat wheat straw." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers looked down at the mouse that was even pierced by the abdomen and still slammed the iron fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today is very late," the village chief continued: "But I promise to have roast sheep tomorrow. You can drink some milk porridge tonight, my The daughter will be sent later, it is all good milk without water.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;When the wizards of the Elf Ranger and the blacks, and the thieves returned to the ground with a smell that was not so good, Baldwin’s battle here had come to an end, and Baldwin was wrestling with the Gnolls because Without a hand, he was in an extremely unfavorable position. His ear was torn off and there was a deep scar on his cheek. From the forehead on the left side to the ear root on the right side, he was almost hurt. Important eyes, plum honey got some clean water, wiped clean blood and dust and then sprinkled some elder ash - if Baldwin can still be treated, the wound will soon heal, but Now... Kerry Ben walked over and took out a bottle of light green ointment: "The priest of Ilmot gave it to me." He said, give it to Mei Mi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the ointment is good, and the cracks that can not be bridged by the connection of the bone ash are no longer bleeding and painful, but it is better for Birdwin not to use these two days.
