			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little mean," Cremari said seriously: "I mean, your behavior..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fascinating water bathing in the sun gave him a look, twisting his body and lazily licking the newly grown fluff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I gave you six pieces of maple sugar, a bottle of snow honey, and three fish you requested," said Kremar, with his fingers: "I thought you would help me keep this little secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otter yelled at him twice, this is the first time Hearing the water screaming, it sounds like a little songbird like a nightingale singing - it lie on the platform-like stone that it likes best, and starts throwing a piece of silver stripe back and forth. Pebble, from the front paw on the right to the front paw on the left, and from the front paw on the left to the front paw on the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you have lost a very beautiful stone, but what do you want the stone to do? You are not a sea otter. There is no oyster to knock you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furry guy stopped and put his new baby stone under his armpit, and yelled at Kremar, and jumped forward In the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no maple sugar anymore! Little bastard!" Crimmar shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otter floats on the water with the belly facing up, revealing the head and the two soles of the feet, and it squirms at Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The negotiations are not going well? Well, the lich sneered, have you thought about what kind of compensation you can get? a fish? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——A hug, perhaps, the soul of the opposite world said that he stood up and walked to his cracked maple tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otter built a new nest, but not far from its original nest, it remembers Kremar, who often ran over to ask him for maple sugar and snow. Honey, but the closest person is not Kremar, but Perant, which allows him to touch it and hold it. The soul of the outside world does not know if this is related to Perant’s career, or does it remember Ilva Perant is the elf of the whole returning spirit that looks most similar to the former - he thinks it is the latter, because the druid in the gray ridge can be more than one of the pelt, but the bastard with the shovel tail is not immediately escaping or They bite their fingers as they try to approach it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only trusts Perant, and is willing to quietly roll up his tail and shrink it in his hand. If any elf or half-elves provoke it intentionally or unintentionally, it will run and complain to Perant. When you get the results and compensation, you will not give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, Kreima got a punitive job to help the gnomes explore the Starlight River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The elves are ready to give up the White Tower. Once the undead has listened to the details of the work, they will definitely say that, at least, it will be Deprived of a unique position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the White Tower survives and develops to the present level is inseparable from the Grey Ridge and the Silver Crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starlight River, except for the turbulence of the birthplace, can not cause any deterrence, and after the silver-crowned jungle enters the gray ridge, because of the entanglement of the roots and the suddenness of the riverbed In addition to broadening and becoming flat, the long roads are almost always between steep and steep cliffs. The rivers are narrow and wide, and the gaps can reach hundreds of feet. The two sides echo the huge roar of abundant water. The whirlpool is omnipresent, and the surface of the water is covered with sharp reefs. Even the most solid and huge five-masted ship will be smashed and torn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the elves want to choose a transit point, the white tower naturally becomes their best choice, not far from the gray ridge, the starlight river has not yet It has become too violent, and the tributaries are wide enough. Even if the wings are wide open, the elf's ship can be paralleled here. The junction between the tributary and the Starlight River is a gentle slope, not the most common one in the Star River. Awkward cliffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Baita was still a small village in Anzhen, relying on the only tributary of the Star River to fish and grow grain for the sake of the elves. They came to their molasses, the party lead red, the fine gold secret silver... the well-informed merchants swarmed in time, and as time went by, fixed and unfixed markets were established, except for the production of the elves, they also They started to buy and sell each other – but just as honey always attracts bees, gold coins always attract the attention of the rulers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the commission and dispatch of the Grand Duke, one of his brothers moved with his soldiers and some of the people, with the new surname given to him by the Grand Duke (ie St. Rieger and the right to manage the land (White Tower and the Hill), he re-stated the number of people on the territory, levied various taxes on them according to occupation and residence, and asked them to perform military service and labor; In contrast, he protects them from hooligans and thieves, and signs them with a charter and a written identification so that they can walk safely and securely between cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the elves want to build three, or four three-level sluices (adjustable water level), as well as the docks on both sides of the sluice and even the city. If they are built, then the merchants can gather in the new city. Their boats can sail on the Starlight River controlled by the sluice. Of course, they still can't reach the Grey Ridge, but they can pass through many towns and villages. If you travel long distances with people and horses, it may take several months, now It only takes one-half or one-third of the time, and the ship can carry far more cargo than the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Luzer is satisfied with this, more cities, more businessmen mean more gold coins, and can reduce the importance of the White Tower Vaguely threatened (he has received the marriage request from the last two bloods of St. Regis, if possible, he is more willing to put it into the stove), he even came up with an extremely cheap price, the elf The land they need is sold to them—although there are no ghosts in the ghosts that can neither be used for planting nor for mining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sluice and the city will not be built in one day, the elves are the most, and the white tower evolves from a village into a city. It took less than fifty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fifty years, for a human being, that is almost their life, but for half-elves, that’s only a quarter or six of their lives. In one part, the changes in the White Tower will be vividly and completely presented in front of its rulers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Is the elves a little angry? The souls of the outside world whispered, although in the sea of ​​knowledge, they would not be noticed despite yelling, but sometimes he would do so out of habit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-A little disciplinary action, if the fool half-elves don’t care about the white tower as she shows it, the lich does not care, then even This little effect can't be achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I think she will care, that is what her father left for her, the soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The elves then achieve their purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—— Her previous behavior may have been due to the coercion or temptation of Demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Maybe, the lich said sharply, but the elves can't see this - yes, maybe you are strong, wise and sharp, good at UBM It’s hard to remember and has considerable foresight, but you won’t ask everyone to be like you, you know they can’t do what you can, can’t keep up with you, and can’t see what you see. And estimate the results you can estimate - he spreads his hands gracefully, but the elves will do that, yes, they believe that you can be as strong and determined as they are, without fear, even if you have to face it all the time. The sharpest swords, the deadliest magic and the most sinister plots, they look forward to your ability to break free, wipe off the blood and sludge, pick up your bones, mend your wounds, and wipe away those tortured. With the traces of insults and pretending that nothing has happened, your soul and body are still pure and innocent, haha! - You can do it, they will admit you, but if you can't do it, dear, as you see, they will not hesitate to abandon you, just like the present amnesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alien soul feels that he is not just describing the ampoule, but he just thought about it in a short and silent way. This lightning-like thought is difficult to read. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich seems to find that he has said too much, and in the following time, he said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring the Starlight River’s work lasted for a full tenth, some hard, but Not monotonous, the main task of Krimaar and several other mages is to fly with gnomes and put them wherever they want to see them. As for other work, such as picking up and freezing the entire turbulent starry river, only the high-ranking wizards sent by the Silver Crown jungle can do it - the gnomes are fast on the slippery hard riverbed. They set up their instruments with trepidation and eagerly measured every piece of data they needed. They looked like human children, dressed in fine silk clothes and small and delicate boots, and their cheeks and fingers were frozen. The redness of the eyebrows also ran a white cream on the eyebrows. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes are not so willing, given the meager profits of this business, the problem is that the managers of Gray Ridge have evidence that they participated in a war - Three huge floating platforms, gnomes, and although they struggled to argue, the elves' swords, scimitars, and bows did make any race short, and they finally accepted the elves at a symbolic price of Mithril. Commissioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The souls of the outer world find that the drawings they have plotted are not as coarse or fuzzy as the drawings he sees in his world, and they can The help of magic makes them three-dimensional, with real texture and color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the mapping work is a discussion of the day and night, the elves, dwarves, gnomes and humans are arbitrarily arguing endlessly, but fortunately this work Kriema does not need to participate, in They vehemently debated whether the gate of the river gate should move vertically up and down or left and right or left and right, and he has already entered the new home of Yadell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale’s new home is small and dark, barely able to accommodate two adult men sitting face to face with each other, and the priest who lost his grace, in addition to The more robust body is simply nothing. They can't build a house that needs foundation. Just like the refugees and slaves, they can dig a cave on the ground that can allow them to hide inside, and then use the branches to set the top and bottom. Short walls, covered with grass blades, and thick grass on the blades, leaving only a small hole for access. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the sun is more sunburned, it would be better." Yadel said that he grabbed his face and there was almost no light in the cave, but Kreima could still see his face full of sputum and sores: "Recently It’s gloomy,” he said, sulking his head in uneasiness. Unsuitable trousers were pulled to his knees, no shoes, and the feet and the wet, muddy ground were almost a color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar touched the ground, the soil was delicate and sticky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you go out?" The caster said, "I think I can dry it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent flame burned the water in the cave at once, but it did not stop, but continued to carry every part of the new home, its tentacles stick out from the exit of the cave, there Ten feet long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the flames go out, the entire cave is red, and the heat that radiates is like a falling sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They waited for a long time, and Krymal once again cast a temperature-reducing hair, and Yadel would return to his home. He Touching the walls and the ground, I found them hard and dry without any joy. He seemed to want to say something, but he was interrupted by himself. "Like Rosada." Krimari replaced him. In exchange for a calm and sad smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world sighs deeply in the sea of ​​knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have prepared a lot of spells," said Kremar. "It's similar, do you want to see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to burning the caves of the priests, Creemar’s flames also serve a lot of uses, such as barbecue rabbits and cooking fish soup, the priests sitting by the stream, waiting Their house cooled down and they were very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have a little more berries," said Krimal, he turned his head and searched the bushes on the edge of the woods. Now it is At the time of the thinness, it has become black, but it does not prevent him from finding those sweet and sour little fruits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw two bright spots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
