			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, the new chapter is not very satisfactory, so put a chapter of the same person Xiaowen - is a comic I recently wrote to change my mind The same person is a very old manga. Although it should belong to the one you know, I think it is more like Futian, because the demons inside can change their gender... After the change, they are quite pure or beautiful, and both Lori and Yujie have ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Seal of the Demon" - Bystander<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written in front: You see, All the characters and plots in the story belong to the original author. I don't use it to make money. That's it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that I am in a comic book, Because I have a friend called Rluto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the friendship between the devils is what it is. What's more, Ryudo is a standard loyal fan, and the object of the fascination is that he has followed countless years of the demon king - the vain monarch Dorias (referred to as the fascinating one). And the reason why he became friends with me is because I have a face that is similar to Dorias with five or six points and the same long black hair - when his king does not allow him to follow, he ran to I am here to see the big event, um, that is me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are still so degraded here," said Rilcon. "If you don't want the subordinates of the demon, don't even the human slaves?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yes, I still need to mention that when I am still a cartoon character who doesn’t know my comics, I don’t really like anyone else around me. Well, neither people nor demons. I always felt that something suddenly emerged from behind me was completely a routine of the Japanese-style horror film. Even Li Lukang, after being fattened by me for thousands of times, finally learned to knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there is nothing that they need to do." I said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your posture can make thousands of demons surrender," Rilcon said: "In order to seek a chance to serve you, they will be willing Give away all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like you, I said in my heart, but I still didn’t say it. Perhaps because I used to be a personal relationship, my temper can be said to be quite good in my demon. But to tell the truth, even the best temper will break out when you encounter the group of dogs that have to hold their legs on the bottomless line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I am also a stranger in the demon. Every demon who wants to be my follower and subordinate will be flattened by me and thrown out of my black forest, then the trees, vines and grass in the forest will remember their breath, once they get close again It becomes a series of demon scorpions. As for when it is released, it depends on how good I am. But even so, I will not appear in front of them, a group of cruel and tyrannical, powerful, can quickly kill the rumors of all the human demons in a city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if Rilcon suddenly sensed that I wanted to He kicked out, he gave me a message that I always wanted to hear in a timely manner: "The human being you asked, my subordinates caught his news - Labins, a magic Although it has been praised by humans because of the magic, it is only a poor little bug." He suddenly showed a dissatisfied look: "God, don't tell me that you are the human being." Want to be his demon, if that is the case..."dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If that is the case..." I said: "Ri Lukang, you What do you want to do? Want to let me die? I am more beautiful than you, Li Lukang, you will not know what this represents." In the demon, the appearance and strength are directly proportional, Li Lukang If I dare to do something, I don't mind if I change the vain prince to a near waiter now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I really become a human demons, Rilcon will definitely use whatever means to kill the human or me, he will not Tolerate a human being to be my master, even if I and Dorias only have a face that I think is not so similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just thought it was a pity," Rilcon said. "If you don't sleep for three hundred days a year, then even if you want to be somebody." The king’s closeness is also a breeze.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Li Lukang was a little worried before I was kicked out of the forest. After all, I have been in this forest for more than a thousand years, and I have not been interested in anything. The demon is not, human beings are not, and Rabins is still The first name I mentioned. But I am really not interested in that batter face, Li Lukang, my friend, if possible, I really hope that you can understand my current mood - this guy is a cannon fodder, but this cannon fodder is the whole The key to comics, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that your love beans will fall in love with a human being! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also know that because of your love beans will play an amnesia! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also know that you will be beaten out by your love beans, and then become a black powder because of love! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still know that you will save your loved ones of love beans, and will seal yourself to enhance your love of beans. The power of the bean's younger brother, no, I am not making a jingle, the thing is so complicated - although you don't love me, don't look at me, don't accept me, don't understand me, but I still love you, don't hesitate to pay for everything, even if you are a god horse. I don’t know if you only want to be happy, happy, and healthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know that the female pig's foot in a Taiwanese drama is a sinister prince Dorias is a cold sweat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after Li Lukang left, a late night, I suddenly jumped out of bed It was up, and the whole forest was shaking. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WTF?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the pressure of a chest blow Nothing is nothing, the tyrannical monarch Dorias? And the other monsters of the demon will not suddenly come to this world. I put my feet on my feet and sat on the bed with a screaming infidelity that Rilcon saw. When the terrible power left, I slowly went to see what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I said that this forest is my territory, and then some humans settled on the edge of my forest about a hundred years ago. A village - because it is occupied by demons, there are no harsh lords and no greedy thieves, and I don't care if they go into the forest to pick up fuel or catch fish and small animals, so their days are better than others. The humans in the place are much more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem for them is probably that there is a marsh between the forest and the village. There is only squid and leeches in the marsh, but because of the cough, One of my pursuers, a demon who seems to be called Yili or a demon named Yelia, prepares for a long-term battle. He settled down in the marsh and then hooked up with the waterman in the village. Oh, no, no. What should I say here, is there any intercommunication? Still something else? Sorry, I haven't been a human being for a while, and I'm already a little less familiar with idioms. In any case, they reached a tacit agreement with each other. The existence of Yili or Julia made it necessary for human beings to sacrifice the power of the watercraft with the power of a village, and the hydrologist would provide fresh meat for the demon free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still the power of the demon king on the edge of the water. I wave my sleeves and disperse them. Otherwise, they will soon attract other demons. It became very troublesome - I found the jade in the black swamp that belongs to the water magic Villijeka (oh, I still remember his name), the core of the power left by the demons after death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a good guess, I remember that the beginning of the comics was that Lilu Kang’s Aidoba was double-sealed, and it’s still unscrupulous after losing most of its original strength. Walking around, walking over the swamp, inadvertently saved a little boy, the little boy took him home, and there was a beautiful sister at home - if this is a Hong Kong man, then the next step is definitely The beauty has been promised, but unfortunately this comic is at best a supportive text, so the love for Xiba at first sight will not be a girl, it will only be a demon, although Villije loves only probably more beautiful than the demon noble. The face, but you know (shrug), Xiba has only summoned beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not blame me for being so disrespectful to the demon king, how do you want me, I used to be a personal class, but I really don’t like humans, humans have A beautiful place, but there are more rotten and stinking places, so that even after I became a demon, I didn’t even want human choices on the recipe... Oh, yes, whatever you say, in terms of demons, my The three views are really correct and there is no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
