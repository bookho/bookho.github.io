Then split into small pieces, and some people who reacted faster jumped and seemed to be able to carry a piece of one or two people. When a person could barely stand, he would use his fist, sword and bow to put other The same person who wants to find a foothold lays down the dark black water marsh. Those who fall into the water are not willing to catch the creeping moss, or pierce the dagger and the short sword into the grassy hill to compete for a hope. Or, desperately grab the lucky foot or something else - if you can't live with two people, they don't mind bringing a travel companion on the way to the mourning wilderness... this time, Almost no one can remember anyone other than himself, whether it is a brother or a colleague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people who are good at drowning and are not familiar enough with Snow Cover Marsh think they can escape with their own specialties, but just before a few breaths, they I found myself making a mistake that was too big to be recovered anymore - if the water in the swamp is calm at this time, perhaps it will leave enough depth for them to swim, but now the water is full of giant speckles and tumbling The mud, these muds are delicate and sticky, and once they fall into it, they can only look at themselves slowly and painfully as if they were wrapped in hot resin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will use their last strength to throw the weapons in their hands to the person closest to them before the mud has swallowed themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a terrible and desperate mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant bite an empty space, it's a bit unhappy, just like a personal class complaining endlessly, or worse, because of its vocabulary It can only be compared with a child who is about three years old, so Kreima’s head is like a repeater - just not a good time to turn it off - under the command of the Lich, The soul from another plane has been keeping a weak and continuous connection with this unsolicited helper. The giant piebald owl in the snow cover marsh is a kind of lazy creature. In fact, it rarely hunts, and most of it depends on the carrion that falls into the swamp. Because they always bury themselves in a deep relationship, once they can grow up, they can grow to a large extent, and few predators can hunt them. Except for their kind - so there is often only one giant cockroach in a range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corresponding thing is that it lacks a picky tongue, it eats everything, there is no unique hobby, so it is difficult to use food to seduce it, but This embarrassment seems to be very interesting for "conversation." Before that, it didn't even have this concept. At the beginning, it was enough to repeat the message that Crimmar sent in the past. Fortunately, in dealing with the biological aspects of non-intellectual and low IQ. The once-dead people were very experienced - the soldiers who climbed out of the mud were no smarter than a shackle--according to his mentor, this was due to the lack of soul energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took some time for 鳗鲡 to understand the help they needed. Fortunately, the soldiers of the guild were busy entangled in Bedwin and Gülen—they thought it was irrelevant, and the casters needed almost a whole night. To be able to reply, this is a well-known thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you use to reply to your spell?" The car owner once again tore the reel and cast a flight. After getting rid of those noisy and useless idiots, he asked in a sullen manner, "Or, are you... what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar did not answer He, he is busy with the giant 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡 鳗鲡Cursing, their swords pricked their bodies. This puncture does not hurt this soft, scaleless fish, but it makes it feel itchy, so it always wants to hit a few rounds in the water, and the black haircaster is I tried my best to let it give up on this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can the reel of the transfer be used?" Gülen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei. It was also the only one of them who was able to use the scrolls, except for Krimall, who shook his head, and Leona handed her a well-made scroll – the deep magical energy contained in it was even the priest of Fro. Feel it, but after tearing it apart, it only blinks intermittently and then there is no more movement, like an ordinary parchment - the magic lines and runes above fade to complete disappearance only need A glimpse of that effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They may have set a temporary small lock outside this swamp." Kerry Ben said that he slipped down on his towering head. No effort, no shaking, just like walking on a flat ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that only the elves could set the locks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil, Dragon and Most A few powerful casters can do this,” Kerry said. “And they only need a small range and a short time—may just limit the use of transport-like spells.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they spoke, the caravan master threw a spell, but it was not an attack but a protection, perhaps Leona’s rune coat of arms gave him With some inspiration, his spells condensed a large layer of ice on the water. The "bad" soldiers went one after another and climbed up hard. They looked up at the adventurers who were dozens of feet above them. Several soldiers raised their crossbows, but to their surprise, the caravan owners raised their hands and motioned them to stop fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why?” asked the leader of the soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can control the embarrassment," the owner of the caravan replied: "And that embarrassment will destroy the ice and let you all fall into the water." The death of the subordinate is not worth mentioning to him, but the current situation is that he is alone. Thanks to the stupid old Bab and his disciples, where the old Baba was sent, he did not know or care, anyway, he is not The Tai will return to this plane, and his disciple, the owner of the caravan has seen the headless floating body (when it has not sunk yet), the young mage has a back on his back. A beautiful magical tattoo, which cost thousands of gold coins to be stabbed by a warlock, is said to be able to play the role of armor, but unfortunately he forgot to come up with a piece on his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still have spells, scrolls, and wands," said the leader of the soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They also have." The owner of the caravan said, "I can't do anything about it - I don't know what he should do, that... the caster Still retaining his spells and energy, I can't deal with him alone." Of course he also has spells, plenty of scrolls and wands, but he is tired of this task, and those scrolls and wands are his personal belongings. . He also doesn't want to be hurt too much. And this task can be said to be forcibly distributed to him. He certainly thought about the benefits of the Alva Master or the Archon who was not inferior to the assassination of Bibi Dibao, but now it seems that this is not easy. He may be able to complete the job. But if the price is to exhaust his savings and let him be in a fragile state, he is more willing to give in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the guild is willing to extract a considerable portion of the reward and ransom? Without the power that is commensurate with them, they will only be taken away, perhaps with his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the soldier is not willing. But what about him? The ice under his feet is constantly shaking slightly. He estimates whether he can shoot the giant tinea eyes, but he looks at his own arrow and gives up the plan. Only the arrow that the elf shoots can have this strength and accuracy from the eye through the huge head of the head - like the arrow that nails the "staple" into the ice, it is not even a magic arrow... poor The "spike", he was not smashed by the warrior's wide sword, nor was the thief named Gelan stabbing the heart, but hidden in the shadow, wanting to face the most vulnerable one in the prey - When Luo’s priest raised his bow, he was shot in the chest by the elf’s backhand. The arrows that were still spared were deeply inserted into the ice, and a soldier tried to pull it out. It was not moving, as if it was cast on lead black water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were so silently watching the black-haired caster gently fall back to his companion, his eyes shining in the darkness, the flames of the reed burning illuminate his face, and there is no trace of exhaustion and weakness. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows that Crimmar is on the verge of collapse, and the result of excessive use of mental energy is a splitting of headaches, black eyes in front of him, and the reason why Standing calmly and steadily, it relies on Kerry’s powerful arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Support. The Lich said that if you fall, the wizard will immediately put his remaining, and the reel. Maybe the spells in the wand are all pouring into our heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-How much time is there, the soul of the outside world asks me, I feel that I am being rubbed in a grinding disc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Now only you, once the undead said, sorry, no one. Only yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-self, giant piebald swears in agreement, self, self, self, me, and myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Please, the soul of the opposite world says, at least don’t let it come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s right, the Lich says, and it needs your instructions to act correctly, otherwise we can try the Snow Covered Marsh on the 7th Deep tour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Why is it seven days? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I like this number. The lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you know that in our plane, there is also a guy who likes the number seven, so he cuts his soul into seven toasts? Bread... Then a female writer wrote the story into seven books and made a movie, which made it the richest woman in the world...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; - rich woman, he said repeatedly, seems very interested, woman ... it said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What does it mean to cut into seven slices of toast? Once the undead person confusely asked, if he wants to extract the magical energy in the soul, he should cut the soul of others, just like the devil often does. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Who knows? The soul of the outside world has been thinking for a while, perhaps because of this, it is possible to write seven books, one book and one soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others don’t know how lively the black-haired caster is. They are only a stone's throw away from Kremar. Of course they know that the situation of the black hair caster is not as good as it is on the surface. After leaving the "bad" soldiers and the wizard far away, they let grams Rimal half lie down - 鳗鲡 has an extremely wide back, although the shaking is very powerful, but after the habit, it will feel pretty good, only Mei Mei can not patiently pour out all the things in the stomach, she is dizzy Climbing to the edge of the moss, almost fell, Liona grabbed her belt and gave her a piece of eucalyptus sugar mixed with mint and cinnamon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the effectiveness of snow honey will be better, but now the most need for snow honey is Kreima, Kerry this time, and Birdwin With Gülen, they have fought with their enemies several times before, and they can be said to be exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold snow honey penetrates into the caster's throat, alleviating some pain, he closes his eyes, but still can feel the change of light - the most painful night Already passed, the next more dangerous white 昼 “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” The darkness of the sea is caught in the deepest sleep, replaced by the lich who has memorized all the spells that can be remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were ambushed by the "bad" guild on the edge of the swamp, and then The owners of the caravan also led the soldiers to catch up. If there were not experienced Bywin, Kerry, and the undead, they might have been caught or killed, but the adventurers ended up. Still drilling out from a small loophole, although the enemy is still chasing after them, they only took a short time to climb the steep and complicated peaks and come to the endless stream of stars and rivers - They heard the roar of the thunderous river in a few miles, and the oncoming wind brought a thick dampness. After crossing the last pass, they greeted them with a bright and clear world - starlight The river is at their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry's 鸮 鸮 舒 舒 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在Rimal has seen their ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
