The only child of the King of the Jungle, Ranger Kerry Ben, his current guard, Berlin, former guard, Perant, and several elves who are second only to the king of the jungle, Yinggewei, who are in the silver crown jungle. The most important position, if Ingway is the backbone of this fortress, then they are a solid wall and a dangerous pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This winter before and after."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the jungle, Ingeway, lost not only his wife but also his healthy body in the great catastrophe of a thousand years ago, although his magic has grown with time. Powerful, but the wound that can't be healed is tormenting and weakening him day after day. He once slept once hundreds of years ago to slow down the impact of this wound on him, but the result can only be said to have little effect. Now, when the new catastrophe is brewing, his dormancy may lead to a deep disaster. If you can, even if he will return to the temple of life, Angel, the Ingewell does not mind. Trying to sip a desperate wine, the problem is that his dormancy is not controlled by himself, his waking time is getting shorter and shorter, and the time of sleeping is getting longer and longer, his blood flow rate becomes slow, his heartbeat Time is growing endlessly, if he falls asleep, he doesn’t know himself Can wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lock has been opened," said Berlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the lock is not perfect." Ingway said gently, everyone except him sighed slightly, the silver crown jungle The lock can be said to be one of the most dangerous barriers of this plane, but it is like the Ingewell said, it is not perfect, such as the body of the seventy-seven islands that is always surrounded by a pink stone. Lich Edel, he once cracked the elf's lock, only a few miles into the silver crown of the jungle, if not the king of the jungle personally fight, knock him back. The current silver-crowned jungle may face more embarrassing evil eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, the king of the jungle, Ingeway, will reorganize the locks, change the position, and adjust the chart. To make up for the shortcomings, this work may only be completed by the king of the jungle in a hundred years, and others cannot control the unlocking of such a vast area and complex structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," said Kerry Ben. "We are all back. Father," he lowered his head slightly, because he used this intimate name on such occasions, but he quickly looked up: " The silver crown jungle is not yours, it is ours, everyone, we will protect it, wait for you to wake up," he said: "You will see a more beautiful and complete jungle." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case." Berlin asked the king of the jungle: "Please fall asleep with peace of mind, your children will stay up all night. Look after our home. If there are enemies who dare to declare war at this time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will put a pink magic arrow on his ass!" This rushed to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that laughed at it was Berlin, and then the older elves, Perant followed, and the king of the jungle finally revealed The sly smile, when he and Kerry Ben laughed, it was exactly the same, even with a bit of naughty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original stagnation of the atmosphere gradually disappeared with laughter, and each elf knew that they would lose the most solid shield and the sharpest spear. But they are not afraid, the jungle belongs to all the elves, it is the home of the elves. It is also the treasure of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the Grey Ridge?" Ingwi asked, with a smile on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant bowed to their king with respect, "The half-elves have all withdrawn from the depths of the Grey Ridge," his fingers light in the void Lighter. The simple image of the gray ridge and the silver-crowned jungle appeared in front of everyone. "If you encounter strong enemies, they can disperse and sneak into the forest belt." Although the silver-crowned jungle is called the silver-crowned jungle, in fact it is only the entire silver crown. A small part of the wood belt, the place covered by the lock is also limited to this. The elves allowed the half-elves to enter the gray ridge adjacent to the silver-crowned jungle. The half-elves, in addition to being licensed by the king of the jungle, could never enter the real jungle, but they could escape into the silver-crowned forest belt. As humans and humanoids with elder bloodlines, they will not be rejected by the forest belt, and the forest belt will shelter them and hide them until the new havoc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cremar?" Kerry asked, since the half-elves were mentioned, it is absolutely impossible to neglect such a special one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is dying in Wanweilin." Berlin said uncertainly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a mage," Kerry said with a grin. "Sometimes I will be lost in Wanweilin too - it is so interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I hope he has found the book he is looking for." King Ingle, the king of the jungle, said, "Let's go find him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you Dad," Kerry said happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you feel it?" After seeing the back of Kerry's back, the king of the jungle asked with suspicion: "Kerry is against Crema. The attitude is really a bit odd."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the silver crown jungle has not been born for a hundred or two hundred years." Perant said sharply - Every time he mentions the great catastrophe of the millennium, he is not willing to talk, but he is simply the kind of guy who doesn’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I am dormant," Ingwi’s father said, "I hope to see Kerry’s children."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What disappointed him was that no one answered him this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you found the book you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry asked, his boat moved slowly At the side of the black-haired spellcaster, the bows of the two boats intimately touched together, and the Ranger put his arms into the lake. The lake was so warm, and there were books like fish swimming over his fingers, but Kerry has just received a huge impact, and he will not want to read any books for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found it." The soul of the outside world replied lazily, it is really not easy to control your own thoughts. Give a chestnut, just like you are throwing in the sea. There are tens of thousands of small balls of foam, and then you need to find the only one before they break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you still don't want to leave, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very quiet." The soul of the world said, “I can hardly feel that time is passing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The time here has indeed been magical," Kerry said. "Here. All things are semi-stagnant." So all the books can be saved so perfectly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, can't the books here be taken out?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I can only rely on memory.” Kerry Ben said: “How? Let me see your book.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair caster silently lifts up The book in the arms - the book can be used as a shield or a cutting board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, maybe the word inside..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world opened the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did not expect," the soul of the opposite world muttered to himself: "After 12 years of the college entrance examination, I have to spend all night. Endorsement...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was already the third day after Kreima finally escaped from the quiet cage. Kerry had seen him once and was busy at other times. Krimaar didn't know what they were busy with, but the atmosphere of the silver-crowned jungle was really tense. The tree house in Grey Ridge was put on hold, and they built a new igloo in the deeper forest belt. Not quite normal, the Singer Elf will not easily discard the original houses, even if they were originally built with silver crowns that have been dumped in the jungle, already dead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the otters have moved, and the parents of the otters have a child. They can’t leave the river too far, so they changed their homes in the upper reaches of the original nest, and the souls of the outside world made a The pot of fat fish soup. The right to warm the nest, for this he was also authorized to touch the face of the white face three times, and fortunately saw their youngest child, the white fluff has not faded, the two eyes are big It was bright, and when the white face of the otter and its wife were drinking fish soup around Mithril, it and its brothers yelled around in a hurry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sneak peek at the sneak peek at the sneak peek.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We can’t wait any longer "Gaiwen said: "We don't have time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean that we act ourselves?" Knight repaired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes no difference," Gavin said. "We are not without a mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is only one." The Cavalier said: "And they have two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They must be prepared," said Gnoon McGee, because he is willing to provide weapons. Relationship. So I got the qualification to participate in this conference, but he felt that these human minds are too simple: "And now the White Tower is a thief's lair, there are robbers and thieves everywhere, and their lords are said to have a fine network guild. There is no inseparable relationship. There are no businessmen who are willing to do business seriously. They will go to Baita. They have arrived at Baita. They are either robbed or stolen, and may even lose their lives."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei took a look at Yadel, she may be the only person who knows the relationship between Yadell and Baita, and the pastor of Rosada is bitter. Baita is a city where his father has exhausted his life. He was born and raised, thinking that he will return to the place at the foot of Rosata in the future. His eldest brother died because of the city, and his second brother also It can be said that it is in its darkness. Now it is his cousin who rules the city, but she does not seem to be as good as Yadel expects, perhaps when she says the ruthless and cruel judgment. Give up hope - he should give up his honor, give up his faith, and compete with Anzhen for the rule of the White Tower. At least the White Tower will not become what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go," Yadel said firmly: "No one is more familiar with White Tower than I am," he glanced at the people around him, gently touching The brand on the face: "I was exiled by the ruler there, and I have already received the forgiveness of Rosada. I am a pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gael looked at the face of Yadel, and the brand of blasphemy and blasphemy remained on his face. They first symbolized shame and sin. Later they symbolized repentance and honesty. Now, They symbolize holiness and sacrifice: "Yes," he said. "And you, the pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there anyone else?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And me." Gülen said, "I am a thief. If Yadel is familiar with the White Tower, I am familiar with thieves. Without me, you may have been caught a hundred feet away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I don't understand why you are willing to take risks." Gavin said bluntly: " We want to face two warlocks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to build a guild, not so bad," Gülen is also very frank: "But Without the support of His Royal Highness Liona, this idea will always be an idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei hesitant, she thought about it like Leona That...become a woman worthy of Bedwin's pride, but she also knows that it is dangerous, and they already have a pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mei?" Gülen looked at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For me, give it a try," Gülen said. Not for Byrdwin, for me," he didn't look at plum during his speech. The heart of Plum was so violently beating: "For me, just for me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei took a deep breath, "I," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavalier frowned in disbelief. "I don't think of a Fro priest..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We need every strength." Gavin said: "Welcome, plum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei slightly trembled, her fingers cold It was like reaching into the sea in the harsh winter, until Gülen reached out and held it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are we going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't enter the White Tower at night," Gülen estimated, knowing Gavin's thoughts. "The night will only make dangerous places more dangerous."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
