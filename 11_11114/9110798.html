			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant mountain can still breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His arms and legs were broken, his eyes were walked by the priest's vultures, but the vultures had to open his chest and pull out his internal organs. The Frost Giant waved his stump and the bones broke, but the arm that was connected with the flesh hit the vulture. It made a rough scream and flew in a hurry, but Jushan knew that it didn't fly far, it was waiting. Waiting for Jushan to spit out the last breath, it will be able to eat without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the mountain is tenacious. In his more than one hundred years of life, he has died more than once - he remembers very clearly, he is still a When she was young, his mother, a female cream giant, refused to continue feeding him. He grabbed her ankle, bitten through the flesh, pulled her down, and crawled on her body to bite her **** He sucked milk and blood; he also stole the meat of an adult cream giant and was thrown into the ice sea. At that time, the mountain without a name struggled for a long time under the ice. His fist was not enough. Breaking through the thick layers of ice, the cold water filled his stomach like an inflated fishing rod, but that time he did not die, and several black and white killer whales regarded him as a food from the sky, he Catch one of them and block its stomata with your fingers. Sure enough, the killer whale quickly took him to a place where he could see the sun. That time, he not only had to return to his life, but also hunt until the day. The biggest prey; when he has the name of the giant mountain, he can be with adulthood. When the Frost Giants went out to hunt together, they also encountered too many cold snake lizards. The monsters are not only bad, but also very dangerous. It is said that only the white dragons or silver dragons living here will use them as food. - The snake lizard's teeth bite through the shoulders of the giant mountain. No one wants to drag him back. It is the giant mountain that climbed back to the tribe. The tribe's priest gave him a herb, and he lived again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he was injured when he competed with other Frost Giants for the position of the tribal leader, and the curse he had suffered - Jushan can be sure of those The festering flesh is the curse cast by the priest, but he has no way to identify a priest unless he can find another priest to serve him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jushan prayed to Kawu, and promised him a thousand, 10,000 human flesh and blood, and promised him half the number of newborns in the tribe After that, all, and then all, except for the life of the giant mountain, as long as the Kawu luxury god can give him blessing, he is willing to kill 100 lives every day for Kawu. As long as he can stand up, the injury can be healed (just like every time before), he will let his eldest son mourn for a whole night before being allowed to die, but if Kahu extravagance requires it, he can also Forgive the priest's crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all this needs to be heard by the Kaussian god. The mountain is ambiguously squatting. His lungs may be stabbed by the broken ribs. Every breath or shouting will make him feel painful and feel him watching. The missing dagger is piercing deeper. In addition, he still has a very strange feeling, that is, the cold, the frost giant should not feel the cold easily, they have the same fat and fur as the snow bear, but he just feels cold, really cold, cold him It was almost stiff—his eldest son and the priest not only took his gold, but also took his bag. How much he missed the wine in the bag, the wine poured into his mouth like melted ice. The block, when it reaches the throat, becomes a flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gasps and speaks words that he can't understand, and then the Frost Giants perceive that a person is approaching himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something going through here, the fabric rubbing against each other, knowing that the small sound of the cable is endless, the giant mountain can hear it, his fuzzy consciousness suddenly becomes awake, Is this the response that Kawu Luxury gave him? A smashing human, he tried to smell the smell in the air, the smell of warm blood flowing under the skin, but he couldn't smell anything, the air rushed from his nose to his chest, for a while. After a long cold, he could not see anything, but he could feel the shadow is approaching himself - come, come, the giant mountain said in his heart, he could not help but hate the priest and the eldest son who took the gold again, if he Still wearing so much gold, then this human may lose vigilance because of greed, after all, the giant mountain seems to be dying, but Jushan knows that he can still sit up. He opened his mouth and exposed his teeth. The Frost Giant had a sharp, hard tooth, but they also fell. When the giant mountain plundered humans, it was discovered that some people would replace the fallen teeth with gold. He did the same. The tooth embedded in the empty gums is a crown. Of course, now it can't see the original look, but gold is gold. When the mountain and the eyes are there, you can see it shining from the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this man approaches him and wants to take his teeth, the giant mountain will bite him, his blood will flow into the throat of the giant mountain, let The giant mountain has to return to the warmth, and he will become a sacrifice to please Kayu luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really close, or is it? For the first time, Jushan couldn't believe his feelings. The sound of blood rushing in the ears of the frost giants formed a roar like an echo or a tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this, a small gift from Austal?" The man said that Jushan "jumped" while hearing the sound. Up, his already hungry teeth collided in the air, and the vibration caused the mountain to be dizzy, but then the fear shrouded him, and he did not bite anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
