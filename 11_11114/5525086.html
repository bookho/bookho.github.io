			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The caster Kremar," the lich took a step back and humbly crossed his shoulders with his hands, and then he said, "May the magic star shine for me." Left and right, the respected Master Alva."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will never dissipate." Master Alva said that his right hand is pressed under the heart, there is no embarrassment but only Slightly bowed, this is a friendly mage with a protective meaning, common among less familiar mage (when they are strong and weak): "Welcome to Bibi Dyke, and my haze hut." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smog lodge is located in the Midtown of Bibi Dibao. Although it is called a lodge, it is actually a comfortable residence with 12 rooms. Among the lush white stalks and flowering boxwood. Master Alva often receives his friends here, allowing them to stay here, and he will occasionally come and stay. After all, his tower is not a place where you can live comfortably, and there are too many secrets inside, but this It does not mean that he will be negligent here, Alva knows how much he wants to pirate and thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the pair of statues of bronze snakes standing on both sides of the porch, their eyes are amethyst, the casters are often used on the golem. That way, their six arms are holding silvery shallow water trays filled with fragrant violets, from the two-tone peony and golden enamel of Serris, their knives are commonly used by the knives. There are double-edged axes, not cast on the body. The lich does not doubt that they can jump at any time, waving the deadly iron guys to make any meaty people who dare to break into the place without the owner’s consent. - His mind has even conceived how a thief struggled hard to escape from twelve arms - and two tails, the length of which can run through the entire porch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but if you are standing here, it is "it"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich moves his sight from the weapon to the scorpion with dew, they are as big as the baby’s fist, and the golden surface is covered with a layer of fine Small, aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical image of the metal moved, and after the lich showed an appropriate surprise, a slap was sent to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Eat, these are not for display," the owner of the cottage said happily: "They are fresh, watery and sweet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can't let your guests stand on the porch and have a good time." Captain Cobbert protested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, you are right, old friend." Master Alva made a snap, so the two statues entered the reception room with them. Another guest of Master Alva stood up and greeted them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is similar in height to Kremar, but the long hair below the shoulders shows the light golden light of the morning light, and the eyes are like the sky after the morning sun. Like a wash (summer sky), his skin is white, but unlike Kremar's slightly indifferent mother-of-pearl white, it is between ivory white and milky white, and looks vibrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark gray-green hood hangs outside the cloak of the same color, and the two strands of hair are braided into cute little scorpions that cling to the back of the head and cover him. The most obvious feature - belonging to the elf, a pair of pointed and long ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friend, Kerry Ben," said Master Alva, "a Ranger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "We have seen it before," said Kerry Ben, who showed a true smile when he saw Crimall: "The thief was the one he helped me," he turned to Rimal, "I was still sorry that I didn't get to know you at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it's not too late." Captain Cobbert smiled and said "He is Kremar, an excellent caster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His skill is equally impressive." Keller this sincerely praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your arrow skills are even more unforgettable." Krimari responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think we can taste the wine while we come to each other again," Alva interrupted. "Does anyone want a hookah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva's meeting room is where many people are willing to keep a place in memory, the wizard skillfully interweaves magic and luxury - the magic behind the wainscot of striped ebony Symbols, the lines on the exquisite tapestry flickering, the embossed figures on the large seats squinting their eyes day and night; the magically locked triangle cabinets and the sacred cabinet are placed with wands and scrolls, the inside are赝品, those few are powerful real goods only Alva knows; the rosestone floor between the low couch and the seat is covered with a soft blanket with ten feet square, and the weaving picture is vividly for the guests. Recovering this fierce hooked red-bellied spider in the vines and leaves to hunt down the scenes of colorful birds and insects - but as long as one command, the plants and animals inside will live, insects, spiders will bite Feet and inject venom, and the birds will peck at your ears and eyes, the vines will penetrate any holes in your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotating the small organs on the wall allows the silver lanterns hanging from the high dome to slowly descend and rise, so that the apprentices can light the candles above, but if any careless little guy pushes it up, Then he had to pray that there was no one under the lamp stand at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these, there are some small tricks that are not worth mentioning, but at some point they may play an unexpected role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master asked his guests to sit down in the seat, and the apprentices left with wine and shisha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich was placed in a very interesting position, facing the Alva Master, on the right hand side is the Ranger Kerry Ben, from the huge glass window The sun is raising his temperature, from the skin to the hair, from the surface to the inside, how many years have he not enjoyed the sun, food and wine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Creek Master," Master Alva said: "Although you humbly call yourself a 'caster,' I think you have left your The tutor can be called a mage, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m not sure,” said Kremar, adding the right amount to his voice. Pain, "He died before I was allowed to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master moved his finger to the heart position, closing his eyes and opening. "Please accept the same sorrow," he said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorrow," said the captain and the ranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you ask your tutor's name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beavis."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bives Master of Longhuo Island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva has worked with this wizard several times. Beavis is a brown skin, a small brown-brown hair, muscular like a dwarf, and a bit like a dwarf. A bit rude, but witty, straight and kind, specializing in the ability to spell, Alva once wanted him to stay in Bibi Dibao, but he refused. The last time they met was 16 years ago, Alva could hardly recognize him. He became thin and sloppy. The dull skin was loosely hanging between the towering bones, and his heart filled with charcoal hatred— - He is chasing a gray robe that killed his wife, Su Lun is on, the unfortunate woman even has five months of pregnancy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in the summer when he left Bitumil, and he saw him in the Seventy-seventh Islands in the winter, but there was no credible news after that. Alva had a premonition, but when he heard his death The heart still inevitably passed a trace of mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did he die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is fighting with Master Praden I was seriously wounded and irreparably." So I kindly gave him the final blow. Incidentally, this male soul is unusually hot and spicy, and tastes good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Platton?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His death is earlier than my respectable Mentor." With my help. The lich said in his heart that although the guy had the same mentor (the real mentor), the former's stupid arrogance has become the stain of the whole tower (especially he especially loves to show off in front of the succubus and the banshee). It’s really unbearable to display his lame spells. I really don’t know what a bone shelf can do, use his femur?), I can easily wipe it out and believe that no one will complain about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Platton is the name of the gray robe, Alva is gratified, for his friend’s wish, but he does not remember Beavis or other Someone mentioned that he has an apprentice named Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When did Beavis become your mentor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Year of Brilliance October."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva thinks that he has involuntarily revealed the color of appreciation, this young man only got along with Beavis and studied for half a round (six Year), but he has been able to knock down a mage with many years of combat experience, even if it is just a mage with the same ability to cast spells and character, plus all the things in the port and the little bird, all of this It shows that he has more than just the talent of casting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deeply regrets that Beavis has never been able to know how distinguished his disciple is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caubert told me that you want to go to the White Tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where to stay there There are some personal items from the mentor." In fact, there are many, the lich has looked at every item in his memory, but he didn't need it at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva nodded in understanding, and the relationship between the mentor and the disciple was sometimes greater than that of the father and son, not to mention that Beavis had no descendants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar turned the silver cup in his hand:" I will travel to Gray Ridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you need in Grey Ridge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Stabilization, and tempering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master looked at him, and the things inside were enough to fill a scroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gray Ridge does not accept humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar did not answer, he put down the silver cup Slowly took off his gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his hands and Kerry had taken off his gloves. His gloves were half-finger, gray buckskin, with a chain on his back. network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sun, the two hands are similar, the fingers are slender, smooth, white, and the joints are distinct - each finger has one more joint than the human The human knuckles are nine, and their knuckles are fourteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has raised his eyes and stared at Kremar’s black hair: "Your black hair is from Aya, is it a mother, or a father?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can’t say,” Kreima retracted his hands and put on gloves to hide features different from humans. "I can only tell you that he is not an elf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He raises you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" His servant raised me until he was fourteen years old," said the half-elf of the black hair. "I belonged to my mentor later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master showed a little The color of sympathy, he glanced at Cobert, which may explain why there are so many conflicts and violations in this young man - he is hard and alert when he mentions his father, and there is no feeling of attachment. It can be seen that he did not get too much warmth from his blood relatives, but he did inherit the character and belief of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not uncommon for elves to love humans or other intelligent creatures. They will be with their spouses for years or decades, and there may be children during this period, but in any case, the spouses’ external spouses are mixed with them. The descendants of blood of other races will be rejected outside the forest, Eya in the south, and the Singh elves in the north. In this respect, the cold and cruelty of the sharp ears is so unbelievable; It is more reassuring to say that the Singer Elves are slightly more compassionate than the Eya Elf. They contain unsupervised half-elves, allowing them to live in the Grey Ridge outside the Silver-crowned jungle and give them a certain amount of care. But as compensation, they need to serve for 60 years in the Silver Crown jungle as a warrior and a warrior on the first line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love of the elves is longer than humans, but unfortunately the lifespan of human beings is so short, their passions are fleeting, and most elves will carry The destroyed spirit and body return to the jungle alone, and only a few will leave the children who are raising them - lonely, painful and dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More children have been thrown away to their human blood relatives, and some of these people have no place to live, some are economically embarrassed, some are sloppy, and still Some children who have been angered by their own children or themselves have suffered terrible accidents. Compared with children who are willing or involuntarily left behind, some people may say that Krimaar is safely able to live to the age of being able to follow the tutor. But that doesn't tell you anything -- in many cases, a child can grow into an adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva spit out a smog that was rendered golden by the sun and smells sweet. Beavis’ wife was one who had been abandoned by both parents and suffered The infinitely miserable half-elf, he must have remembered her when he saw this child, so he will suddenly give up and continue to stun in the exhaustion of the long and rough road of revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the adults for their reward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquor <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reward 1888 starting currency<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diicith<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reward 588 starting currency<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cool--Fi... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
