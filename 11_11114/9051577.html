			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that the calmness of the black-haired spellcaster makes most of the people in the room relieved, perhaps only Kerry Ben-- When the twilight sank into the blue sea of ​​gems and rendered it as a bright and infinite mirror, reflecting the magical star river across the sky, he stepped into the tent of Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar does not mind continuing to share a tent with the Elf Ranger, Kerry has declined, although the class division in the Silver Crown is more inclined Responsibility, not rights, but the Ranger has not received the hospitality of the authorities in the country and region of mankind hundreds of times. Even the Alva Master of Biyindi Fort has considerable authority. He has also accepted the human king. The invitation briefly became the ruler of a region, so he is still very clear about the practice of seemingly sloping on the surface. Krimaar is still a toddler in the elves, but in humans. It is the owner of 100,000 slaves and an island. He can squeeze out the last coin from the land and turn it into his own scroll, casting material and even the Master Tower. It is also allowed to crush any one that is not respectful to him or It is a violation of his laws; or he just wants to see how the flames engulf an island, and it can make the entire side of the island a scorched earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds a bit ridiculous, but a paper curse housed in the wizard’s Wanweilin records an emperor because he wants to build a new king. He secretly ordered his slaves to arson in the middle of the night, and tens of thousands of humans ran away in the flames and smoke. When they were crying, he sipped a glass of honey in the palace at the top of the mountain overlooking it. Write a long poem and an outline of a tragedy in this "great sight." Of course, he did not escape the hand of the angry people. They grabbed him, cut his throat, and poured boiling blood on the land that was covered by thick ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada sleeps outside the tents of Kremar. According to the practice of Longhuo Island, a tent with the entire island as the "owner" of the territory can not be so shabby. There should be no less than six servings in the tent, two maids. Two couch maids, two eunuchs, or more are allowed, just as the highest courtesy of the guests is to let them walk on the backs of the beautiful female slaves or the chest. They can also replace carpets, couches, and bedding with those wonderful and warm bodies, which are the most in the Long Fire Island. However, Kreima is a caster, which saves him a lot of tongues. There are also masters on the Longhuo Island. The eunuchs with a little knowledge and experience will know that the mages may be more beautiful than the mortals. But when they meditate and rest, they definitely don't want to see people other than themselves in the room. Some mages will also set a deadly trap in their own room, which is a small gift they give to uninvited guests. gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diligent young eunuch really prepared a tent full of female slaves for his new owner, but the eunuchs were always good at observing the words. He has already discovered that in this team, the vulgar position of the leader is the elf Kerry. Although he seems to be mild in nature, there are few roars and loud orders, but others are willing to listen to him. Especially the black-haired caster, the new owner of the side island, he is very gentle, can even be said to be a bit naive, almost no madness and greed that a ruler should have; as a friend of Kerry Ben, Badwin’s identity is slightly For his half-man, and the daughter of his side, Leona, has its own dignity and authority. Gülen is obviously attached to the Master, and Mei Mi is the thief's gimmick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply say, if you want to enter the Kreima tent, it is not Kerry, but Birdwin or Gülen. They will be blocked by Dada, but Kerry is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar is sitting on a whale blanket with his feet on, and the whale skin is thick and smooth, blocking the chill and moisture from the sand. The caster's knees are cluttered with some things - fluorite for lighting, spell books, small crystal cups, hookahs, and some brown squares. The hookah was ignited, and the translucent cyan mist lingered in the tent, like the dark red sparks of the animal's eyes flashing in the low light, squeaking in the smoke, and the elf smelled a strange smell that could not be said. It is not that it is stinky or irritating. On the contrary, it smells like charred honey, sweet and fragrant, rich and heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"‘Tobacco’?” asked the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's an extract." Kremar said, "I asked Dada for a piece." He said as he gestured. A cold wind swept past the elves, and the smell quickly dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has rejected the second spell cast by Kremar: "The elf is not affected by this tobacco." He said that most Toxins in biology and plants have no effect on elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world releases the finger, letting the spell dissipate in the hand, he does not need it, this slight toxin does not pose a threat to him at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Ranger sat down across from Kremar. "Can you tell me why?" In fact, he was the first to see Kremar. Something reveals such a strong hatred and jealousy, and he suspects that it may cause greater and worse effects than the existing ones, given that Beavis has stayed in Longfire Island for such a long time, What he might have discovered, and then told this to Krimari, and the elf was puzzled by the fact that Kreima did not seem to have seen this crop on the Longhuo Island, which was concealed by Beavis. Or for other reasons? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world hesitated for a while. He didn't know what to say. He couldn't tell the elf that the photos of the crop often appeared on the school's newspaper, the bulletin board of the community, and the walls of the public hub, and those who were omnipresent. Media. When it was still an ordinary human being, I always felt that these things were far away from me, like the monsters hidden under the bed and the closet when I was a child. When they really jumped out of the darkness, who else could keep it? Calm? Fortunately, in this plane, all casters are able to cast spells or spells that destroy toxins. The spells (magic) are not so high on the caster's level, and as far as Dada is concerned, It has not spread to large areas outside Longhuo Island on a large scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean it will be addictive." The elf said: "But the spell can dispel the toxin, no matter where it is hidden, and as you said Even if there is no need for spells, as long as there is help and willpower, it is not very difficult to get rid of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really," said Kremar Thanks to the cheap tutor Mr. Beavis. Things related to this crop can be pushed to him: "The body's addiction can be forcibly quit, but you can't root out the desires in the soul," he thought. "It... is a kind of energy." A good thing to make people happy. And what you have to do is very simple, ignite it, and then suck it up - for ordinary people, this is absolutely impossible to get rid of the temptation. Kerry Ben, you see. As long as it is human , or elves, dwarves, or even orcs, they always have troubles and sorrows, but we always have a way to make ourselves happy," he said, holding a chestnut: "I am, if I have anything, it will upset my mind." Now, I can talk to the 'white face' (Kerry has cast a playful look, not a fight? He said in a lonely language, but the soul of the outside world does not see it.) You can also go to the exchange point. Eucalyptus, give yourself a grilled fish, take a hot bath... In short, there are too many things that make me happy, but this kind of thing, this kind of thing brings happiness to people is definitely not this, it... ..." The black caster is tough Choosing the vocabulary: "It's a very irritating thing, the Beavis instructor told me that after further purification it will make people fall into an unparalleled pleasure, that is any kind of person who can make people Joyful and satisfying things are incomparable joy. Compared with hungry people who get bread or clear water, loved ones are jealous of each other, or they continue to work for several days and nights. - As long as you have tasted it once, then other things can no longer attract the interest of that person. The people controlled by it will not feel hungry, nor feel cold, nor need loved ones, lovers and friends, Kerry It affects not only the body, but also the spirit and the soul. Even if the priest and the mage can cast a sacred spell or a spell to expel its venom, as long as there is a memory associated with it, then that person has a great You may be eager to search for it again - unless he will not suffer even a little bit of setbacks from then on, but Kerry Ben, you know, this is simply impossible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once something that makes him unhappy, he will immediately be hungry for this 'tobacco'. In any case, it is like a sword directly, and it can eliminate all the troubles in the shortest time; Others, like delicious food, soft beds, or lovers' kisses, are just like itching. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words can be said to be messy and clueless, but Kerry has understood the meaning of the caster after a little thought, and his look gradually Become serious: this plane has not yet seen humans or humanoids controlled by this gorgeous plant, but the elves can speculate and imagine - if the crop spreads out, if it is true, as Kremar said, It gives human happiness better than the instinctive sensory stimulation, which is simply the most terrible thing - the elves have seen alcoholic people, their hearts are very fragile, in order to escape the crush of life and fate, they You can get everything in exchange for a bad drink, as long as it is wine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared to wine..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It's much more powerful than wine," Kreima slammed his head and thought for a while, adding, "Many times. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Kerry has only seen this plant on the Longhuo Island, and the Longhuo Islands are similar to the closed environment and the outside world. The less friendly attitude also strongly curbed the spread of this dangerous crop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s bitter, they seem to have no way to do this. - You can't let those slaves die in vain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's the time. "The soul of the opposite world said. "But before this," he continued: "We may need to modify the original itinerary, Kerry Ben, what do you think of the side island? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's beautiful. "The Elf Ranger said that he has already understood the meaning of Kremar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can make it more beautiful," said the black-haired caster. : "No slaves, no poison. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's true master will not allow it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But," the soul of the outside world lowered his head and pinched his new spell book, then raised his head and smiled slightly: "Give me something." It’s not so easy to get back. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few ships choose to sail at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Cobbert walked up and down his new ship, a beautiful three-masted ship that followed the name of his last ship It is still called the Little Bird, but this little bird is much larger than the original. He now has 30 crew members and 200 passengers. The whole boat is packed full of meals. The meal can only be as simple as one bread per person, or one. potato. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of these people is lighter than that of Bibi Dibao, the nose and mouth are bigger, they have no weapons, but they are wielding swords The people who are with the sword are more daunting. To be straightforward, they are some quenched guys. Unlike the experienced people like Cobbert, well-informed people might think that they are poor mercenaries. But the old believers of Su Lun saw more—they were soldiers, not the soldiers of the lords, but the soldiers of the king. Even on strange ships, they were still able to remain vigilant and disciplined. Two hundred people were placed in decks and cabins. They were strong, at least men who had been strong, but quietly like a group of brown mottled rabbits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting in the middle of the night for two reasons, one is because their leader seems to have the help of a friend, the generous lord is willing to give them a long-term They can't wait to stay in the place, they don't want to wait for one night, another reason is not too many people know - they come from the Thunder Castle in Norman, Highland, because the former lord Bird who was once loyal to Thunder Castle temperature. Tang Klei and the new king’s dissatisfaction, they, not only their family members were expelled, but also attacked by orcs and unknown mercenaries, they can not get a piece of farming land in Norman, Highland, their hometown, The lords or knights are willing to take them; the rulers of other countries and regions are taboo, and they are not allowed to stay on other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luzer Dagong kindly allowed them to temporarily rest in his border with Norman Norman, but this time limit is almost here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Bedwin. Don Cray's things, Alva Master of the Bibi Dyke, as well as the consul and Cobbert, have heard of them, they expressed sympathy and understanding of this unfortunate knight, but the consul of Bibi Tibao or Alva Master This attitude cannot be revealed. After all, there is a whole city and their people behind them. The guardians of Yadel and Thunder Castle have to find a place outside the walls of the Bibi dike, where the people live. Temporary shelter, when I heard that Yadell wanted to go to Longhuo Island for exploration and experimentation, some merchants found him under the suggestion of Alva Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
