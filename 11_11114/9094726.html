Pain, in the previous battle, he suffered a little injury, although it has been urgently treated, but the newborn skin is always very fragile, he can know from the cheeks and neck without touching What is the warm liquid? He saw that the dark shadow, which almost occupies half of the martyrdom, took a step forward. The arm of the Mithril was extended forward. The end was neither a wide sword nor a hammer, but a Short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please, Byrdwin!" Gülen shouted: "Bedwin, open your eyes and look, I am Gülen! Gülen Your companion, I am not an enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin smiled a bit, don't ask how Gülen is in the darkness of this light. It was an instinct to see it all, and the intuition told him that Baldwin was smiling, and that the former owner of Thunderbolt seemed to have completely lost control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— The following is the anti-theft section, which will be updated before 6 pm tomorrow - sorry, because it may be going out tomorrow morning, so I can't make sure to change it before ten o'clock. Just in case, just a little delay, 120,000 points Sorry. In the update chapter I will increase the number of words to compensate everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the Lev family is all here," Birdwin muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can't be people," said Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves only feel that they have been fighting the undead, or the magical thing for a hundred years, he feels extremely exhausted, even if there are elves Potion, he also felt that he would turn into a pile of deep red sand with the wind at any time - but even if the Druid did not make the decision to pursue the last one, they could not lie down and rest in peace. Unless they want to sleep completely, no, since you know that there is a Necromancer, you may not even be able to get the last sleep... Maybe someone would think that Gülen has an advantage in this matter, but Gülen I am not sure if my own specificity is discovered, I will not be placed in a glass jar to become the most proud collection and guinea of ​​gray robes. It is said that many gray robes are for deep and long-lasting pursuit of magic. The mystery and the truth became the Master of the Necromancer. He did not want to know whether the "Black Lev" was a special one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "people" that Bydwin said are tall and tall, even if they have no flesh and blood, but they can still see the original strong and fierce, each body covered with leather, or Chain armor, these original rot and rusted armor are unexpectedly new and complete, their weapons reflect the blue flame in the hollow of the hollow, sparkling a strange chill of the heart - Perant will both hands On the ground, chanting a curse, the stone floor and the wall of the mausoleum creaked, the vines were drilled out of the crevices of the slate, and they were twisted and thrived under the command of the Druid, not only in the gap between them. There was a fence with strong vitality, and it was still rushing to the feet that only left the white bones, trying to pull down those warriors who should have rested in peace. Unfortunately, these cockroaches not only met the adventurers before. The cockroaches are more sturdy and the action is more agile. They even know that the companions who hold the wide swords first go forward and break the unknown vines, while those holding the shackles and the circles The cockroaches summoned the cockroaches of a group of rats in a way that humans could not recognize. The cockroaches of the cockroaches had already rotted, but like human cockroaches, they still have the ability to bite everything, with teeth on them. The plague that allowed any life to suffer from disease, only a moment, the vines that entangled Lev's ancestors could not help but retire and retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The vitality here is too weak," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich shakes his head, which is of course a place where a powerful Necromancer can live, perhaps some people will be thriving Grass and the house mouse are confused, but for a lich, this can only be said to be a trick to ridicule the layman - these grasses and the house mouse are all intentionally raised in gray robes, just to cover up the surrounding Vegetation and living things are forced to wither and die due to long-term infiltration in negative energy, but this camouflage is not true after all, maybe Perant and the house mouse will be aware of it, after all, home Although the rats are omnivorous, it is possible to use the human body as the main food or the human feces as the main food. The experienced herders will not even let their cattle and sheep go through a fierce battle. Going to graze on the plains, because those grasses that seem to be delicious and flourish are grown on human flesh and blood. Some herders think that cows and sheep eat this grass and become crazy, eyes turn red and teeth become sharp, in starvation time Eat their own masters ...... in fact does not, but the sheep will be more than ordinary cattle call to hordes of goblins is an indisputable fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Lev’s family has not been a long-term family, perhaps because of the already chaotic relationship in the area – it’s possible to climb out from the stone The standing knights are only twelve, they have solved the difficult vines, and the blue flames that jump in the eyes are like the ability to rush out of the dark eye sockets, not only can not make people feel warm, but will It made people feel cold, and Baldwin had roared and rushed out. His new arm had been turned from a wide sword to a single-edged axe. The axe was as big as a giant's head. From the left shoulder, he slashed to the right cheekbones. When he still wanted to struggle to connect himself, Birdwin flipped his arm and used the upper end of the axe to strike the eleven or two consecutively and forcefully until he took it. It was only after the smashing and smashing - and before that, a sly knight closest to him opened his mouth without tongue and waved the steel smashing, but it turned out to be a woman. Well, a woman who looks more like a young knight from her face, she has no fear in her eyes, and her hand is also waving a wide sword that can be erected from her forehead to the ground. The sound of screaming with the flails sounded through the entire tomb, and the knight straightened its neck. I don’t know whether it’s amazement or surprise, but neither of them means it will be merciless, but The power displayed by this female warrior is not worse than that of this undead creature. Although the technique is somewhat unfamiliar, but the knight is not smart enough to go there - Lev's family is not the one who passed the title and armor for thousands of years. The family, their genealogy is short and poor, and they are not lucky enough. Of course, they cannot find the outstanding people who are told by the bards to teach their children. Even their masters are just vulgar people, and the children are sent to that one. In the castle of the place, in addition to spending some gold coins in vain, he only participated in some stupid things like eating, drinking, and looting. He did not learn to write or read. A laudable exercise is nothing but a cruel and violent disposition of martial art nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona was fortunate enough to continue to receive the teachings of Pharaoh and several other officials he trusted. Thanks to Norman Norman, this country does not like the beauty of women who are too fragile, as some small southern countries, although they also like it. Charming face and elegant gesture, but they think that only strong women can give birth to healthy children, so Norman women can ride horses, go out, practice martial arts or play around, as the first heir of a country, Li Ao Na was a male to be educated and has an innate power. Her weakness is the lack of practical experience, but she has Baldwin, and those knights who are loyal to them. When they are empty, they are not afraid to practice with Leona for a while - if there must be any absolute disadvantage, it is the first time the Norman king of the Highlands confronts you, if it is a person, of course she Knowing where his fatality is, but it was originally a hole in the body. But she quickly remembered some of the tricks that Baldwin had instructed her. For example, when faced with an enemy that is taller than you, and has a particularly solid flesh, what you have to do is not blindly puncture again and again. His body, especially the chest, although the heart is there, has thick muscles and hard ribs before, but in some places, it is impossible to grow muscles anyway, such as joints and many key parts of males - There are no muscles, and some important organs are missing, but they still follow human rules when they act, that is, their bones do not reverse, they do not suddenly change direction, and Leona can see The place where the bone is connected to the bone has a dark gray fascia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had previously learned that Baldwin tried to break the bones, but the upper body of this knight was covered with a fine chain, not a leather armor, and Those bones will quickly close even if they are hit and left cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anything that gives the king a unique inspiration, perhaps it’s how the casters dealt with the stupid guy, she’s like a girl turning Turning her weapon lightly like a daisy, it is not facing the enemy with a knight who is never lacking in power. Although she uses a heavy wide sword, it is like a fine sword. It’s hard to deal with – after it finally hit the joint between the ulna and the humerus twice, the bones in that place began to loosen, and after a strong blow suddenly the whole land fell, with the falling of the flail Even breaking a little finger bone, the knight looked puzzled and didn't seem to understand how he was captured by an arm. When it lifted the shield and tried to resist the attack, the shield also came from its eyes. We can say that) fall, of course, if you give it time, those bones can still condense and return to their original position, like those gargoyles, but Leona is not that kind of stupid kindness. Man, she strode forward, leaned over and lifted the shield, and lifted it up, just hitting the skull that was spurting cold and smoldering. At the same time, her wide sword cut off the connection between the tibia and the femur. In the place, in the screams that humans could not hear, the knight fell on his back and some of the broken bones fell to the ground. Leona did not hesitate to pierce the wide sword into its ribs, and then double-handed shields. Like Bidwin's look, he slammed down ten times in a row until the flames in the eye sockets went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
