			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port suddenly fell into a terrible silence, and even the sound of the waves hitting the rocks became sticky and low, and the ecstasy of summoning a demon master was like The tide faded away from the mind of the female warlock, replaced by the nameless fear and panic. She could only summon the devil below the Anzu Demon class. This time she borrowed the treasure of the Eastern Crown Lord, both to satisfy Her own lust is also to show her strength in front of others, but in her predictions, the best result is that the bones or the horns will call the lord to give her a lot of enviable. Power and sacrifice, but a demon master and a high-level devil are two different concepts. Even her most powerful brother should be careful when facing a demon master. She doesn’t even know what to do next. do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak," said the demon Lord, the voice may be said to be gentle and affectionate, and the impact on the Master is not so great, only to say It’s some nausea noise: “I’m listening, warlock.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one of the parties to the contract is either a caster, the mortal It is difficult for the law to make fair sanctions or judgments, so they are more accustomed to swearing to the Magic Star River. If the conditions of the contract are violated, then the party that violates will be deprived of the right to cast magic; and if the contract involves The benefits are too great, so large that a caster may abandon his innate privileged identity, then they will go to the temple of good gods such as Tyre or Rosada, requesting the gods to be witnesses of the contract. But one third of the people who are standing here are warlocks, although the elves have said that not every warlock is evil, but the caster who can occupy a place on the Longhuo Island is afraid of this life. Will not step into the gods of the above two gods . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock who has the dragon's blood will certainly not choose the former. In the face of so many casters, even the little devil or the succubus may not be able to do it. No omissions. She finally decided to change the spellcasting materials and spells used in the summoning, summoning a high-order devil for this contract, and she even thought about how to confront the devil word that was called. Bargaining does not mean that she will marry a little sacrifice, but the summoner's too easy answer will make a devil feel angry. They like to slap their lips and make a dance-like contest with the casters, and get the most extreme pleasure from the anger and frustration of the losers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then came here is a demon master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone knows, the devil is orderly, and the devil is chaotic. Some people have signed a contract with the devil, but the proportion of the contract that can fully achieve the intended purpose is astonishing and to what extent. Even the scorpion, which is in the tavern, will scream when the bard sings an evil wizard to sign a contract with a demon, accusing him of using the wrong word, not the devil, the devil, the devil. Credit is obviously much better than the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now what can she say, she can say: Oh, the bottomless abyss is down, the devil's Lord Grazite, I am not calling you, but It is a high-level demon. Although you would like to have a pleasant single free trip in the main plane, I am sorry that your credit went bankrupt 10,000 years ago. I don't believe you, others don't believe you, can you roll back and pick up a bones or a succubus? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, no one will do that, they are deeply bowed, and they dare not let the demon's Lord look directly at their faces, lest the devils from them See what is in the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it makes no sense, and the female warlock as the summoner moved his lips slightly after a brief iteration. But before she spoke, a voice broke the silence of the warlock with the devil's blood to the demon's Lord. Deep enough for his hair to touch the knee and then he explained to Grazt the reason for the summoning, and diligently showed the scroll to the sorghum's demon above the Obsidian Throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Grazt got enough information from the bones before coming to the main plane. He doesn't think there is anything wrong with being a witness to a contract signed by a group of wizards and warlocks. Although the beginning is a bit boring and monotonous, he believes that this game will always become extremely interesting. He will stay in the male warlock. On the body, the devil's eyes are grandmother green, but unlike the elves, the colors of the irises like the newborn leaves or the vast lakes, this green is like the sap of the broken liver and gallbladder, and it is like beating between the bones. The phosphorus fire is as cold and hard as the northernmost ice ridge. His gaze makes everyone horrified and numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his sixth finger and swayed gently, the reel flew from the male warlock’s hand and landed between his hands, the devil Straightening the reel, I was interested in knocking, and then some of the obvious things were fascinating, because the contract was not only related to blood and death, but also to curb them: "I will supervise this contract," Devil's The Lord will throw it at once, just throwing the reel in front of the warlock of the East Crown lord: "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nada." The female warlock quickly replied that she took the scroll and boldly smiled at the demon, and the original well-knit needle didn't know when it disappeared, and the bound neckline opened. Between the **** position, there is not much skin exposed, but in the red robes they are like solidified fat or shiny moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Various name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness." Because of the devil The Lord did not allow her to call herself a slave. The female warlock changed her name sharply. She tried to look at the devil's expression, but found that it had been shrouded in a black mist and she bowed her head in a respectful manner: "Thank you for your help. ......" She snorted because she didn't know if she should raise a sacrifice or other reward at this time, but since Grazt just wanted to be happy, then... anyway, the devil can always get what he wants. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please sign your name, you," she said. "In the strong and majestic demon Lord, Grazt's testimony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a few casters are still reluctant, now they want to leave, even if they lose the favor of the master, in a witness by the demon master Signing the contract, they always feel that they will lose more than get, but I don't know when. The devil's fog has enveloped the entire port. They turned back and couldn't even see their own ship. It is now clear that they have lost the opportunity to repent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so. No one wants to be the first one. Finally, an unfortunate old wizard who was closest to the Obsidian Throne took the threat of a female warlock to sign his name in the blank part of the scroll. As soon as he finished writing the last letter of the letter, the black name flashed into a lava-like reddish red, then slowly infiltrated into the reel, and finally the starlight flashed, indicating that the magical star river had accepted the contract, he The agreement with the East Crown has come into effect. Then they came one by one, and signed their name unsatisfactorily. The warlock with the demon blood is probably an exception. He seems to be very relaxed. When signing the name on the reel, it was a wave of it. When he retired and asked another person to sign, he also had a heartfelt smile on the female warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiles at the last moment in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An invisible giant suddenly grabbed him and lifted him into the air, and everyone could see how his deformed body was clearly Showing the outline of the giant hand, the hand tightened slowly and tightly, and squeezed him from the shoulder to the hip bone a little bit. If it was a mortal, it would probably die at the moment of being caught, but Warlocks with demonic blood can mourn until they are squeezed into two segments. His upper part fell to the ground, splashing red water, and the remaining two feet were able to jump. It is like escaping from the former owner into a safe sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The casters instinctively retreated, the wizard's hands were put into the sleeves, and the warlocks shook the body, and the air was filled with subtle flares caused by magical fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be nervous," Grazt, hidden in the fog, said lazily: "I am just fulfilling my duties, look," the scroll suddenly When it is set up, the paper used for the reel is bleached human skin with soft fine lines. When several mages focused their attention, they found that one of them was not completely hidden: "a little trick." Grazte slammed the palm of his hand coldly: "But it should not be played in front of me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously. The warlock with the devil's blood may think that the demon's master will open the net to him, but he does not understand the devil as he thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So say." When the next wizard was urged to sign on the scroll, the demon's Lord Grazt was dissatisfied with his obsidian throne. Grievance: "It is a mistake to raise a child in the main position. It is too comfortable here. The result is to raise a group of useless little mice. I said, isn't the bottomless abyss a good place? Maybe it is dark, cold, It’s hotter, the war is a little more, the plants are a little less, but at least there are still a lot of scenery, architecture and demons worth seeing, and the food is not so scarce, as long as you like, whether it’s the river or the mourning wasteland. Many souls worth tasting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressions on the casters’ faces are indescribable, and they signed their names in the roar of the demon master. With the headache and tinnitus that can be tolerated, now they just want to leave here, even if they are rushing to the crater that may break out at any time, at least the volcano will not complain about the child's parenting problems like a blame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcer suddenly said a name and signed the name, he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world is very surprised, because since coming here, the lich has not "speaked" to another plane language, although he has The soul of the alien world has been read, but what the former undead person said is indeed the language of the plane? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign the name that I told you. The lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this really work? The soul of the alien world holds the peacock feather pen while smashing it in the ink. Oh, I mean, I can't escape without full confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't need to escape, the Lich said, sign it, do you think I can get rid of you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world thinks that he needs to recall how the name should be written, but he finds that his finger does not need a brain command to sign smoothly. The name, the name stayed on the paper for a moment, and like other people, after seeing reddish, it penetrated into the reel, followed by a tiny spot that dissipated in an instant. He put the peacock feather pen back into the Mithril bracket. On, take a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scrolls restored the original whiteness, as if no one had written anything on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is... finished? The soul of the alien world confuses to ask if this is my name, is it, my name? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, the Lich said, do you think that the Magic Star River and a Demon Lord will not be able to recognize a pseudonym? He is a little annoyed. He doesn't want the soul of the outside world to have too much memory in the past. As he said, this is a dangerous thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world sighs, but it’s a pity that it’s too strange for the Lich, and I don’t see if it’s a male name or Female name Do you think it should belong to a male or a female? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe both have it, the lich is sarcasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been vigilant against the demon's Lord Grazite, but he did not make it until everyone signed the name and put the reload back to his feet. More people trembled, the fog disappeared with the reel and Grazt's departure, the stars re-projected on everyone's body, the sea breeze passed their skin, they found that their robes were almost all Cold sweat is submerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their work started early the next morning, no one was dragging, nor People objected to Nada’s arrangements and instructions, thinking that there was always a pair of demon masters behind them, watching every caster just want to quickly complete the work of quelling the volcanic eruption, and then return to his island as soon as possible, or return The mainland can also, in short, the farther away from this dangerous place, the better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, the harbinger of the volcanic eruption is already very clear. They can’t see the birds and small animals, the land is hot, and from time to time they can see the rise from the cracks. The steam, the air is full of a strong smell of sulfur, stronger than when Grazt appeared, the wizard who once spoke with Kremar shakes his head, he is the first time to participate in this kind of action, and also provoke A demon master, now is the time to regret when Nada asked them to summon their own fire element magic, he pulled a cockroach from his cuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
