			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Knicks saw Kremar, her expression was really hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been with Red Dragon Griffith for many years, but she is the first to see such a sloppy dragon - she recalls it carefully After a while, I saw Kremar, who was a special warrior in the Warlock Tower. His clothes and looks are not very different from others, but that is as black. The color of the nightmare and the eyes can still make it easy to pick him out of the warlock's community. For the Knicks, he is like a shadow under the fire, thin and dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at that time, his appearance was still qualified for the Grinada, even if he did not have the red hair color of the dragons, no gold or It is an amber eye, but the shape of the facial features, facial contours, and long and strong body are still popular among women and some men. The elves and the red dragons should not have any mixed races other than killing. Almost all of the advantages were inherited by him. And compared to other ivory white skins of other dragons, Krimerar's skin color is more inclined to have a metallic zinc white, which may be considered to lack vitality in the outside world, but in Grenada, All the colors that can be associated with metal are welcome, and the Knicks know that sometimes when the warlocks are in the pub, bathroom or squat, they can't directly say the name of Cremal, they call him secret. Silver Warlock, this is almost an open secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before Kremar’s “Leaving” Grenada, there was no shortage of female warlocks on his bed, some older (just by age) The female warlock is even very generous to him. Whether it is a spell book, a spellcasting technique or a magical tool, the black-haired dragon is never scared. This is why his tutor is a favorite, but he is still a flattering villain. Did not give him the reason for the real trouble. The Knicks even heard that his mentor had forced Kreima to summon a demon—when he had not yet had the power to control the high-level demons, he thought that Kremar would be rushed out of the circle. The devil is shredded - if it is not a female succubus that should be summoned, maybe he can really succeed that time. But it is a pity that from the summoning circle, neither the Quars nor the Flo devils, but the curved double horns, the sheep's hooves, the succulent full-faced succubus, and her to Crema I am extremely satisfied... Yes, I am extremely satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knicks have a little regret for not seeing the scene with their own eyes. She doesn’t like Cramer, but she doesn’t like him. The mentor, who later died in his room like a newborn baby, and his soul was not summoned when he traced his death,<br /><br />&nbsp The Knicks guessed that the bloated soul had probably become a fat in the sorcerer's mouth. The sorcerers were always very generous to their favorite warlocks, and the Knicks didn't doubt it at all. The awkward black warlock played an invaluable role in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for now - there is such an instant, the Knicks really want to summon the succubus, she may scream and put this favorite young dragon Shredded - she must say that she is also willing to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I am mistaken," said Kremar’s attendant leader: "But you are not going to inspect the dragon with His Highness Mitt. Is it your teeth? Why do you want to go to a venue for a fine carnival?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world does not know what the goblin carnival is, but he I got the answer very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Gnomes collect a variety of animals, including their own droppings, ferment them and smear them on each other at the party, then the sun The place to go is dry, I think she is saying that the smell on your body is very rich, unique and unforgettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- God, you are awake! The soul of the alien world shouted happily, and it was really fed up in the past few days... It was the first time it felt so lonely, so lonely... Thinking of leaving the tip of the port, on the little bird, the lich It has been gone for a while, but at that time it didn't feel like it needed to be stuck every second to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Maybe because at that time you were always surrounded by a lot of idiots, once the undead said, but I think even if they are, they will This time runs away from the distance, is your nose suddenly cursed? Can't smell the smell on your body? It has almost the same power as the stinking cloud! Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--what's going on? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Mitette wants to transfer his mount to me, but unfortunately the degree of fit between us is too low, I and Mitt was thrown by the droppings of it, and it attacked both of us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you cast spells? Don't tell me it's a fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Oh, it’s a fireball, and Mittite has poured water on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich has been silent for a long time, but he has seen Mittite’s mount, an evil eagle lion, but in all respects It is indeed the best choice. Other flying beasts are not guilty of Longwei’s inability to follow the red dragon’s mortal enemy, and Griffin is the most powerful of its ethnic groups – the Lich has little contact with it. But I also heard that it is proud to be similar to the arrogance, and the eagle lion is almost as clean as the dragon, so that their hair and feathers can shine, he can imagine that it is going crazy. So, but it seems that it has not been able to benefit from this guy who came from another plane and did not quite like to follow the cards. Fortunately, without his urging, the soul of the outside world has gone to the bathroom to clean himself up. The hot spring water further spread the smell, and then we must admit that It is quite necessary to have a caster to serve as a waiter. They cast spells. The wind brought by the spells quickly blows away the scent. The leader of the attendant dumps it into the black iron scented ship that is only 12 feet long. The sulphur and spices in tens of pounds, until everything was arranged, on the other side, in a room a hundred feet away, the Knicks, who had been forced to wait for a while, finally saw the new owner of the dragon tooth. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the Knicks want to talk to Cremari and try it out, but even if the smell that stuns her disappears, she still I can't do anything that has never happened. As the maid of Greedy, she can endure the pain that ordinary people can't imagine, and regard it as a kind of pleasure, but this lady of the dragon also has absolutely unacceptable things - She is not the maid of the god of the goblin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——So I can only get one reel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-When she has forgotten today's things, we may be able to get more, the lich is perfunctory, remember that I taught your spells, test it And then open it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world certainly remembers that although it was first used, before that, they did not seem to have picked up a gift that might be full of malice - The scroll was opened, and there was only one command, or a will, which could be said to be a dragon tooth, or a new owner of the dragon tooth. They will be ordered to encircle a group of refugees and barbarians. The country where Grenada was destroyed, and the barbarians were the aborigines in the desert. They were also driven and killed and sold as slaves, but they were more cautious than the insects in the desert, and they also domesticated a ferocious The wasps, they can rely on the wasp larvae, eggs and worms, and their honey to survive, and can also escape the hive when they are not right, so the army of Grenada has never been able to take them. All cleaned up. The problem was that they were still attacking the caravans of Grenada because of the hatred with Grenada, which caused a lot of damage, especially for dragon teeth, dragon claws, and possibly The name of the dragon thorns. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You don’t even have a mount now, the Lich said, it seems that the first thing we have to accomplish is this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I feel that even if Griffin will not allow me to ride on its back, the soul of the outside world will be slightly stunned, he remembers leaving Griffin is no different from another plane's black-bone chicken. Of course, Griffin is much bigger, can provide the chickens needed for a whole wedding, and the black-bone chicken can't talk and eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-No, it will, the lich has seen the memory of the cohabitation and said that it will fly over the erupting volcano and then take you Throw it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world laughs in the sea without any scruples - then tomorrow, it looks at the air, the magical star river has risen, the stars Embracing the bright moon of silver, although in Grenada, their brilliance is much weaker and more bleak than in other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Have you found a solution? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——No, the soul of the outside world does not say with a hint of shame, but you wake up - so, hand it to you! Dear, gogogo! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
