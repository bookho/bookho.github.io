			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill's body was brought back to the silver-crowned jungle where she would find her place to sleep - the dead half-elf was buried in Gray ridge, a cracked maple tree, or a clump of firethorn, or a pontoon is their tombstone. Except for Fenway, his body has turned into an indiscriminate ashes mixed with blackened trees. With the pale, lifeless soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar," said the manager of Gray Ridge: "Iron has told me that you are her friend," he said. "Although the time you get along with is so short... but I think you have the right to choose from her relics as a credential for remembering and remembering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ill's residence miraculously did not be looted by the giants. Although he lost the cracked maple tree, it fell from the height of fifty feet like other companions, crashed into the flames, and was torn apart. But the elves still found out a lot of things belonging to Ilkh - her spare bows, daggers, ornaments with magical fluctuations, chain of Mithril and small crystal bottles of various colors, Cremari One, open the cork, smell the smell inside, this is the bottle of healing potion, the quality is good, it should be Fenway to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair caster silently put down the bottle, he saw everything, a secret silver box with some long-wilted cedar flowers inside, There is a small note with the words in Elvish: "Error, but a lovely gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager thought he would choose this, but Kerma Still put it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally he chose a plain astrolabe, the kind of 567, with a beautifully carved and smooth surface, but without the mosaic of Mithril There are no jewels, and even the 32-point rose compass is just the most common brass material. If you want to say something special, it is that it can be folded into a quarter of its original size, and the bottom layer is empty, can be opened, put all the pieces, easy to carry, not to incur the embarrassment of others or Hey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is perhaps what Iir wants to take away, the manager painfully thought - when she and Fenway leave the gray ridge, settle down elsewhere Later - they can open the astrolabe in the warm sunshine or under the starlight, move the compass, and then lazily cast the piece of their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could have been so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other elves each took away some small things that reminded them of Ilva, and the manager, Kerry, left the secret silver dagger of Ilva When Ilva traveled with them, the most common one was with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in any case, as a manager, he can’t indulge in his emotions for a long time - this may be a good thing, busy can make people Forget the worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can do more things, the most important thing is to rebuild their homes, you need to specifically note that it is not the place, it is negative The energy-eroded land needs to be purified and reinfused with the power of life. The pastors who serve the gods of life in the elves are sketching the holy emblem of the goddess of mercy on the scorched earth, triangles, overlapping The three rings, each side of the triangle must go 50 steps, each line is three inches wide, filled with Mithril powder and stone powder, so that this sacred sign shines in the quiet sunshine Can not be seen directly. The three priests each occupied three endpoints, and the mages from the silver-crowned jungle stood on their periphery, cursing, making gestures, and manipulating a rune plate that brought them to the water elemental plane. Let it land in the middle of the priest - the rune looks like a colorless, transparent, shallow-mouthed dish filled with clean water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastors silently shouted the name of the god of life, praised her, prayed to her, and took off the secret silver sacred emblem hanging from the neck. Invest in the rune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Emblem dissipated into a bright spot as soon as it entered the water. The wizards raised their arms and the clean water in the rune began to overflow the disc and infiltrated into the dust. The source is endless, and soon the latter becomes moist and warm, full of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf folds the branches from the maple tree and inserts it into the ground. The branches become a small tree in an instant, another blink of an eye, the small tree becomes a tree, the green leaves Stretch out and hold the sun that every cockroach can touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may take many years for them to grow into their original appearance. The elves can certainly restore this to their original appearance, but they are more respectful of nature and are not expelled. The negative energy that should be is their obligation and right. The branches are planted to compensate for this land, but this does not mean that they can further influence the course of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray Ridge's elves and half-elves built their new home deeper in the Grey Ridge, and the silver-crowned jungle elves also came to help, which greatly accelerated the project. The progress, but the lich is still able to detect the manager's strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is worried and restless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——White Tower, the Lich believes this is the correct answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The link between Gray Ridge and White Tower has been interrupted for three full days . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the night of the raging fire of negative energy, until today, the elf's flying wing brought the lord of the White Tower, the brother of Demon. The object of admiration, a female half-elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks stunned and looks horrified. The manager of Gray Ridge gave her a cup of tea mixed with snow honey, and she immediately drank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Tower replaced the consul," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original consul," she said: "that is my uncle, he died, and fell from the inner wall."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," the lord shook his head: "I don't even know he is I lost myself, or someone deliberately murdered... The white tower that night was confusing - many people were suffering from madness, and even the guards of the garrison and my uncle were not spared. They lost their senses and only thought about hurting and killing. And some despicable guys took the opportunity to plunder everywhere - there was fire and blood everywhere..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My uncle fell from the inner wall, She clutched the cup, as if she could draw strength from it: "I lost my life immediately, but the white tower at that time was the most in need of the consul..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Someone has replaced his position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Demon, my cousin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Demon, The manager repeated in surprise: "But he is the second son!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My uncle's eldest son also died, dying from the hand of his youngest brother," The young half-elf said tiredly: "His sword stabbed into his abdomen, and the hilt was held in the hand by Yadel - they said that Yadell also suffered from madness, they did not kill him, but he was Closed up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
