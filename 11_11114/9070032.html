Please search (product% book ¥ ¥ net)! The fastest-changing novel, Perant, was the head of the silver-crowned jungle, and later served as the governor of the White Tower. Now he is the manager of the Grey Ridge, even if it is not so productive, for more than a thousand years. Life is enough to make him polish himself as secret silver armor is bright and hard, and only a few times he will let his emotions show up, like now - he does not know that Kerry has no life, But the elves sometimes do the same as humans. Before the elves who have grown into a warrior from the embarrassment, Perant's heart is like hanging in the void, or being crushed under the boulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry could have said that he was holding his teacher and relatives with joy, feeling the warm and soft emotions repeatedly in the heart and mind. After a few moments, he let the position with the smile that the sun was eclipsed, "Come, Kreima, come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow The demon was hesitant, and Perant smiled, grabbed his arm, dragged him over and gave him a hug like Kerry, "We miss you, Kremar," he said softly. The names of several elves, not soaked in hot water baths with the souls of the aliens, were made with him in the eucalyptus wine, or they had been fighting with him in Thunderbolt: "Right," he added. ...and white face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I miss my little fish?" Once the undead person accepted the hug stiffly, his skin was in contact Druid felt a tingling, even though he knew it was only a psychological problem, but he had to endure several times. Let yourself impolitely Pelant away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant was not so gentle before. The lich thought, probably because of Kerry Ben, in any case, the Elf Ranger escaped from the sinister dilemma more than once with his help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no doubt," Perant finally let go of the black hair caster. "It has children again." Druid said happily: "We I also baked the fish for it, but it always seemed unsatisfactory. Every time there was a boat, it would run to the beach and wait for it, and it would be disappointing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong and strong, I am eating the empire, the soul of the opposite world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hehe-by the lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So this time it won't be disappointed," said Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who used to vote for a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The will of the king of the silver crown jungle," Perant said: "All, the people of the Silver Crown jungle must return in thirty days." Jungle.” He Rimal: “Although your blood is not in the silver crown jungle, you have been identified as belonging to the Gray Ridge, and this matter is related to you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is a moment. The Lich thought that his own card had been revealed, but he immediately thought that the elves would do things that were as hypocritical as human beings. If they knew their true identity, then they would never be hugs, they would only be Sharp arrows and swords, or powerful spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are we going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, Perant thought, but he did not expect It is that Cremari is now the lord who rules the entire island, and is the ruler who actually holds the title of ownership. Like the female grandfather of Azores or the ampoule of the White Tower and the Mt. Hill, and the 3,000 soldiers from the Norman Highlands and their families are in need of his asylum, and have been the White Tower Archon and Gray. Ling's manager, Perant, of course knows that it is not a good time for Crimal to leave. He hesitated: "I left the jungle four days ago," he said, and his wife sent him to Bituminburg. Then he changed into a black-footed albatross flying over the sea. This is faster and more secure than other methods, except that as soon as he stepped into Bibi Dibao, Kerry’s urgent letter about the Longhuo Islands was transferred from Alva Master to him, which is why he can So, in time, add an important weight to the balance of this battle: "You may be able to return to the Grey Ridge after twenty days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Twenty days is enough." The Lich said that he knew what Perant was worried about, but for the new leader of the East Crown, Amos. His departure may have allowed the poor little slave to relax a little, and there is also Bedwin and the daughter Liona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the undead is not so Dewey, Tyre’s bottom line can be much lower than a hundred years ago, perhaps because of the willingness to do so now. Are there fewer and fewer idiots that are fair to dedication? Byrdwin is a powerful warrior and an outstanding leader. The problem is that his soul can't match his tough sin, perhaps because his body does not have the blood of the knight. The lord of Thunderbolt was before the election of the old Don Clay. It’s just a humble hunter. Maybe his biggest hope is to have a wooden house that won’t collapse in the storm, a woman who can have children for him, a pot of fire on the fire, boiled broth, In the lucky days, after selling the prey, how many copper coins can you drink into the pub to drink a rough ale? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the god of destiny is always bad, even if it has revealed a tempting smile to Birdwin, but everyone knows that she is just a female watch, she generously gave a civilian distinguished status, Supreme power and lofty status, but failed to give him the vision and mind to match it - this made it impossible for Baldwin to rid himself of hatred and fear after encountering a sudden change, although he disguised Very good, but now only Kerry and Leona are still ignorant, only one of them is friendship, one is blinded by love and ears, as for other people, plum is not for Birdwin Resentful, she is more happy, the relationship between Gülen and Byrdwin has always been very nervous, Yadel is a keen and wise guy, as a pastor of Rosada, he will not go to the power of the common customs, So he immediately chose to retire. Even the knights around them were aware of it. Didn't notice that he hadn't had much contact with Yadel since he came back from the island? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Baldwin, the Lich is more Oona, although she is not very competent as a virgin, but her blood and surname are enough to offset this error, And her father did teach her as a heir. She has both majesty and means, and she has sincerity and compassion. She is neither as cold and ruthless as the ruler of Longhuo Island, but also It will not be as shallow and ignorant as the peace of the White Tower. Not to be as stubborn as Norman’s Pharaoh, she will listen to others’ opinions and make choices at the necessary moments. She knows that this plane is not black and white and can tolerate dark gray areas like Gülen. The thief who walks in the middle, even if he can offer a part of the loyalty, she can let go of him - the king is better suited to be a leader than Birdwin. If she still has something wrong, then she may only have her love. More directly, Byrdwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is not without a solution, and the soldiers of Thunderbolt may be more willing to surrender to Byrdwin, after all, he is fighting with them nearly twenty The man of the year, the reason why the Cavaliers still choose to return to Bywin, there is also this reason, then, Leona can be used as the flag in the hands of Birdwin, now he needs to consider how to make this former Paladin Can be farther, like Yadel. As a pastor of Rosada, he has never received training as an army leader, but he was able to gather four or five thousand people after being expelled by Dylan Don Clay, to persuade and manage them, and to succeed in The repeated obstruction of the orcs and thieves brought out two-thirds or more of them to a vast expanse of vast expanse, which only shows that he has an extremely talented talent in this respect. And now that Baldwin is the most in need of manpower, if the Lich is in Bedwin's position, he will not hesitate to put Yadel in the position of the deputy, so that he can not only use him better or more completely. It will also allow his soldiers and knights to re-transfer the love and trust of Yadel to him, and will not let their hearts have any doubts about him and apology for Yadel - the lich I don't know if Bedwin is aware. Since Yadel returned to the semi-hidden state, his knight would unconsciously bow his head when facing Jaydale, and the soldiers and his family would always kneel down after Yadel, to Rosa. Da Mum prayed - just because Yadel gave them great favors and help, but failed to get the rewards and thanks they deserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is very dangerous. Baldwin is the paladin of Tyre, although his blasphemy has always been believed that his people are misinterpreted as a despicable conspiracy. But after all, they will still leave a seed in their hearts. If Baldwin fails to be as fair and honest as people think, the seed will grow up and grow, and what kind of fruit will come out at that time? I won't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should be grateful that Yadel is not a sinister person, the lich shakes his head, only needs to push a little, or there is no Princess Liona and Kerry Ben, It is not impossible for Birdwin’s status in the soldiers to be replaced by another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin may have noticed this, he is more and more anxious about when the new limb can be completed, but he still can't understand, strength, especially It is the power of the individual, not everything. He is on the way that Tyre does not want. It is a pity that people who find this are only willing to stand by and don't know how to correct them. After all, Birdwin has not revealed too many mistakes, and they still have deep hope for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that his new limbs may have to wait until they return from the silver-crowned jungle. The gnomes have died a lot in the tsunami, and the surviving gnomes have to They mourned for their loved ones for three months, and they would not do any work for three months. Fortunately, McGee was safe and sound, and although he stopped his work, it did not hinder his brain Graila. Running hard. He had a lot of new ideas about Bird's arm. He stroked the paper and often disturbed Kreima. This is a bit arrogant, but the new owner of the side island is now without eunuchs or A close knight or mage, no one will care about his rudeness, the soul of the outside world is willing to open the brain with this stinking gnome, like can you let this arm bring your own rocket launch system And the like - and the undead who was once willing to listen to McGee's ideas, in addition to Bird's arm, he prefers to have a silver golem, in his mentor's tower, there are two The silver golem, but the instructor said that this is not a gnome's work, it can only be said that he made the imitation when he was in the whim, but all the people (or non-human) who have seen the power of these two demons are shocked. No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructor’s golem can be placed in a small pocket with a small top, while the gnome McGee says that his father’s silver magic is the smallest Can be accommodated in a test tube, which can not help but the lich is not heart-warming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then twenty days later." The former undead said: "I and Kerry will return to the Grey Ridge before the morning. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
