On the ship, only the captain and the ship doctor will wear boots in order to show their identity— - No matter which kind of boots are so dense, it is not suitable for wearing on a damp and humid boat, so the pirates and sailors of Ten are running barefoot on the boat, and their soles are born. Very thick scorpions, like a kind of sole sole, of course, this does not mean that they won't have a pair of boots. After all, if they want to go to the pub casino or the wife to have fun, they will wear value. A lot of boots, so as not to be laughed at and look down on. Www*xshuotxt/com. mobile network<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but today it is said that there is a caster in their prey, and several experienced pirates immediately return to the cabin from their own Find the boots in the wooden box, and wear a ribbon and a small icon with a charm on the charm of the emblem. It is said that this can avoid many spells. Other pirates have the same kind of learning. Everyone will dress up. It is like a palm cockatoo with a crested crown. There is nothing to say about Drake or the Sea Devil. It is unforgivable to break the pirates' superstitions like cutting their genitals. Even the captain is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reiite did not go to the boat from the ship’s side of the rope ladder, and then sent her to the shore by the boat, she let the wind of the night Lifting up, like a feather blowing in the wind, fluttering in the pirates, in the process, her silk robe rolled up, rolled over to the thigh, she did not wear pants - more correct It’s a thing that looks like a stocking, tied at the root of the thigh with a wire to prevent it from falling off, so anyone who looks up can see an unimaginable beauty – a few daring The pirates not only turned their eyes off from beginning to end, but also intentionally made a clear sigh after the silk robe re-covered the legs of Reyote. What's more, she gestured to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes them so irritating and eager is that this glamorous red robe warlock not only does not show any unpleasant look, but also spurs claret lips , smiled at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come here. You," she said softly: "Let's finish our work first - when you want to have fun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words made a lot of people excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea devil turned his head and she was happy that only one or two of those guys were her crew, no doubt. These people will definitely be put into the first offensive team by Rui Yi, I hope they can consume the spell of the caster as much as possible, she thinks, they can't live anyway - although the sea devil is a bit annoyed Yu Ruiyite’s surrogate, but she still bowed her head to express her respect when she walked past her. As Ruiyite said, the most important thing is work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where should we go next?" asked Ruiyite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soon," Drake said, while doing a fancy action, a flute appeared in his fingers like a void, he Picking up the flute and blowing it, the pirates around him were confused, because they couldn’t hear anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hai Mo and Rui Yi Te can hear, the former is because of the blood of half of the orcs, the latter is because of the thin blood of the body, Ruiyi Wrinkled frown: "I hope this voice will not be transmitted far," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Drake said, because he is the leader of this mission, so many secrets are kept in his throat. Neither the Sea Devil nor the Reyote know, this is one of the ways to protect themselves. Without a little bit of it, he is the weakest of the three in terms of his own strength. "They are already here. It’s very close.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drake said it was right, and in a short while, a small figure swayed out of the huge fern. The pirates were shocked and quickly pulled out their weapons, and the silver-white blade gave a terrifying cold under the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that’s just a dog, an ugly hairless dog. It is rare outside the Dragon Fire Island. It is said that a warlock was specially cultivated through the requirements of the gnome. To be honest, even the pirates saw it and wanted to vomit. It looked like it was peeled. The mouse has a white and smooth surface. The eyes are as big as almonds, but the head is not as good as the fist of an adult male. The ear is pointed up and pointed up. It has a pointed and long mouth. The teeth in the mouth are dense and sharp, although it is not yet human knee. One-half is high, but no one will be happy to be bitten by it if you look at that mouth alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it came out, it looked at it, and it was desperately sniffing. The lips pulled back to reveal the teeth, and it looked very evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay," Drake said. "Come out, don't waste time, your master is still waiting for our good news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the sound of Sosso for the second time, a small black shadow was drilled from the opposite direction of the hairless dog, when he stood in the pirate When they were in front of them, they found out that it was a gnome. He bent down and stroked the head of the hairless dog, muttered something that the pirates could not understand, and then made a gesture to signal them to go with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They rested at the Black Rock," the gnome said as he walked, and said in his thin voice, "They have been cruising the entire island for the past three days. Now they are tired and tired... the caster’s tent is inside. And his friends’ tents are outside, they carry twenty female slaves, one eunuch, six 'skulls', and twenty-seven other slaves.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only these?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only these," said the gnome, "you may feel that the task time is too tight, but this is the best The timing, the owner of the East Crown evacuated his army without leaving the land, and the new owner has not yet been able to establish his own army. He even did not even have time to send letters to his friends and tribes, and even When I went to the letter, where did they get the soldiers and the knights? Poor little fools," he said contemptuously. "Unless the gods are gracious, let an elite and capable army descend from the sky."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many spells does the caster have? Swiss special meaning to ask, as a caster, than this she is most concerned about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to ask him." The gnome answered unceremoniously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil who was cursed 10,000 times!" Drake uneasily blamed: "You promised, you will try to find a chance to consume some of his spells." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We did say," the gnome shrugged his narrow shoulders and said, "But we said it was a pity, We have not been able to find an opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is included in the contract!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are free," the gnome suddenly stopped, and the sea demon who walked behind him almost stepped on him as a small cookie. "You can turn around now, I swear that there will be no one to stop you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drake's face is a bit bad. Of course, they can't go back, let them toss and turn, and the high rewards that are missed are within easy reach and let them go back. How can it be? What's more, compared to the sea demon who just walked away once, he still has a reward that must be paid to Ruiyite, which is also a big expense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reiite stepped forward and took Drake’s shoulder like any mortal she had to face. Drake didn't mean much to her, but now she doesn't need useless dignity. The gnome's attitude doesn't matter. He is their guide. Their work must have him to complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry." In fact, there is no need for Ruiyite. Drake has already recovered. If he does not understand patience and compromise, the sea magic around him is already a crushed fat. He holds Ruiyite’s hand. Gently swept her palm with a small finger before letting go. He knows that the warlock will understand what he means, and once they no longer need guidance, the gnome will experience nightmarish pain and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome smiled sharply and lowly: "What is this woman? Is it a warlock mage or a pastor?" His eyes fell on Reyote's belt. There are hanging pocket reel belts and weapons, including a curved knife cone and a Mithril elbow hammer. Except for the dwarves, only the priests of the gods will carry a hammer as a weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is she has nothing to do with you." Drake said: "If you want to continue to delay, listen to the respect, but if you miss this moment, I am not If you will act, then it will not be me to explain to your master. It is you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome is small, like two nails In general, the bright eyes in the night stared at Drake for a very short time, and he still slandered his master. So next, he didn't say anything, but took the pirates in the dense jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate’s sentinel is to issue a warning at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone," he said: "Many people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is not a person," The gnome said: "That is the 'cow horse'. Have you seen the cattle and horses will give people a letter? No. So even if you leave you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates will be suspicious, The gnomes took them through the sugar cane field. The sugar cane that was in the growing season was only as high as the human waist. A group of slaves worked in it, and they completely ignored them, even if the pirates were on their muddy eyes. Staying, they didn’t even see them at all. A young pirate who was at the end of the team couldn’t help but curiosity, pulled out his dagger, pierced a slave’s abdomen, and quickly let go – he prepared the slave Because of fear and pain, he yelled before he was yelled, lest he be accused and punished for unnecessary killing, but he was shocked to find that the slave fell silently, and the two slaves around him paused. For a moment, I don’t understand why he’s going to Falling down, when the young pirates wanted to give them some, they finally reacted, but they didn’t yell or rescue and help. They just dragged the slave and dragged it to the side of the sugar cane field, let him do it. Lying down, quietly waiting to die, and the third slave filled the position of the deceased, so they worked diligently and honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene made the young pirate unscrupulous, and he jumped up and caught up with his companions without looking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can leave them outside." Dada said: "This enemy At a glance, we know that we have found them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, it is difficult to find out if someone in the tent has no light in the tent, but if it should Sleeping outside the tent and waiting for the slaves to be told is also gone, then it will certainly be perceived as not right, but neither Kerry and the soul of the outside world will allow this to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are in trouble," Dada said, "they are also unable to continue living."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Possible." The soul of the opposite world said: "But that doesn't mean we have to deprive them of their lives before the enemy." He nodded slightly. "You take them to the depths of the cave. Don't make a sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada took a deep breath, "Follow, my master," he said: "May the gods bless you, And your friends can be safe and sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think...Glan," Mei Mei is close to Gülen, putting the sound to a minimum: "You think we are this Can you still be so lucky?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good luck?" The thief snorted. "Do you think that our previous trips were fortunate? For you "Maybe, but for us," his eyes showed a cold that would make his enemies chill: "No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dada’s concern, the pirates did not see a tent and a sedan, and they knew they had been discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruyite closed his eyes slightly and put himself in a state of meditation: "They are still here," after a pause, she said: "In that cave." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our action is still very fast." Drake said with pride that they brought a total of nearly two hundred pirates this time. Renke’s “Golden Lady” and the “Sea Devil” will not be a good person, but standing here is a fine selection, not exaggerating, even if it is They also have a battle for the soldiers of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
