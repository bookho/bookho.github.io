			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the previous chapter - I want to say is the mother of the otter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a part about the elves - I admit that when I set the role, I thought about setting the king of the silver crown to be a woman, just to avoid The reader thinks of Thrandil, and the king played by Lee Pace is too deeply rooted in people - he must admit that he does have an influence on me, whether it is a novel or a movie, but in the end I still set him as a male because this role is true. Not very suitable for women - this high magic plane is too dangerous, um, of course, can be set as a female man, but do you really want to see the female wizard Elf King? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, he is jealous of the lives of his people, not wealth, although he is also very good at collecting money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ille 妲 like Tao Ruier, this, I have to say that although Illu left us early, she would never like a dwarf. Pointing his bow and arrow at his king and swearing at him - some people may think she is cool, but my personal opinion really does not like this kind of female character that is not loyal or sensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, in my text, the king of the Silver Crown jungle has a high authority and its own ability is very strong, even his heir Kay Reuben must also fully respect and respect him. The Taurrell bear in the movie will be dragged down. If it affects his strategic layout, it is possible to be expelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what needs to be stated is that the elves in my text refer to many elves in the Western Magic, in addition to the Lord of the Rings, including the Dark Elf Trilogy and Pastor Five. Part songs, (we don’t mention the 喽 中 in the dragon gun), because there is not much to say about the spoilers in the back, the only thing that can be determined, as I described before, they are not stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After determining the list, the elves and half-elves will soon depart The weather is getting colder and they have to rush to Fort Lee before the first snow arrives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the elf is the majority, but only ten mage, including Kremar - the soul of the alien world is the first time to see so much The elves are gathered together, not movies, nor photos - every elf is interested in the new members of the Grey Ridge, more correct, very interested, "little children" Craigar's little story in them The lips are handed over, they especially like to touch the hair of Kreima, because it is rare in the gray night and the silver crown jungle, and the soul of the outside world has to be again and again. Hard to slam the lich who is thundering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This has to blame yourself. The soul of the alien world said, you should not set your age so small, twenty years old - for the elf, you are a little baby just under the age of one, how can an adult feel the little baby? What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The age of the half-elves is calculated according to their non-elf blood. The lich sneer and say: Although the elves are very annoying, they are at etiquette. Never neglect, unless they are facing their enemies - they are stroking you just because they perceive that you like this very much - idiots, how old were you before? Or as you just said, a baby just under the age of? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——......(After being like a 2d 3D beauty, it is not a dead house that can be tough to refuse)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——And, on the Starlight River, what did you do? Why are they still talking about it until now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——呃......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Did you dance on the mast? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——This is absolutely no, the soul of the outside world resolutely denies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I hope that you will be able to compare...beautiful, the Lich says, if I let me hear a cute little story about you-- He snapped his fingers slowly, and Kerry would probably fall under the orc's axe less carefully at some point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world hopes that they do not have to take a boat when leaving the Gray Ridge, otherwise his cohabitants may be stimulated to a fierce hair, although not As a last resort, he would not use the orc's hand to throw the Elf Ranger into the mourning wilderness as he said - Kerry is the first friend of the alien soul in this plane, the lich knows that he is against the idiot The importance of some small things that make him unhappy is not enough for the undead to destroy the seemingly stable relationship between the two, but the balance is in jeopardy - but he can still make Kerry a little moldy, for example, Kay Reuben occasionally ate salty and spicy berries, and he accidentally stepped on a sharp-pointed stone. Last time his tent suddenly ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods who are far from knowing a few planes miraculously blessed the souls of the outside world. They did not take the boats, but drove the horses along. The edge of the silver-crowned jungle travels so that their safety and food can be guaranteed. Occasionally the elf patrols pass through their camp and talk to the elves in the camp and Kerry Ben for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the half-elves will enter the jungle and climb to the top of the silver-crowned tree to look at the huge royal court hidden in the jungle. Even if they know that Wang Ting is in the lock of the wizard wizard, they can’t I saw it magnificently, but they still tried it. Kerry and the patrols never stopped them. Only once, they pushed back the camp for more than ten miles, and everyone was not allowed to leave. Camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for the souls of the outside world to feel that there was a fierce force that was bursting out from the depths of the jungle, and as the waves generally extended in all directions - It is a force full of vitality, but with the unquestionable majesty and coldness of the king only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Silver Crown jungle is trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——......This is the Elf King of the Silver Crown jungle to strengthen the defense, the Lich is silent for a while to say, I only heard and read from the book I have been there...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Is it very powerful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——very powerful. The Lich said that it is simply unbeatable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never felt the power again, the elves’ teams went all the way north, helping several villages to annihilate a goblin lair, three cannibals Devil, a giant who found a good canteen but lost two wild boars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild boar became a plus for the elves and the half-elves. Cremaar remembers that Master Alva once praised the craftsmanship of the elves, and he has not eaten yet. The elf's roast rabbits, but the elves' roast wild boars have enabled the spirits of the outside world to cast their spirits in the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope to meet wild boars later." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Kerry Ben said: "When we arrive at Fort Lee, the first thing is to hunt."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunting?" The soul of the outside world was a little surprised, but he immediately thought of a possibility: "Is it for each other?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, the elves will not obey the command of mankind," Kerry said. "There are two reasons for hunting. The first is to ensure that the soldiers and the people of Thunderbolt will not go hungry during the long winter. The second is In order to consume the food of the orcs - black cattle, horn deer, sheep, they will look for herbivores and follow it. If it is warm winter, the north side of the Longji Mountains will produce plants that will migrate and become prey of the orcs. We will drive those stubborn guys back to the south before they have crossed the ridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
