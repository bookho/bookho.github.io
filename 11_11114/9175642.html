			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft prevention section, update at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning, on time, thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional birthday greetings are updated at two in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Fish Series<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Kissing Fish<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is a glass fish tank embedded in the wall, three meters long and sixty centimeters wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fish in it, about ten or twenty, white around the body, a light red on the back, flat body, similar to squid, dorsal fin caudal fin The pelvic fins are translucent and neat, such as the bangs repaired by the hair stylist. The lips burst forward and suddenly open half a sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the eyes are bright, black and white, round and large. I have seen a woman who wrote a rap in a book, "The eyes are like a black mercury in a white mercury...", but I have never seen a real person with such an eye, but I did not expect it to be on a fish. see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such bright eyes grow on the bleak body and are even more shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends told me that this is a kissing fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are relatively mouth-to-mouth, hold tightly, and face each other, like the mirror of the other person, when they are looking carefully, the two fish have been violently separated. If you have nothing to do, swim anywhere else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said it looks more like a fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends call me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at it, I said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One fish is firmly chasing another fish, and the two fish are rotating around a virtual cylinder for a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is in a hurry, the latter is crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of swindlers chasing the good people. I say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗤, obviously, it’s a good gentleman, you see how unique it is, there are countless beautiful fish, but ask for a ear. Said the friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this. I say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the fishes is extraordinarily huge, eagerly searching for objects that meet the lips, but other fish see the giants coming, immediately dodge, it does not Give up, agile up and down, left and right, and almost a few times, and the difference is only a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the bully of the tiger’s back is the dominant bully, I said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends give me a blank eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only slightly obese, and has a strong will, not being discouraged by numerous rejections, and constantly pursuing true love...not feeling really Poor and cute? she says. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, she sent me a pair, yelling at me, when I could see the sweetheart and remember to call her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still look like Ishuro in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, I checked the information. It said that when the two kissing fish meet, both sides will unveil the long lips with many jagged teeth and forcefully touch each other. Together, like a lover "kissing", it does not separate for a long time. However, this "hot kiss" is not "courtship", but a fight. Because the kissing fish has the habit of defending the "territory", when they meet, they use long lips to fight to resolve the "territory" dispute until one party retreats and the "kissing" is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am correct, but did not specifically tell her, maybe she also knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still a friend with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still indulging in love again and again... as kissing fish keeps kissing... kiss...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2Betta fish<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar pet shop owner, selling Thai fighting fish, as long as five rounds, I have long heard the name, I took two away from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One dark red with blue, one dark blue with red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you fight? I ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss put them separately in two transparent plastic bags, nodded, of course fighting, he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put them in a glass jar after going back and watched for a few minutes, they were very leisurely swimming, met and did not tear, hit each other Touch, like humans say hello, peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, the two fish were slowly opposite each other. In a few seconds, the scorpion was first arrogant and flattened, as if it were the helmet of the top warrior. The sharp dorsal fins are slowly erected, and then the strip-shaped caudal fins that are originally dragged behind the peacock are gradually opened. The pelvic fins expand rapidly downwards and backwards. The film between the fins is not transparent, but slightly brighter, and the color of the protrusions is Deeper, the three can almost completely collapse into a whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They tilt slightly and pass each other in a graceful manner, the rose-leaved body draws a curve in the water, and then again, all the fins are Move around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Beijing opera plays as nervous but the elegant battle lasts for a long time, the red fish obviously falls in the downwind, and the deep-bush fins are torn down by the enemy one by one. Once I even saw the blue fish mouth with the spoils proudly roaming the bottom of the tank, I don't know how strong the smooth flat lips are to this extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent tears make their beautiful long fins messy and shattered. No matter the winner or the defeated, it looks like nothing with the rag. respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave them to children I don’t know, went to the pet store owner, bought two new ones, still one blue and one red, but The fins are perfect. According to the boss's instructions, I bought a rectangular box of plexiglass with a pumping plate in the middle of the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want them to fight, just take the pumping board and the boss will show it to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the new fish home and watched it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They trembled the fins in vain, but they were blocked by the invisible but existing glass plates, and the demonstrations were repeated only once and for all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that when I take the plunge, they will fight for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly there is a strange feeling that they feel like my two beautiful lovers, they are trying their best to fight for the little world I have given them, not to wear the sky with each other. I love to watch them fight like this, but they are afraid of conflicts and detract from the beauty that I like.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to isolate them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one day, I will open the partitions so that they don’t have to simulate fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to watch them fight to death, laugh and lean forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am your neighbor series<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;402<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The child next door to my family somehow began to tear heartbreaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-lasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you cry so badly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will gently wash the dishes Put it in the cupboard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His parents don't go see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it next door 401?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, four or five years old, my parents are very young."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A girl?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I saw it as a boy yesterday afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next child continues to bark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound insulation of the walls of the house was originally good. But for such a sharp voice is still a little thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child is crying, I am shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even my husband frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there any discomfort?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will take a look? Young couples may not know how to look after children?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Indulged for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to go back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not that I don't care, but now it's not like the past... The neighborhood is cold and alienated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Laughed and kissed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know know, I will go, come back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali and her boyfriend in the middle of the night I swayed back to the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grandmother who has been waiting at the door is catching up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are dead, Ali! Come back so late? Leave such a small child at home, go out alone, how do you be a mother?" "<< /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"※(※#!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali’s boyfriend swears, You have to fight against your sleeves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...forget it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Li grabs him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The neighbor's grandmother...I also expect her to help bring a small donkey...forget it..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boyfriends raised their eyebrows.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali touched the key to open the door, not to mention the boyfriend for 3 minutes Rush out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apo! Have you ever been to my room!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apo Trembling stood on the bench at his door and heard the words go back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, who is going to enter your house... ...dirty dead..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali sounds sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't enter my room, the blanket on the devil, and the hot milk egg who gave it to him! Say! Are you secretly matching my room door? Key?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apo slowly waved <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just moved in and didn't know... It was 402 rice bran. She used to be a pediatric nurse, and she liked children very much. In this building." She will go to see if the child is uncomfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's yours..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apo actually shrugged with a foreigner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. and her husband went together 50 years ago, as long as you get the yin, you will be fine!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(End)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;鲛人的哭珠<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; 1940. Nanjing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath of Qinhuai is always warm and wet, it seems to always linger in the rainy season. The little pink butterflies in the low air will never fly beyond the line of sight, and the posture will be slightly tilted or swayed, like those singularly beautiful songs, slowly passing under my window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m on the purple-colored rosewood table, it’s very old, the annual rings are silky, the texture is slender, and there are irregular crab claws. The grain is adorned with a beautifully colored Luodian. During the day when I heard that there was a woman singing "Amazing Dreams", the right way was: "The original 姹 嫣 嫣 开 , , , , , , , , 似 似 似 似 似 似 似 似 似 似 似 似 似 似 似 似 似 ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” Endless resentment and pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so embarrassing, it’s really rare for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jade squid hanging on the door sizzles at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't help but sigh, I really doubt why I thought of doing this business. Other people are trying to run for a mouth, why am I suffering? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a frequent visitor, selling many beads with me, the quality is still good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As before, she didn’t talk much, took a small kit from the exquisite handbag and placed it on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I poured out all the things inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten number of fingertips and pearls are rolling everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting a close look, I can't help but look at me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One hundred silver ocean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is obviously eclipsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These beads are only worth one hundred?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哒!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bounced a bead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to, you can go somewhere else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time! You are sure that I can only come here, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sigh At one click, such characters will be most entangled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The best bead is leucorrhea, big and round, shiny, followed by black and beige, the worst is yellow. Today's beads are many, but too Pink, not perfect, the size is no different from ordinary beads... You are crying too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to my last sentence, she squatted Trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The South China Sea has a monk, the water is like Fish, not waste, weaving, its eyes can be shed... I have collected pearls for a long time... But the poor beads are still received for the first time, and you will not know if you are a monk. Few crying, the most beautiful bead in 50 years, as big as a baby fist, gold, green, black to white, all exquisite and magnificent, Baoguang crystal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I am fascinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I want is such a bead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, she asked gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it possible to be a little more..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shook my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clenched her teeth and made a slight giggling sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My husband is in desperate need of money and money, so I have been patient, even the only child died when she died. Time, since you are not Ordinary humans, when we know that we are always sympathetic, please help me... I will definitely..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said if you don't want to Go to other places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I interrupted her coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly lifted her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what you are, but everything in the world is incompatible with each other. Even if it is as powerful as a god, there is always a day to be spared. Today, I am dying to death, beware of retribution!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I clap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There has always been only time for people, and have not seen time to ask for help. If there is such a miracle, I hope it will come soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at me desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transparent water droplets solidify in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few times, she finally gave up, a fish-eye-like ball rolled to the ground, turned and fell into the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The crepe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice was too light, I barely heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much do you want to make?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gently hold my lip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;鲛纱? I certainly want the crepe. It was a luxurious, beautiful and sturdy fabric. I had long wanted to collect one for clothes, but I was always disappointed. Because it needs to twitch the muscles of the people to woven, only when the monks die, its loved ones will use it to weave such yarns to sacrifice the gods in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monks I met were stubborn like feces, and I couldn’t buy an inch of crepe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was originally... or new weaving...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laughed, this and me Nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You bring me to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much can you give me?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I estimate if I don’t see things? You remember, now it’s a world of chaos, how many treasures but a bag of rice, gold and silver are the most Tough circulation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My tone is hard, she shows a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...Do you hate me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just doing business." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I faded back to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Receiving such a character really hurts me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before sending her away, the pair of jade squid and the bells rang, if you don’t watch it, I’m so bored, I really want to pick it up. I dropped it into this fat powder river and figured it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a frequent visitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
