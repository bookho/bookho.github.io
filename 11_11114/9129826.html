The Lich said, I only hope that there is no hard evidence - we are now shallow at home, and if Mitte insists on the claim, we only have to send Ferry Hill out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Should not, the soul of the opposite world said, I don’t think, even if there is, Mittitch may not put this blame on us. - It is not us who he has to deal with at the beginning, otherwise he does not have to hand over the dragon teeth, but also tries to be a good brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Do you know that he is so tender that I am getting pregnant soon? The lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world laughs loudly, but only in the sea, outside, people can only see that he is smiling, the dwarf collapses and thinks he saw it. That fruitful "exoskeleton", to be honest, the dwarf really believes that the term is very Grenada's style and sounds terrifying. But in terms of shape and color, it doesn't look terrible – it looks more like an extravagant ornament, the dwarf is practical, but the gnomes are more practical and focused on beauty and sophistication, so they quarrel Several times, the result is that this one now - looks like a solidified scorpion attached to the Mithril line of the female winged body and limbs - or should not be said to be a line, because they are the narrowest and one inch, The widest part is half a foot, especially the most important part of the back. It looks like a pocket shield. All the lines extend from it. It is like the tentacles that the octopus sticks out. Wide to narrow, around the body and arms, and legs, up to the wrists and knees, and the inside of the "shield" is a rose-like rune that blooms like a dwarf, a dwarf and a creek Collaboration is completed with amethyst and emerald in the middle, which provide the power support needed for the exoskeleton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another plane, the exoskeleton armor looks more like an insect's carapace, very thick, but in addition to allowing some unfortunately disabled people to move around again, Running and taking items can also turn an ordinary person into a super strong Superman. In the memory of the broken soul of the outside world, those exoskeleton armor can allow a person to lift two hundred pounds for five hundred times in a row. Things, maybe more, as long as the energy is not exhausted, but in this world of high devils, the exoskeleton armor they created can be more powerful and more powerful - the winged beast is no longer You don't have to worry about the heavy dragging wings. Exoskeleton armor can be used to lift and wave them instead. In the rune plate, a thorn line is connected. This thorn line is the soul of the alien world in the deep structure of the human body. Under the guidance of the demon, although the Lich also borrowed some knowledge of another plane - in this plane, the necromancers are the most knowledgeable of the human body, but compared to the scholars of another plane. , < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not deep enough and fine (perhaps because they are all practical) - this thorn, or wire, pierces the human brain So that armor can receive instructions from the brain without requiring the user to issue commands with his mouth or hand. This makes their existence more subtle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for the collapse, Krimaar believes that this dwarf will not sell himself, but the three gnomes can be said to be monitored and shut down, they also There is nothing to complain about. They can at least eat delicious and hearty food at Cremari, sleep on a soft and flexible bed, and occasionally drink a little honey when they are not working. This is enough. After seeing the whip and the soldering iron, these gnomes wisely put their position to the lowest level, and now a little improvement is enough to make them feel satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one pair," the dwarf collapsed. "After that, it will be faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The soul of the opposite world nodded to him. He knew the meaning of the collapse. The first pair, no drawings, no reference, only one concept and sketch, they will certainly be slow to build and assemble, but if this test article can succeed Then, the next step is to make it according to the sample, it will be much faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winged beast, the first female human who agreed to work for the black-haired dragon, first carefully patted her wings, she Waiting for the coming of severe pain, but not. Then she turned her head and stroked her wings, because she couldn't feel their weight, and thought they suddenly disappeared. When they walked, they almost lost balance. She stroked the exoskeleton armor, and the flexible Mithril was on her palm. Sliding, she contracted her muscles slightly. This time she felt it. She looked at her master and Kremar nodded to her. The female beastly took a deep breath—if she didn’t Knowing how to fly, it is impossible. When the wings can only bring pain, she is forced to learn how to fly. She closes her eyes and recalls the feeling at that time, not pain, but The novelty and excitement of that moment, her wings violently hit the air, but in a blink of an eye, she rushed into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She should be grateful that we are in a very remote location, and in terms of height, it is also the lowest, or very low." The maid said with a whip and her companion, they certainly know that their master is still a child. It is very unloved, and this can be seen from the palace given to him - because the red dragon likes the relationship of the heights, the Greinada people are also respected by the heights, but today this is The shortcomings of humiliation saved a life. Although the human slave was best killed immediately in the opinion of the maid, Krimaar did not allow it. They suspected that this may be because Cremari also needs this test article. relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they did, the black-haired dragons only examined the wound roughly, and determined that it would not affect the bones and sent away. The human female clerk - the soul of the alien world is eager to cast a healing spell or give her a potion, but he knows that he can't be too gentle and kind, otherwise all the attendants around him will immediately turn to him. The enemy, because in Grenada, the kind people always die the fastest, these profitable guys can not obey and be loyal to an inevitable dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will do some testing again, collapse." The soul of the outside world said, staring at him, and then the soul of the outside world bowed to him. Eyes, the collapse immediately understood, as a particularly useful dwarf slave, there is no shortage of therapeutic potions around him, he can give a little to the poor girl, although she looks ugly - in the dwarf's aesthetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women’s winged beasts walked into the basement with a collapse, the sun would not shine in here, but the darkness here is enough to reassure her, they are far away Those who are evil - the first to find a healing potion in their room, give her a drink, she feels itchy back, knowing that the wound is healing: "When will we continue testing?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Test?" collapsed and said: "No, you need to rest, we can test again tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow is Another day," said the female beast. "That means that your forging work will be delayed for one day. My companions will have to endure pain and another day, and you don't know when things will get worse," she said. Watching the dwarf: "I know that you are sympathizing with me, pity me, but collapse, you think about it, if it is so bad, it will be one day, my companion can't have time to wear armor, they can't fly, can't run If someone wants to kill them, they only shout and bear "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapse collapsed and said: "Okay," he said after a while: "Let's do the test."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tests are not for others to see, or even for those gnomes to see, the previous flight is just another way to hide their eyes and ears - they are doing the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapse brought the female beast to a large rounded floor room, although the room was underground but high, in Crema Before he left Grenada, it was used to summon the devil and the devil. The demon and the devil are generally very tall, so this room is enough to accommodate the female beast to fly, just be careful not to fly too high, she I bumped into the zenith several times, because with the help of the exoskeleton armor, the wings were as light and agile as butterflies and dragonflies, but soon she became familiar with them. After all, they were part of her - she could be in the air Flying, moving fast and floating, then the dwarf gave her a bow and then picked up her own round shield and spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on!" he shouted. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female animalized person used to be a mercenary. Before she was caught by the Grenada, she was not evil. Of course, she could not say It is kind. She is like any mortal, there are good and bad, perhaps more to the bad side, because an ordinary mercenary can not be as straight as the Knight of the Thai or the white robe, and she wants to raise her own Little sister. So at the beginning, she was very embarrassed. Although she already occupied a favorable position, she would still shoot the arrow behind the dwarf if possible. The arrows had been removed from the arrow, but even so, there is still no A dagger can shoot the dwarf, "You have to be faster!" the dwarf shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His temporary enemy snorted and agreed, she deliberately forgot the armor and wings, like a real bird, she is in a limited space Flying freely, changing various postures, the dwarf's eyes can only capture the afterimages left by her. After constantly roaring and jumping, the dwarf's back finally has two more annoying white spots. "You are passing!" the dwarf shouted, but the moment the female beast took off his wings, his spear hit her forehead only a few milliseconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
