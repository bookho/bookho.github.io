At the end of the west side of the Longmai Ridge, this huge hollow is thousands of feet high enough to accommodate more than ten dragons - hundreds of dwarves have lived here for thousands of years. In addition to the catastrophe more than a thousand years ago, in order to avoid a group of red dragons in madness and anger, the dwarves waved the hammer, the sound of the axe and the squeaking of the wheels of the cart carrying the ore, one after another. With a strange sense of rhythm and the dwarf soldiers neatly walked over the cable suspension bridge, the snoring of boots and spears disappeared for about ten years, other times, the scenery here. It's always the same. If you are an outsider here, he may even be confused. He doesn't understand whether he is in a certain curse, but let a dwarf look, it is always fresh and interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iron Bone City is not the largest of the dwarf cities, it can even be said to be a bit small, but still very great, this is a great miracle that no race can afford. . When the dwarves created it, they faced a whole solid mountain range. They carefully selected three positions, and began to dig the ramp as the rabbit built his own nest. Each ramp was twenty feet from the start. High, no matter the ground and the top are covered with large blocks of rock, the sides of the ramp have columns with rough lines but beautiful aesthetics. Each column is engraved with the gods and heroes of the dwarves, and the torch is set. On both sides of the column, when the torch is ignited, the pulsating fire casts on the face of the statue, and they are plated with a golden light. The indefinite shadows are like letting them live. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Great Holocaust, the road was equipped with a black iron frame every other mile, a flat sliding door filled with granite plates, and nails embedded in the door. The bolts and hinges are made of steel. The springs designed by the dwarves allow the two heavy doors to close tightly in a blink of an eye. Even if a dragon stretches its neck into it, it will be pinched off. There are a lot of small rooms like the potatoes on the branches that are on the horizontal branch road. It is the room of the dwarves. If you continue on, you can find more ramps, and the dwarves get the glow here. Stones and iron ore, and perhaps all kinds of precious metals, but no matter how tortuous, how to change, they will eventually break in the hole we mentioned before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shape is very similar to the hollow of the ale barrel, not dark, nor cold, because the dwarves not only dig up, but also dig down until they dig a depression like a lake, a dwarf priest to their gods Pray for the most powerful magical technique, the lava that is hidden under the mountain is introduced into it. The hot red magma erupts from an invisible exit, and like a flowing water, it leaks into another invisible exit. The dwarves have it. Endless heat and flames, you can beat their anvils and stir their furnaces. Every day, their armor, weapons and jewels flow like lava. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf’s city square and hall are erected high, it is like a most precious pendant hanging from the rugged dome, with eight fine A narrow, stone-free suspension bridge with no guardrails connects it, meaning that only eight ramps can reach the rare building directly – the other ramps can only be intertwined with other cable suspension bridges that criss-cross the building. Passing, either on or below the iron escalator on the wall where the ramp is located, in addition, there is a device that comes from being intimate with another plane, because it is an old elevator, also a sway The iron cage needs someone to pull down the gate, but it is not the electric current but the rune board that can make it rumbling, and it is not the dwarf, but the rock carved by the dwarf or the ale and food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take advantage of the temperature of the lava, it is impossible to be too far from the lava, there is a platform-like rock around the lake of lava, more than a hundred dwarves are Always sweating and working on it, only the strongest and most stubborn dwarfs can appear there - weaker constitutions will faint or become stunned because they can't stand the high temperature of lava, they are almost all fruit, rock and stone The muscles tremble and stretch with each movement. When they are concentrating on the semi-finished product on the anvil, or shouting the force to stir the residue in the furnace, there will always be a beautiful beard. The female dwarf peeks at the side, and when they come to use the ale and food, they will hit his toes with their own small hammer - this is a kind of other people may feel incredible, but for the dwarf, sincere and sincere love . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valentin was among them 150 years ago. Although he had a wife early, his wife would be willing to beat his toes. However, since his wife was killed by a stone monster, he was like a sudden aging, his nephew and beard became white like snowflakes in a few months, his skin was slack, his eyes were dim, he I am very happy that there are a few very good guys in my family. After he died, they can take over his hammer and continue to protect and manage the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he often came to the edge of the square, stroking the smooth low wall, overlooking the hot scene he once loved, while cherishing his wife, breathing the burning air containing sulfur, listening to the hammer hitting The sound, the lungs and ears of the dwarves need this - he walks back and forth along the edge of the square, meditating, writing down some words from time to time, these are the kings and successors who are to be handed over to them, he always I am afraid that I have missed something - Valentin looked down at the parchment that was curled up in the ubiquitous heat. The biggest problem was the stone monsters, and only one of them attacked his wife - these monsters did not know where to come from. But now it’s not the most important thing to pursue them. If the dwarves return, or those who never return, the number of them is at least ten, and the dwarves try to try to be vacant. The martyrdom ambushes them, but in addition to losing a few precious lives again, there is almost no fruit, and the Sol Stones can not only break into any one. In the rock, there is plenty of wisdom, or deceit, and you can even control your own **, when the dwarves think that all of them are already on the top of the fine gold secret silver, most of them Already integrated into the rock and circling behind them, but when they suddenly wrap the dwarf's hands and feet from the top of the head, from the side, from the ground, the original stone monsters that were regarded as targets by the dwarves are also ready to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the dwarves, these monsters are too strange and terrible, although Valentine is willing to avenge his wife and the tribe, but he still has Reason, when some young dwarves yelled that they wanted to try again, he even severely rebuked them. Of course, the dwarves were able to drive away the stone monsters, but before that, every temptation would make his people innocent. Die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invasion of the stone monster did not stop. Valentine listened to the advice of the pastor and prohibited the dwarves from wearing metal, no matter the daggers given by the elders with blessings. It’s still a lover’s necklace hanging between the necks. It’s not allowed. The stone monsters don’t like meat. They attack the dwarves just for the metal objects on them. After a few days of calm, the dwarves find that the stone monsters are swallowing their ore in large quantities. With wealth, and their number is constantly increasing, if you continue, Iron Bone City will only be a food dish for the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when a dwarf reports to him, an adventurer’s team wants to pay tribute to the city’s managers, there may be some other requirements, Valentine was even a little impatient. His first thought was to drive them out, but he immediately thought that not everyone could find the dwarf's martyrdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of team is that?" he asked, striding toward the center of the square - the dwarf's square is different from humans, it is not Leveling, or vice versa, is a sunken public building that hovers over several steps and seats, because all the dwarves have the right to listen and express their opinions, even though they have something big in the city. Always more willing to adopt some of the more wise or qualified dwarfs, but this is the tradition of the dwarf, a tradition worthy of pride - Valentin sat down on the first step, he held The parchment was folded up by him and placed in the pocket next to the chest. Then Valentin fastened the neckline of the leather vest and patted it to ensure that the precious paper would not fall from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An elf and human adventure team." The dwarf said that he had a rounded nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves?" Valentin wrinkled his beard. "What kind of elf, is it young?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is very young, one is not," the dwarf said. "Do you remember Perant? That druid," he said excitedly. "We have been with the orcs." He is in that team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valentin shook his eyebrows, if an elf, this is not common but can’t be said to be rare After all, every elf in the Silver Crown jungle travels in adulthood, and the best way to travel is to follow the group - no, with the adventure team, so that not only can you encounter all kinds of wonderful things, but also people. Responsible for soliciting a series of complicated problems such as buying and selling, accommodation, entering the city, licenses, etc., the elves can show their powerful strength in a timely manner. But like there is some unspeakable tacit understanding, there are few two elves in an adventure team, and this adventure team not only has two elves, one of them is Perant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is one more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Kerry," the dwarf shook Head: "I remember that when Perant was with us, I also celebrated that their king of the jungle finally had an heir!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are others "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A half-elf, a human female, a human female, a human male, a human male, a dwarf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomish humans or gnomes?" Valentine asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomish." The round-nose dwarf said that his nose was as round and bright as a red-painted wooden ball: "Why do they want it?" Bring a gnome?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should say why a gnome will appear here." Valentin said that the dwarf is known for its violent and stubborn temper. So that they rarely make friends other than the tribe, and in order to resist the greed of human beings, they often show very cruel and indifferent - their relationship with the elves is even worse than humans, which is to say, in the big Before the catastrophe, the relationship between the dwarf and the elf was not so good. It was equivalent to a lot of strangers, and the enemy was a little less. When did their relationship become close? Probably the elves are divided into two, one of which has moved to the silver-crowned jungle. The elves and the orcs must not say more, and the orcs often take the dwarves as slaves, build armor and weapons for them, and later... ...the dwarves found that the elves were not so unattainable and frosty; and the elves found that the dwarves were indeed "scentful" and "not trimmed" as they imagined, but they could be said to be one compared to humans and orcs. A race worthy of being called a "friend"... especially after the king of the silver-crowned jungle, Ingeway, gradually opened the silver-crowned jungle to the dwarves - the dwarves also suffered from illness, injury, or exhaustion, and suffered a major The change of the priest, the priest can not be separated or even when he is difficult to preserve, the jungle's herbs and springs naturally become the choice of the dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
