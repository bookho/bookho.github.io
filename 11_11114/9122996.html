He kept silent. The ground stabbed and stabbed - in Bernardo. Bendini confirmed Giuliano's death, and then carefully awakened the number of times the left-handed sword penetrated enough to make a large sieve for macaroni before being nervous or excited to completely control his friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pach stood up in dizziness, and the hot red liquid soaked in the light velvet, except for Giuliano, the blood of this poor victim. And his own - the murderer who inadvertently created a slender wound on his lap is still driven by intense emotions and rich fantasies, temporarily feeling too much pain, his face muscles twisted, teeth biting It creaked, looking like a vulture after a bloody vag, looking around, looking for the second goal of today in a chaotic crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medic's suites and friends rushed to the altar, but the assassins in the crowd greeted them. In front of the marble altar, Lorenzo faced three despicable murderers alone: ​​one was the main sacrifice, he grabbed the jewel-filled silver sacred box as a defense, and the other hand unskilledly grasped a wide The daggers were nervous; the assistants who had thrown away the ritual supplies served as the principal offenders. They were tall and tall, and the five senses under the headscarf were rough and rough. The position of holding the left hand and the short knife was very similar. Lorenzo remembered it. One of them is the martial arts teacher of the Pach family. In a certain field, there was a brief conflict with Juliano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo wants to find his brother, but the assassins have apparently recovered from the beginning of their failure, they fiercely rush to Medici Parents, the arms are shining in the candlelight, eager for the noble blood; the unarmed murderer has to wave the cloak and let it wrap around the arm, showing that the cloak of luxury and identity is always heavy and inconvenient. Now it has become the best substitute for shields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people near the altar screamed, some brave people pulled out their weapons, more people desperately wanted to escape, and the people behind them I can't figure out what happened, curious and desperate to fight forward, and Mingzhe's full strength to retreat, and the scene was chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo and the murderer’s fight are still going on. When I used the feather pen and the holy kettle’s hand to wield the weapon, it would be awkward and naturally beautiful. Dijon became the best breakthrough. A jug was kicked by him, and the sacred body cloth that was dropped in the panic wrapped around the feet of the gods. The latter screamed and fell backwards. He overturned the high iron frame and the reading platform where the candles were placed. The candle on the shelf flew out, but fortunately it fell on the damp and cold marble floor, and only a small part of it ignited a little silk hanging on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire is annihilated, at this time only the pale golden sunlight from the rose window is empty for the cathedral lighting - according to the design of the cathedral, close to noon At the time, almost all the light will be concentrated on the altar. The bright light is set against the backdrop of solemn grey stone, clearly cutting out the deacons of white and the Medici in red. They are separated at the ends of the big altar covered with three layers of linen, filled with madness and hatred. Contrast, because the muscles that are clenched and the knots cast an unusually heavy shadow on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining two assassins are more professional than the priests, their pace is light, martial arts is superb, and the cooperation between them is extremely tacit, if there is no strong and flexible chain armor And the iron candlestick that Medici grabbed in time (his sabre fell under the altar when he fell down), maybe they had already completed the task - one or two slams that could not be avoided The fine silver-plated iron ring, the broken metal ring and the tip of the sword are deeply embedded in Lorenzo's body, blood rushes, but the Medici parents out of anger and tension have no time to care until the two finally get rid of The enemies of the adversary rushed to the altar to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one or God responded to him, and more hostile swords stood up. The priests who entered the church under the name of Cardinal Rafaelo di Riorio, pulled down the sacred headscarf and revealed the Gentiles. Faces, they waved their weapons, and in the panicked crowd unscrupulously opened up a bloody road, straight to Lorenzo de Medici. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loyal subordinates seized Lorenzo’s arm tightly and dragged him to the rear of the empty altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no seat in the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Flore, only the low bench, the walls are empty, there is no available The shelter was used, and the back door was always closed and locked, and the entrance was firmly controlled by the enemy - but one of the members immediately found that the door of the sacred room was actually open. They thought about Lorenzo and rushed into the most sturdy and secret room of the church. It had two heavy bronze gates, and the people who were loyal to the Medici family exhausted the last effort. Finally tighten it and put down the heavy door latch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo, who was forced into the depths of the room, grabbed his entourage and slammed it on a hard metal relief with eyes and lips clinging to it. In the narrow gap of the road, he first shouted his brother, and then his loyal friend - they voluntarily blocked in front of the holy room and fought for the companion who was closing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to his insults and screams with a strange accent, and the sound of weapons slashing on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entourage was silent and tried their best to suppress Medici’s parents, and more than one of them saw Bernardo Bendini’s knife Cut the skull of Giuliano de Medici, if the Virgin is pitiful, he can escape from that terrible injury, Francisco de Pach's repeated spurs have also cut off the last hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo’s eyes are blurred and exhausted. He feels anxious, thirsty, and the blood seems to turn into a hot flame to rush out of the nose. His reason has been Disappeared, the desire for revenge replaced all desires... When the suites thought about whether to stun him, his body collapsed after a powerful shackle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suites panicked and they pulled the neckline of Lorenzo’s tights so that he could breathe smoothly. Over and over, inspecting his trembling body in a touch--the light that permeates through the cracks of the door has no way to satisfy the human eye, but there are no windows or firestones and candles in the holy room. Although it was built soon, but with the continuous financial support of Medici, the new sacred room is still full of precious saints (sacred sacred), crowns, scepters, holy grail icons, portraits and transcripts, spices , painted manuscripts, tapestries, precious metals... cautious servants will not allow any hidden dangers here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a careful guy found a long and narrow cut on the left side of his neck, the wound was unusually swollen and hot, and the surrounding was wet. . At this time they discovered that Lorenzo was sweating a lot. One of the entourages, called Antonio, did not hesitate to squat down, and was close to Lorenzo, trying to suck out venom for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This doesn't help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound behind him makes everyone shocked Several young people suddenly turned around and kept Medici's parents behind them, clenching their daggers or short swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person standing in the dark moves his footsteps, he opens the palm of his hand, a small glass bottle in his palm, and the faint and clear green light illuminates his strange shape. The knuckles and deep palm prints. “No need to be nervous, Medici young people.” The monk said in the Florentine dialect that the Medici are familiar with, he used another hand to pull down the headscarf. “This is just phosphor powder, a kind of powder that glows, reading too much. Old books can be protected from glare and fire damage; it doesn't have much harm..." The monk made a subtle pause, then continued to move forward two steps, completely ignoring those approaching the throat and chest. Sword - He bent his neck and observed Lorenzo de Medici in a painful breath with an indescribable look: "At least, it is better than Medici's blood - this venom will Residing in the wound and nearby clots, if you rush to squat, there is no other use besides sending a precious life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Modestly lowering the body, letting the terrible green light shine on the face of the dying person, and carefully searching for every detail: "Look, he is sweating, breathing fast, chilling, tongue strong," he is excited Said: "This The venom has entered his blood vessels, and it may take a while to get into the heart, where it can do its best – he will twitch, dyspnea, and slow heartbeat. If that is the case...” The monk looked up, Say the conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
