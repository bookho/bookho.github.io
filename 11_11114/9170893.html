			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylen. Hyde’s coronation ceremony was grand and deserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking is grand, of course, except for the flattering villains and their knights (in fact, most of them are not because of despicableness, but because of brutality and cannot be in other places) The mercenaries based on the army, the nobles and residents of Wangdu, and some people who are loyal to the Queen Mother of Chun'an, others are businessmen and civilians who are half-invited and half threatened here, and are forced to use it. The serfs, dressed in the best clothes of all time, holding a rattan basket filled with petals - these petals will fall forward in front of his horseshoes as the king of the king who is waiting to be crowned walks across the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who supervise these serfs carry whip and sticks. Whoever dares to make any mistakes will be beaten with a whip and a stick, then dragged on to wait for the ceremony to end. He died of torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody thought of it, a girl dressed in exquisite elegance, apparently with more than the noble status of civilians and businessmen, jumped from the window sill with about fifteen feet. , fell in front of Dylan in front of about two horses, guarding Dylan's caster thought he met an assassin, but no assassin would take his life first - she landed on the head, with half a piece The face is broken and the blood blew out. It flows along the gap of the stone pavement to both sides. In a small pit, the blood gathers and floats the white petals that are only as large as the fingernail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rigid cheers are coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t say anything before she jumped, and she didn’t yell and struggle. In fact, when she held a bunch of flowers, everyone thought She is also one of the new kings. If anyone notices her, it is probably because she is as beautiful as the silk flower in her hand. Before she spits out the last breath, Diane is like a hyena. The guards had already smashed the door of the tower and rushed in, but they would have felt very disappointed, because this tower, which should have a servant and the owner’s tower, is like being dusted for hundreds of years, all worth something. Nothing, tapestries, cabinets, beds, chairs, lamp holders, and a few pieces of dust left on the remaining items. In front of the window where the girl jumped, there was a chair. It seems that she is stepping on it. Jumped over here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know her." Dylan said that her great-grandfather I used to be the Chancellor of the Treasury before Fukai. Later, even if he left the court, he gained the respect of almost everyone because he had a resume for the three kings. The girl is his youngest granddaughter. When Dylan was still a teenager, she once stood in her cradle and watched her lovely face, pinching her little fingers... Dylan knew why she chose, here, at this time, in him Choose death in front of her, and use her pure blood to pollute his path to the throne. Her great-grandfather had an accident because of questioning the death of the pharaoh, and everyone was aware of the unexpected accident. Her father, and the two uncles, after hesitating, weakly chose to give in and endure, but because this surname has a large territory relationship, miscalculating the shameless and affectionate of King John, they finally did not escape the vulture. After chasing, after they entered the cemetery, the girl’s mother was forcibly married to a short and despicable jester. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the inheritance law has been modified, the only descendants of this family have been imprisoned for price, and Dylan has heard it faintly because he wants to She has too many people to enter into a marriage contract. John Wang is bent on selling her for a good price, so her marriage has been dragged down to this day, but: "Mother said that she has been released." Even told Dylan that she called fifty knights to send her back to her father's territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master glanced at Dylan sympathetically, but he might not doubt his mother, and he was willing to give the whole country a happy hand. Mother, just since this girl is worth a lot of money, the Queen Mother of the King Ann will never let her slip away, not to mention she is very clear, on the long list of deaths, but there are many from Fukai. signature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a person who towed the body away, and the ash from the elder was dumped on the blood, then swept away, and the whole process was used only. Not enough time to cook a small cup of milk. The problem is that this is an ominous sign. The Queen Mother of the Queen, waiting for Wang Ting, can be said to be furious. She immediately asked the Master to go to mourn the wasteland. Tracing the girl's soul, vowed to hand her over to a devil for a hundred years, but this is just a remedy. The Queen Mother thought for a while in her favorite seat and raised her hand to summon a maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
