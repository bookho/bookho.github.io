			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fukai thought he had to wait a long time, but it was not the case. He was confined to a tall, empty fortress in a semi-custodial manner. The people around him - the most luxurious are the warlocks and pastors of the red robe, and he is only a mortal, but Fu Kai has never been depressed or inferior. Once, even if any one of them can easily destroy a city, what about it? Fukai couldn't ignite the power in the magical star river, nor could he hear the voice of the gods. When he was just a baby, even a mouse could bite his throat, but there are people who can taste more than him. Dragon blood? The kind of molten magma, the sweet honey-like liquid that flows into his body, Fukai can hear the comfortable shouts of bones, nerves and flesh - more, more, More! Never enough... want more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique elegance and beauty of the woman standing in front of him is a supreme appearance that will never appear on a mortal. She made a Gesture, let Fu Kai follow her, full of red velvet robes that seem to drop blood at any time, dragged to the ground, she is not a Gredi, but a projection of Gredi - Fukai has never seen The mother's true body, he only knows that, unlike people think, his mother is not even a human being. She is a powerful red dragon, or a great god, only occasionally pity on a human male, and Fu Kai’s birth was a complete accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She often said: "My poor child." Then I took Fu Kai's potion in the blood marrow jade cup, which tasted like a charcoal fire. So burning the tongue and the internal organs, it took a long time for Fukai to know that this is the dragon blood - the blood marrow jade guarantees its freshness and effectiveness. At the beginning, the young Fukai couldn't swallow the potion at all. It was not only stinking but also causing pain, but soon, as the mother said, his body quickly solidified, though He still can't cast spells, but his wisdom and strong body are in no way inferior to any caster, or stronger than them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They go down a large, steep spiral staircase, down...the narrowest part of the ladder also requires an adult male to step out three steps More, and the height makes Fukai completely jump. The burning on the wall is not a torch, but a candle, but it is definitely not an illusion. It is getting hotter and hotter. Fukai thinks like it is shrinking. Only the iron stove with the charcoal fire piled up from top to bottom - just after Fukai found that his velvet robes had been soaked in sweat and then ironed by the hot air to dry and hard, they stopped, two towering The door was quietly opened in front of Fukai, and the white light appeared in the door. Fukai turned slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one here, only one red dragon, entrenched in a huge hall, the ground of the hall is stone, but covered with black iron, let The ground became more hot, and the air that made the air here almost boiling was the magma flowing from the channels that were left from the ground. Fukai found that the channels were not randomly excavated, they formed a magnificent array. Together with this hall, the dragon lying in the middle of the cage is imprisoned or protected. The red dragon body in the array is twisted, but it may exceed one hundred feet after the launch. "Come," Fukai’s mother said, Come see your eldest brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes "Gredi's projection said: "Every drop of dragon blood you drink is squeezed from his body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fukai slightly I took a breath and although he was not unexpected, he immediately frowned. If it was just hot, then the air here. Is scalding is dirty, it is difficult to say what the smell - in short feels like ...... By the way, before the death of all mankind that kind of foul breath, it is said that it was dust from the wilderness of mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy’s projection passed the flame and the melt without any scruples, and raised his hand as if he wanted to put his hand on the body of the red dragon. Then, when her hand had not touched the dragon scale, the eye hidden in the front paw suddenly opened, and Fu Kai was so scared that he stepped back. His figure was like a black dragon with a full-length mirror. It was presented in the erect, the eyes were full of hatred, and Fu Kai found that he could not move at all, even though he wanted to yell and escape, but the eyes closed as fiercely as they opened, Greedy’s The projection placed the hand on its scale and didn't see how hard she was. The reddish-brown scales were on the lower abdomen of the red dragon, not like the back or the side, they were smaller and not overlapping. It is side by side, but even so, it still exceeds the size of a baby's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon screamed because of the pain, but only in this way, Fukai saw the muscles of the behemoth arch, but after a while, it could not be seen or The shackles that get rid of it still make it fall helplessly down the head and wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this scale, even if it is Fukai, can find that it is not healthy, its edges are rolled up, the color is a bit dark, and even some faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" Fukai doesn't think that his mother just wants to see the dying brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him send the last point of use." Greedy’s projection said, then Fukai heard her begin to sing a long spell, honing to the roots The sound that should not be emitted from such a small body vibrates the entire hall, and the dragon that is bound in the formation struggles, and is more crazy and desperate than the humiliatingly unplugged scales. Fukai realizes himself. May be listening to a dragon language magic, his heart violently jumping, like tearing his body out. Fu Kai held his chest and took two steps back. He felt dizzy. He thought that he might have passed out. Maybe he just closed his eyes and let him wake up again with a thick bloody smell. Even the dead air is not so obvious, his feet are immersed in the sticky liquid, and the air becomes moist from the dry and dry, and his bare skin feels stinging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, my child," After waiting carefully for a while, Fukai heard his mother say "You can open your eyes." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature in the hall is slightly lower, I don't know if it is another spell, or because of death - Fu Kai saw his red dragon brother, it has Completely dying, ugly lying on his back, the abdomen was opened, like a pig waiting to be poured into spices and apples. The cracks slid straight from the sternum to the squats like the hills, letting the air What is getting wet is his body fluids. The dragon's body fluids are not very useful. They flow into the magma like thick yellow-green water, steaming with stinking white steam, steam moisturizing the air, and precious. The dragon's blood was extracted, and they condensed into a mass in the air. They were unwillingly twisting and twirling on the palm of Gerdi's hand, just like the red dragon's will is hidden inside. Even so, still thinking about fleeing the fate of teasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fu Kai’s eyes passed a trace of mercy, but even if the spin disappeared, why did he pity a loser? He can't even save his life, and Fukai can almost guess that Greed's behavior is related to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only these." Like hearing the thoughts of Fukai, Gredi said softly, then maybe another spell, from that pile In the internal organs, the heart that is still pulsating is slowly lifted up. When it is in the air, it is still as big as the bird's lair, but when Greed makes the pinching action, it becomes smaller, or Said, squeezed and shrunk, the dark red blood was oppressed out, like the Tuquan into the original dragon blood, Fu Kai waited for a while, the strong momentum finally slowed slightly, and Gray Wait patiently until there is no drop of blood to stop, and the heart is as big as the chick's head. Greed continues to recite her spell, blood is like being steamed and continues to shrink, and finally only a small The group was held in the hands of a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on." Projection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all from the conditioned reflex, Fu Kai walked over and squatted at the mother’s feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open your mouth." Greed said: "It will make you a true dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fukai does not mean to resist, but he can't stop the sudden thoughts: "How is my wife and children?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Grydy's projection glanced at him, wondering why he had such a weird idea: "You will see them soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fukai swallowed the dragon's blood, it flowed into his throat like a living, Fukai heard a red dragon's roar, and then ushered in a darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, my child?" Greed asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also." The eldest son of Red Dragon, also known as her husband, glanced at the "self-wills". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
