Kerry whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar is not sure if he wants to follow this reminder - since he stepped into the room he got too many reminders, some are true, And some are fake, the only thing that is the same is that they always bring pain, hehe, just like now - Kerry's scimitar is on his left rib, and the soul from another world feels Like being hit by a fast electric car, he flew out (as literally) and slammed into a beautifully carved tool display rack with a large scimitar that was as long as a male arm. It fell and hit his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was temporarily unable to take care of the poor nose, he rolled and then jumped up, grabbed a sword hanging from the wall, and traced it Kerry has continually launched two quick spurs, but they were all blocked by the small shield tied to Kerry's right arm: "Back waist!" He reminded him again, and then he was a clever detour. Pokes the back of Kremar, and then shorts his knees with the edge of the small shield, screaming as Kremar kisses the ground enthusiastically: "Sometimes I am a bit suspicious - in me In front of him is a goblin who drank a powerful potion," he sighed. "Is it still a giant who has been given a mentally retarded spell?" He said, once again assault, knocking the black hair caster with a scimitar with a sheath The back of the head, shaking his head incredulously: "Grace the god of life, Angris, his starlight must always shine on your way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Rimal climbed up from the ground angrily. "I have fought side by side with you!" he shouted at Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry this smiled and nodded: "Strong my faith - yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The black hair's caster's mood is almost identical to his hair color, and he stands up and begins to take the offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Kerry’s said, his power is better than the Ranger, he uses the fine sword, but that’s the point of the pen’s big point but it can give Kerry’s Like the pressure of giant waves, if the wooden shield is not covered with dragon skin, and the bracket is not made of fine gold, it may have broken into countless pieces. Even so, Kerry still feels bundled with small shield. The arm is about to break, and every time he is stressed, his footsteps will move backwards and the counterattack will be interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly caught the way to flip this unfavorable situation. His shield was always tilted at an angle, guiding the huge force to where he wanted, and pressing forward to shorten himself and Crema. The distance, sometimes just close to the arm on his side, is complemented by more detours and stumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be particularly fond of Kremar’s nose, and Kerry is kicking his wrist when he hits his nose for the fourth or fifth time. The fine sword flew from the hands of Kremar to the floor of the entire room, and finally stopped under a glass cabinet displaying various slings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crimmaran lay quietly on the ground, his nose hurts, his back hurts, and the back and ribs do the same, but the most painful thing is His self-respect - in another world, as a gentle deep house, even on the Internet, he rarely argues with people, those who make him unhappy, at most delete friends or drag into the blacklist; I haven't taken any tools other than nail clippers, scissors, kitchen knives, and table knives, including the Longquan sword that has never been edged on the wall. But since he was thrown into this ghost place, he had to kill each other with monsters that should only appear in the horror game. He won, and he also held up a small killer whale that weighed 10,000 pounds - he didn't think These can make him compare with a pair of underpants who can force the time to reverse as long as they rotate hundreds of revolutions around the earth. They are not so fond of (except for the fat little killer whale), but he thinks, He should be stronger than the average person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that as long as Kerry is willing, he can hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If based on Kerry's book...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- How do you say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Kerry’s age is between the ages of four hundred and fifty and fifty-five, and he is at the best according to the standards of the elves. The youth age may have kept this state for a thousand years or more - the elves were officially adult when they were 150 years old, before they had learned and skilled their martial arts for seven to eighty years, yes, that is The whole life of a human being - if he did not use drugs and spells to delay his aging and death, the Lich said, what is he doing in the three hundred or four hundred years after Kerry's adulthood? Of course, it won't be hiding more mushrooms in the room. He spends more of his time studying, traveling and fighting. In your words, the goblins, orcs and giants he killed may be more than you see. There are more people who have passed, and his martial arts has been honed and shaped in blood and bones for hundreds of years. His rich experience in battle may exceed me. Please note that I am referring to martial arts. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it’s a good thing to be so embarrassed by such a guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——...If I am mistaken, please forgive me, the soul of the outside world is careful to say, are you comforting me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Unfortunately, to disappoint you, the undead who once died denied it, I have never learned this skill. I just want to remind you, don't think that he is too harsh on you. As a teacher of martial arts, there will be no better candidates than Kerry this in the near future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We are the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-When you run out of all spells and mental power, it’s not, the Lich says, so please study hard, I think this situation is very good in the future. It may happen from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——嗨! The soul of the outside world protested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up," said Kerry Ben, extending his hand to the frustrated half-elves: "The floor is cool and hard, no. It is suitable for taking a nap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar grabs his hand and stands up, by the way, on a wide sword hanging on the wall His own face, he feels that if he can take this body back, maybe he can go directly to COS Voldemort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His nose is safe, at least on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your body is tougher than you think." Kerry Ben said, and he is also very well-informed. He doesn't think that kind of strength can be right. The snake man can't completely irreparably damage the body, and the snake's claws can even be inserted into the hard rock at the bottom of the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it still hurts." Kremar complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is pain to remember." Kerry said, "The talent you have is more than anyone I have ever seen. The only thing that owes is lack of experience and grinding. "Let's practice." And a must-have ruthless heart, he said in his heart, "Well, these are not all that can be done overnight," he continued. "We started from the simplest and quickest - Cremari, I I feel that you need to change your weapon again, and the sword is not for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Crummar entered the room, he was forced to fight in the battle with Kerry Ben, so that he could not see the whole picture - the sun shone from the dome of the hall inlaid with colorless glass, illuminating There are enough huge rooms in which five opponents are slain. In the catastrophe brought by Fenway, this hall built in the same tree was destroyed by the fire of negative energy, but it was lucky. The ground escaped the looting of the giants. After the reconstruction, it continued to hang over the wall and displayed thousands of weapons, which were created by elves and half-elves, and occasionally purchased or picked up by them during the tour. , or friends and employers generously give, and some are collected from the enemy's hands, the variety is complex, but have been carefully wiped and maintained, ready to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The casters usually carry daggers around them," said Kerry Ben. "The secret of silver and fine gold is a good choice. They are very magical." Affinity, the caster wears them without worrying about the adverse effects of ordinary iron on magic. Sometimes they can become a medium of magic or direct enchantment. As far as I know, a famous assassin has a The evil dagger that can absorb the vitality of others and heal the master - of course, the caster chooses more Mithril, although the hard gold is harder than Mithril, but it is too heavy."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picks up a fine gold dagger, its hand grip is cast into a spindle shape, that is, the ends are thin, the middle is thick, and the anti-slip pattern on the surface is a circle of parallel circles. It is called a rib circle pattern; the hand guard is made into a s-shaped venomous snake, and the tail tip and the hanging triangle head and the body have a small gap, so that even without the sheath, it can be Hang directly on the belt or chest strap Above the buckle; it is narrower and heavier than other daggers, like a flat awl with three blood troughs, suitable for stinging rather than slashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The relic of a thief." Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar took the test and found that it weighed more than gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bow," Kerry continues, "This can be hidden in the sleeves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Kremar put down the fine gold dagger, this Mithril is the main accessory material, the small bow is not so much a sleeve, but it is a wrist, it is mounted on the wrist, like a big and weird The ornament does not exceed the length of his hand, and the raised part can be covered with wide sleeves. The small arrow is like a hair clip, and the spring for launching is hidden in the palm of the hand. The middle finger or the ring finger can hit the arrow with a single push. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried it and found that the arrow that was shot by the toy's small cockroach could break through a wooden shield covered with cowhide. Of course, under normal circumstances, it was not killed by its own weight and length. You can inject a fatal or not fatal potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These two are dwarf works," said Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He showed Kremar a wide sword that was used as a mirror by the latter, and a thin blade with a width of more than one foot or more shines in the sun. Light, its length can run through the entire room, the hilt is about one-third of the blade, and the end is a long and sharp, piercing the head of the wild boar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And dwarf?" Kremar asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No,” Kerry Ben said: “It’s an elf.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar Look at the wide sword, estimate the height of the elf, and the gap between the trees, do not say use, even walking with it will be a difficult thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not used here." Kerry Ben said, but he did not continue to explain, but turned the topic in the other direction, "Why did you Choose a fine sword? Because it can be hidden in a cane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So have you thought about anything else? No need to think about anything else, just what you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima hesitated for a while: "stick?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry had paused. "This is rare," he said. Few people use sticks, except for the monks of Surris, because their teaching is to avoid killing and seeing blood as much as possible - although their sticks are not safer than axes or wide swords."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gestured to Kremar to look at the place he was pointing to, with a spear and a trident, and two long sticks, and the stick was dark, and Kremar tried it. They are found to be heavier than Mithril, but they are lighter than fine gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If you dare to pick this, the lich says sullenly, I will kill Kerry Ben, I promise I will say it, even if I can't cast spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We have a very powerful monkey there. The soul of the opposite world is very excited. He uses a stick, a stick weighing 13,000 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I don’t care if it has multiple, used for monkeys or pigs, the lich says, if you dare to take the sticks everywhere – like a goblin Slave, I let Kerry die, so I have no discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world shrugged his shoulders that did not exist - the staff? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Kreima took only a dagger from that room, the relic of the thief, the relic of the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes," he asked. "What happened to Yadell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He came to Kerry Ben for this, but he was beaten and almost forgot the reason for coming to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has settled down," Kerry said: "I caught five sheep, three heads, two mothers, and they quickly There are milk and hair that can be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the memory of Kerry Ben, he has passed through an uninhabited wasteland, not far from the Grey Ridge, the mountains There are small forests, streams flowing through the woods, upside down barren rocky slopes, weeds and shrubs, and a wild flock of sheep living on these plants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those exiled civilians did not want to live in isolation, more accurately, they did not believe in the elves, they decided to go to their relatives With friends, or going to Bitumil and other cities, only the former servicemen of Rosada stayed, but they never used their own hands to do slaves and civilians. They were always awkward at first. But with the help of Kreima and Kerry Ben, they learned how to build semi-underground mud houses and hoisting stoves, how to pick up the leaves and dead branches as fuel in the woods, and distinguish the edible fruits. And mushrooms, scrape rock salt, as well as fishing and catching rabbits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The souls of the outside world are prepared to look at them for a while, with some drugs and maple sugar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Before this, the Lich said, you better do that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--that piece? Oh, you said that... the soul of the opposite world said, choose my partner? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Yes, once the undead said that each warlock has a small partner, the most important, the most trusted, far beyond Kerry Or Yadel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I thought you would choose water, the Lich said, after all, from On the surface, you love those elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The soul of the alien world does not want to argue with the Lich that his love for the elf is only floating on the surface - this guy is always only swinging A porcupine who walks around with a stinger and wants him not to stab something is harder than letting him change his position. In any case, this mixed ball occasionally makes concessions because of interests or threats, but wants this once not. The deceased shut up in a timely manner... The soul of the alien world did not know when and what once again poked his hign point. The tenant of another world has been deeply suspicious that he is having problems traveling in a starry world that is not particularly dangerous for high-ranking mages, probably because he is always excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Fire, the soul of the alien world once again said affirmatively, I chose fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The elves hate fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-No, they only hate those who will destroy their loved existence, about this, whether it is fire or water, lightning or wind, it is the same of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If the fire you caused burned the remaining half of the gray ash, the elves will eat you – don’t forget that the Singer is going to Grilled meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We can start with small, safe. The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the early autumn, the dry leaves, branches and moss of the Grey Ridge increased, and Crimmar effortlessly picked up a small hand, with They came to the landslide where they had buried a fertiliser, where there were still grey rocks and sand, and the seedlings had not yet sprouted - he lit the moss, the moss ignited the leaves, and the orange flames that leaped with the leaves were like The endless snakes spread from all sides to the branches, and the little smoke and Mars they produced were blown by the wind from the top of the starry river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Come on, the Lich said, since this is your own choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of the soul from the outside world is broken, but it still remembers that it was burned by a lighter, not a flame, but a metal part that was burned by the flame. It’s a fairly cheap lighter. The blue flame is as long as a finger. It’s also boiled with boiling water and porridge. The pain they bring is also hot. With the heart pulsing, a little extra heat. And the touch will bring another wave of dull pain deep into the bone marrow. After the injury healed, he left a few dark black smooth scars. It is like a birthmark. It takes a long time to get clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also seen on TV and in books that someone has taken coins from the oil pan, boiling water, or walking on charcoal, but it knows this It is not a fake or it must be flawed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human body is fragile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar slowly rolled up his sleeves and extended his hands. He had a full ten knuckles than humans, pale and slim, skin The smoothness is like a piece of alabaster that has been carved out, and the bones on the wrist are raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame wraps around his hands, burning it, sticking bright, light-colored tongues between the fingers - don't be afraid of them, don't hate them, don't Don't remove your eyes, they will be your sharpest spear and your most solid shield. They will be your most loyal friends, the most lovely children, the dearest lovers - you choose them, they choose You, you will exist for each other until one party is destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you feel burning? The lich lowered his voice and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I only feel the warmth, the soul of the outside world also replies with a small voice, although the conversation within the sea will never be heard by the outside world, but He always felt too loud to scare off a little guy who was rushing to the brain - he said to the lich, showing another highlight in his body to a soul on his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s too small, the Lich said, although I have my concerns, this choice is too small. What are you going to do with it? It is not cooked even with sparrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I think this is a good fit for me, the soul of the opposite world said that he touched the bright spot with the index finger of the other hand, it became bigger Point, then stretch out a few drifting tentacles from the white body, and use one of them to wrap the finger of Kremar, as if to jump from the finger that originally lived to the one that touched it. The finger went up, but it was tripped by its own tentacles. It fell. The relationship with Kremar was limited to the finger that was caught, and the round body was hung above the branch of black-haired, red-light. Shake a few times around with a panic gesture of an elemental creature, climbed up along the tentacles, wandered around for a while, and finally decided that Kreima’s thumb and fingernails were the best. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
