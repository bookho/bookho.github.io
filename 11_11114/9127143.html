Imprint, obsidian is a very brittle gem, and it is very hard. When Grenada has not become the territory of the red dragon, people who lack black iron and brass use swords and arrows to knock out the obsidian. But under the claws of the red dragon, they are like decaying and fragile wood. With the approach of Gredi, the smell of her body becomes stronger. Unlike her children, this breath does not lead to others. Unpleasant, it smells like a burning musk, or a rusted steel, cold, rough with a wonderful, suppressed but tempting all the time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest scale of the red dragon is like a pointed shield that can be attached to the arm. When she moves, it is like a stack of scales. At dusk, the sea is covered with red-red scorpions, and the souls of the outer world are watching them. They are not like a part of a creature. They are like the gods of gnomes or the gods of dwarves. Every subtle place is It's that perfect, there is no trace of disorder and imperfections. Both the gathering and the unfolding have a sense of rhythm that can be embarrassed. Of course, undoubtedly, they are so powerful and hard, with sharp edges, moving in Greedy. At the time, they opened slightly, reflecting the light in the hall like the sharp edge of the sword.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy gently leans his huge head against the thin body of the black caster, her golden eyes like a small lake, reflecting gold The flash, the black diamond-shaped pupil is like a whirlpool in the lake, it spins, bred countless conspiracy and cruelty, and the red dragon can't completely close the upper and lower jaws to reveal its teeth - each giant The dragons have more than three rows of teeth, arranged neatly and orderly in their mouths, like a grinding machine made of fine gold, even if it is rock and steel, it will be chewed once or twice. Become useless pieces, swallow them into the belly - don't worry that the dragons will be indigested, the evil dragons (especially the red dragons) will bite if they have time and strength when they know that they are going to die. Broken and swallowed all of their treasures, not left to the same family or left to humans, gold, precious stones and other precious things will only be turned into a group of stinking residues in the strong stomach acid of the dragon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some dragons will even eat their own dragon eggs or the young dragons who have not yet left the nest<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black caster disappoints some people and makes some people stand for joy, without retreating or huddling, and the huge red dragon looks up slightly The cast shadow suddenly completely shrouded the man of Kremar, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world could not help but frown--appeared in Greedy At that time, he had a slight discomfort. This feeling is hard to describe. If you have to express it, then it is like the twilight time of another sunny summer. The rainstorm will come to the moment before it - in Greedy. When I walked down, this feeling became strong, like what the body was tightly bound, and I needed to struggle to breathe smoothly. Now, he feels that the shadow covering him is like a substance. Not only has the essence, but also the weight like a mud, his breathing stopped for a moment, then became tight and rushedDudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see where you can stick to it"Red Dragon said that she also has such a little surprise.Of course, Gredi not only remembers the name she gave to this child, she was once a strict and demanding mentor, yes, in the Warlock Tower and the teacher who has so far been unable to find the name and trace of her, she still has no idea In the presence of Remar, this symbol of disobedience extended her small and firm fingers to magic and power under her guidance—he used to be so weak, so incompetent, even the most bloody. Thin sidelines, those who can only become dragons and servants and soldiers can arbitrarily tease and harm this privileged, but powerless and empowered child - but Greed is not like other people think That stubbornly rejects the other half of his body, although she does not like the elves, or just likes them to be put on the plate, but this old red dragon has a powerful god. Fragment, her thoughts are broader and longer than any red dragon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This child was really too...worse in his childhood, even the new king who had hoped for him was finally disappointed again and again. Give up, but Gree does not, she found extra fun in this child, this kind of fun even made her want to condescend to look after the young descendants who could not even walk upright at the time - although she believes her descendants want her He has never been interested in him, and he is not willing to accept such care, but we should sometimes give up the process of recourse and directly look at the results. Greedy is optimistic, look, now is not very good, her descendants For the first time, there is a situation in which a mage and a warlock coexist in one person.Greed hopes that this is not a special case. If possible, she would like to try it. She has countless bloody descendants, but they are either warlocks. If they want to be a mage, they must be before they are allowed to become a warlock. Changing a professional character, turning a warlock into a wizard, or turning a wizard into a warlock is almost impossible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world heard a roar, and Greed had no warning around him, and opened his wings silently. A huge force burst out of her body, and his body violently rolled inside. The internal organs are like the smashing of the same pain. He suddenly crouched on the cold ground, the blood spilled from his mouth, and the soul of the outside world could no longer take care of others. All he could do was Hold it with both hands and try to swallow the blood down. He can remember that his blood is different from normal blood from appearance to nature - but there is still blood spilling from the finger joints, and the stars are dissipated in the air. . Fortunately, he can now be said to be surrounded by the body of the Great, the red dragon and the dragon's sight can not penetrate the scales and flesh and blood to see the inside, and just in the moment, he Seeing those beautiful humanoid red dragons and dragons have already bowed down with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also put down his knees, it can be said that the whole body is close to the ground, the red dragon's claws and scales are shaking in front of his eyes, the outside world The soul closed his eyes—perhaps just after a few breaths, or after a few nights and nights, everything finally stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the dragons, Kelmen and Kelsey’s look is not very good, or worse than the prestigious Cremari They were able to stand up with the help of the attendants, and the black caster slowly straightened himself after Greedy convened the dragon. Greed looked at her daughter's child and stretched out. On one side of the membrane wing, put it on the shoulders of Kremar. The body temperature of the red dragon may be hotter than the charcoal that has not been extinguished. The heat is transmitted from the shoulder of Kremar, causing sharp pain. The skin may have been burned, but look at the eyes of Kelmen and Kelsey - fully interpret the kind of envy and hatred, the soul of the outside world feels that even if it becomes a char-grilled chicken wing, there is nothing wrong with it. . Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very happy that you can come back to me." Gredi said that her voice is no longer so grand and honest, on the contrary Her voice may be the most wonderful voice heard by the souls of the outside world in this plane. If there is anyone who can match, then only the elven king of the silver-crowned jungle, Yingyingwei - Gerry When the dragon was formd into a human form, there was no superfluous fluctuation, and there was no light or wind. The soul of the alien world only felt that the weight on the shoulder suddenly disappeared. When turning around and looking at the past, there was only one beauty around him. A majestic woman, you can't say that she is young or old, and can't describe her appearance specifically. When she sees her, you will only admire her uncontrollably, fear her, and give her everything. She put an arm on Kremar: "Kremar," her eyes passed over everyone. "My child, from today, he has with Mitt, Kelmen, Kay. Ersie's equal status and power, as well as what I should have as a direct line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragons exchanged their eyes, revealing a meaningful smile, and New King’s wife, Gret’s daughter, Kelmen and Kelsey’s mother turned around annoyingly, and the new king and Mitt’s face were gratified and happy, even Kelmen and Kyle. Silk, after a brief horror and anger, also put on a stiff but not rude mask - they just don't want to violate the purpose of Grei, they are afraid of Kre's, their disgust and hatred More important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "new king" of Grenada seems to think that this scene is not lively enough. After Greedy returned to the throne, he immediately stepped forward. "Respected mother," he said, deeply swearing: "I need your consent for something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Question: "My treasure," she said softly. "What do you want? Is it for Kreima? Say, he is also my descendant, what does he need? It is a scroll, a wand, a staff, Or is it a magic robe? I have the crowns and rings that once belonged to the dragons. If there are many artifacts and spells, I have a lot of spells here. He can choose as much as he wants."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that's yours," said the new king, as if he didn't notice that Greed was talking, even the young red dragons showed a look of greed and hatred: You know, to this child," he glanced at Crimall with a sigh of relief, "I am owed - compared Other children, he can get too little, too little, so I feel heartache every time I see him - so..." He bowed again, and Greed is just quite awkward Smiling with interest, she also wanted to know what the new king was going to do, and the new king paused and called his other child's name: "Mitte."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mittek immediately stepped out of the ranks, and he gave his knees to Gridy. Greedy raised his hand carelessly and let him stand up. "Why," Greed asked: "Don't you? Is the matter related to Mittitch?"dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Closely related," said the new king: "I used to hand over my army to Mitt, because he is my favorite child, but now, I have to compensate my other child to reduce my apology, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
