Bibi Dibao also had people staying up all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that merchants are always confused by the light of gold coins, but I did not expect that they would even abandon the minimum vigilance," Al Master Wage said tiredly that when Kremar first came to Bibi Dibao, the older mage was still a broad-minded, well-informed person, much younger than his actual age, but In just a few months, it was like suffering a curse. The time that was masked by power and skill was flowing away quickly. When he walked with a long staff, he even smashed his back. Get up, "Don't they? Those who are displaced?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They think that the refugees are because they are weak or don't take the medication according to the instructions of the priests of Greedy. This will be the case." The governor of Bitumindi whispered softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greedy..." Master Alva repeated: "A new god, an ominous omen - what do they say now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the priest of Greedy? They demanded the establishment of the temple and sanctuary of Greet in Bibi Dibao," the Archon said: "I am very It is difficult to reject them, because the wife of the parliament is almost asking for the son and grandson to Gree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Businessmen are threatening us if we disagree When the dynasty fortune sells this herb, they will leave Beitburg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe just talk about it verbally." The consul said: Beitburg is the only one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the worst place." Master Alva said gloomyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the anti-theft section, updated around 10 am tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German was half-sleeping behind a city, and almost fell asleep leisurely. He didn’t seem to notice that a demon was coming from the back of the city. Climbing up, two coal-like burning red eyes staring at his back neck, which is the weakness of almost all creatures, as long as they are bitten, they can't move - it can be said that when it finds that it is facing thieves When he was penetrated by a dagger, he was extremely surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't anyone tell you," the thief said in his heart - in addition to not wanting to attract more enemy attention, those who follow the "death" of the demon A strong smell of odor is enough to make people feel uncomfortable. "Even if you are in the vent, but the premise is that you still have to be clean," Gülen complained: "You are more than marinated fermented shark viscera Even stinking, it can be a weapon or a shield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said this, stretched out the palm, except that it could be hidden at the most critical moment. Beyond the shape, the most satisfying thing about this dagger is that he can return to his own hands. This is what he discovered unexpectedly after he left Beitburg. In this case, life is not difficult. After all, they still have so many enemies, and the thieves think with satisfaction. And, if there is anything that deserves to be silent for him, probably it seems to be able to resist certain toxins and adverse effects for him - just like now, he smells the dirty smell, but does not feel Discomfort, when the dagger returns to his hand, the effect of the scent is reduced to the extent that it will not affect him at all. At this time, the Druid has also achieved a temporary victory. He reached out to Gülen, and the thief jumped down the battlefield and handed the jacket cloak in his hand. To Perant, and well hidden his smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, he said, if he can return to the port of Point, he can probably answer a question that has puzzled many people for a long time - that Is the druid wearing clothes or not wearing clothes when changing to animals? The answer is that other druids may not, but the elf druids can, the silk of the white-bellied spider is not only tough but rich. Elasticity, even if he becomes a giant rhinoceros, with the original ten times waist circumference, it is not a naked body, and has a thin but credible armor. Just a little cute on the look and feel, think about it, a giant rhinoceros shining in the fire, the edge of the dress is also embroidered with the elves' favorite silver crown wood flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant glared at him. The Druid did not go with the thieves. He knew their strengths and weaknesses. Gülen might not have been as good as Kreima, but there was no such bad thing that Baldwin thought. And during this journey, they are still companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan instinctively feels dangerous, he turned his head and wanted to find a safe point, but the collapse and louder vibrations that followed Let them raise their heads at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapse of the main tower gives them a magical galaxy on the side of the iron blue sky, a fire and a huge black figure against the backdrop of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" Gülen asked in a panic: "Organic elements, or stone elemental creatures?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no stone elemental creature, but the Druid is not prepared to open a magical lecture at this time: "It is a demon soul, but it is not a pure demon soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said this because the demon souls faced by Kremar and others can reach the window sill of the third floor of the main tower as long as they reach out. The original body may be a snowy giant, mottled and rotten skin. Tightly wrapped with angular bones, its too tall skull is like wearing a funny yellow high hat. The thick legs are like pillars in the hall. It is neither afraid of lightning nor fear of ice thorns. The wind, even the flames can't be attached to it because it can't find something that can burn, and it's obviously very intelligent, and it can make zombies and ghouls - Gülen thinks they meet There are already enough undead creatures, but I didn’t expect the main force to be here at Krimal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant pulled a long bow and a magical arrow from the pocket, and the arrow whizzed past, piercing the ear hole of the demon corpse - it was an ear hole Let's go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may have screamed, grabbed the arrow as soon as he raised his hand, and it was in time, because the magic wound on the arrow formed a big moment. The hot flame of the regiment, but this is not to say that Leona’s crisis has been lifted. Although she is not killed under the claws of the demon corpse, she has to face the tongue that is ejected from it. The tongue is thin. Long, the tip of the tongue also carries a hook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leona!" Birdwin yelled, but before that his new arm grabbed the front half of the tongue, the demon corpse The tongue hit several times on Mithril's arm, and the hook on the tip of the tongue creaked on the metal, trying to dig through the skin to dig the bleeding, but obviously it was impossible to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gülen made a face and jumped into Leona and Birdwin. He chose the position very correctly, because neither Perant nor Kreima would pour pressure on two ordinary humans. On the contrary, they are like the warriors of another plane who put hatred firmly on themselves. Although this can only be said to be better than nothing, because the demon corpse also perceives them as Leona and Birdwin are the weakest link, and he screams and orders the zombies and ghouls to delay. Perant’s footsteps turned to face the Lich and Kerry Ben. But at the same time, the two demons are climbing up and down from the darkness, their eyes are condensing on the back of the warrior and the only woman, perhaps now with a thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little trick may be able to deceive others, but it is impossible to escape the lich’s eyes and thoughts. Who can be more familiar with them than him? Undead? Even the demon corpse he personally created a fight, and this necromancer is stupid, as in the seventy-seventh islands, the Necromancer and the Lich never use giants or gnomes as the The raw material of the undead, because what they need is the corpse of the size of a human zombie. This corpse is almost exactly the same as the zombie, but it is even thinner, but when it is mixed in the zombie community, it is almost only encountered. The enemies will reveal the different wisdom and speed of the zombies, and the snake-like dangerous tongue. There are many knights and priests who fall under the kiss that they can't help - a giant corpse of mud embryos Hey, do you think you are playing mud? Who is big and who wins? The huge size of the body limits the speed of the demon corpse, eliminates its concealment, and creates more vulnerable points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Cremari is still a lich, there are of course countless ways to get rid of this stupid big or use it for your own use, but Now he can not only release the mage with negative energy, there are two elves who have been traveling for many years, but the bang from Gelan has attracted his attention. If he is not mistaken, it should be a dwarf. Burst arrow, um, these small locusts, regardless of the identity of the buyer, their blasting arrows have brought some minor troubles to the guests in the seventy-seven islands, and the seventy-seven islands sent a few lichs. After talking with their patriarchs, the result is that the gnome's bursting arrows have only been on the gnomes since then, although sometimes they will "lost" a few, but because they are too expensive, the number is scarce and will not interfere again. The calm and tranquility of the seventy-seven islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although McGee said that he insisted on being a dwarf, he was still a dwarf. These bursts of arrows are not like a gift, they should be thieves temporarily. Borrowing," but the Lich won't mind this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sight penetrated the dust and smoke directly on the thief, making a gesture when Gülen looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan caster's gesture, what he has to do may be dangerous, but the caster has closed his eyes slightly, began to chanting spells, making cast gestures - He only presses the bursting arrow on the bow, not one, but two connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hitting the left knee of the demon corpse accurately, all the parts below the knee were turned into a moment, and it screamed and squatted sideways. But the second one was slightly offset by a boulder that it was thrown at once, only half of that huge kneecap, but this was enough, and the caster’s first spell was covered by the thief. Invisible armor, although the boulder hit him but only dampened his skin, the second spell was a seed that had been soaked in the water of life. As soon as the seed fell into the gap, it quickly budded and grew. The tempered bones creaked under the power of life, and eventually they were ruined with helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich casts a third spell without stopping, and the innumerable thorns rise underground, entwining the body and arms of the corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief walked to the caster with a bloody face, staring at the demon soul and blinking his eyes, "It’s weird," he Said: "This guy has already died, but it will still fear and wince." After he finished, he pressed the trigger, bursting into the skull from the black eye of the demon soul, colliding on the skull and violently The ground exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Cremari is still a lich, there are of course countless ways to get rid of this stupid big or use it for your own use, but Now he can not only release the mage with negative energy, there are two elves who have been traveling for many years, but the bang from Gelan has attracted his attention.
