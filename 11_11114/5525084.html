			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light outside the store has become very weak, the hot wind is moving slowly with them, the street becomes quiet and dark and the pub becomes noisy and bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pub was dancing, the boat doctor noticed that the young people in the same group slowed down slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do I interfere too much?" The senior smiled and said: "Maybe you really need a cute little thing to do, dance or dance. It’s a drink, not an old guy with me who spends time in the spice heap.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m not without gain.” Kremar Say, "I am just a little..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Curious," said the ship doctor: "You must have rarely been exposed to such women before." One was his parents. He and the tutor are strictly disciplined, he said in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I met a Fro's pastor at Tsim Sha Tsui."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ship Doctor Whistle: "Lucky - Fro's celebration day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "How?" The ship doctor squinted like a 16-year-old boy: "They like your beautiful and young boy like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Then she must be an exception," said Kremar. "She collaborated with a half-ogre and a halfling, first with the added honey, then with the stick and the dagger."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship doctor can't believe the sky. "Do you have anything to do with Fro?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Isn't the smack of Pastor Froe's nose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After that, still before that?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then she will The reason is that," the ship doctor wrinkled his lips: "This is terrible, no one will guard against a Fro priest. Under the premise of no devious behavior and deity, murder violates Fro's teachings, she is love. The god of ** is not the god of theft."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to justify her..." Kreima said: "But she only offers a glass of honey." Or she herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not for the preparation of the subsequent murder?" The ship doctor retorted: "At the Bibi Dyke, she and her accomplices will be executed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is the pastor of Fro."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only on the premise of obeying the doctrine She is the pastor. A pastor who cannot follow the doctrine of the gods is just a despicable false believer. The temple will not interfere with the operation of the secular regulations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long does it take for such a pastor to lose the gods given by the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Immediately," the ship doctor quickly replied: "And he Immediately, the gods will be given and the temples will be known."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she can still use the magic," said Kremar. "She cured herself. The nose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship doctor slammed down and he stared at Crimal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless she has a healing reel in her possession." Remar recalled that Pastor Fro's robes were extremely close to the body, thin and light, with only a thin leather cord, perhaps she hid one in the dark corner of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or she is a fake." The ship doctor guessed, but he knew how weak this conclusion was. "When I was young, they were not like this." He walked forward again, shaking his head with anxiety as he walked. "When I was still a little girl who was holding my mother's skirt to walk, she took me to the temple of Fro, so long road, one On the road are women who are offering to Froe, young, old, rich, poor, beautiful, ugly, wearing garlands on their heads, ruddy, smiling, and holding the latest harvest in their hands. Wheat ears and sweet peas..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"麦穗?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for love Dedicated sweet peas, pray for the birth of the wheat, but now the woman who wants to give birth to the sacrifice of the Gredi, only the sluts and sluts will pray to Fro - her pastor was originally only in Fro On the celebration day, before the ritual and land ploughing, the unmarried men of the age group were selected to pray for thick objects. Only one symbolic silver coin is charged each time. But now? They always think of the way to ask men for expensive gifts, or mix them with younger and handsome ones. As for whether he has a wife, a child, and the ability to give birth, it is not within their consideration. Hey, they are already close to each other, and now they are mixed with thieves. I am really worried about how many more In the year, Fro's pastor will also be the target of the expulsion of Betty Dyke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are passing through a place that is almost noisy with the previous pub. The soul from another place still wants to know more, but his problem has been violently interrupted by a body that broke out of the pub door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship doctor stood on the left hand side of Kremar, and the raid came from the right side. It was a male mercenary with a bearish stout and stinking. His head was very Small, low in the center of two towering shoulders like a mountain. He ran out of the pub. When he stood on the road to see his own must, he not only stopped, but roared and continued to move forward. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creimal turned to keep the skinny ship doctor behind him, turned the leather bag with honey to the left hand, he was ready to give this smashing guy 狠狠The preparation of a punch may be able to hit him directly back into the pub - he has a deep understanding of the physical strength of the body in the twenty days on the ship, not only the naughty little killer whale, but also on the little bird The sailor also gave him a lot of help - although they always let their noses and face swollen, Kremar was a little overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but almost at the same time, a tall, thin girl rushed out of the pub, she raised a crossbow with a string, aligned The heart of the man. Kreima and her crossed the shoulders of the mercenary, her eyes sparkling with golden light, which contained the cold and persistent that could not be mistaken. So Kremar changed his mind in an instant. He grabbed the mercenary's coat, kicked his knees, and slammed him down. He heard the vibrating sound of the crossbow string and the sharp whistling that followed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two whistling, then collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint light from the whale oil lamp does not affect Cremari’s vision, and the arrows and feather arrows that can only be stared at the chessboard. Trying to infer the difference in the mercenary that just happened, he clearly read the whole process - how Fang Fangjian left the bow and how it was shot down by a slender feather arrow The feather arrow that was not used for killing but was used for salvation came from the other end of the pub. It was separated from Kremar by 50 feet, which was a dense crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall, ranger rides through them, carrying a long bow, calm and light, and his hood covers his hair and his half face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary wanted to get up from the ground and escape, but Kremar’s feet were on his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let him go," the girl rudely ordered: "He is a thief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just took the one I should take. The mercenary shouted: "And she wants to kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not yours," said the Ranger to the mercenary, and then he looked at the girl. : "Not yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s expression becomes a bit weird, horrified, or a little bit afraid, when she wants to step back, Ranger Turn the bowstring to yourself: "You can't go yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things seem to be quite complicated?" the ship doctor said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call the police...guard," said Crimmar, of course: "There is a law in Beitburg, isn't it?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls, mercenaries, and boat doctors were short-lived for a while, and they didn’t expect this - the hip-hop’s lips were quickly tilted up: "It’s right, friend, He said: "Let the guards come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little boy who was in the pub quickly called the guard. Before that, the ranger looked for the mercenary. Out of a cylinder, when he poured out the contents of the cylinder and examined it, the ship doctor seized Kremar's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 14: Devil's Finger (below)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's the devil's finger, um, we Humans call it so, the elves call it 'poisonous tip', which is a unique species of fungi." The ship doctor said that they have returned to the foot of the egret, sitting in the front hall, surrounded by a warm hearth, in front of Grape juice mixed with vegetables and watered milk: "Only in the swamp deep in the forest can you see the stuff, when it is not grown, it is white, it grows bright red, dried, and ground into powder. Masters Use it to summon the devil. The mortal use them to kill people. It only needs a small point. It can be hidden in the nails. It is soluble in water and can be turned into smoke. The effect is similar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very expensive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very expensive," the ship doctor drummed his mouth: "The mages weigh it in grams. The elves hate the mushroom, which is almost exclusively distributed in the backyard of their vestibule, perhaps because people almost call it the elf finger, they See it, we have to destroy it not, of course, they do not want to collect them and then let mankind out to sell or use "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master’s face is full of regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the Ranger stand face to face on both sides of a pool of fire elements. This pool of fire elements is small, it is limited by the Master in a hand that can be lifted with both hands. In the mica stone bowl, the bowl is stuck in a black iron bracket that is cast into vines and gnome arms. In the place near the bowl, the iron bracket becomes dark red and emits turbulent heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you really leave me some?" He said: "As long as the weight of two grams, I just want to do some experiment."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The Ranger answered gently and stubbornly, the Master grinned sadly, but he still cast a spell on the Ranger's wish. After the spell took effect, the Ranger will take the cylinder. Throw into the pool of fire elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke was dispelled as soon as it was produced. The dried mushrooms made a baby cry in the pure fire element. "These summons can summon more than a dozen devils." "The Master said that for a while, the Ranger thought he would reach in and rescue the remnant part - but fortunately, he said sorry to his mage friend in his heart. Few people know that the elf hates this mushroom. Because of a name and the evil use that humans know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood until the fire element pool returned to its original appearance before leaving, and the Master carefully locked the room with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I may not be prepared for this spell." Alva said that he was a little bit worried about the mushroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't take a long time to leave Bituminburg," said the Ranger, comfortably. "At least not enough to make you tired of your old friends." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master likes hookah is a well-known thing, but he is equally busy, so he keeps a small spell to disperse the room and body in an emergency. Smoke smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else do you have to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Ranger Slightly over the head: "Need help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caubert wants me to meet someone, a stranger who makes him feel good," Alva The voice echoed in the empty corridor, and the Master and the Ranger were used to walking lightly and silently: "He hopes that I can give some... instructions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not known," Alva said. "But in my opinion, that person is not extremely kind, it is extremely Evil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak with one sentence," he said, "He wants to go to the White Tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——White Tower? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Yes, White Tower, we must first get something there, and then go north along the Starlight River until the Grey Ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- is the end point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The temporary end point. The Lich said that we need a safe place to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I thought you would be eager to restore strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There is also a place where the blade is sharpened. The former undead said that the gray ridge is the front and the post of the silver-crowned jungle - the goblin, the orc, and Human beings, fighting and danger are never lacking, but they are not too frequent and are suitable for us now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Will they allow? Skeptical about the soul of the outside world - in his world, 80% of a funny little interview said that he could not recognize his neighbor and could not name their name, but There is almost no harm to them, but what about this? People will hold a suspicious and vigilant attitude towards an unfamiliar face. Travelers of unknown origin will be expelled even if they are only passing through the village or staying in the field for a while, let alone settle down and invade their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Yes, the Lich said, simple and unquestionable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world has no more to say, he can detect that the lich's emotions are in a state of volatility. The once-dead person seems to be forced to face something he does not want to face. The most ironic thing is that it is none other than himself who is beating him with a whip behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich used magic tricks to give himself a rough mirror, the handle was made of wood, the mercury paint on the back was cracked, and a small piece was missing. . His pale face was reflected in the mirror. This face had been rotten as early as seventy years ago, but now it is back, the Lich is not happy with it - he never liked his face, although it once gave him shelter, in him Still very weak and humble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
