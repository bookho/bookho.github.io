The earth shivered, "... 10,000 sorry!" he said in the most humble gesture. "Please forgive my negligence... Powerful and respectable Edel... I am just..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, I know," the demigod lich didn't care nod, although Austal couldn't see: "Relief, child, I won't mind one or two unintentional rudeness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." Austal licked his lips: "You can, can you... tell me?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My answer is," said the Half-God Lich, "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, Austal was able to make sure that his blood rushed to his cheeks and fingers like a boiling magma, and he almost rushed to use his teeth and claws to immortalize this. The mixed ball tears, tears, tears, crushes the rest of his bones, pulls his soul out of his life, and throws it to the lowest inferior in the endless abyss and the scorpion bite for a hundred years or longer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that calmed him down was Edel’s spell that he left behind. The Dragon Warlock retreated in the sharp spell of the spell, and his protective spells shone. Bright light, and the same use of the protective seal of the rune in the crisp burst of sound, in order to pull him one after another barrier, the only thing worthy of praise and fortunate is that even in this case, he No offensive spells are cast, just defensive and alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm." Edel said softly: "Yes, take a deep breath, yes, humans do this, come, take a deep breath, Once, twice, three times..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal endures the squirting of a sulphuric acid - he looks at his own 嗲The opening of the black hole was still openly ironic. For this answer, even Grenada took a lot of effort to get the jewel, but now it has been taken away without compensation. Even if Edeler didn't complete the contract - Austal repeatedly recalled the contents of the contract, this contract is unfair to him and Grenada, but Edeler is the most impossible thing they can find. Their most intelligent and powerful caster - because Grenada also has the blood of a dragon, before he became a lich, he was also a dragon warlock. He and Austal are blood relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Can I know the reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I’m so glad that you can calm down so quickly," said the half-god lich, Oss. Tal could almost see his projection on his fingertips and put his hands out of a triangle tower. "Isn't it," he said. "There is definitely a reason."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just can't give an answer, or a useful answer, because the puzzle was cracked long when you handed it over to me," Edell said. He might have made a snap, and the golden dragon grammar book appeared in front of Austal in such abrupt manner. It didn't seem to be damaged at all, and even the gold cover was intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, my dear child," Edelna Kindly said: "What is incomprehensible? This book is a mystery, a mystery with prizes, it hangs there, shining, everyone can see. Then someone solved the puzzle Take away the reward, okay, even if someone found it after this. Once again solved the puzzle, but sorry, dear, no prize, the prize has been taken away - the answer has been taken away The maze will only be opened once for the first wise man. Then it will be closed forever, the exit will disappear, you can destroy it, or you can imitate it, but the exit, unfortunately, can’t appear again anyway. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal probably didn't realize that he was slowly shaking his head. Is that half-dragon? Or was it the owner of this dragon grammar book? Or is that the black hair caster? But he has been swallowed up by the Starlight River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person who stole the reward..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alive." Edelna Let the dragon sorcerer who did not want to be answered startled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, it's pretty good," Edell added. "He's a very flattering child." The demon smiled and lazily stroked his newly acquired gem, pink, very clean, hungry, his power tentacles eager to move, eager to catch a soul into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" Ostal asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Reward?” The Semi-God Lich replied: “For mortals or idiots, that may not be a reward but a punishment, but for smart people, it is not too rich, or my child, it It's just a scorpion. One can lead a powerful and wise existence to find a huge..." He interestingly saw the greedy flame in the eyes of Austal: "heritage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heritage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Edel said easily: "I have given you more than you." Deserved, little guy, you should know how much you got, your 'mother' will be proud of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Ostal muttered, he might have to ask for anything first, but a chilly force pushed him back. He only took a step back and fell from the flat ground. The suddenly opened Dimension Gate threw him out of the tower of Edel, and the lead ash that appeared again in front of him was The clouds, and at his feet are the dark, ice-free waters of the seventeenth islands. The talisman on his body played a role. A self-activated flight sent him a piece of land about ten feet wide. reef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid the pursuit of the army, it was forced to take the risk of passing over the pirate ship on the edge of the seventy-seven archipelago. An over-exposed watchman saw Ostal He couldn't help but scream hysterically. Standing on a reef in the seventy-seven islands, a lich is just an exaggerated description or a boring rumor, but many people still believe it. The Dragon Warlock looked at the ship as if he had been madly chased by tens of thousands of undead. He made a gesture with a gloomy face and cast a spell that destroyed the rudder of the ship and its route. Squatting to one side, carrying a ship mad pirate crashed into a small island that rises out of the sea like a shark's dorsal fin. It is not known if there are any undead, but they can swim before the ship is completely sunk. The island can be said to be very lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least you should get the robes and red robes!" Ostal shouted, then cast a spell to send himself back to himself. tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to return to the tower is to contact his disciple. It is the younger brother of Ruiyite of Baita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you see Rui Yi Te?" As soon as the face of the disciple appeared in the flame, Aostal asked sternly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," his disciple said, "The night before yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You told me it was my order, you will come to Baita here. Is it true that he has sent this favored disciple to Ruiyite's "Tobacco" - it is quite normal for the Dragon Warlocks to seize each other's merits. As long as the previous plan is not compromised, it is not important at all who is the final result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Ostal found that his disciples were a little nervous, but every true disciple would be nervous in front of him. What he did not expect was that he The disciple just learned something from Drake that he didn't know yet. And tried to use these messages to trick his sister into a sum: "Just talked briefly." He said that in the warlock, talking often often refers to intimidation and extortion. This is also known by Austal, but in words The confrontation is more symbolic of useless voids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The previous plan was put on hold," Ostal said unquestionably, and his disciples immediately bowed and said: "I need you to go to the dragon." Fire Island," Ostall said: "No need to disclose." That is to say, this secret does not become his handle: "You can ask for assistance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"She may not be willing to die," his disciple said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She will." Austal said, "The delay in our plan is the biggest reward for her."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal’s disciples hide their regrets behind a humble smile. If Austal makes concessions or is willing to exchange, then those things can fall into his pocket, which is really a pity, but he should not know what Ruiyite did, otherwise he can There are jokes to watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to open a dimension door here," Ostal reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His disciple quickly retired and gave up his position, but Austal did not personally come to the White Tower, but threw a reel at hand. This is the command and reward for him, and the mark on the outside of the reel is just a flash and burns. But this time, Ruiyite’s younger brother has been able to see the contents. The scroll contains a six-level spell, but at first glance, it knows that this spell is aimed at this action. The young warlock begins to think about how to This scroll is saved. Maybe his sister, Ruiyi, can help? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal sorted out his clothes after completing this method. He still has an urgent thing to do, which is to return the result of the task to the "mother". On a road that was hundreds of feet away, his brain was spinning so fast that he knew that his last mission had been flawed and he should have cast a more devastating spell. Shake the black hair caster and his boat completely, instead of handing the work over to the Starlight River, now he needs to make up for this loophole, maybe he can... the Dragon Warlock is entering the huge and heavy black iron gate The former has restored its original calmness and calmness. The "mother" may not know that this is just a lie, but sometimes the "mother" will become extremely tolerant, as long as she can see what you can do for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were silver hammers hanging between the waists, and the priest dressed in a deep red silk gown opened the door for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada, how familiar is this name what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gredi is its variant name, which means greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what he will face?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Wang replied: "He is like you, and he is also the chosen person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hate the word." The soul of the aliens blurted out when it understood that he said When it was something, it was panic and embarrassing, but it was like the idea that he produced in every movie and novel he saw in another plane - what is the selected person, who is it? Purpose? Who can happily manipulate the thoughts of others and destroy their lives? Has anyone asked him if he wants to carry this heavy and dangerous shackles? Why do you have to sacrifice and sacrifice? Why can't all people work together, the wheel of fate is so huge, how can you let one or several people control its direction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Someone will be selected, the lich will say in peace, just like there are always heroes in the game you play, they are born to save the whole world. It’s like... although... he laughed a little, and our identity seems to be more suitable as an enemy of the brave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world did not even notice that the king of the jungle had come to him. The distance between them was only one elbow, and the flowers of the silver crown fell. Falling between them and the body, exudes a faint light wood fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
