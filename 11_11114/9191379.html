			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afra was with a small smile on his face when he went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this bound ball, the first owner is Gredi, the second is His Royal Highness, and the third is her - His Highness did not conceal her from her father, from her father, Gülen, to her mother, Mei Mei, who began to love each other, and went to Bedwin to reject her father's petition - no one knows whether Birdwin's runes can get rid of the gods. The curse, but he did not give the slightest pity is unquestionable, then the mother's death, and Afra was sent by his father to the Grenada - perhaps he handed the bond ball to Afra, It was for her own decision to come to Afra to all the catastrophes and tortures. At the source, Birdwin may have an unshirkable responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Afra found that she didn’t have much hatred for this mortal, she didn’t even hate her father, Gülen, of course, Afra It’s not the kind of vomiting innocent child who grew up in a warm and peaceful environment, and who is gentle and generous. She just thinks that being able to meet His Highness Kremar is enough to offset all the injuries, colds and insults she has suffered. Both Baldwin and Gülen have made her feel good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the parents of Birdwin Don Clay give the verdict, Afra does not feel that they will be willing to let Birdwin continue to be theirs The father or the king existed in the world. What would they do? Is it ruining that Badwin can prove his own things and then exile him, or will he be buried directly forever? What does Baldwin think? After he was mercilessly abandoned by his own children? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know where the doughnuts are sold?" Affola asked their "guide" with great enthusiasm: "It is fried in the oil." The one that swells up and then rolls in the soy flour and brown sugar - and Couscous, the bread is stuffed with vegetables and pork, sprinkled with sesame seeds, or fried dough, I like to put it inside. Sugared apples - another round soup, mutton, chestnuts, cabbage, but not olives... I want to see the six giant fountains on the market square. Is there a market today?" She can't wait I want to see, listen to and taste the scenery, music and food described by His Highness, who always describes it. It is like that the Highness is still by her side, she has not left, and she can also have with her Highness. More of the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to live in the Egret Hotel," Afra said: "Or the smog hut of Alva Master, you can." For this pair His Royal Highness has a strong master of ambiguity. Afula still maintains a little respect. Maybe she can visit this human mage. Afra thinks that when she returns, she will be very happy to hear her story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the young man returns to the residence of Dagong, the magical star river has been squatting, and Dagong is waiting for him. There is only one whale candle in the room. Whale oil candles are faint and have smoke compared to whale wax candles. When Dagong lifted his head from the file, his eyes were bloodshot. The young man walked over and extinguished the whale candle, and familiarly found three cetyl candles from a drawer and lit them. He did not blame the servant, because it must be the request of the Grand Duke. As the crisis approaching the Bibi dike was gradually moved away, Dagong’s demands on himself became more and more demanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Dagong put down the quill and licked his forehead: "Do they have any requirements?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe stay a few more days," the young man said. "It seems that the plan has to be postponed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong sighed Tone: "Maybe this is also a good thing. After all, at the celebration... In case of panic, it is very dangerous to push and trample. It is my negligence, child," he shook his head. "I was What do you think? Is it for the so-called ritual sense? It’s stupid.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, not stupid,” the young man blurted out, then he Annoyed to find that I made a big mistake: "I mean," he said: "Why would you make such a decision? Grand Duke, you saved the entire tourmaline, all you deserve - I believe other people think so too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong looked at him, then revealed a Sincere smile: "Thank you, my child," he said. "But I have made a decision, if..." He walked out from the desk and placed his hand on the shoulder of the young man: "If there is What, that is, I have to say sorry to you, I want you to carry things that you don’t want to bear – but believe me, no one but you can bear this heavy burden.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————————————————— —————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is leaving the room At that time, I saw a small flower on the other side of the promenade. Although it was not neat, it was still very beautiful. A long flowerbed was drawn from the straight green leaves. The top is a cluster of hundreds of flowers. The umbels of small flowers, small flowers and white crystals, each flower has five stamens with golden anthers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Onion," he said, and then the tears flowed down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afra is only 30 days after leaving Beitburg and received the death of the serious old man, and at this time Refa is close to the Azores and is far away from the Bibi dike. Even if she wants to do something, Bibi Dibao can have enough reaction time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are they moving hands at the celebration?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was after the celebration. "A dragon tooth knight said: "At the meeting held by the Grand Duke, his guards pulled out the short sword and the dagger. He died in a dozen knives, but he did not suffer too much pain."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afra's mouth is slightly tilted up: "So what about the guards? Are they being executed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "How come?" The Dragon Knight seems to feel the joy of the little master: "They are the heroes who saved the tourmaline from the tyrant and the dictatorship, and the headed one became the new parliament. The head of the parliament, he is still so young, it seems that there is no accident, Bibi Dibao can welcome peace for at least 50 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heroes "Afra is casually playing with the ring on the hand: "The human population is always so ignorant, they are on the throne, not stupid, the clown is cheating. And the people who really sacrificed for them were trampled under their feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Grand Duke is a believer in Ilmot," said the Dragon Knight. "This is exactly what he wants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can of course choose," Afra said. "But that's why they can be lenient and ungrateful." ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— —————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aubrey gave the new speaker a punch, a heavy punch, and directly knocked him to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Aubrey..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't call my uncle!" Aubrey Angrily shouted: "You have sworn," he pointed to the young new speaker: "You swear to be loyal to him! And your allegiance is to pierce the sword into his chest?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not what I hoped!" The new speaker also shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't tell someone to control you!" Aubry squeezed his fist: "I can see how you proudly put on the robe of the speaker!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have!" Aubrey yelled: " You cheated on him, betrayed him, and he treated you as his son!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't!" The new speaker stood up and Aubrey When I saw the face that was more mournful than him, I couldn’t help but stagnate: "It’s Dagong asking me to do this," the new speaker said tiredly. "He asked me to do this," he repeated. "He let We killed him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In order to make a trip to the Fort,” the new speaker said: “Bibi Dibao has been a free city for more than a thousand years. Before and after that, it should not be subject to any rule.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Harvey..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After Harvey's Grand Duke?" The new speaker called: "Don't we Can you find a new Harvey Grand Duke? The richness of Biyindi Fort can make the dragon covet also. How can you guarantee that the next dictator can be without selfishness? As long as there is one, Uncle Aubrey, Bi The dynasty dynasty was destroyed and completely destroyed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can expel him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No use!" The new speaker said painfully: "Did I not mention it? I don't want him to die at all. I don't even want to exile him, but Dagong said, there is only one miserable, humble and desperate. Death can guarantee that people will not be born with the same ambitions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I even buried him in Nguyen Fortress can't do it.” The new speaker continued: “I can't do anything, Uncle Aubrey, nothing can be done!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ———————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painful cry of the living person will not be conveyed to the ear of the deceased, Harvey does not Will care if he has a spectacular resting place, his ending has been written since he decided to become the Grand Duke of Betty Duke, he is only worried about whether the young people will suffer in the hands of the gangsters, but still There are Aubrey, and several other sensible members who are assisting from the side - um, it should be OK, he thinks a little irresponsibly, and feels a heartfelt joy. He worked hard for the life of Bituminburg, and died for He can only say that he is free from punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened his eyes, he saw a large black ship that covered the world, sailing on the mourning wilderness, like a mortal The ship was on the sea, the pale arm grabbed Harvey, but before they touched Harvey, a ray of light let them melt, and Harvey heard a sharp scream, and then his arm was warmed. The hand is holding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irmotte came to meet him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, outside the city of Norman’s capital in the Highlands, a person is slowly walking hard on a small road between the jungles, constantly falling, and then Constantly climbing up, his face and body make people look and fear, but also pity - covered with a layer of linen, the face is swollen, twisted and deformed, only one hand and one foot, his clothes still Tidy, wearing a short sword - his body has not allowed him to wear a wide sword, but the short sword is also a weapon, when several refugees want to rob him, its sharpness guarantees Bydwin Don Clay Not to be injured or even to die, his money bag is also. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But except for this, he had nothing, even the silver arm was buried with his armor, and as the king of Norman in the Highlands One of the distinctive features, it can't be taken out and installed on his stump. Now he has only one ordinary iron hook on his right arm. Like most mercenaries, he lost his feet and was burned by dragon fire. The face can't be treated by magic, and the foot is replaced by a conical wood. As for the face, he can only use a hood and a face towel to ensure that it does not scare others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to a very small village where there were good people who were willing to accommodate him, but he couldn’t help but scream when he saw his face occasionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" asked the farmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon Fire." Birdwin replied simply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer’s eyes are bright. “Are you fighting against the Red Dragon with our King’s Majesty?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No..." Bywin said: "I am a coward. I fled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that he did not come from the farmer’s eyes I saw contempt, "Do not blame you," said the farmer. "We all know how terrible the red dragon is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
