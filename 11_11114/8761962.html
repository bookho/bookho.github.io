			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are adults who worry that I will write this as a foreigner Conan - this is definitely not, this is a high magic world, they have always been doing things... rudely ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the world of alien souls, even if there is such a A clue that under the premise that the holder is dead and there is no cctv monitoring system, it can only be said to be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this world, no, sometimes they only need one direction - if the ringing golden bell is really as big as a scorpion, then stuff it It’s entirely possible to go to a small water polo. They have seen the ball that has caused countless madness. From the outside, it is no different from the ball placed in the holy pool of Rosada. The crystal inside. It has not completely melted, and it has a cold atmosphere, but it does not smell a little bit of a specific smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The trial was held at noon two days later," said Master Antonio. "They are waiting for the priest of Rosada to arrive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We really don't need to worry about time." Kerry Ben said, but I can see that he is a bit hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it's not enough for us to find other outlets," said Master Antonio, who then told his apprentices to prepare a series of very precious and complicated materials. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What are they doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Since it is impossible to ask anything from the living, the lich answers, then only ask from the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——They want to summon Monroe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Fro's priest, if he can't get anything from her, it will be Monroe - calling the priest or the priest's soul is quite dangerous. Things, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I don’t know how your soul will be treated, but the people here, except for the few voters who have been watched by the gods, after they die The soul that has left the body will be expelled to the mourning wasteland in a very short time, that is, the spiritual world we often say, where it is empty and desolate, there is nothing but wind and ash, and the soul gathers there. And scattered, aimless wandering - there are only four ways to get out of there: First, respond to the call from the god of death, Cranmo, and join the long, never-ending team to go to his country for trial. Second, the pursuit of the devil and the devil, they capture the soul as a soldier in food, currency and bloody battles; third, from the main material world, that is, the call of the living world, if the caller is a common mage, maybe he just wants Know some news, if you are a pastor or a priest, you may be able to get a chance to resurrect. Of course, the gray robe can, but that kind of resurrection, you probably won’t like it very much; The call given by the gods they believe in, of course, this is the meaning of some people's existence - the sorcerer's tone at this time reminds the alien souls of Chinese medicine, sour and bitter The disgusting kind of - the shrines of different shrines are different, some are thunderous screams, some are dazzling, some are blooming flowers in the ashes, some are singing people singing. Still others are just a warm drizzle, a faint scent... It is certain that the more devout the faith, the clearer they can feel, and they follow the call and are led to the kingdom of the gods, where Get eternal life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- But the faith of the pastor and the priest must be more pious than the average person, so it is very likely that when you call them they are following the call of the gods to his kingdom - the soul of the opposite world says dryly, if it fails Even if it succeeds...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Hey, that’s really worth looking forward to, isn’t it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Don't be like this, the soul of the outside world persuades that it is not good for us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Antonio Master has a room dedicated to summoning souls, demons, and demons, not only on the ground, but also on the ground, using the Mithril line to outline the perfect ring. On the wall, various symbols and patterns resisting energy and spiritual invasion are drawn. Two rune plates that can generate attack and transmission effects are placed at the touch of the Master. Antonio Master is not the first time to summon the soul, but The alien soul still deliberately pulled up the lich and let him look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Is there any negligence and need to supplement? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——No, the lich is bored and said, except for luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although conventions, the sooner you summon the better, the souls that mourn the wilderness will quickly forget the things that happened before, and for the pastor and the priest, the more The clearer the voices of the gods they served, the more clear, but the Antonio Master carefully conducted a brief meditation. When he left the room of meditation, he drank a little winter wine mixed with snow honey to concentrate. spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry and Craigar wait outside the room for summoning, Antonio has been using it for a long time, when he walks out of the room, the sky has turned Indigo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His state is very bad, in a nutshell, it’s like adding a stone grinder to an old scorpion that already has a weight of hundreds of pounds. That way - Kerry Ben took out a small silver jug ​​from the side, which contained the remaining water in the rune plate after the reconstruction of the maple forest. It was full of life, he poured it full of a cup, Antonio took it and drank a big mouth. And then it is a big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't find Fro's pastor," he said exhaustedly. "There was no Monroe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They sensed the call of the gods so quickly?" Kerry was surprised to ask, Fro's pastor he was not familiar with, but Monroe had contacted once or twice, even if not this time. He is also considered a devout service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suspect that they simply couldn't reach the mourning wasteland -" Antonio Master looked up and wrinkles piled up on the forehead: "I went to mourn the wasteland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is too dangerous!" Kerry blamed, and Antonio Master just returned with a worried smile: "I asked each soul who can still answer questions, and one of them died in the previous turmoil. The white tower residents, but no one has seen them - a devil wants to capture me, the result is caught by me, I asked him the same question, his answer is that I can never find what I want to find. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their soul..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It may be caught or eaten." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's what gray robes can do," Kerry Ben answered, and the whole room fell into an ominous silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't quite understand it," said Kremar. "Anthony Master, you want to summon Fro's pastor, and Monroe, to give The priests of Rosata were charged with the crime - so why not let them, or the coming pastor, pray to Rosada for his help?" He paused, "or there is Tyre." He is the god of justice, and his pastor should be able to give a fair and just answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry and Antonio Master exchanged inquiries, It is like determining who is going to answer this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you mean Yadel," Finally, Kerry has answered, after all, Antonio Master is very tired, "Then they are in the holy pool." The poison that was put into causing madness - no, it was already rejected by Rosada when the dirty creation was brought into the sanctuary - they lost their jobs, they indulged the evil, they gave it a chance, They let the thick fog of filth cover people's minds, obscuring the pure and bright morning light - Rosada will not give them any more response. As we have seen, they can't even give themselves a little treatment. And Rosada’s priest, for the time being, whether or not he is willing to risk the loss of Rosada for the sinners of White Tower, even if he really prayed and received a response, the response will not be For Yadell, there may be more serious punishments -" he said softly: "The gods are sometimes cruel, Kremar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell is the same," said Master Antonio: "The answer he gives must be guilty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-and you don't expect him to tell you Who is planning this behind the scenes, this will not be the work that Tyre should do - the god of conspiracy may be, but praying to him may cause the remaining half of the White Tower to fall into deeper disasters and darkness, It’s not worth the candle, dear, the Lich said, that’s really worth the candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The evidence we are looking for is not for the gods," Kerry continues. "It’s for the people of White Tower. They think it’s Luo. The priest of Saada brewed this bloody bitter wine. If this idea is extended to the judgment seat, they will undoubtedly be executed - we have to prove that they are the same as ordinary people who suffer from madness. It’s the victim, they are dereliction of duty, but at least they don’t have to be forced to bear all the accusations and punishments.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we can’t find Monroe now, and we can’t find it. To the priest of Fro," Antonio Master was kneeling in the seat, as if he had lost his last strength: "If we tell them that the two souls were caught or eaten by the gray robe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is like the apprentice telling the instructor that his scroll job was unfortunately eaten by his dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;——Ask them, the lich suddenly said, if they found the priest of Fro, and from her It was found that people given a bag of gold coins, how they want to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will summon her again," said Master Antonio. "And let her tell the truth in front of everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——People? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our lords, consuls, parliamentarians, and representatives of the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The official is Demon, the Lich said that he is a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who used to think for a while, not long, but very focused - if they just want this, I have a way, he said, But I have to remind you in advance - it is very likely to fail, the result of the failure is very serious, Yadel and others will be executed with a despicable reputation, Antonio Master will completely lose his reputation, status and people to him The trust, the best result of us and Kerry Ben is to escape to the gray ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
