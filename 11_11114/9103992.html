The special hobby is that not every elf can be good at grilling small fish. The half-elves are also: "It tastes delicious and very satisfying," Druid said. "Without the pot, turn the carapace over. It is baked directly on the campfire. It can be filled with sea water and the meat that is removed. It is hot, delicious, sweet, full of juice, and tastes like meat. It is like wheat and fruit. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that such deep-sea crabs will only lie in the trenches, no matter life or death, but ordinary humans, their limit is only three hundred feet, it is impossible to catch If you have to catch this kind of crab, if you must look for opportunities, they may be on the coast or in the belly of a whale. Find one or two claw tips that used to belong to deep sea crabs, or their teeth. This is the part of the whale's stomach that can't be digested. Sometimes it is a whale. He said that some experienced and bold adult whales will hunt this crab. However, if it is not good, if it is attacked by the sea crabs, even if it is a huge whale, the best ending is to escape with the skinned flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So just now he will take the opportunity to kill the deep sea crab. The recipes of the deep sea crabs include all the creatures in the sea. The whales are of course good, the king squid they also do not mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further down, the soul of the outside world understands why the druid does not change into a big whale into the trench. Perhaps it is because for thousands of years, there are whales who use this trench as a cemetery. There are densely packed hunters who eat dying whales. The sleeping sharks in groups, like the deep sea crabs of the sea sand, are like the dense blinds of the branches, the sea snakes, the endless crustaceans and the shrimps, they are in the jungle like whale bones. I roamed slowly, hunted in it, built nests, raised and progeny, and buried here, mixed in white whale bone gravel. Yes, the sea sand here is different from the sea sand elsewhere, like snow particles, crystal clear, Amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many predators seem to be used to eating everything that sinks here, and the Druid needs the help of the caster, otherwise He couldn't concentrate on finding the whale bones they needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alien soul throws a javelin that is condensed with pure power. It runs through the head of a sleeping shark. Its companion immediately tears it apart. It takes only a few breaths. The former hunter will be Swallowed, but before they finished their dinner, the caster waved his finger and cast a spell again, exhaling a breath of intimidation. The cone-shaped invisible threat not only drove away the group of sleeping sharks, but also Drive away a group of twisted sea snakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't this be?" The soul of the outside world curiously touched a bone that was close at hand. This bone can almost make him a bed. It was still very generous, but the king squid that Perant changed was simply waving his wrist and knocking it out of the crack. "This big whale has been seriously injured." Perant said: "We are looking for an older whale whose bones will be tougher, but not severely injured, just because of illness or other causes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Other reasons," the soul of the outside world asked: "Is there a whale that has depression and decided to end life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Yes," Perant said. "I have ever encountered a whale that has been sullen and refusing to eat because of the death of a partner. In fact, this whale was met by Aaron Lend, but Perant I don’t think the black-haired caster would like to hear anything about the Aya elves, he I never asked them to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have dive for a while, and the creatures that appear in front of them are getting more and more eccentric and ugly, and they are more and more embarrassing and powerful. To call them, the squid of the change of Perant began to flash, like a magnificent aurora of change, this is a warning, only the squid containing the venom can emit this kind of light, the soul of the outside world can feel There are a lot less eyes to peep at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This one." Perant suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world directs the fluorite around the perfume that Perant said, just one of them, turning a circle, indeed, this bone is very Beauty, under the fluorite of the fluorite, it is even as crystal clear as jade, knocking up can make a very sweet sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really rooted, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world couldn’t help but look down, although it knew that it might not be able to see anything, but he always felt that his cohabitants were like dogs. Like bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, you can't demand another plane's idiot to understand the eternal pain in the lich's heart. His skeleton is the cleanest, smoothest, most white, and the most toughest and most delicate of all his peers. Perhaps only the bones of his mentor can make him surrender. The problem is the bones of the mentor. Since he became a demigod lich, there is only one left. In terms of quantity, he still won, although this victory cannot Recourse to the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After changing the gravity, it is not so difficult to carry the whale bones. The trouble is to be mixed with this whale bone. The whale bones are separated and moved away. At this time, the squid's wrists play a huge role. Even if the squid's wrist is not as dexterous as the octopus, the length can make up for this strange alien soul to help, now it is against itself. The power is no longer so strange, and every time the blow is accurate, Perant can use his wrist to gently sweep away the broken pieces that fall on the bones of the whale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a headache for them. A group of sea spiders nest in the whale bones they are watching, their spider webs criss-crossing the gap between the whale bones. It’s like someone has dried hundreds of voiles on the whale bones. Not only that, but some spider webs have bundled other shins and whale bones together. Druid tried to pull it and found the spider web. The scope is far beyond what his changing king squid can control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can these spider silks be burned with flames?" asked the soul of the alien world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we are in the deep sea now," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world thinks, "We can give it a try." Doesn't need a real flame, just need a high enough temperature, he takes out a piece Pure gold, then summon the fire element waiter. As he did in Iron Bone City, the melting point of fine gold is the highest of all metals. The extreme high temperature makes the sea around them instantly boil, and the spider silk touched by the fine gold ball melts like ice and snow. All the scenes were slightly shaken, even if the scrolls were isolated from their adverse effects, the scene still made Perant unconsciously roll up his wrists. He didn't want to become a plate of white seafood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creatures hidden in the whale bones rushed out like the tides, big and small, in various shapes, and even a few of them even Perant I have never seen them use a little time to burn the spider silk wrapped around the whale bones. The soul of the outside world will hold the warm golden ball in his hand: "This It’s much cleaner,” it said with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unprecedented," Druid said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Druid's changed king squid extended a long wrist and wrapped one end of the whale bone, when burning the cobweb, the black hair The caster still remembers to leave the part that connects the spine and the chest rib, so that even if the squid Perant is a little smaller than the whale bone, it can also take the whale bone from the depth of the trench with the help of the spell. When the mention was made, the sea sand and the bone dust flew up, and the sea water suddenly became muddy, and they could not even see each other. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time, the clutching of the wrist of Cremari was suddenly tightened, and a wrist was appearing in front of the caster without warning, blocking it. A pair of dirty and poisonous claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can understand the dangers of the deep sea better than the soul of another plane. Even in another plane, the power of science has made mankind the only master of the world, but the deep sea is still a forbidden place that is unpredictable and understandable. From the moment he left the land, he cast a spell to ensure that the enemy's maliciousness was detected within 30 feet, and at the moment when Perant noticed, the black-haired caster threw the fine gold ball out of his hand. Almost immediately, they heard a scream of unfamiliarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sea Ghost," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of sea ghosts lurk in the whale bones, perhaps seeing them enter the deep sea, or perhaps earlier, the sea ghosts who raided the Nanuk people died After that, the sea ghosts hidden under the Aratati ship stole the news. In short, these ugly monsters thought they had found a good opportunity for revenge and predation. They might have come out of the nest, and they could There are twelve that are found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful." Perant said that his wrists have never been loosened, after all, at this time, he can't guarantee that once the caster leaves his brachiopod Or sight, he can still find Kerry's chicks back... At this time, he heard the message from the caster that the soul of the opposite world touched the wrist and the conversation between the companions could not let the sea ghosts When we heard this, they took advantage of it. For example, the gravity that is now suddenly increased not only makes the turbid sea water clear again, but also allows those unprepared sea ghosts to fall straight and uncontrollably, two or three. The sea ghost was directly stabbed on the bone spur of the whale bone because of bad luck, and the dirty mucus and blood suddenly spread in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the sea rush towards them!" Perant said, and then the soul of the outside world clearly felt the wrists tighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darker liquid than the sea ghost's blood suddenly rolled over in the sea, and the soul of the outside world thought for a moment, only to think that the squid could also release the ink to confuse the enemy's sight. This conclusion made him very embarrassed. Hey, he didn't mean to think about which part of the perfume was sprayed from the part of Perant. It may be a bit embarrassing, but its excellent effect completely overwhelmed this slight...incompatibility, they are not only color Deep and rich, it also contains intense toxicity. Even the sea ghosts are also born with numerous abscesses full of diseases and venoms. They are still unable to escape. They hold their throats, their feet are frantically kicking, and the melting eyes are in the sea. The Chinese became bloody, and only a few of the most awkward sea ghosts escaped. They screamed and cursed viciously, and the voice spread far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe we still have to find these sea ghosts before we leave." Perant said: "Otherwise, we must remind Nanuk that they will change the location of the building. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world has a nod, and he does not want the Alati people to suffer revenge from the sea ghosts because of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the whale bones were sent to the shallow sea, the Alatiti people pulled them to the coast, and a hundred strong men immediately began to work hard to complete this difficult The value of the work must pass through the entire Yongyue Sea, reach the sea of ​​the North, and then return here. No strong and huge ship can't do it. Every Alatiti is so cautious and vigilant. They are not only not only careful but also vigilant. I took out the best reindeer deer ribs and took out the rare squid fish gelatin. They also sought the help of the caster because they needed to pull the silk from the black iron that the carriage can provide. Whale bones and seal skins, the shamans of the two tribes pray for the ship once a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will be able to leave here soon," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good thing or bad thing?" Gülen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not very good to say." Leona answered him, yes, I can leave here as soon as possible, reach the sea of ​​the North, and find a metal dragon. Treasures, of course, are the results that they hope to achieve, but they will inevitably encounter more, more dangerous, more difficult obstacles to deal with, and can be expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is their journey, they won’t go back, and they don’t want to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in another place, perhaps one of the enemies they expected, is also preparing to leave for the North Sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
