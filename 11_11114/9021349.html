			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "pig" is holding the loose ship's side of the reed boat, fingers are inserted into the wet plant stalks, and the reed boat is pulled by many feet. Like flying on a water marsh instead of taxiing, the milky white steam mass is left behind by them - the scourge created by the wizard has not fallen on the body of each bipedal phoenix dragon, as seen by the piglet, About one-third of the gnome dragons are alive, but they do not continue to chase the ships, but screaming into the moss and reeds. wWw.しwχS520. coM wants to read them. What is wrong with this? The apprentice with slender legs thinks that it’s not that he is crazy. He wants to continue to deal with this turkey with claws and fangs. It’s just that he has a hunch that they give up the food on the lips. - There must be something that they have to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for his doubts to get the most vivid answer - at this time they were a thousand feet away from there, and the gnome dragon became one Only the small black spots that beating, suddenly a wide wave of water pushed to them, the reed boat was picked up high, the people on the boat screamed, and the "piggy" was almost smashed. He rolled off the side of the ship. Instead, on the deck, which is also bundled by reeds, the fingers and feet are deeply embedded in it, and the face is close to a blood-stained silk cloth, which is a souvenir for the dwarf dragons who jump into the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods are on," the caravan master was pale. "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh." said the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the nerves of the caravan’s owner were already tight enough, he still looked at Kerry Ben with a subtle look after hearing this answer. Of course, he knows what it is. This kind of fish is delicious and tender, and it is one of the common fish on the table. Of course, the civilians can only use the small size of the finger to cook the soup and make it frozen. The fat cockroaches will be given to the royal aristocratic guilds and other powerful people. Some countries even issued decrees from the middle finger to the length of the elbow, which can only be used for the honour of the king and the count - he never Not doing business, but he has a few friends who are doing business, they complained to the owner of the caravan - about the cost. They caught the fat cockroaches but the law was not allowed to sell nearby, but to the distant capitals and castles. In order to prevent these valuable living things from rot on the road, they were forced to hire them. Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the caster willing to do this job?" asked the owner of the caravan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There are always some apprentices who don’t mind having a bit of fish on the coins.” His friend said, “And I don’t need them to fight the dragons. Or the devils, all they have to do is freeze the water. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that those slimy gadgets are really profitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;His friends laughed at the sour slick of the caravan owners, who knows that the latter’s profit on the pyroxene may be ten times that of the scorpion, but who doesn’t want to be complimented, in a whole small bucket of rotted wine Catalyzed. His friend told him that his most proud purchase was a fifteen-foot-long shackle. In order to capture this shackle, he lost nearly ten slaves. However, after he hired the mage to send the donkey to Wangdu, he received a return of 50 acres of vineyards, which can earn 200 gold coins a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King held a grand banquet for him, and he, his wife, children and all relatives shared the roast and boiled with honey salt spices. I am fortunate enough to have a piece of meat." His friend licked his mouth. Satisfied: "It's delicious, really, it's more delicious than any one I've ever eaten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they see it now This cockroach can be exchanged for a vineyard that is as big as the Norman kings of the Highlands. The owner of the caravan thinks that it is about 100 feet upright on the water, but as the elf said. It is indeed a piebald, the triangular head, the narrow fins, the black and yellow spotted epidermis - and the ordinary cockroaches seem to be the same, but the tens of times more than the body is looming in the steam. . It has a dense, fine-toothed mouth, a strangely low-pitched squeak, and the elf can see that the gnome dragon, who was still fleeing around, has curled up. People in the distance also feel dizzy and disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf crushed a few leaves and let the owner of the caravan sniff, he was finally not so uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks..." The car owner said hard: "It seems not very pleasant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is normal," said the elf. "Whoever is sleeping comfortably is not too happy to be boiled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Does it track us?" This is what caravan owners are most worried about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shouldn't." Kerry said: "It doesn't have too much intelligence," he blinked. "There may be gnome dragons who want to inform, but I don't think you can understand their language."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the caravan does not know whether to treat this sentence as a joke or take it seriously. Then he decided to believe the Ranger, at least on the surface, he apologized to Kerry Ben, saying he needed to lie down and take a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf smiled and watched him return to the tent. In the attack, their tents were also damaged, but not very serious. Reuben went on to continue his work - the eyes of the ordinary people allowed him to see more details, and the giant cockroach calmed down after a few breaths, steam and violently burning pyroxes failed to What caused the big nuisance. If a human is caught in boiling water while sleeping, it will be injured, but it is a giant cockroach. Like ordinary cockroaches, it has a thick mucus covering the whole body. These mucus can absorb the damage of swords and arrows, and can also isolate flames and freezes. The invasion, even the role of lightning on it is not so obvious, it can be said that it is a very difficult guy to deal with - perhaps some unreasonable people think that the half of the elves are acting recklessly, but everyone knows that When almost one of the three wizards can be used for real use, in order to preserve the lives of most people, this kind of adventure is allowed and necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet that Canghuangyuan has caused a lot of attention, but it seems like a gnome dragon spread around it with a large number of nuts. Arouse its appetite, it lowers the curvilinear neck, and the marsh water reeds together with the moss grass bite the raw half-baked mature dwarf dragon into the mouth, and start to use its lunch slowly, um, it is possible It is any meal, this is not important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than enough to drag the reed fleet to run until the day turns into a purple-blue color and gradually slows down, Kerry is shouting, using the elf-specific The way to appease them. Let them park the reed boat near several grassy hills that are connected together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extremely far-sighted, more and more grassy hills like this, and the water marsh has become narrow, you can even see sporadic trees. "We are going to the edge of the swamp," said the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can the boat be used?" The owner of the caravan said, while looking at the surroundings with Kerry Ben: "It doesn't matter, just leave the snow covered marsh." At the center, there will be a bird to find us, and my subordinates will prepare the carriage." He turned around. He smiled at the elf and saw that his spirit was much better: "I will let them prepare a few strong warm-blooded horses for you. Brown horses and silver horses, you and your friends will love them, Of course, as well as my previous promise, you can take whatever you want from my goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The horses are good enough." The elf said calmly, he also had Krimaar, and Leona's pocket was filled with gold coins and gems, but maybe you can ask Cremari. Whether he has a lack of casting materials, after all, they may not pass through the city afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the Ranger couldn't help but search for the Master's trace. He found a familiar white robe on the grassy hill, and Crimmar saw him. Was beckoned to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The smell of good fragrance." The owner of the caravan said that he misunderstood the meaning of Kerry Ben: "Oh, sorry, but it is indeed the time for dinner." ,"He says. Because they had to arrange the goods and people before, now it is the night, and in normal times, people have already fallen asleep. Only now they have to meet the empty stomach first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gemstone's fragment powder has been consumed by the Master, the owner of the caravan took out a box of complete pyroxene, and the mercenaries broke it with a hammer. Then use a double-layered pot to cook the food. This double-layer pot is very common in the pockets of mercenaries and travelers. It looks like a belt in a round iron pot with feet. A thin-walled cylinder with a mesh cover. They put the charcoal fire into it, then put the water in the pot and put the food - no need to spend time setting up the stove, the lid will soon boil, and the food will be cooked more time than the ordinary iron pot The cooking time is short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really fragrant," Kerry Ben walked over and said, "What are you cooking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Squid." The soul from another world said that the first picture he jumped out of when he saw the giant cockroach was the squid rice, dark brown, oily, fat squid, The sauce is infiltrated into the crispy epidermis. After spraying the honey, sprinkle with a layer of white sesame seeds, spread over the fluffy and smooth, with a little transparent warm rice, with some refreshing side dishes... Unfortunately, there is no rice here, so It is too lazy to bake, just to cook soup, perhaps because the owner of the caravan has a part of the relationship between the Seris people, he has the ginger sauce and scallions in the sauce, Gland Birdwin, and a few The mercenary got a few squid (fortunately, no one was tempted), not comparable to the giant cockroach, but also reached the standard for the royal family to eat, and Crimmar picked some wild celery. After cooking, the soup is clear, the squid is white, the parsley is green, and the taste is light and delicious, even This can not help the Swiss multi-Helehaoji mouth. (To be continued.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: Thanks to the adults for their rewards and monthly passes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
