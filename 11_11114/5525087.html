			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way back to the foot of the egret, not only Captain Cobbert remained silent, but even the souls of the outside world carefully hid in the depths of the sea. He knows better than anyone else that the hands are not forged. After all, when practicing the cast gesture in the Chaos Sea, the hands are always placed in front of his eyes to make various actions. If there is more knuckles, as long as it is not a scorpion, it will be discovered sooner or later. He just didn't care about this - compared to sharing a body with a lich, multiple knuckles can only be said to be a minor problem. He is not as naive as the lich, so the network casts the whole world, and even opens up the dirtiest and unbearable places of them, so he still knows how to be human. Chestnuts, he knows that it is best not to have done anything now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who were treated with caution were more calm and calm, and the haze of the past did not seem to have any adverse effects, with the permission of Alva, He bought a "medicinal belt and a reel" in the "mystery and flame" that opened in the inner city, as well as a lot of paper and ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sapphire on the magic pendant is about to shine, but the lich who is busy copying the scrolls from the room still doesn’t want to rest. The soul of the alien world had to be knocked on it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Don't bother me, the Lich said dryly, I am preparing for our journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We have not decided to go with Kerry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Yes, he will wrap you in the blanket and hide it in his arms and sing the song back to the gray ridge. The lich is ironic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world caught the face that he did not exist, did not say anything, then the lich smashed him to copy the remaining three spells, he also quietly accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich is content, his performance in the smog lodge has not been applauded but has been of great benefit to his later life - he is in his father's After spending his childhood and youth in the palace, he became an apprentice of the mentor and served and studied in his tower (he didn't lie at this point). During this time, if he said that he and the good people What can be related, must contain blood, cursing and killing; can understand them in depth, or after he becomes undead, the other disciples of the mentor only care about treasures and spells, the Lich is more concerned, he does not Understand why his colleagues would dismiss the enemy's thoughts. Of course, many of the latter's ideas are ridiculous and stupid for them, but they don't mean they can't take advantage of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't it a good opportunity to verify them now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully selected Master Beavis, this little man has not visited many places, but includes the Bibi Dibao, Baita and Gray Ridge. His friends include humans, dwarves, and elves, but they are not deep enough to meet them. At the very least, they are not deep enough to be in touch at any time. They exchange their whereabouts and current situation. The last trace left by him is six months away from the brilliant year. He and Praden’s entangled lich have long heard and understood (the jokes that Praton was chased by a human mage have always been the most delicious snacks at the midnight tea party of the undead); he was sent by the mentor to this knot. It became a stupid thing in the classic legend. In the last battle, only him, Praton and Beavis; he captured the souls of Praton and Beavis, and then swallowed them in time, so he didn't have to worry about who is there. When the spirits wandered, they encountered two words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best part is that Beavis also has a half-elf wife, otherwise he has to compile a father who has deep friendship with Master Bevis to explain Why is Raton taking such a small burden when he is busy with revenge, which will widen the scope of lies, which is very troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately expressed his desire for emotions and the pains of seeking in his words, and sure enough, those people would not pursue his past in detail - a bruise on a whole body The victims are not their style, they even give some soft sympathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that needs to be guarded against is the soul that does not belong here, but fortunately he is still ignorant of the world, ridiculous, he and other People believe in the words of the lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If anyone asks Master Beavis, um, that is your mentor, when the exchange is in the table, the soul of the outside world asks, What should I say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Tell them - he has been suffering. The lich said briefly. They will not continue to ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Cobert stayed at Bibi Dibao for two days, and on the third day, the little bird was about to sail again, and the boat doctor got a small gift— - The jar full of thyme honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship doctor tried to pat the shoulders of Kremar’s shoulders with a high toe: "Good boy," his eyes brightened: "See you next time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish you all the best," said Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shouts of the pilots, as in the past, the little bird has gracefully and agilely crossed the nets and masts made up of numerous sails. The jungle, which happily turns around the sea, turns around and heads south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bibi Dibao has a clean beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the blue sea, the blue sea towers and the city walls, the sand-brown wharf and the breakwater, and even the nearly thousand barges that inhabit the clear waters. So smooth and neat, it is like a row of small toys that have just been brushed and put on several layers of varnish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors returned to or left their ships in groups, and fishermen, pilots and bookkeepers happily greeted and occasionally stopped Come down for a while (if they are just empty), gray skua and black cats squatting on the net, roaring on the brown-brown wooden path, peeing in the bushes; hills and shoals outside the city gather for sale Fish and salted fish, dried shrimps, and some grocers who say things that are unclear, the skin is dark and cracked, and the woman with the drooping Ru room carries a basket filled with oysters, clams and sandworms, and the children are hung. The necklaces and bracelets made of shells ran around, pinching the wildflowers with the sea water, and cast their hopes on every possible customer. They were not careful enough, from people to things, but they were very cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creima took out two copper coins, and changed a basket of wild purple Paphiopedilum with a little girl with a gray-black towel around her waist. The flower has turned yellow because of the erosion of the sea. The caster licks it with the thorns of the velvet, looks down and sniffs, and then slams a violent sneeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This smell," he said, "It’s so weird." The rot of the plant roots is mixed with the fresh scent similar to the mint flavor. It is unbearable than any of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So there is no one here to buy this kind of flower," the elf smiled and said: "A little trick to bully outsiders."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ewww." The caster made a face, but he didn't throw away the flowers and wasn't angry: "But it looks good, right," he said. "I can put It's made into dried flowers...oh, as long as you don't mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I mind?" asked the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because...the elves don’t really like plants or anything? Do you think of zombies when you look at dried flowers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't Alva's room full of fresh, dead bodies?" Kerry said in a serious way, "We still eat their children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Kremar said: "Don't let me think of this, I have seen it." In the stinking and dark alleys of Jiangang, those A small goblin around the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to forget that awkward memory, Kreima removed his gaze from the purple sage, and he saw a large handful of sly colors that could cover his sight. With the navy blue cornflowers, the petals are full, and the leaves are not rolled up by the salt from the evaporation of sea water, with bitter grassy notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the previous success encouraged other children, who have long been accustomed to being surrounded by small business hawkers in the tourist area, who are unwilling to come up with a copper coin Two copper coins were exchanged for the flowers in the children's hands. His basket was quickly piled up, and Kerry's arms were more than two dozen white sea otters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you giving them alms?" asked the Ranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like flowers." Kremar said that he can take out silver coins and gold coins, but outside the city without guards, this is a scourge, one The black bread bought by copper coins is enough for a man to eat all day, this is a real little surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only those who are waiting in the city will buy their flowers," said the Ranger. "The amount you buy is more than 20 women." ..." He showed a ridiculous smile: "They will think that you are a master of love, no doubt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar coughed subtly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines on his gray cloak, the body under the cloak is warm, he squints, feeling happy and relaxed until the last child comes to him . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held a bundle of messy fragrant aconite, holding it, not holding it, because his wrist was bare and empty, he had no double The feet, the whole body, the knees honed on the sand, gave birth to thick cockroaches, and the skin wrapped around the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
