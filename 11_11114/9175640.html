			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are fatKremar said<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" said the white face, rubbing the face of Kremar with his own beard, it has grown to the limit of the leeches, that is, Three feet long and forty pounds heavy, held in the hands of heavy, like a furry weight, all of a sudden settled the heart of the black dragonSurrounded by them are the white-faced family, three small otters and a gentle female otter. The youngest child is a small snow-covered fluff. They are eating around a pile of grilled fish. Specially eaten - these small fish are sea fish, although small, but the belly is full of fat fish seeds, it is particularly crispy to eat<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the banter of Kremar, the white face does not care. When winter comes, even the fish will sleep, like other animals. The otters also need to be filled with rich fat before the snow and ice cover the jungle, otherwise they have to rely on what to spend the long winter - just it does not need to compete with their wives and children for food, compared to them, white face It is a strong and intelligent male otter, with a vast territory from the Elf Wang Ting to the Starlight River - yes, the white face thinks, slips from Kremar's knees, and is confused by the black-haired dragon. Incomprehensible gaze ran into the jungle, shook his nose and sniffed, climbed a towering silver crest, and after hitting a squirrel, put its pine nuts and scorpions, and the wooden fruit (silver crown) The fruits of the wood were taken away, and a large leaf was found (it is reasonable to say that winter should not be so big, so green leaves, but if there is, the otter would not mind), wrap them all, Sandwiched under the forelegs, like a piece of a beloved stone With only three paws ran back to the big friend's side<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kerry went into Wang Ting, he saw this scene, and Kreima had taken off the red that meant evil and blood. The robe, in the red robe, is the white knee robes given by Tyre. In the sun, it shines like a secret silver, and the white face lies on his knees, while the white face The wife and children are busy with their faces, and there are some nuts and their shells scattered around them. The Elf Rangers don’t even want to bother them, destroying this rare warm and peaceful scene, but it’s like bright The orange-colored huts are all about the attraction of a tired, cold and hungry traveler who spends all night in the snow, and they also attract Kerry Ben to walk over to Cremari, he Sit down, then sigh gently, half lying down<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lying down, the Elf Ranger discovered that he was so exhausted - the place where the jungle was burned and felled needed to be refilled, the damage and damage needed for the lock Re-weaving, tree spirits, and elves who return to the knees of Angris need a solemn and sacred farewell ceremony. The orcs, the Grenada, the Deinonychus, and the body of the lion's lion beast need to converge. In order to avoid the plague, the friends of the Druids are released - they will investigate and smell the entire jungle, no one knows the red dragon, the orc priest, the Grenada warlock and the wizard will What are you leaving?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf’s body suddenly became a heavy one, and he opened his eyes slightly, only to see the white face’s flat face that became more and more full with time. Smell the smell of the elf, and immediately sneezed. Kerry had not bathed and changed clothes before. There was still the smell of the orcs when they were burned, and there was a smell that made it uneasy. It turned in the direction. With the butt against Kerry's face, lifted his front paw and called Krymar twice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the smell of a red dragon?" Kremar asked<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry nodded. "If you need anything, you can take it.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said Kremar, after thinking about it, "Gredi will not be unfamiliar with the smell of the child, even if I am taken by In her hand, she will be taken away by her, but I think you can ask Alva, maybe Antonio."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will be happy and go crazy"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar smiled a little. He believed that Master Alva and Antonio Master would make good use of this red dragon. She can be called fate." The gift - even him, and the elves did not think that the trap they set could capture such a large prey, and then they would reach two other red dragons - their greed out of the elves As expected, Perant completed the last spell when the Red Dragon was about to land. What surprised him even more was that the female red dragon should finally be aware of it, but she said nothing but just let herself Brothers bite and devour themselves<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Kerry couldn’t help feeling sad and horrified. This kind of trembling cold and cruelty is the Grenada and the Dragons. Believe and practice, the Ranger has heard about it, but for the first time he saw and heard so clearly, he could not imagine that he would roast a small fish for a otter, and he would be the son of the emigrants outside the city. The moving Krymall will eventually become one of them - the Ranger is delighted that the soul of the Dark Dragon is still pure and straight, but there is no doubt that if he chooses to return to the Red Dragon's lair, this will become him. The most deadly weakness - even if no one notices, his kindness will still make him weak, and in that place, sympathy and compassion are not a derogatory term, and the evil generations of Grenada will only mock him and humiliate. He is always looking for the opportunity to tear him apart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the Star River rises," he heard Kremar said: "I am leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is repressing his impulse:" You haven't even seen the third morning light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't stop again," said Kremar, "I will see red when I go back." Long Gerui, she will have doubts if she delays for too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the jungle gradually becomes weak and the color is dull, in the turbulent starlight river On the side, they held a small farewell party for Kremar. The participants were only Kerry Ben, Kreima, Perant and his wife, Raven, as well as the white face and his family members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar does not appear in front of more elves, except to avoid redundant explanations, but also because he is too special - he still needs Back to Grenada, not letting too many people (even the elves) clearly know that his position is the best, but Kerry has not wanted him to suffer resentful and hateful eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star-light river has a thin ice that has been cut into a circle, and the cold current from the whistling plain still affects here. They grilled the fish. There are some nuts, and Perant even evokes some extra berries. For the Druids, this is almost an anecdote to nature, but there are exceptions to everything, and every Druid must do one. When something might make him lose his life, he can be tasted for the fruit that should not have appeared in this season, because he may never taste it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired dragons open the bones of the scorpion, which is a folded piece of unknown items, and a rune piece, which is Kerry’s from the North The land was taken back, brought back to the jungle, and came to the rune fragments in the hands of Kremar. The blue light shook slightly, like a vibrant heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the Dragon's tooth." Kremar said that she was slightly surprised by Perant and Kerry, they did not find anything on it. The dragon's breath and signs, "Of course, just pieces." Kremar said, then he opened the piece of folded things and stared at the fire for a long time: "This is... dragon scale..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelant bowed his head and quickly converted how big the owner of the dragon scale would be - the biggest scale of the dead red dragon had the size of a shield And this scale, if it is also the biggest, then the dragon with it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does Greed want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her greed can swallow the entire plane," said Kremar. "But the key is indeed this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————————————— ——— ——————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a prince is from the royal girl Leo When Na’s room came out, his face looked like he had just stepped down from the execution desk. The baroness smiled behind the fan. As the leader of the nightingale, she certainly knew why they were so fearful because of Wang Li The child in Oona's room - the relationship between the daughter Li Naina and Birdwin Don Cray has been made public, but for these nobles, the feelings are nothing, but a child is, especially he is a boy, if The daughter Li Naina died unfortunately before she entered into a marriage with other men, so that this child, even if she is born out of wedlock, may become the king of Norman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all their plans to be defeated. Even if not, some stubborn old guys will not allow Birdwin to become the father of the new king, if you say At least he was the lord of Thunderbolt before, and it was the paladin of Tyre. He is now just a fallen man, a despicable person who bears the crime of blasphemy - even if no one is mentioning it now, but it is only for the prince Leo. Na can justifiably retrieve her family name and inheritance rights. I believe that Baldwin is only a victim of conspiracy, probably only those young and naive knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s not the knights that can make a Sir Alex Ferguson, let alone the heirs or sons of Sir Alex Ferguson. They have become the power, authority or other in the hands of Birdwin, especially when Birdwin led them and regained several territories and cities in one fell swoop. He was crowned as a glory by the fallen knight. On the clothes and flags, there are publicly embroidered gray opposing giant bears. The Baroness believes that the sergeants who saw this must have mixed feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
