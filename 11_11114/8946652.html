			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is standing in a corner covered by a curtain, holding his breath, and Kreima makes a gesture, whispering a spell, what? Something landed on the Elf Ranger. He looked up and saw nothing - but he immediately found his cloak turned into a furry gray, like the kind of female and attendant who used to wear it. Made from the large gray squirrel skin on the edge of the forest and in the bushes, the squirrel can grow up to fifteen inches in the head and tail, and has strong fertility, so its fur is not so precious, but at least it is better than rabbits or voles. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloak of the cloak has also changed from the fluorite-filled Mithril pin to the ordinary silver pin, followed by the robe, the elf’s robe is Plain silvery gray, with a metallic texture mixed with spider silk and Mithril, is now turned into a soft burgundy jacquard silk, and the long hair hanging on the shoulders turns into a dark brown and rolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"幻幻?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little tricks." The lich answered, turned Beginning to disguise myself, black hair and black eyes are extremely distinctive features. The undead have not been more hands-on, just to make their colors lighter. "So you look a bit like the Don Cree family." The power of magic slid down like water, and the caster's white robe (also one of the deadly features) turned into a dark blue silk, which is the most aristocratic servant of the kingdom. The two colors chosen for the long time - the caster's staff becomes slender, the surface becomes rough and black, and the eagle claws holding the ruby ​​at the top grow up, wrapping the gems and combining them into a polygonal triangle so that it It looks like a spear that can be seen everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, there is this." The Lich said that he touched Kerry’s double-knife and “Silver Crown” and “Starlight” were swimming. There have been no fewer than a hundred times in the poet's songs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even so," Kerry Ben said: "They will still know who took Bedwin."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about that?" said the Lich: "Is it possible to speculate and think that it can be put on Tyre's balance as evidence? What's more..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf curiously flipped through his weapon, the touch and weight did not change at all, only the vision: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we move fast enough," the former undead said: "In the future, the new king will take him away before the trial of Baldwin in front of everyone - then, in a way, Baldwin is not A sinner, because his crimes have not been conclusively determined, we just took a friend, lest he be grievous and tortured after losing his asylum--as far as I know. Birdwin is deeply influenced by the people. Respect, the latter will believe his words, protect him, support him, not the aristocrats like the king are vying to strip his skin... Hey. A poor man who suffers from nothing, a suffering hero, A sturdy knight, the bard will be able to compile a wonderful story of ten twists and turns, so that no matter what he wants to do later, survive, argue, redeem or play for another country or lord. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that no one will be willing to accept a knight who has lost Tyre." Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not necessarily, the lich said secretly, his tutor’s tower can raise a lot of such cute little ones. "This is also a helpless thing, as a Tyre. The Cavaliers. A single dereliction of duty is enough to make him lose his grace." And as a former undead, the Lich is not optimistic about the relationship between Birdwin and the King, and the appearance of the King can almost make A fire that vomited his soul - only the stupid Tyre knight would turn a blind eye to the various violations - he opened the curtain, and several attendants were hurriedly shouting "old The king is dead, the new king is long lived. While holding a spear through the corridor, and the two maids are mixed in the team, the Lich and Kerry have successfully smeared them without much effort. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After changing several teams in a row, Kerry would have sincerely thanked him for following the advice of Kremar - Wang Ting is in a chaos, attendant There are running out with the female officials, and there are also going inside. The defensive defenses became disorganized by the loss of the principals, and some well-informed aristocrats had managed to enter the court, with their attendants and female officers, and the clever ones vying to see the Duke of John. It is now the new king, and the stupid ones are asking where the Princess Li Naina is. Do they think that the girl can still be the head of a country? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they gave Kerry and the Lich a great help. They were walking in the court, and strange faces were bound to be intercepted and cross-examined, but now . Who can manage who, who is willing to manage who? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There isn’t even a torch in the courtyard, and the innocent scorpio is as clear and deep as the precious obsidian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prison of Wang Ting is an independent tower. The room in the tower is occupied by some noble prisoners. For example, the captives of a battle are not kings or lords, or rich knights. They are waiting for their families. When the ransom is paid, it will be treated with important guests, food, good wine, servants, and the bard will call to play music for them, sing poetry, and occasionally participate in one or two games in the court. The contest of the contest - of course, it will not be Bywin, Princess Leona painted them a rough map, pointing out the three passages under the tower, which lead to more than 20 prisons, she The father decided to take her down a little bit after she determined that she was the heir. The sinner inside was sinful to her father. The most profound impression of Leona was a former lord because she refused. After delivering the knight to the king and taxing, he was convicted as a thief. After five consecutive wars, big and small, he was victorious and put him in jail. He was between the hands and feet, and the short chain made him crawl only. The knees can see the bones, the ten-finger nails roll, like the plant's tentacles, the eyes are covered with white smog, already smashed, but he firmly remembers the smell of the enemy and the voice of the enemy, when the king slowly passes, he With the head and shoulders hitting the iron cage, there is no tooth or tongue in the mouth, it is a dark cave with no bottom, and Leona has done the nightmare that has been swallowed up by this terrible black hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is the best sinner in the entire prison, and Leona can't imagine what it would be like to be a member of Bedwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prison tower is probably the only place in the tower that can now live with the new king. Kerry Ben and Kremar are easy. I found two hidden wizards, no less than three dozen knights and soldiers. As for how exactly Tari is, it is still unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the two casters are not senior mages, and they are not alert enough. After all, New King and Fukai are still waiting for Kerry’s inquiry. And questioning it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meme climbed two steps and wanted to learn more about the outside. message. Her instinct tells her that something is happening - because she was a woman, she was beautiful and beautiful, so she had to get a lot of benefits in all aspects. Taking a chestnut, she walked in instead of being dragged in. Although she was tearful, she did not prevent her from seeing everything she could see. Who knows when it will come in handy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered that after entering the tower, they walked down through a dark door on the ground. The stairs were steep, narrow, and there was no light. They could only look at the light spot at the bottom. Below is a circular cave. There are three passages. The guard asks the knight who brought her to the beauty that is to be sent there. The knight says to the left - when the guard is willing to talk to Mei Mi, she praises her as a rare lucky one. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So I may still be released," Mei Mi asked ignorantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard laughed: "No." He said cruelly: "As long as you get to the bottom, you will not be released. Beauty, you are going to die, but I will only be hanged, I swear that by then I will crush your neck with your knees, so that you will die quickly and without pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mei Mi did not ask how the sinners in the remaining two passages would be, even if they knew they would be tortured. She has never been a person who will paralyze herself. She wants to live and live anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had thought about trying to strangle him to get the key on him after the guard entered her iron cage, but they would not be fascinated when they saw a woman. The idiot. They only come in one person at a time, and the other person locks the door of the cage outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei thought a lot of ways, and ultimately did not help, but she did not give up - there is always a chance. Just see if she can catch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She almost embedded her face in the gap of the iron cage, listening to one ear and listening to the end - the end of the three passages, or the starting point The cave should be a execution room. In the short moment, Mei Mi saw the nail chair, the tongue puller, the iron fork, and the punishment shoes. Flowering pears... There are wooden beds for wooden boots and cat paws. For the first time, she heard the screams of the inmates for the first time, and I feel very familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she heard a name, Byrdwin, oh, the respectable Sir Alex Ferguson, poor Sir Alex Ferguson, not too surprised at this Mei Mi, The vulgar and stupid village woman, called Penny's woman, Fro's priest made her and ruined her. Her husband is Birdwin Don Clay, but since he has fallen to this place, Don Cree should have no surname. It belongs to him again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hybrid ball called the hyena, very lucky, before Mei Mi did not have any face with him, and eagerly enumerated a variety of penalties - even The octopus, who has no brains, can also hear that he has a deep grievance against Birdwin. Now it is good. He finally found a good opportunity to vent and retaliate. His enemies are in front of him, weak and mean, he can do it. I want to know what to do. Mei Mi found the image of the Sir Alex in the memory, wearing a full set of armor, gray eyes and gray hair, burly like a bear standing upright, not a beautiful but unique intangible charm He is not a bad person, just like he treated him with Mei Mei. He knew what Fro's priest was, but he never rudely laughed at his obedience and refused his request. He allowed him to bring Mei Mi, and he insisted on staying in the king instead of following him. After coming to the Thunder Castle, he also let other crickets bring her a hundred gold coins, half threatening to remind her not to hurt the child's heart too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a good person, Mei Mei thinks, but good people are always suffering from sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She almost forgot what she was going to do, and a fierce battle and quarrel woke her up - a man is arguing with the hyena, he is determined not to Agree to the dog to use any penalty - Baldwin has not been confirmed guilty, but the cruel gauntlet or other punishment is reduced to a sinless person, whether it is the Norman Norman law or the law of Tyre is not Allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei heard his voice, she tried hard to think about it, it was a man with one eye, tall, I heard that it was still The Knight of the Duke of John, who was not punishable by the Duke because he failed to complete a certain task, became a low-lying jailer and a good man. He never entered the iron cage of Mei Mi, who tortured her too. When they are bad, they will also hit the iron cage to warn them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that a good man is always unfortunate. After a while, a body was dragged into the prison where Mei Mi was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say?" asked a guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that he was accidentally killed by a sinner," his companion said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" The guard smashed Mei Mei: "Can't it be her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Of course not," his companion said. "The thief would be more appropriate. It is said that he is very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the thief?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the box," the guard’s companion said mysteriously: "Sometimes he turns into a pile of red powder that makes people think he is dead in order to escape - so they Put him in the box and use the lead to cast the gap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if he is in the box, how did he run out to kill a guard? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows, thieves always have his way," the companion said unhappy, because he also found this problem: "Look There is a small lid with a lock on the box that can only allow one hand to stick out. I am ordered to open the lid at regular intervals to see if he is still alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
