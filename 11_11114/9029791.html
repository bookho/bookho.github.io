			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anything like Drake that people don’t want to recall, it’s no wonder that he used the magic character to escape to the port of Point, or was the Sea Monster. The owner grabbed and brought back the ship's things - the owner of the Sea Devil is about thirty years old, full and strong half-orc female, with dark skin, prominent chin, wide nose, and two lips that are turned out. Tooth decay, she has the power of extraordinary humans (including men), demonic treacherous, vulture-like keenness, and the fire of desire that can not be extinguished even with the water of the entire ocean, she is against Dray Ke can be said to be a damn love at first sight. More than once, he gave a bright or dark invitation to the owner of the Golden Lady, but they were all rid of by Drake. This time he even chose to escape. I thought that the owner of the beautiful sea magic, such as Fro, was thunderous. Before Drake had found his helpers and servants, he was caught. After the Lord of the Azores came out, he was able to use him. Body weight of yellow He redeemed himself body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This loss is not too big, because in just a few days, Drake was worn under the big ass of the buttocks. Ten pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an uncompromising shame for Drake, and it is precisely because of this that he hates Gülen who will bring this evil, though He has reached an agreement with Gülen because of his greed, but if he knows that the seemingly harmless "traveler" is actually a caster, then he will not catch the attention of this guy, or it will be even more Be cautious, instead of rushing to take him on board, let his mage appear in front of them without a trace of precaution, so that the black caster casts a spell when they have no chance to resist. Poor bingo, his death is worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out the gold-plated triangular sword. Put it on Gülen's shoulder and cut off a small piece of his meat. "I should cut off one of your hands," Drake said. "Or or dig out when the thief is screaming." One of your eyes, but the new king of Norman in the Highlands gave a reward that could not be refused and could not be neglected. I remember you killed his son? I don't want him to lose a little because of it. His little fun and deduct some rewards, one hundred gold coins, ten gold coins, no, one gold coin can not be less, Gülen, although you are a bunch of stinking garbage, but I don't want to lose any more because of you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted Gülen’s cheek with a sword tip and turned to another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello. Dear caster." Drake said, "You should inform me of this glory in advance, so that misunderstandings between us will be much less, or impossible."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So now?" asked the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a little late," Drake said. "Remember that you put my mage, the poor worm called bingo, directly into the tip. What do I say when I am in the port of Hong Kong, I beg you to stay as my mage, I promise you that you can get a commission of 1% per transaction. Don't feel less, dear. You I don't know how big the sale I made. There are also your spellcasting materials and other things you want to use, as well as food, wine, women... Maybe after a long time, you can have a spacious and bright, Decorating the gorgeous mansion,” Drake gently tapped his palm with the sword of the triangular sword: “But you refused.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just because he refused, he also threw bingo into the water. When Drake took him up, he regretted that his mage had already walked on the way to the mourning of the wasteland, and had to throw him back and see that without him, Drake would not lose him. Master on board. Nor will it be unfortunate that a group of damn big fish will not be able to fight back and fight effectively, and those big fish will not ruin his ship. He will not fall into the sea after running away with the rune coat of arms. In the hands of the mistress's hostess, oh, stop, don't think about it anymore, this is not worth repeating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did have a bad mold because of this dark-haired half-evil mage, and he also let go of all the goods on his boat, including one with the same black hair. Elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to know, the caster," Drake said: "There is no name on the list of rewards given by the new king of Norman Norman. There is no dear Ranger, let alone the noble lady, but I think that the loving uncle will be willing to spend a small sum of money to pick up his niece, but you...and Kerry Ben? Oh, yes," He suddenly said: "You, the son of the silver crown jungle, the genus of Angris, the believer of Su Lun, the great ranger, you also have a reward, and your father... Of course, if he If you don't want to pay some price for his only child, the orc priests will be very happy to get a noble sacrifice like you...the gods are on, you are also quite valuable."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks like now," he touched his hat with his hilt and smiled mocking at Kremar: "You are the least valuable one - - But there was a lord on the Longhuo Island who ordered a black-haired elf from me. Originally this The transaction can be completed a few years ago, if not for you - perhaps this is called who is paying the debt and who pays back, although you have a pair of pointed ears, but you still have your hands, half-elves, I think I can at least get it Half of the money, what do you say? Fortunately, the generous owner does not care about the gender of the goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drake Captain, Kreima is my people." Kerry whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he owes me!" Drake replied loudly, waving a three-sided sword and slamming it at the elf's waistline. - The triangular sword is mostly used for thorns, not for slashing and slashing. The sword ribs are not very sharp and cannot penetrate the shirt with the silk and the silver silk, but even so, it still makes Kerry a painful and dull voice. Short shouting: "You are also, Ranger! I can remember that you have found a lot of trouble for me! Believe me, if your father can't get the satisfaction that makes me satisfied, your end is not better than your family!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you," Drake turned suddenly and faced the lich again: "You must be very proud, isn't it? A caster, a From the blood and talent, the guy who is born to be superior, but the same, a spell, a sharp needle piercing your head, can turn you into an idiot! You will have nothing, and your mind will live as a plaything. One day, one month, one year... Dear, until someone thinks you are doing Food is more suitable than plaything, ha, you. You, you! will eventually become a pile of dirty and poisonous feces! Even the most hungry and thirsty dogs will not smell the kind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is staring at the black hair caster, his mouth is rising because of the sweet reverie, and he hopes to see the black pearl-like eyes revealing the most common Fear and cringe, but he couldn't find anything, just like the first time he saw him in a confusing blunt pub, only the endless indifference and coldness in his eyes, which is more than a scornful disdain. The owner of the number is angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the guild's mage, so far. He hasn't been able to find a satisfied mage. The guild's mage is rented by him. They have also cooperated before. Today, Mrs. Gold appeared here just wanting to see if there is a ship coming out of Bitumburg to the Longhuo Islands, or It doesn't matter the opposite. Drake lost a lot of money. His money emptiness is like having a nick hole, so he doesn't mind doing looting these days, but he I did not expect that I would have gone so lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember you have a scroll." He said to the mage of the public, "Use it. Shorten his head, do a deal in advance, we all Can feel at ease - maybe the buyer will be moved by our service, not too much care about the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guild's mage grin, he is the most Like to ruin his kind, especially those who are self-righteous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his finger into his pocket. But before he found the reel, he suddenly jumped out of the deck and nervously looked at a place. Drake stunned from where he was gazing, letting his guards surround him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremors in the air. A blue spot extends to the sides and then down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transportation," Drake said. He now has a little regret that he did not immediately sail, so the portal will not be opened directly on his boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage of the public nodded. He took a reel from the dimension belt and the reel was certainly not used on Kremar. He concentrates on ensuring that no matter who appears in the portal, he will be immediately annihilated in evil energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks so, and he does it, the evil energy is shining from his eyes to the stalwart figure that has not completely separated from the portal, but then The fluffy, hot, white flame came on the scene, burning his eyes—the mage that was sent was also prepared, and the power was stronger than the wizard of the thieves’ guild. The guild’s mage screamed screamingly, mentioning one Only the arm held back and the eye was receding. The other hand couldn't be forced to pull out another reel, but before he smashed it, a fierce flame pistol flew him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alva Master of Bibi Dibao has unfortunately looked at the place where the water column rises. It seems that the Master of the Thieves Guild also has protective runes. Heraldry or armor, otherwise he should become a skewer before falling into the water, instead of escaping so quickly and wisely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the black-haired caster, and he gracefully performed a mage ceremony, given that Cremari has made many heroic acts worthy of praise and praise. He can't treat this dark-haired child as a normal junior: "The magical star shines on you, dear Cremari, and I am very happy to see you again... though," he made a gesture. , eliminating the magic of the sticky ball: "It is on a ship belonging to a despicable pirate and slave trader."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magical star never dissipates." The lich replied: "And your magic is still so powerful and impeccable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe because there is a relationship that a little guy is willing to help me. Alva said kindly, he reached out his arm, and a small flame exploded from his large robe sleeves and jumped over the shoulders of the Lich, constantly rubbing his cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
