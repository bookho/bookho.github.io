			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black-haired dragon, and the people around him are moving fast. Someone may remember that the first enemy that Krimerar faced when he accompanied the Red Dragon, the owner of a walled city, a powerful mage, his death was unusually boring and ridiculous, not even so consistent. People describe him - probably because he has faced only a mortal and low-powered kind of person for a long time, so the image and temperament are as strong as the yeast-like dough. But when he realized that he was facing an unmatched enemy, the fragility and despicableness hidden in his heart was immediately exposed. He did not even think of fighting, but chose to abandon his subordinates directly. Party feathers, with the wealth that has been gathered for more than a decade, escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s ridiculous, if he is not escaping, at least not the first time to rush to escape, so if he is alone in the prison under the tower, he may not So easily murdered by members of the Dragonbush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their mission has some minor relationship with this wizard - the red dragon's scroll needs to be handed over to an old mage living in the dying spirit The dying spirit is a place that is both weak and dirty. The dry swamp stands with black slender trees, and the vines are wrapped around the branches. There is almost no output except peat, but it is The former owner of the Walled City, the territory of the Grand Duke of the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong got up very early, as the owner of a duchy, he never needed to leave warm and soft before the morning light had covered his small country. The bed, but not today, his master told him that there will be a team of Grenada (and one of his distinguished His Royal Highness) to enter his country to do something. Of course, the Greinada people did not ask them to greet, but think about it, the three legions of Grenada have cleared a flat and straight road in the country surrounding the country of the Red Dragon - on this road All the countries and territories no longer exist. Except for Tilan, they have not even left the royal family and their people. The fields have become wilderness, the city has become ruins, and the documents of history have been turned into ashes in the flames. This is the most complete demise. Without a hundred years, they will never be remembered. Only the records of the temple and the sanctuary may be able to find only words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when those cruel and ruthless Grenada people come here, can he still expect these guys to be as respectful as real knights? Come to see him as a grandfather? No, let him come. His Principality is fortunately not a hindrance to the people of Grenada. If this is the case, then let it and him silently continue to do a humble dust in the red dragon’s field of vision. Anyway, his brother, he has learned how to bow to a caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the child?" Before leaving the room, he whispered to his wife, and now she is the only one to believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s already in the sanctuary in Rosada.” Dagong’s wife said that in those countries that were ruined, if anyone else got rescued Then only those civilians and nobles who have gone to the temple and the sanctuary, the priests who serve the gods, especially those dressed in white robes, put all the people into the sanctuary as much as possible, although only It’s better than nothing, just... “I heard that the priest of Rosada was expelled by followers of Gredith,” said Dagong. “If possible... think of a way to send to Siennos. Go to the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will do it right away." Dagong’s wife said that she is not beautiful, but she loves her husband with sincerity. So her eyes are filled with worry and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing," said Dagong: "I will prepare anything that will satisfy any of the casters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But these people are not just the caster, Dagong’s wife is not so concerned about the outside world, her focus is on her husband and children, but she also heard that the Grenada people even took the mount For human beings, gold coins and gems cannot calm down their innate arrogance and cruelty, just as humans see a monkey who will give fruit to them and will not regard it as a kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how worried the woman as the wife of Dagong, Dagong still stood in the cold wind at dawn, in order to avoid the Grenada people thinking that he was malicious or It was the subject of the problem. The ministers and knights behind him solved their weapons and armor, wore gorgeous velvet robes, and tried to make a stupid and harmless look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
