			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's words: The elves in this book are in fact very kind... as the two creatures that pursue idealization and perfection, get along with them— - In the short term, you will feel that they are very good and tolerant, long-term... you will know that it is actually just a subtle way of alienation, especially for idiots who have to deal with and are not obedient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves had to deal with the disobedient idiot sitting in her In the room, the wedding of the lord should have been held in her main fort, but Demon believes that the white tower after a riot needs more comfort. The contest, juggling, jealousy, and free wine can make the people of White Tower forget the terrible night as soon as possible, and come out of the grief of losing their loved ones. He does not need a group of useless people who are indulging in grief and fear all the time. The trade of the elves has stopped for more than a month, and Demon’s request to meet the manager of the Grey Ridge, Elster Perant, has been rejected several times, although the reasons for the latter are not sufficient - the gray ridges that have been attacked by orcs and giants. It also needs to be trimmed, but it still makes him feel humiliated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants and lawmakers don’t care much about this. They are like a flea grouping together and whispering whispers - they are the elves in Demon’s mouth. They are dissatisfied with the inaction, but they are more concerned with all the fine gold secret silver of the elves, the benefits of the golden lead, the golden honey maple jelly, the gold coins that flow like the starlight, the privilege and strength. In the outside world, in order to obtain a dagger of fine gold, a long sword of fine gold, a bottle of winter honey, a box of maple sugar and a knight and a mage who are willing to condescend to serve the merchants are not in the minority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They presented gifts to Demon, more expensive than once, but Demon is not as happy as the first time he received an expensive gift, he knows He is paying for these gifts. They are silent reminders and tangible shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming the excitement and novelty of the White Tower owner is gone, the only thing left is fatigue and frustration, and then the anger of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vented this anger to the servants, subordinates, and Anzhen of the bureaucracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essence’s request will be rejected, she will not be allowed to leave the room, nor will she be allowed to speak to someone other than a personal maid - but She didn't know what to say with her personal maid. Her favorite and brave maid was beaten, raped and cut off her tongue by Demon. He did not allow her to summon the priest. As a result, they could only use cold water to cool the fever victims, remove and grind pearls and corals. Give her a stoppage and let her contain a garnet to promote healing as soon as possible. Thanks to the god of life, Angris, she survived, only because her tongue was cut too deep. After she recovered, her lower lip was inflated and turned outwards like a half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon let her go to the kitchen to work because he didn't want to see such an ugly monster beside his wife. The maid obeyed the order silently and humbly. When she left, she kissed the skirt of the ampoule, and the ampoule Only holding her hand tightly - she felt that she had done something wrong for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahn’s supply is still top, and all kinds of extravagant gifts are constantly changing. Before dinner, Demon sent her according to custom. The clothes to be worn at the wedding, this dress may be worth a year's tax on the White Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat alone in front of this dress, since the incident, she did not allow her maid to appear beside her, she told Demon is because of embarrassment, it is ridiculous that Demon actually believes it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she heard a very light laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first she will be frightened, but as it appears more frequently, she will not even speed up her heartbeat: "You don't go Serve your master? Asmodeos?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil appeared in the shadows, it put away his tail and wings, look Going up is a furry black ball, pretty cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ann saw it killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Demon doesn't like to see me appear in front of others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? An Zhen said, pointing out her long, snowy fingers and indicating that it was sitting in front of her and sitting on her wedding dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not someone else," Asmodois said bluntly: "You are my mistress." It moved quickly, Ann I have to think about it before I know that it is awkward - after all, it seems that just a ball rolled forward slightly and returned to its original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have what you want." An Zhen knows that Demon is feeding the little devil with a soul jewel. The blood of the elf is in her The body is tumbling, making her want to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have," Asmodeos said happily, sticking out his tongue and greedily licking the pain and remorse of the ampoule. "Dear hostess, you have," it said softly. "Wait, I will ask you for it, in the future; but from now on, you can consider what I can give you." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bard sings as he walks out of the tent in Bydwin. He sings the braveness of Baldwin and sings his kindness. Sing his selflessness and justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because his song clearly mentions the name of Bedwin and his Frederiksborg, Birdwin politely stopped to say goodbye to Kerry. Ben and Kremar's footsteps, I would like to invite them to listen together - it is a strangely dressed bard, wearing a brown tunic and a belt woven from countless knotted small ropes. Under the coat is black leggings and a pair of bronze boots with a pair of copper boots. The reason why he dresses is strange because he is wrapped in a brown turban that is generally used by women, and his hair and eyebrows are strictly hidden. Up and down, the forehead and the two squats and the lower jaw are hanged with silver coins and head ornaments and ornaments. Black and white ostrich feathers are inserted on both sides of the headwear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything he sings is related to Baldwin, from his ordinary origins, his outstanding talents, his loyal heart, to his keen mind and his refusal. Exhausted courage, and every battle that must end in victory... He describes them with a thick and powerful baritone with irresistible charm, but no matter what the verses and tones can be said to be simple Wuhua, but it is in the mind of Baldwin, because Kreima heard that Baldwin was telling him that he had taken the scorpion of gold coins from his tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the blind man brought it, Baldwin changed his mind, because the bard was mimicking the tone of the Tyre Knight companion to ask him: "Bedwin, give me a sword...Bedwin, give me a helmet...Bedwin, give me a horse..." This was originally just a bard added to the atmosphere of the battlefield. The episode, but this undoubtedly gave Birdwin a good inspiration. He briefly apologized to his guests, letting him drop the scorpion, put on his armor, put on his helmet and neck, and pick up his wide sword and The spear, jumping on the horse, galloped and challenged a knight in the enemy camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is over very fast, not every knight has the courage. As for Bydwin’s previous opponent, he was generally brazen, and Tyre’s knight won back. A whole set of equipment, and a horse, they were all given to the bard with ostrich feathers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really a real windfall," Kerry Ben teased him and said: "It seems that the poets' manuals have You can add one more to your verse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am doing this." Birdwin said honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bard who received a lot of rewards stood in the depths of the land, and the expression was as always, that is, not as good as people To be so ecstatic, his eyes are dark brown, like two white cheeks with deep dark circles, pale, but the lips are as black and black as solid blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may also want to express his thanks to Birdwin, but just then, a commander in a red velvet coat rides a spotted horse. Entering the contest, it conveys the intention of the owner of the White Tower and the Hill Hill. The lord and the White Tower's governor are about to come to this place to personally observe the fearless manners of the knights and give the color of the contest. Victory Knight - An enchanted Mithril chain that automatically resizes to fit the wearer and keeps the wearer's body temperature constant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This award is not expensive, but Baldwin just made a face with a lack of glory, as the owner of the Thunder, the king’s minister, the elves The ally and a near-invincible knight, armor has never been what he lacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahn and Demon appeared side by side in front of the White Tower people, people cheered and threw flowers at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonderful thing is that both of them who are satisfied with the ambition have a snack, and Demon stunned a bunch of lily of the valley flowers on his black robe. , grasped the hand of An Zhen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen docilely let his hand be caught and hurts, this pain is even more unbearable than the clothes on her body, according to Demon Said that this piece of clothing that can be worth a year in the White Tower is from the countries of the South, where the aristocrats are tired of box-like robes and gowns, and their women prefer to better show their identity and body. Costumes - silk long underwear, all the way to the feet, the hem is wide, but the cuffs are tight, round or square neckline, revealing part of the chest, a variety of ribbons around the waist, the end of the ribbon is hanging with pearls, and then here The outside of the garment is covered with a shawl velvet long coat with a wide leather waist. The sleeves are suddenly widened and widened from the elbows. The tail is enough to kiss the ground. The sleeves and hem are all delicately embroidered. Drag out nearly six feet and use gems as buttons and embellishments. Matching it is the two hairpins and the double-corner hats fixed on both sides of the head by the gold wire net. The shadow of the cap tip is more than the back of the back, and the tips are as thin as each. The spun yarn of the flap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
