			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow of the goddess, the eyes are closed, and even the most sensitive voters around her have never felt the same, but in another distant country of God The conspiracy god, Shrek’s pale and thin face, was rarely covered with a strange blush. His fingers were constantly scratching on the armrests of the white bone seat. The soft and smooth eyes on the armrests stunned the conspiracy. The sharp claws of the gods - these are all dug out of human eyes that have been humiliated or mortal, although most of them are just doing their duty, like arresting his guards and trying him. The consul, but these reasons are completely untenable in the heart of this evil god. He imprisoned their souls in these unbroken eyes, and every time they squeeze and scratch them will make them miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet...Quiet..." Sirrick muttered, this is only the first step, although from the chaotic god Aliman, he is not as good as possible Attention has been stole some power - after all, there is the sacred country of his servant descendant Afra, but it is precisely to avoid the attention of Ariman, he dare not take too much, the power of different natures Turning in his body, being assimilated by his filthy divine power, the conspiracy god is painful and relieved, especially when he recalls the god of morning light Rosada and the god of justice and justice, Terre twisted and deformed Gesture - Chirac immediately summoned the god of the thief, Mask, and his beloved voters and messengers, and told them to go to the main material plane, letting the whispers like the mouse whisper in the shadows, let people produce Panic means showing them the true face of those sad false god priests - even if they are exposed, when these pastors and voters pray for magic, they will open more channels to the abyss for Aliman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are about to win, our master...is the god of chaos Ariman..." Herick said: "This world was born in chaos and will also Ended in chaos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of conspiracy sits on his throne, and the body sometimes breaks down into countless black worms, sometimes turned into swampy mud, some places It always keeps human appearance, so it seems that he is even more terrible than zombies or jealousy. Although everyone is bowing down the ladder, he knows that every one, no matter what they are, including Mask, is in Anxiously waiting for his weakness and mistakes, there is no loyal soul here, only a group of ignorant dogs, and he is their leader, and Herick’s smile in the palm of his hand, he tastes humanity. The sorrow and pain, as well as the frustration and anxiety of the subordinates, "Go," he said: "The world belongs to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———— ————————————————— ------------ <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Wolf consider yourself lucky, previously, is now, after perhaps will be so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had his own lord, but as the war spread, his lord died, and the new lord announced that all the former congregations would become his slaves. Wolf certainly knows what the slave is. He thought about it for a long time and boldly went to the gloomy canyon. When the first time he saw the black tower standing quietly in the canyon, people were terrified, even though they I don't know if it's a lich's tower, but it's still clear how the caster sees the mortal, tools, animals, or sacrifices. The powerful caster can't even fear the army and the king. And they were just some peasants, but after a while, Wolf and his son did not wait for the spellcaster's messenger (soliciting taxes and servants), and there was no sudden death or illness. The tower was like a stone. Standing there has no effect on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wofu’s wife and son are resolutely opposed, and Wolf said: “I am old, my son already has a son, maybe,” he said. A long-lived grandson who looks like a little calf: "They will soon have their own son, then," he pointed to the group of little dolls: "Are you willing? The wife, let them be in the shackles Branding, and the children they gave birth are the same, all beings are enslaved? Do you remember how Joe died? He died very badly, the mouth on his neck can be stuffed into a pot, but he used to be a live flogging Two slaves died, one with children, and hung there, hanging on the tree, dear, I watched the fetus fall from her legs to the ground, the woman’s screams are now I echoed in my ear, so I insisted on not buying slaves and not using them. They are humans - but we are going to be slaves now, and our children will suffer such crimes." His words clearly made two The daughter-in-law who is pregnant is shivering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can escape." His second son whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Useless," said Wolf's wife. "There are knights and servants outside the village. They have horses, hounds and sword armor. And... We don't have food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he wants to do that, he can do that in the morning." Wolf said that their village is far from the center of the territory, that is, the castle. Although the land is not so barren, but the production is general, the lord does not pay much attention to it. This is why the slave riot was successful, and if the caster wanted it, their lord should not refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we have nothing to give him..." Wolff’s wife yelled: "He will be willing to serve us..." It is said that these casters are Very arrogant, even the king may not be able to hire them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have no other way," Wolf said. "Try it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In this village, Wolf, among the few remaining people, the oldest male, naturally became the leader of the people, and the people tacitly covered him, and he was alone, carrying the parcel to the village. Outside, the soldiers who supervised their soldiers just glanced at them and ignored them. His wife, son and grandson were still in the village. A strong old man, but the old man who had to be grayed out was not worth paying attention to. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf walked toward the canyon like this. He had a secret and didn’t tell anyone. Just in the winter, their family was almost because of a calf. When he was forced to die, the black man who gave him a gold coin with his baby, it was not the last time they met. In fact, Wolf had seen him twice, and Wolf didn’t know how he was so bold at the time—but he always felt that the other person didn’t seem as irritable as the legendary caster, evil, Wolf had seen By the time he held the child in the sun, the vines rose from the ground and tangled into their chairs. The...the expression of the adult was very soft, and Wolf didn’t know if he was discovered—he I quickly walked away, not out of fear, but did not want to disturb them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf is a lucky person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a subordinate of Cremal, nor is it a person like Gülen or Kerry who can completely ignore the dark jungle damage, ghosts, zombies, Monsters, even those that are distorted, can take his life. In other words, the last one is more capable of causing the most terrible trauma in silence – when the devil wanders in the main material plane, the power they carry and dissipate can lead to hallucinations, stimulate desires and weaken reason – Sali Although he is only a half-devil, his father is the three-level master of Grazt. When he can't control the power, the overflowing power is enough to corrupt the surrounding trees - they are intelligent. At the same time, it became evil. Fortunately, Wolf met Saul before he was eaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This noble caster responded to his request as Wolf hoped, and the village was sheltered by Kremar, and then the name There is no landlord, but there is no harsh taxation and heavy labor land, attracting more people - in another plane, people will be willing to be adjacent to the snake tiger because they evade taxes, where people choose Hiding in the shadow of an undead, even if they tremble every night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more and more refugees flooded into this narrow and barren territory, the people around Wolf began to feel uneasy, and they even formed a team, thinking To prevent others from entering the territory of Kremar, but not successful, he was severely stopped by Wolf. He now has extraordinary authority in the village, except for the shelter he seeks for the village. There is also a private opinion that he may have become the master of the evil mage, even his wife does not dare to sleep next to him - Wolf does not care, he did not receive too much education, but has Talented and alert, and unparalleled courage, people think they have crossed the most sinister gully, but Wolf feels that this is just the frost before the arrival of the winter. For those outsiders, he said: "Since the lord of the lord allowed them to enter here, it shows that they have obtained his permission and his people. In this case, no one has the power to expel them." I paused for a moment and saw their thoughts from the faces of these people: "If you think that whoever comes here first, whoever becomes a servant of the master, can obtain a special identity and be treated differently, then that is big. Wrong and wrong, our host is a powerful mage. They are neither keen nor good at rule, so if there is a problem, he will not spend precious time to judge your right or wrong, only to us, they will be together Go out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wofu’s words were quickly confirmed, some people were expelled, and the villagers of Wolf’s fear that this narrow territory The problem of not being able to support so many people is solved by the wisdom and magic of the casters and the help of the Singer elves. Then they got a news that was worth celebrating, that is, the Emperor of France officially sealed the land to their owners. But even Wolff did not find that the news brought not only glory and benefits, but also wrapped in danger, like honey wrapped in poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
