			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to Fenway, Ill, this guide can be more competent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the most needed for the black hair caster? Not a job, not a map, but food and shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have described before, the warehouse in Jiangan Port is shell concrete, and the buildings in the port are almost half-timbered and semi-soil; Most of the houses in the dykes are stone, only a small number of wooden houses, and the emigrants living outside the city are abandoned tents and small sheds woven by palm leaves; the white towers are similar to the Bibi dikes, or other places. The building is roughly the same, the serfs rely on the low huts of mud and grass to get a breath, while the slaves are only able to cover the caves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are the first stranger to come to Gray Ridge, you may be confused, because you can't find the location of the "grey ridge" - - There are no piers, no temples, no neat houses, no clear roads, only countless, towering giant trees, vines hanging like curtains, tangled with wrong roots and deep in every step The layer of rot that is trapped in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but as long as someone is willing to lead you, or if you are looking sharp and willing to always carry your head, then you may find a clue: the residents of the Grey Ridge Hanging his home in a height of about 30 to 50 feet, the material used is a silver-gray wood, almost no metal and stone, and the room is tightly attached to the body surrounding the giant tree. The circular open-air corridor and the spire-like wide-brimmed roof are of varying heights and are connected to each other by a narrow suspension bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar’s residence is one of the smaller, only five rooms, which makes the Lich satisfied that one of the rooms is completely enclosed, only fluoride Stone lighting, and a room with four windows inlaid with colorless glass, even if the sunlight needs to shine through the layers of leaves, it can maintain enough brightness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This house was built in the imitation of Fenway's residence," Il said. "Almost the same as it is. You are also a mage, I miss you." The demand will not be far from him.” She shook her head slightly: “He should bring you here first, not to see how to make maple sugar.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Obviously, he has his own plan, the Lich said in his heart - whether it is Jianjian Port or Bituminburg or somewhere else, except for the gray ridge, the status of the person who can see the magical galaxy is Excellent and transcendental, even an apprentice can be respected and enshrined with sincerity, and here, the so-called leader is rude and contemptuous to let a mage do something that should be done by servants and slaves. If you stand here today, there is no other picture of Kreima (this Fenway is not wrong), but another caster, he will not hesitate to choose to leave - in this case, Fen Why should Wei care about his shelter? It’s just a waste of time. Already. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some empty room in the room. After all, there was only one Craigar, only the bed, the hanger and the storage box, but the box was covered with beautiful copper horns, and the bed was covered with fur, down and silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the others, Fenway does not lie, there is no transaction in Gray Ridge, there is only exchange, or you can collect the production yourself - for example, Crema I need a beveled desk to copy the scrolls. He can go to the edge of the silver-crowned jungle to search for decaying or collapsed trees (this is the first step), or you can take something that might be of interest to others. Here, there are many skilled elves and half-elves. A beveled table is just a little pastime for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitchen should be used for cooking. The kitchen is complete. Of course, there is no stove. The silver cans are filled with blue-black glass texture powder. A strange mineral called pyroxene, which releases a lot of heat when it hits the fine water and hits the water. If you want to cook a pot of hot tea for four to five people, you only need fingertips. A big one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ir’s cook a pot of tea, add three pieces of maple sugar, and a piece of bread she carries with them, they are in Cremari In the new room, I had a lunch that couldn't be simple but delicious, mixed with inquiries and answers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray Ridge is monotonous and boring in Fenway’s mouth, but in Il’s mouth, it becomes much more lovely, in terms of work – The most important job of Gray Ridge is to set up an initial and most important line of defense for the Silver Crown jungle. However, this work is not likely to be handed over to Kremar for the time being. He is not familiar with the gray ridge, and the gray ridge is not familiar with him. As for the other The work can only be said to be an embellishment or a hobby - you can even do nothing, as long as you have nothing to want. If you want to do it, then in addition to making maple sugar, you can also try to domesticate the big silver belly spiders, get the silk from them, the silk woven shirts can even match the leather, and even the druids Can wear; you can try to make wine, yes, there is no pub in Grey Ridge, but if your room is filled with sweet wine, then there will soon be elves and half-elves holding all kinds of things to you. Exchange... If you are a caster and you are more willing to use your talents to improve your life, then you can also try to make reels and potions, treat potions, protect, repair, and supply energy other than flames. The patrol personnel are welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every night, when the magical galaxy is hovering in the air, they will dance in the riverbank and the glade, staring at the moonlight and moonlight, singing in a low voice; In the rain or the heavy rain, they will meet in a larger wooden house, drink tea, taste honey, exchange anecdotes and jokes, and listen to the descriptions of rangers, druids and visitors (very rare). With the guidance, be prepared for your future travel and forever leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, forever, the elders and humans have mixed ages and humans, and their lives are two to three times that of their lives. After adulthood, they served for 60 years in Gray Ridge, and there is still a long life waiting for them to go. Deliberately profligate, but it is not a gray ridge, and Grey Ridge will even refuse to re-enter them. Although Kremar is not a descendant of the Singer Elves, he has not grown up in the Grey Ridge, but the shelter provided to him by Gray Ridge is also only Sixty years - although he does not need that long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many years has Fenway Master been in service?" The black-haired caster suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fifty years." Il said, a calm expression with a touch of incomprehensible sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway stood in his room, standing in front of the reading stand, An open spell book leans against a silver-gray plate. He puts his finger on it, and the words inside squirm, tangled, decomposed, and combined into another arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fluorite white light illuminates the book, and Fenway’s face makes his face look like a rock, lacking vitality, too big brown The green robes swayed on his prominent shoulder blade. He had recently lost a lot of weight. He should go to the companion who is good at sewing to change the size of the clothes, but he didn't notice this at all. His fingers pressed on the treacherous texts, hunger and thirst. Read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a pair of hands are gently placed on his shoulder, I can imagine how horrified the wizard is, he almost screams and stabs the dagger into the person behind him. The heart, or release the most deadly spell in memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar touch stopped a tragedy, he closed the spell book, turned around, and looked at the uninvited guest with a faint anger and disapproval . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should know how dangerous it is to suddenly appear behind a wizard, Ilva." He groaned, hoarse, dry and sharp, sounds like It is the snake that threatens and the spider crawls on the leaves. Ilby frowned, this voice reminded her of the grotesque sounds of her long-lasting life that made her feel terrified, mostly from an evil red robe or gray robe, evil spells, cold The negative energy, the sulphur and the flame, the tremor and tear that are engraved in the depths of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
