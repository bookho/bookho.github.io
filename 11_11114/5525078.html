			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zhengbei, whale!" shouted the loyal watchman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? A shadow-like blue-gray back is rising from the water, with a white spot on it, a spear-like spur To the sky, this is the largest narwhal ever seen by sailors. It swims right in the direction of the little bird and hundreds of feet, and makes a long, loud tweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? With this scream, the killer whales and whales left the crew and the little bird who were frightened by their tossing and swam in the south-south direction. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? "Do you think they want to eat the narwhal?" In the gradual shaking, a crew member asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? "I think the narwhal summoned them." The object he asked was affirmative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???Whales and killer whales quickly crossed the lonely narwhal, but the little killer whale that almost ruined the main mast was still The hovering around (the white patches on the cheeks are like the artificial blackbirds on the sides of the cheeks on the cheeks), it finds the same interesting new stuff - the mage's gray leather cloak falls into the sea It tops it with the nose and fiddles it with the pectoral fins. When it wants to take a bite, the narwhal swims over it and whistle calls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???The little killer whale quickly gave up the leather cloak and drilled under its colorful belly. The narwhal dive down and wait for it to float again. It swims side by side with the little bird, the spiral-shaped, long-gray, long-angled tip of the house's support column that is holding the leather cloak that is soaked in water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? "Wokin bless," the sailor couldn't help but say, "How many wine glasses can this long angle make?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? "Don't be stupid," said the captain. "Obviously, it was a druid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?? A crew member who is good at lassos helped the mage retrieve the leather cloak. The narwhal looked at the little bird with a meaningful look. Take a nap and talk about the non-stop little killer whale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? "What does it call for these whales?" The previous crew continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???"Meal meal?" His companion guessed that the sudden incidents had cost them a lot of energy, he missed the cook's vinegar and pickled Meat and eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???"Use it yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???The face of his companion suddenly changes It’s very weird. Fortunately, this misunderstanding was quickly solved, and the lookout of the Little Birds found the Lady of the Gold on the sea 50 miles away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???The beautiful four-masted ship was struggling, surrounded by layers of sharks, dolphins and whales. Lifting the waves, lifting the hull, biting the rudder, disturbing the navigation of the ship, the performance is very orderly, polite, careful not to let humans shoot and stone bombs hit themselves - there is a dolphins broken boat The stab wound, it immediately swam away, a 20-foot-long thresher shark immediately filled it up and bit it into pieces as the paddle hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? There are also several narwhals in the inside, but the biggest one is the one they have seen, it should be, it is using that huge sharp The corner punctures the vessel not below the sea surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? "Hey," the captain shook his head. "It’s awful, the narwhal’s horns can be pierced with ice.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? "It’s weird," he added, "What about Drake's Master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? ?? In the bottom of the sea in the port of Jianli, the captain's passenger said in his heart, while walking through nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? "Do you want to slow down? Captain?" The first officer hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? "I think they should be able to hold on for a while," said the captain of the small bird, but hesitated a bit, "Let the section slow down." "He lifted the brass telescope and looked around. When he saw a dark hull, the main mast and the sails were all painted in white, the boat quickly became easy. "It's the Sea Monster, Drake's old acquaintance. OK, we can go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? As for Drake, do you want to be the same horrible woman who is insatiable in bed or on the boat... Well, rescue..., it’s not something that anyone on the little bird can and will care about. It’s gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???The whales and sharks quietly dive into the water and disappear without a trace. Except for the scarred hull of Lady Huang, nothing can prove that they have appeared. Over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? "The narwhal is still there." The squad of the little bird whispered: "It’s too dangerous. There are three metal ratchets on the sea magic. The rifle, it will be pierced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? "Wait a minute." The captain said that he closely followed the people and the fish. Every move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???The waters under the scorching sun show pure and innocent grandmother green, wavy transparent like crystal or air, constantly changing the shadow of color and shape Like a bird, it floats lightly and quickly. Five pairs of wrists full of suckers climb the keel of the Golden Lady. The razor-like shells and thorns on the keel do not affect it. It is so soft and So tough, so huge, a single wrist can cover the elegant and beautiful lady - the crew on the Golden Lady did not realize that the real disaster is coming - a squid with only the length of the human arm Can you easily bite the crab's tongs, which is almost the same as the half-length of the Golden Lady's squid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???The value of the Lady’s Lady is not only reflected in its bow image, but also to prevent shells and seawater from colliding with reefs and fish. Erosion, it has a layer of lead on the outer shell below the waterline, and there is a layer of tarred canvas between the lead and the board, but they are not stronger than the egg shell under the squat of the red thorn squid. a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???The little bird is unable to see how the sea is frantically pouring into the cabin, tearing the ribs and the bulkheads of the ship, and not hearing the ankles. How the paddlers fixed in the seat are desperately barking and asking for help, but they can see the squid's wrists reach into the interior of the vessel and grab its food from inside, just like the child will snack from the candy jar. Putting the fists full, there is a person on each wrist of the red thorns, including those who are forcibly pulled from the ankles, the feet are bloody, the paddlers are covered, and the soldiers wielding weapons ——The gold-plated triangular sword can easily pierce the chain armor and the ** it protects, but it can't effectively damage the octopus's tough and smooth tentacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? The clever red thorns of the king squid are not too nostalgic. This wooden box filled with small pieces of meat, it catches enough, that is, ten people, relax the muscles, slide down from the golden lady, dive Back to the deep sea it is familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???and the narwhal has long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? At this time, the Sea Monster is not close to the Golden Lady, and a purple dot appears suddenly in the Golden Lady. On the deck, after a short magic flash, he disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???"Drake escaped." Captain Naughty of the Little Birds couldn’t help but say, "There will be people who are very disappointed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???"The Sea Devil will light his crew," said the chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? "It’s a problem, but Drake will solve it." The captain said: "We can finally eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???The whale brought trouble to the little bird, the captain and the crew did not bother to sit down to eat, even their guests only had a butter and bacon. Baked potatoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;???Bake potatoes are very simple, but the potatoes were just bought from the port of Mind, the cook added a lot of butter and bacon, and generously incorporated A little honey, the sailors did not have so many ingredients, but they were very happy to eat, the Master walked among them, happily found that they had been entrenched among them, and the vague atmosphere had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??? In addition to the yellow-eyed crew, it seems that no one knows that he has lifted a killer whale that almost hit the front, but many people have seen him. How did he catch the yellow eyes and tied him to an apple bucket? They thanked him for saving their friends and turning this gratitude into a kind smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Because the computer has a problem, the articles are all sent by the mobile phone, so I can’t give a reply in the book review area for the past two days. I hope that everyone will forgive me. stand by! thank you very much! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the adults for their fists! Hug old friends, new friends! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five doctors reward 100 starting points<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
