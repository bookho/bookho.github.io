Followers, especially the priests of gods who are unlikely to be Red Dragon ally - they are used for a wide range of purposes, as a sacrifice, as a currency for transactions, or as a venting person. Of course, there are also some chic guys who try to persecute or seduce a devout priest or a paladin. It is said that such merits are worthy of being recorded on human paper even in the bottomless abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The succubus Ferrer Hill listened at the side, she has no objection to the content, but I don't know why, the tone of this powerful gray robe always makes She couldn't help but think of her summoner. I remember that the day before he left Grenada, he told the attendants to prepare dinner. So, please take some lamb, you can steam, or you can cook soup. Or add the Seris sauce and knead it, or pick it up and marinate it with honey until it is cooked well...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Obviously," Gray Robe said: "Kelsey prefers the latter two, the previous two ways of using, you, I mean, that It is not important that the unfortunate prey has its own will.He said, while lazily crossing his fingers into the shape of a minaret, the wide sleeves of the robes slipped off the elbows, revealing the tights inside, and the glittering satin made Yadel slightly a little distracted - it was not only the calamus ( It's the kind of pink and gray color, and there is a whole row of innocent stone buttons carved into olive shape. Yadel certainly knows that the silky texture of the tights sleeves and neckline are buttons, otherwise smooth fabric I can't get close to the body as people want, but he only feels that his eyes are about to lose their original function by the hard rock and the sly color.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to look at the blue-black wall, but there were still countless light spots on it, and the priest of Rosada had to helplessly drop his eyes.Of course, he can also go to see the succubus. The color of the demon lady from the bottomless abyss is biased towards cold and dark. The problem is that because of the bad hobby of the gray robe, he offered a piece to Felix Hill. Light gold robes, Ferry Hill seems to like it too, maybe in addition to color, it has a role that others can't know, for example, the succubus looks like a glamor when wearing it. Human female, different from human beings - gray-blue skin color, pale curly hair and erected glutinous rice are hidden, even when she stretches her feet, it is also a pair of feet with toes and nails<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if possible, is black more suitable for an abyssal creature? Or cobalt blue, navy, even the deep red used by the priests and warlocks of Greedy is much better than the current color. As a follower of the god of morning light, Yadel is very fond of symbolizing the approximation of the morning sun. In the transparent pale gold, but he absolutely can not accept the vulgar pale gold of this moment in piapiapia, he must admit that he once had the impulse to drill into the room that Crimmar entrusted to him to find a piece that can make him a little A surging alternative - the dark-haired dragon has piled up a lot of useless gifts, many of which have enchanted robes, but for Kremar, there is nothing better than what he got in the astral world. Pieces of knee-length white robes are better, so they can only be sorrowful along with the mummies of the Mercer lizard - but this is just a fleeting idea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dragon thorn, dragon claw and dragon tooth are all part of the grid Reid's, but they are biased," Gray said. "Under Gree, Dragon's teeth are infinitely inclined to the new king, and the dragon claws... well, at least on the surface, their knights In accordance with Kylemen’s orders, as for the Dragon Thorns, Ostal’s great-grandmother was the maid of the Red Dragon Gredi. It can be said that except for the royal family, these four maids are the highest among all the dragons.Her descendants, Austal, although talented, "Gray robe out of the heart of the commentary, after all, in his cognition, in this plane, there are only a few existences can be called talent outstanding Of course, he must humbly admit that he happens to be one of them - "general" can already be said to be a good evaluation, to know that even among the gods, there is no one who is said to be an idiot. Two: "But he obviously understands and chooses his own future - he is not struggling in the Warlock Tower, trying to rise to even one step, but out of the Grenada, in people's ridicule Working with businessmen and thieves - but he did a great job, the priest, the dragon thorns have existed for a long time, but in the end it was Ostal, not it made Austal"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In essence, Austal is more like a thief or a businessman than a warlock.""It's like his youngest disciple, even though they all have the blood of the dragon, the acceptance is also the guidance of the warlock, and it is also a warlock, but one eventually becomes a businessman with a warlock name, and the other It became the robes and became the lich. This is the path that the stubborn fate set for them. It is not transferable and vague: "So, Aostal and its dragon thorns can serve any one, or Let any one go to death, they sway dangerously between the new king and his red dragon wife - under the watchful eye of Grein," Gray robes said with enthusiasm: "You have to admit, Yadel, before him. It’s not so bad, some ideas are also novel.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray robe smiled at him, not revealing the shame and regret of others' scars: "Do you know why he came to you at this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because Kremar is not here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because Kelmen is not here, her mother is also, Red Dragon Gree is not there." "The gray robe arbitrarily said something that would make most of the Grenada people feel terrified - Kelmen is not a big deal. Although the red dragon is tricky, it is not impossible to perfuse. The key lies in Greedy. The trace of this respectable woman has always been hidden and undetectable. All those who dare to do so are not rebellious or enemies, even her red dragon children, or especially her children, even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new king was tired of his two children long ago, perhaps because of his relationship with them who had a warm expectation - Kay When Ermen and Kelsey were born, they had the characteristics of dragons, scales, erects, and wings. Everyone thought they would be the most powerful dragons, but it was a pity, perhaps because of blood. In the near relationship, they have nothing to praise from strength to wisdom... they can survive only because the new king and the red dragon daughter don't want to be in bed again under the orders of Greet."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then they think about it now?" Ferry Hillman said, her voice trembled and reverberated in the room, Yadell secretly took a few deep breaths, and the gray robe turned Overdone, blinked at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not," said the Lich: "It’s just that the new king has no patience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Patience?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gredi is putting on the last pieces of the puzzle," Gray said. "In this process, everything has nothing to do with it." Things will be ignored and compromised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the end? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" At that time," Gray Robe said: "Maybe there will be a big change, great, not only Grenada, this plane, or Yes..." He didn't go on, but looked at the succubus, the succubus sat obliquely on the chair in an elegant and beautiful gesture - there are always countless whispers in the bottomless abyss, he can't guarantee Lord Grazite didn't hear anything, no, maybe he heard more than Red Dragon Greedy or other demons, the devil, so Ferry Hill will appear in this place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you just want to solve this thing, it will become very simple, whether it is gray robe or Ferry Hill, you can make this crazy The daughter of the Red Dragon is quiet forever, but the death of Kelsey is a symbol, a new king asks the collateral delivered by Kremar - if Yadel is just an ordinary, fallen pastor, Kremar's a subordinate or a slave, he won’t even hear a word, but even if he tells everyone Kreima is just his master - oh, such a bad lie is still not to be said in front of these people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know that he is Crimdale A friend, knowing that Crimal will not turn a blind eye to him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I refuse? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think Ostar will do? Gray robes said: "He will say, okay, unfortunately, I am going to find someone else." can you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gredi and the new king are full of interest in the project, but they don't care about slaves." "If you are afraid... don't deny it, this is the normal mood of human beings," said the succubus, softly. "I will avoid it when I get hurt, and I will cringe when I see death... I think this is very It’s unusual, and it’s a little cute. You don't need to be ashamed of this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will look at you. "Grey robe said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel is not afraid of pain and death, if so he will not come to Grenada - he did it first This decision was then accepted by the Elf Kerry Ben, or Kerry would not ask an innocent good man to fall into the poisonous mud for his own sake, but what does it mean to look at him in gray robes? He thought In the gray robe, I look at the succubus Ferrer Hill. In any case, although the succubus is not in line with people's imagination, her charm value is still unquestionably high, and it also has the general succubus. The enormous power that can't be possessed, even if it is not for its own sake, it is just willing to pay a price for it to get a powerful tool.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
