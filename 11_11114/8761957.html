			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cause?" The manager of Gray Ridge looked at her. "What do you want us to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lord with half of the elf blood in the body said nothing, but her eyes and expressions have unfolded her innocent and childish ideas in front of the manager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue eyes of the manager inevitably reveal a disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pelante adults..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anzhen," the manager said, tone and Not harsh, but the girl flinched: "We never accept threats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a sword to be a threat," said Gray's manager, Elf Perant, who gently said that the nominal owner of White Tower lowered his eyes shyly: "What about Antonio Master? You have Didn't ask him for advice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Sorry," Ann said in a low voice: "I..." She was so upset and stuttered Say, while playing with his fingers: "I forgot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf sighed distressedly, even in the human way, the ampoule only At the age of 19, if she is converted according to the age of the elf, she can say that she is still a baby, and it is only three years before she becomes a lord. Perant doubts whether they should resolutely refuse. The proposal of the lord--he loved his wife madly, and this love reached its peak after the unfortunate death of the mother of Anzhen, and extended to their only child - based on a narrow idea of ​​human beings, he I believe that wealth and power can become the crown of the little daughter and become her sword. He insists that Anzhen, who has only half of human blood, be his heir, inheriting a large piece including Baita and Lushan. Territory, according to the laws of their principality, the heirs are indeed feasible, but the other half of the ampoule has made some old-fashioned diehards sick... and he has a brother-in-law who has three sons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last brother who took over as the lord first gave a concession. He respected and loved his brother. For this reason, he voluntarily gave up his inheritance and asked for his own and his descendants. The white tower, this request is not excessive. After his brother left the world, he obeyed his promise, supported Anzhen as the new lord, and sent his eldest son to work for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant has heard that the upright and strong young man admires the peace, although their blood is similar, but if necessary, re-integrating the inheritance of the split in this way is also a good result - even if it is The elf who is not interested in the game of the world's rights can also see that Anzhen is not suitable for being a ruler. She has always been protected by her father. She has a weak personality, a simple mind, and holds a lot of things. Of course, you can't say that she is malicious, but some things she does are more hurtful than swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the idea that has not been exported, or more correctly, requires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahn said that as long as it is given once, it is a few unpaid and generous gifts that can transform the thoughts and positions of the White Tower people, but Perant knows this. It is not feasible at all. The Druid has been in the upper reaches of the mainland for nearly half a century before becoming the manager of the Grey Ridge. He has both his friends and his enemies; he knows their thoughts and understands their behavior. He knows that after suffering a major trauma, for human beings, too unbalanced charity will only attract more jealousy and greed. If they don't get what they deserve, those secret dissatisfaction and complaints. It will soon turn into anger and hatred without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the White Tower also has a Demon Master who has won the hearts of the people. Perant met the child. He was the most like father of the three sons. Like his father, he was alert and alienated to the elves - and as the priests of Rosada thought, he could count Don't be a tolerant person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be said that the spell book that almost ruined the entire gray ridge and the jungle was handed over to Fenway, although his initial request was Destroy it, but the manager of Gray Ridge thinks that this thing is not as simple as it seems - Fenway is a child with a personality and a whisper, but to go to that step, saying that no one is pushing Peran behind I will never believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do?" An Zhen asked sadly, but this sentence is more like what she said to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back," Gray Ridge’s manager said: "In any case, since Demon has inherited his father’s rights, he should also do his best. The duty of the courtier, you should go back to Baita, accept his allegiance, soothe the people, and annihilate the thieves--I hope that our old friend Antonio Master is safe and sound, if it is, he will be a big boost," he thought a little For a while: "... Gray Ridge can give assistance to Baita, but after you have determined that it will not cause more disaster, let Antonio contact me as soon as possible. I need to talk to him about the situation of Baita. Talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought he would get a response soon, but it wasn't the case. Anzhen was silent and just looked at his toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An芮?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I not leave?" she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a little while, Perant thought that his ears were hurt by insensitivity during the battle, or that they were hallucinating because they were too tired, but Anzhen was not so kind, she followed: "I want to stay in the Grey Ridge," she said eagerly: "I can stay in the Grey Ridge," she said more quickly, the more she said, the more confident: "I am A half-elf, I am only 19 years old, and my mother and my father are dead. I have this right. I am willing to serve for sixty years for Gray Ridge, let me stay," her eyes flashed brightly. And the moving light, reaching out to grab the perfume of Perant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the elf of the elders picked up his eyes. "But you are more than just a half-elf!" He stepped back and broke her Finger: "You are still the master of this land!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to be the lord," An Zhen said bluntly: "It makes me bored and let I am afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So who do you want to give this responsibility to?" Perant: "Demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the rules of law and convention," Anzhen grimaced with his hands: "It seems to be." She is not very smart, but also knows that Demon will only use the entire white tower. Push to the opposite side of the Grey Ridge and the Silver Crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you think of having to go back and face the people who look at her with suspicion, face the questions of nobles, parliamentarians, guild leaders, businessmen, and deal with them. When it became a document that seemed to never be processed, she became frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant looked at her, this mere half of the time in this world, the half-elves are so delicate and delicate, her hair is linen Like his father, but it is softer and denser than him, with obvious curls, the length is almost up to the heel, the rich face is small, can be lifted with one palm, a pair of gentle blue eyes, This is similar to her mother, but without the firmness and courage of her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father loves an elf. He is willing to give everything he has to the child born to the elf, but he does not like other elves to contact his wife and daughter, especially Perant. He occasionally visits once. When she is a partner and a friend, she can always see her husband’s hand on the hilt of his waist. His hatred can be said to be bright and unobtrusive, and he is not allowed to be arrogant about his life and family... After insisting that his daughter, who has half of the elf's blood, be his heir, Perant thought that he would raise a human being—a changeable, ambitious human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been worried about this, but now, he feels that it is better to face a versatile, ambitious human! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very least, she won’t suddenly want to leave everything behind, and walk away from home! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected silence made Anzhen flustered, she didn’t think she had anything wrong with her – she was really tired of her previous life, she liked it Gray Ridge, here is the same person as her, she can find her own happiness here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to the White Tower," After a longer period of thinking, the manager of the Gray Ridge instructed: "Let it regain calm -" He didn't look at Amway's eyes. He knew what would be loaded in it: "And protect Yadel, your uncle's only blood except Demon, trying to elute his charges - since you don't want to continue to take your possession Responsibility, then at least, you can leave a straight and credible new owner to the White Tower and the land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kerry found Kremar, he was carefully polishing a small piece of chess, and Il's chart was still there, but the pieces were much less, but fortunately they They are all silver crested wood. It is not difficult to find the same raw materials and polish them. Only Kreima finds that his craft is completely inferior to Ilva. Ill can be carved on a chess piece that is only the size of a cherry core. Fish and birds, the scales of the fish and the feathers of the birds are clearly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the pieces placed on the chart, some have patterns, while others are bare, seem pitiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the chart of Ilva," said Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Ian’s dagger." Kremar nodded and said that he saw the dagger hanging in the waist of Kerry Ben, Iraq. Erzhen used it to cut the fruit and eat it for Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
