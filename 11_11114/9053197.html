After getting Drake, she is no longer interested in this male human. After all, compared with the half-orc, the human male can only say that it is both stagnant and small. It’s better than nothing. Now, there are two uncontested orcs who are with her. It is said that the orcs in the Wuthering Plain were almost completely annihilated in the battle with Thunderbolt a while ago. The two orc tribes are very poor, but Fortunately, they were too poor, and they couldn't even get too much gold, so they couldn't get the curse that had been cursed for thousands of years from the warlock. Most of the young men in the tribe survived. If it weren't for the tribes they wanted to take the opportunity to rob Gersh after the war, they could be one of the tribes that couldn't be underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two orcs are the two small fish that Gesh leaked when cleaning the tribe. They are not high in the tribe, their strength is not strong, and there is no honor and no name. No. This has become their advantage. At least no one on the way to escape has deliberately chased them. But in the human kingdom, they are the most powerful fighters, but the sea monsters are almost like them. Tall and powerful, although she has half of human blood, but these lines are used in her mind, even if compared to humans, she can be considered smart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when she saw Drake being hurt by Ruiyi’s spell, she just smiled indifferently and turned back to her cabin. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea devil's cabin is very wide, with almost no furniture inside, just covered with fur of various beasts, from small copper coins, black and bright moles to the skin After the expansion, the giant white bears that are enough to accommodate an orc have their skins, and the furs are not well treated, exudes a fleshy rancid smell, and is the favorite taste of the orcs; the corner of the room There are several wooden boxes in the middle, including poor crates and exquisite ebony boxes, and an orc strode over half a room. Leaning over a box, insert the finger directly into the gap of the wooden strip, pull it open, and the wooden strips creak. Reluctantly broken with rusty nails, revealing the golden wicks inside, the wick grass is a bit moist, giving birth to red bugs, and the orcs quickly grab a few of them. Putting it in your mouth is like chewing a sesame with humans. The box is full of blood red wine, but from the fresh blood stains on the box, its source is not reasonable and legal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another orc found a white cup from the pile of fur, saying that it was white, because its cup holder was silver, but the cup was yellow and even slightly cracked. The cup was as big as a dish, inlaid with Phnom Penh, and the shape of the cup is a little weird - it comes from the skull of a sea lover, if Drake is not a favorite child of the Azores. His end is not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who saw the red dragonfly?" The sea demon asked, lying comfortably in the pile of fur, taking over the glass of the male orc. Accepting their more diligent service - this is unlikely in the Orc tribe. The males in the orcs have supreme status, and the female orcs are only a little better than the old orcs and slaves, but they are recruited by the sea monsters. Into his own ship and room, he has already used fists and swords to teach them the "sea magic". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why there is." A male orc said that his lingua franca is still very raw, but the sea monster ordered them to do so. She only allowed them to speak the orc language when he allowed it, such as when there was something that did not want her crew to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea devil swears that this sentence is spoken in the language of the orc, similar to the fact that someone is erected on a charcoal fire and slowly baked. of. She climbed up from the fur, and the movement was light and agile, just like the dark green skin filled with air, but the two male orcs were clear and there was no muscle. The muscles inside were like steel casting. Whether they are jealous of them or when they "use" them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out!" said the Sea Devil, and threw the cup on one of the orcs' faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two male orcs stood up in a panic. I wanted to give way to the sea magic, but one of them was kicked by the sea magic. One of them was kneeling on the ground and mourned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companion did not forget his companion when he greedily sucked the liquid on his cheeks, not because they had any robes between them. Love, but the command of the sea devil has always been without discounts. The orcs who stay here are hard to escape, but it is an unforgivable fault to leave him here. He can be said to be grinding. The companion who curled up together pulled out the room of the sea demon, and deliberately let his head hit the wall and the door along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At other times, this kind of trick is not a whip, but she doesn’t have much fun now, she’s from her own I took out a reel in the bag and opened it. This reel does not contain any powerful offensive or protective spells, but it is the most important and indispensable part of the pirate career of the sea magic for decades. One of the treasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the scroll is opened, a gray-yellow mermaid paper is presented in front of the sea demon. The paper has a fine curved pattern, which is the trace left after the scale is removed, except that there is neither text nor graphics on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea devil took a piece of palm-sized fluorite from the pocket of the second, and the whole room became bright and bright in an instant, and the female orc was unhappy. Rubbing his eyes, bowing his head, and reading a spell, the curse is very mouthful and lengthy like the leggings of the soldiers, but the sea devil still remembers it very clearly, and when he reads it, it is also loud and clear, in her After reading the spell, a black dot appeared on the paper. The sea devil used his canine to bite his right thumb and then pressed the thumb on the black spot. At about the same time, the sea magic felt a sharp tingling. I know that there are not many things that can make her feel this way. She has a cold sweat on her back. The sea monster always suspects that the black spot is not only her blood, but also part of her vitality. It comes from A warlock of demonic bloodlines, this already illustrates the danger it must exist, but before finding its alternative, the sea demon can not give it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She continued to wait for a while, the paper gradually changed, showing mossy green patches, black shadows and red dots, the sea magic immediately smashed up Look carefully and don't miss any of the same places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the soul of the opposite world is standing here. It would have thought that it had returned to the original plane. Anyway, what it saw was really like a computer version of Google Maps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale sapphire blue is seawater, while the mossy green plaque is the island. Black is the reef and the shoal, the red dots are the bloody humans and humanoids, and the whales, a white slender little point is slowly crossing the south side of the side island, the sea magic did not care about it. Because that represents the cold-blooded fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the sea devil sees most of the side islands, as well as some of the surrounding seas, this living sea icon shows only within five hundred miles The place is farther away from its ability. Although the sea magic has always wanted a wider range, it is always better to deal with the warlock less once, but temporarily, this chart is for her. It is said to be very precious. How many fat prey and how many fine nets escaped by the "Sea Devil" with this chart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea devil searches along the side of the island, and there are no moving red dots on it. In addition to the "Golden Lady" which is very close to the "Sea Devil", the red dot is everywhere on the side island. In some places, the red dot is dense like a nautical chart with a few ominous red eyes. These are slaves. And it is the kind of extremely cheap slave, the sea devil licked his mouth, it seems that "Red Dragonfly" really can not join the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the Sea Devil feel very unpleasant. In her original vision, "Red Dragonfly" is the best shield for exploring and using the wizard's spells. Who can she let her go now? Drake is free. He is an incompetent and timid idiot, and he does not have to be wary of Sulon's followers. Didn't he see that he actually got a warlock from Baita? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warlock with dragon blood, although the composition of dragon blood is not so pure. But the sea magic can feel it, her orc blood is boiling and wants to compete with one, while her human blood is shaking and wanting to surrender, although the final master is the sea magic itself, but her decision is far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the caster deal with the caster, this is the best start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning. It’s not over. The sea demon is hesitant, and she tries to convince herself that she lacks “red dragonfly”. It’s no big deal. She can discuss with Drake and take some of them from their hands to solve this little trouble. If it is the warlock. It’s better to be willing to shoot in advance, she is even willing to give up some compensation for this, but her tailbone is pumping pain, not because of injury or anything else - her tailbone was hit by a wizard's spell, and later It healed, but occasionally it hurts for no reason, and after each pain, the sea demon will find himself provoked a big trouble that should not be provoked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time the tailbone pain was after she got Drake’s little beauty, so she was after the messenger of the Azores’ female grandfather boarded the “Sea Devil”. He did not hesitate to ask for the equivalent of Drake's equivalent weight of gold coins and let him go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea devil squats, rolls the reel again, puts it into a silver reel, throws it into the pocket, and takes out a huge red spine. The stone hung around the neck, and the back of the spinel was engraved with a rune, and a spell contained in it was sent back to the Sea Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, she originally wanted to let the "Sea Devil" stop at her place, and now she changed her mind, "Sea Devil" is still the distance side The island is a little better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei was gently awake by Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous escape life allowed Fro's pastor to develop a lot of good habits. For example, when she was sleeping, she was awake for no reason. She would neither refuse to get up nor yell and yell. She almost immediately took a breath, slipped on the toes of the silk on the tip of her toes, and she didn't even find her own gold slippers in the faintly lit tent, but she was red fruit. When her feet touched the ground, she almost cried out. She quickly covered her lips with her own hands. I don’t know when the cold water came up from the ground, and Mei Mei felt that the water had already It’s almost going to her foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a high tide? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey immediately vetoed the idea, there are few knowledgeable people among Pastor Fro, but she still knows at least that it will not rise in the middle of the night, maybe Is it dawn now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course no, their landing is not a complete cave. Half of the "nail" belongs to the sky, and Kremar is the master. He The tent is naturally inside, and the plum and other people’s tents are outside, but now Mei Mi can still see the magical star river, which is only slightly skewed to the west, but not yet completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swallowed a sip of her mouth and began to pray silently, praying that her god would once again bring her strength, courage and unparalleled good fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guran looks to the black-haired caster, the light in the cave is weak, but he, Kerry Ben and Cremari can see each other, the thieves did A few gestures, "What?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy." The Master also used the silence to "say." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he continued to "say": "A lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief subconsciously watched the cave Outside the place, the tide slaps the reef and makes a burst of regular roar. In addition, the surroundings are still a peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Gülen believes in Kremar, although this guy sometimes makes people feel that he is a little idiotic or crazy, but choose one from the people around him, Gülen Still willing to stand next to the black haircaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
