The old woman said: "Even if you steal a piece of bread, you will be hanged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black-footed people seem to want to escape, but although they are exempt from torture, they are still tied up, their bare feet are black and squatting on the ground, making dusty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Lev made two steps back under the support of the maid: "Of course," she said, "I can forgive you," she smiled at Perant. "In any case, you helped me find my lost gold and silverware. Compared to them, a little salt and fish don't matter, but unfortunately I can't use fish to entertain you, those are Very good seven, making the fish jelly extremely delicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just passed here," Perant said: "Although quite affectionate, but We still have a long way to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is because there is a long way ahead," said Mrs. Lev, of course: "So Take a good rest - even if you are accompanying me, this is a wife who can sleep at any time. We have not seen travellers or bards for a long time, even businessmen are not willing to come, perhaps because they Knowing that we are already poor here, there is nothing that is worthy of their temperament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is my knight," she licked her head, glanced down at her feet, still squirming and trying to break free of the magic rope. The so-called knight, "I don't know what to do with him, he has a few accomplices - maybe they don't want to forgive him, he may not tell anyone - there are things about these gold and silverware, maybe I should return these rewards to my master first, otherwise I will worry if there are one or two people who don't want to wait any longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can the lord's reward be returned?" McGee asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's fine to make other fancy after casting." Leona said that her father was quite generous in search of supporters when he was not a Norman king. Generous, but after he became the new king, these gifts and rewards changed and looked like they were sent back. Perhaps because of omissions, perhaps because of the shyness in the bag, there are a few armor and silver plates that have not been done a little bit. The cover was sent out, and she remembered how her father laughed when he saw them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant has already understood the old woman's meaning. She is old and a woman. She can't grasp the knights and soldiers left by her husband. Apart from being tied into a locust style, other knights are afraid of not enough. Reliable, perhaps the most noble of them is just sitting on the sidelines, it is absolutely impossible for them to draw swords to fight for an old woman who has obviously not been able to bring him rewards and glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And although Perant and others are just strangers, everyone knows that the quality of the elves is as pure and pure as the stone, and at least one of them Rui, a mage, and these knights, or mercenaries, may not be able to make them move if they have a dozen more half-lengths, but a caster is completely different, not to mention that Mrs. Lev is not prepared to hang them all. Hanging, she only needs a little time and something that can make them jealous. Those who carry heavy gifts to the capital will bring the knights and pastors of the lord – perhaps bringing new to this land. Master, her lord has several children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few days will be fine." Mrs. Lev said: "Our territory is not very far from the capital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only say that I am sorry," said Perant, who did not want to stay here. There were no cubs and debilitated elderly or wounded in their ranks. Rui, he can also find the safest and warmest resting place for his companions. A not solid fortress is not too tempting for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what a night?" said Mrs. Lev: "I know that some people in my farm have also caught some black-footed half-length people. They were supposed to I was refused, but I can ask the governors to send them over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant does not know if those black-footed half-length people Knowing more, he was trying to refuse, the lich inserted into them: "This is a sincere invitation," he said softly: "I think we should accept it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid turned his head and glanced at him. "If that is the case," he said, "Respected lady, please allow us to accept your kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our territory is not rich," Mrs. Lev looked around: "But I think my guests can still get the best care."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ge Lan smiled a little, and he hoped that the old woman would not give them a house soup. The rats were raised very fat, at least than the hens curled up at the foot of the city wall. It’s tempting to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Lev will certainly not give them a soup, "This is a turtle soup," said the lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what they saw was a broken calf head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is updated tomorrow before 10am. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-footed half-body has widened their eyes, and this move makes them look even more ugly, because the eyes are almost beyond the eyelids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On Lev's territory."
