			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief Grange climbed a spiral tower at the tip of the sea otter and made a sigh similar to the stranger, although he could not see the magic across the sky. Galaxy, but can see ordinary stars and pure color sky, a three-toed gull with a small fish swiftly passed by his eyes, followed by a body with twice as many brown thieves The gull, it was so scared that it did not find that it had broken into the human sphere. The thief shook his wrist and shot a silver coin. The silver coin hit the wings of the gray three-toed gull. It was in short screams and chaotic feathers. Struggling to meet the hard rocky ground - the frightened skua first shouted and flew quickly, hovering for a few weeks, and found that humans did not move further, it did not Hesitantly landed on the body of the three-toed gull and began to enjoy the original fish and unexpected food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan is able to continue to quietly admire this small territory, which is made up of two sea otters, which look like a big one to be big The cracked mouth, between the upper and lower jaws, stands hundreds of wooden piles that flicker in the dark yellow waves. When the foreign enemies invade, the wooden piles will wrap around the chains and become the first line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low seawall used to withstand wind and waves is built along the edge of the coast. Many places have been damaged, some are naturally collapsed, and some are masterpieces of smugglers. At the end of the west side of the seawall is a square stone building, which is dedicated to the god of the storm, Talos, and the people who give him a dedication every day are endless. For Gülen, this god is not as good as the thieves. God's Mask is so amiable, Mask will protect his thieves, and Talos has never protected anyone except his pastor. The only thing that can be ensured is that those who dare to ignore him are better not to ever appear. In places related to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pier extends flat from the seawall, and the dock is recessed inward, they look like a gums and a slender, uneven tooth. Every tooth is constantly picking up a lot of resources, manpower and intelligence for the Port of Point, and the gold and silver coins, the various goods, people and other intelligent creatures that flow around the clock like the tides are pouring in and out of here, spacious. Whale oil lamps are hung from the docks, and workers who are busy unloading and loading from morning to night, from late to early. Warehouses and houses are densely and cluttered behind each pier. Unlike the half-timbered houses in the urban area, they are mostly made of concrete mixed with shells and sea sand in order to ensure firmness and low price. The surface is rough and ugly, and the inside is cold and damp. There are a variety of goods stacked in it, inhabited by merchants and craftsmen. The wealth they have accumulated in the past two hundred years is almost comparable to the fifty dragons, and it is constantly increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the thief was brought in. Gülen thought of it and shrugged happily. The guild he worked for was the most fearful and taboo of the whole kingdom. The branch in Jianjian Port also has a history of hundreds of years. He is only twenty-six years old, who controls this guild branch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His smile can hardly hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan’s gaze turned to the port, where there was a four-masted sailing ship with a golden raft. The bow was like a noble woman with a solemn face, neither naked nor naked. No, its captain is Drake. The sails have not yet risen, and the number of sailors walking on the deck is small, about 20 to 30. They are not flustered and even have nothing to do. The gold-plated weapons are shining in their waists. The thief’s eyesight was not enough to see too many other things, but soon the top of the ship’s main light lit up, and the tiny lights flashed three times in a row, then three times, then two under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is telling him that things have been done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief gave a satisfying chuckle, and he walked briskly down the tower and returned to his residence in Point Harbor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His residence, which is the branch of the guild, is located at the end of the sea, a circular peninsula that looks like a cap and a ball, the peninsula and the land only There is a narrow isthmus connected, and the former district chief built a subtle and magnificent fortress on it. After the guild used various means to capture it, it cut off the isthmus and set up the suspension bridge, so when necessary. Can make this fortress a real island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief pulled his own hood at a distance of one hundred feet from the suspension bridge, so that the guards on both sides of the dark castle could identify themselves. The two clever guys jumped out of their nests in the blink of an eye and made an exaggerated hand-to-hand ritual to their new leader, honored to have a silver coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many respects like this, guards guarding the secret door, soldiers guarding and patrolling on the city tower, busy with horses, hoofs, weapons, Food servants and slaves, trusted businessmen and officials, whispering in the shadows of the periphery and internal guild members, who were accomplices of thieves Gülen and strong competitors, some have been in some action Became the object of Gülen’s obedience, but now, at least on the surface, they must show humility and obedience to Gülen, otherwise the thieves will have a reason to assign them a mortal task. This is the law of the guild, which is more than the law of the kingdom. It is even more convincing to these lawless villains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gülen walked through the busy first courtyard, leaving those humble knees and flattering flats behind him. His room was on the third floor of Newcastle. The first and second floors lived with other important members. The entire three floors belonged to His, but Gülen is not satisfied, because his predecessor lives alone in the square tower of the second courtyard, the square tower is hidden behind the two moats and the new fort, perhaps it is not as comfortable as the new castle, but more Safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this year’s Thieves’ Guild has a mage, a true mage, not an apprentice, and Gülen must show him respect and tolerance. But it is not without any advantage. He got a very good magic item from this ugly short man, an obsidian Masque statue, which knows how to identify the true identity of humans or other creatures, such as people entering the room. It is not Gülen, it will spurt a smog that is numb, colorless and tasteless. Gülen has doubts that the wizard may use this statue to monitor and steal, so every time he returns to the room, he will remember to cover it with a thick black velvet cloth and ensure that the mage can not enter the statue. Once again, the scope of the spell was applied. The thief had "unintentionally" revealed that there were 37 organs in the stairs, corridors and doors on the third floor. In fact, there were at least fifty, and there were changes and increases and decreases every day. Some of them are fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan’s predecessor had only thirty-four organs set up inside and outside the square tower, which made Gülen feel very proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two goblins holding the spears are at the entrance of the third floor. When they saw Gülen, they eagerly wanted to yell at him, rushing to keep their heads low. The ass wrapped in linen, their weapons are so collided and twisted in the air, but no one is willing to give in, in the unnecessary dispute, the two wastes fell into a pile and sullenly fight each other. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes are not good materials for guards, and Gülen reminds himself that it is time to pick out a few strong and weak points from the members of the guild that can be controlled. As a guard of his own, he sometimes suspects that his assassination is too hasty, but good opportunities are always fleeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The set of gadgets flew around the thief's flexible fingers, but did not make a sound, he went up the stairs, the stairs were narrow, only The majority of the women's feet are in different heights. The fourth-digit grid is equipped with a pressure-triggered arrowhead mechanism. There is a piercing device at the corner that is disguised as a weird ornament. The holes in the wall can suddenly spurt one or the other. A few hot, high-level flames flush with the head of a normal human male; in addition, there are two flaps on the aisle that are covered by old faded carpets, from which unsuspecting people fall. A huge and viscous asphalt bucket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
