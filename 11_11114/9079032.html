If it is one-on-one, even if there is a gap in strength, you can escape with the experience of reel and luck, but if the number of enemies is Double, it will become very troublesome, after all, when you are dealing with one of them, the other may be ready to cast her / his most powerful spells, so the lich is not as Baldwin thinks Opposite the two warlocks, um, he pulled out from Bywin in Reid, and when he was looking for him with her brother, he tore a reel. This reel is, to a certain extent, not to say It's a powerful spell, at least it doesn't hurt others in the usual sense. After all, it's just a... ah, a Lee Ou Meng shelter, exactly a 20-foot square stone building. Although very rudimentary, There is no invisible servant, and it is impossible to completely isolate the invasion of magic, but the lich created it not to rest. Don't forget where he is now. The tower of Antonio Master is more extravagant in the Master Tower, anyway. Like the Alva Master of Bituminburg, he was fully supported by a city. His tower is sixty feet in diameter, removing narrow stairs, and the depth of the room and center hall is about 18 feet. The location of his hiding place can not be said to be the center of the hall, but after the spell takes effect, the abruptly enlarged building still fills the entire hall tightly, even if there is some gap, a cat or a mouse may feel quite Spacious, but a slightly larger dog will feel a little tight. The weak partition wall was pushed by the shelter, and it was dumped in the dust of the sky. The sudden increase in weight caused the ground to be overwhelmed. Rika chose a better position than Ruiyite. He was behind the corridor. He stepped back and gestured, and a squeaky lightning javelin penetrated the small window of the shelter, and the lightning light allowed him to see the black hair caster in the hut. He doesn't seem to panic, yes, as a caster with combat experience, this situation is completely unexpected. The spell of the shelter restricts the caster from leaving the hut. Otherwise the spell will expire immediately. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to Rica, Reyote's situation is even worse. She was almost crushed under huge stone bricks. She had to activate a coat of arms that made her a squirrel at the last minute, "it" avoiding sporadic falling rocks and broken beams. At the foot of Rica, she didn't dare to scratch Rica's robes at random. Every robes of the red robes were magically processed. If they were touched without permission, their ending might be a miserable and painful death. "It" can only scream eagerly, Rika bowed his head, his eyes made Reyte tight, the claws gripped the ground, perhaps between the next breath, it would not hesitate to escape into it The most recent hole, the bad thing about deformation is that you can only wait for the cast time to pass after you become an animal. After the spell expires, you can restore the original shape. Of course, your caster companion can also lift the spell for you, but Ricardo’s eyes are too familiar to them. Of course they are the closest blood relatives, but when Rica is still in the squat, he shows an attack that makes their parents feel happy. Rei is his sister. But this only means that in many cases, Rica feels that it is more interesting to make her pain more painful than to make servants and slaves suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be nervous," Rica shrugged. "My sister, I know it's not playing time now," he raised his hand and threw the spell to Reyote. On the body, the spell was lifted, and Ruiyite stood up and looked at her brother with vigilance, but the next moment, she gave an angry scream: "Damn," she shouted. "He escaped!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lodge disappeared, as it appeared and suddenly and silently, and Ruiyi took advantage of her younger brother, and quickly summoned one Only the abyss monster, the lowest level, but Ruiyite does not need it to fight for itself, it only needs to find the trail of the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can't blame me," Rica complained. "I can't get a spell for you while still grabbing a mage, not to mention him. It’s not very good to deal with, you see, he is very embarrassed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you laughing?” Ruiyite gnashed his teeth and said that the cabin was already because of the spell. It failed and disappeared, but the wounds it caused were still there, and before Baldwin cut off some of the support frames, there was a constant collapse or deformation, and the little monsters gestured to indicate the people Ruiyi wanted to find. Already not here, the two warlocks followed it, the little monsters were ugly, like the parts of the fly mouth swaying in the air, they went down the trembling stairs, and met several thieves on the second floor, but They have never encountered the black hair caster. When they reached the bottom hall, even the little monster lost its tracking direction, only stupidly spinning around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves are far from Ruiyite. They can of course be aware that their leader is in an extremely angry state. She looks like she has just been beaten by a stinking goblin, her robe is torn. And the burning can only cover the small half body, the exposed part is full of dust and black ash, the smell is even more daunting, the only dull to not find this may be around her feet The little monster that is spinning, it wants to get its own reward, the thin claws are constantly holding the boots of Reyote, the female warlock bows his head, the little monster can see It’s like her brother’s smile. “I almost forgot you.” She murmured, reaching out, holding a soul gem between her fingers, and the little monster shouted happily. Jumping on her palm and trying to pull it out, it didn't even notice that Riyette wore dragon leather gloves, and Rui Yite showed a boring expression, violently clenched his hand, only a small monster like a squirrel. She was caught tightly by her. It may have made the last scream, or it may not. The voice was issued when its flesh and bones were squeezed into mud. Reyote could be said to be concentrating on this piece. Things, like a strong warrior, in order to show his strength and squeeze the lemon to squeeze out all the juice, the little monster's dark gray body fluid overflowed from her fist. Before it fell to the ground, it became a stench of smoke, and the body gradually turned into an ashes with a few particles. The creatures from the abyss only had this end if they died in the main material plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that one hundred years later it has forgotten this thing when it climbed out of the bottomless abyss," Rika said with a smile: "No. I'm probably hard to summon such stupid little things in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared to this matter," Ruiyite said wickedly: "I hope you can explain your behavior," she threatened to put her hand on her waist, where Mithril's pointed hammer was hanging to remind her brother. She is not only a warlock or a priest of Greedy, she is no longer the humble and weak girl: "Your plan does not seem so perfect." More precisely, it is like deliberately not letting it be so perfect. She insisted that all the hands and feet of Birdwin should be cut off, but her brother insisted that he stay in prison in good condition. The reason is that if their traps and spells can't control the wizard, a complete hostage can play the role of a semi-disabled hostage, but the truth is that Baldwin can escape from his jail so easily. . Ricardo's interference has played a significant role in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Rica with a sceptical look, and she had a greater desire for the success of the project than Rica. The black hair of the caster is an extra benefit for Rika, and for her, it includes the previous loss, and once the original goal can be achieved, her income will be doubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" asked Ruiyi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else can I do?" Rika said helplessly: "I admit that my plan is really lacking, but my dearest sister, are you? I thought I would stand on a stand against you? Even if I am crazy, I will not mix with an elf, nor will I bend my knees to a human..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is hard to say," Rui Yite said sarcastically: "Not long ago, you are still singing to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rui The card raised his hands and said that he surrendered, and bowed to Ruiyi: "Don’t ridicule me, my sister," he said softly, his voice can be compared with the elf when needed, and because of this, he Often in the capacity of a bard to cover themselves walking in the crowd, in addition to Birdwin, there are countless nobles and kings who praised his singing, and his heart and song are impressed by the heart, even now It is Ruiyite, who deeply understands how dark and evil spirits are under this beautiful skin. The blood relatives, also unconsciously relaxed their alert: "Can they give me more than you? Retreat 10,000 steps, even if they have what I want, can an elf accept a red robe without any greed "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And we still have Leona," Rica said. "Her identity is a good and no chip, if we can't get from those people." To get what we want, the new king of Norman in Highland will also pay for the satisfaction of our compensation. I don't think there is anything more precious than a national treasure house. In addition to the great and timeless grid. "The Palace of Ruidi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sentence is best not to say the second time." Ruiyite warned him: "I don't like people mentioning this. You should be glad that you are my brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she hesitated: "Do you think Liona... Is the position right now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and see," Rica said. "I think if you can, it is not impossible to negotiate directly with those people."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leona?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noting that Baldwin was very happy when he saw himself, with After some hesitation, Leona stroked her head, her hair was shortened on the way to escape, even the women in the mercenary rarely cut their hair to be like a male, but this shape is more suitable for Leo. Na is not the king of Norman, but Birdwin saw her hair suddenly grow longer. Although it was not yet in Norman’s length, now the hair is enough to fall on the shoulder, not as it was. That's only to the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she left the room of Anzhen, Anzhen gave her a small potion. Under the effect of the potion, her hair hangs down to the knee position with only a few breaths. The amputy's maid cut them. Later, An Zhen explained that this would be used to confuse those who monitored them. It is not very clear how to operate Leona. Because she was put on a dark gray cloak, she was sent out of the fortress. There was a knight who dressed up as a domestic servant. He took her all the way through the countless dirty and cold streets. He stopped when he could see the outer wall of the White Tower. He didn’t wait for a while and was taken by another knight. The people from Bedwin and others reunited with her again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," Birdwin stopped them before the knights left, and the former lord handed them a gift to them by shoulder: "You Do you know what our mage Crimall is doing now? Does he know that we are here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is he who agreed with us here," Knight One said: "But I don't know how he is doing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another knight took a step forward: "I am not very clear, but you Friends, Elf Kerry Ben..." He glanced at Leona’s arms: "It should have been with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of the people A loose, before they have become friends of the Master, Kerry has experienced several adventures with the black hair caster, and the tacit understanding between them is not comparable to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I am too mean," said the former knight: "I can't even ask for your forgiveness, but I still have to beg you, distinguished. His Royal Highness, Leona, the daughter of Norman, please remember your commitment, just as we remember our promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will find yours Worry is superfluous and ridiculous," Li Oona said indifferently: "He will grow up safely and become an upright and heroic warrior..." She paused for a moment and she sighed: "He won't lose anything that he once belonged to. His things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Mei Mi asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers bowed deeply to Leona,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona They sneaked into the darkness. She did not answer the question of Mei Mi, but opened her own cloak directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
