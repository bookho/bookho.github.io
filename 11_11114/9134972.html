			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale only had a handful of people who would be pushed by the power of the spell to his own, his fingers sliding on the skin covered with blood, almost inserted The deep wounds - the magical commanding blades danced in the air, maybe in the next moment, they would attack again - the smallest winged beast was lucky not to die in the first place, entirely because of her wings They also have the exoskeleton of Mithril, which prevents the cutting edge of the blade, but the blade slides to one side when it fails to work, and then penetrates into the root of the wing, thanks to the wicked, because they obey Kay Ershi’s command to make Kremar, the younger brother she did not admit, everyone in his room must suffer as long as possible, even their souls can not rest in peace - Kelsey this time It also brought a Necromancer who will gather these human souls into a soul gem and decorate it on her belt.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two red robe warlocks walking next to Kelsey, her latest collection of lovers, they are young, there is no prominent position, so in order to flatter It’s all about the temple, not to mention that they themselves like the mortals or the weak ones – they should have tore the wings of the beasts – they certainly know that they are the most sensitive places.The short-lived defeat made the warlock who cast this spell reveal a shameful color, and his enemies sneered, he almost throws a spell at the show, the power of magic whispers, with venom and stench, but that From the point of view of the costume, it is like a man of a monk in Ilmotte raising his hand. The soft and bright light radiates from his palm, forming a sly light curtain, whether it is poisonous fog or dancing. The blades are blocked<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't he fallen?" The girl of the Red Dragon looked at the gray robes with great interest. "Why can he still use the power of Rosada?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two possibilities," Necromancer said: "He either deceived us or deceived his god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the former is more likely," Kelsey said. "What do you think the hybrid wants to do?" He let a pastor who worships other gods enter the kingdom of Grenada, at the mother's feet, if the pastor wants to do something," she said: "That is the sin that can not be forgiven for ten weeks around the king.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer is silent, and the Red Dragon's daughter can of course be a dragon, or a dragon with a close blood relationship with Greetian. It’s a hybrid, but he can’t, the mage, especially the Necromancer’s inherent suspiciousness and caution, keeps his mouth tight, even a superfluous word, but he can keep quiet, Kelsey’s lover But no, when the spells fail, their look becomes even more awkward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I recently learned a spell," said a warlock. "It can take the flesh, bones, and internal organs of the skin, but it can bring the soul of the subject." Fixed in the original skin, they can even move and shout if needed," he said diligently. "Look at the statues, my Highness, we can add some new companions to them.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer turned his gaze. This spell was originally exclusive to the Necromancers, but after the Red Robes saw it, they would not wait for it. It turned into their spells, and he didn't have much opinion about this. The spell here may still be fresh, but in the seventy-seventh island it has become a toy for apprentices and disciples to play with each other - If there is any existence of this plane, it has an extraordinary attachment to the study of the spell. Except for these gray robes and bones, there is probably no one else. After all, most lichs are trying to continue their search. And willing to spend a lot of effort, resources, and the risk of becoming an idiot and ghost to transform the ritual, on the island surrounded by the red ocean, almost every day there are new spells, but they are not Being abandoned because of various shortcomings is temporarily unknown.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this cute little spell, though not too innovative, and not strong enough to be overwhelmed by most undead, is unexpectedly very outside the seventy-seven islands People are welcome, as far as he knows, there are such finished products in several branches of the "Silver Finger" thieves union, which is said to be designed to shock the thieves and apprentices, and the enemy has specially hired the undead to make it - really, He prefers to see it in a thief's room, not here, used by an idiot to please a lover, magic is not a cake or a flower, he can use an expensive gem brooch to achieve the same goal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kelly has apparently been pleased. Before she smiles, she is like a glamorous and harsh silver statue, but she really feels When she was happy, she inherited the red dragon's eyes and body will show a different place than the mortal - her diamond-shaped hazelnuts contracted, it looks like a black line, and the golden part occupied almost All the irises, when she looks at you, you can see the little ones tremble in the burning red flame, the dragon's pressure and the feminine charm seamlessly together, she makes you think To lie at her feet, but to conquer and marry her, this complex or conflicting and intense feeling can almost conquer every male - the gray robes exception<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As far as I know," another warlock ridiculed in a timely manner: "There is an indispensable premise to cast this spell," he said. "First you have to get a raw material that won't fly or escape." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, when they competed with each other, the pastor and his protected winged beast had escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you do nothing?" Kelsey asked displeasedly, and the gray robe just shrugged: "Contract," he reminded. My dear child, the contract clearly defines the content of the work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a jealous person." Kelsey said angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I didn't prepare the corresponding spells." Gray robe did not shyly say a lie that was almost humiliating, even a goat Don't believe, don't say it is the dragon and the warlocks, but they also have no way to do this. The most powerful three legions of Grenada are going out, and the powerful casters are all collected, and this one, Not because he is clumsy or weak, because he is indeed extremely powerful - it is not so easy to have his own tower in the warlock Tallinn of Grenada, and he often disappears for no reason, and for this reason, He was not recruited by the army, so Kelsey could still ask for his help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the woman of the Red Dragon has not lost her reason, she knows that the identity of the son of the Red Dragon can make the uninformed person feel jealous or fearful. But the tallest people on the Grenada Cone Tower don’t have any kindness to her and her brothers. The blood of the Red Dragon’s toughness is like a failure. They don’t inherit the obvious Dragon. Signs - no scales, no tails, no cavities, their qualifications are as mediocre as the shape, which is why when Cremari showed great talent, they immediately decided to kill him, and they Brother (although Kelmen and Kelsey did not admit) Mitt, if not afraid to anger the new king, maybe he has already become a pile of ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they also know that this does not allow them to get what they expect, they just can’t control the flames in their hearts – and that’s why they can’t get more The reason for supporting and helping, the instructors in the Warlock Tower think that they are too impulsive, childish, not calm enough. The question is, is it that they recognize the Cremaris that they trust? He abandoned his homeland, abandoned his father, abandoned the "mother" Gredi, and abandoned everything that was owned by a Grinada, with humans, dwarves, elves and even gnomes as friends and blood relatives. Getting along, and doing the disgusting good deeds like the enemy of Grenada - look at these beasts, who cares about these playthings that are only more valuable than ordinary slaves? And their body actually has the sparkle of Mithril, is there no one to see, no one heard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is simply...hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like the gray robe around her, those who are enough to incite this heterogeneous position don’t seem to care about his behavior, and Grydy indulges him, The new king indulges him, and Mittert indulges him, and even the Warlock Tower is condoning him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So do what you should do," Kelsey said viciously: "I think you can drive these bugs out in the shortest possible time." Is it?" She asked the two warlocks around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Gray robe suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelsey’s heart leaps slightly, maybe this one finally changed his mind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be wary," Gray said. "You may face a very difficult enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The pastor?" asked one of the warlocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe." Gray robe said, then he fell silent again, and Kelsey wanted to drag his tongue out and put it in the stone mill, but She was patient, and even the mentor of the Warlock Tower was respectful to this respect. The thorns of Austal had speculated that he might be a lich, not as plain as it seems. gown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock's flame swept the interior of the palace, the curtains, the pillows and the window sills burned, and the wooden cabinets and sills, the dust polluted the walls and the top Faces, gorgeous stones, although not burned, will change color and crack, precious ornaments smash in the flame, every place they pass seems to have been a nightmare-like catastrophe - they are not too eager If the black-haired dragons are still here, their actions may be stopped, but there are only his slaves - the dragon-like attendants are not returned, they are wisely avoiding them, they may be willing to Kreima works, but this is not to say that these people who are dragons or servants will be willing to anger Kelsey for some despicable beasts and slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
