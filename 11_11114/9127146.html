			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of Grenada is strange to the soul of the outside world, but for the lich, it is not so familiar, it is better Said to be impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Gülen’s people agreed to meet in the “red belly”. Unlike many people imagine, the "red belly" is not a restaurant full of people, but a public bath. It is not within the kingdom, but between the second and third walls. Soldiers stationed in a small number of Dragon Claws, whose main duties are to fill the eyes and ears of this chaotic land, and the minions - yes, there is also a huge market here, but this market simply cannot be with the king. Compared with the "black market" in the city. People who are crowded here are all humble, or can't reveal their identity. Here, you can see the goblins, you can see the orcs, you can see the gnomes, and sometimes even the dwarves will appear here - Grenada People dumped defective or disabled goods here, like silk dipped in water, and broke a small mouth of porcelain, mixed with too much impurities of copper and iron, and because of various accidents, or self-harm The slaves... In the "black market", the price of some things has become cheap and incredible, and when they get here, they are worthless. Merchants who are eligible to appear on the "black market" will not appear here. They are often his servants or subordinates, and the goods in their hands may just hover over the teeth of the giant sky above Grenada. The fallen dregs are more like the throws of the waste than the rewards - very few people will seriously consider how to sell these things for a good price, they carelessly pull the crumpled fabric from the skin, and A piece of dish is placed in a flat sand. The slaves are the most indifferent of these goods. Not only are they mostly thin and dying, but their minds are always in chaos because of drugs or torture, like this. "Things" even the devil will refuse to accept, like this sticky and barren soul, can not squeeze out the magic energy that can be used as a reward, even the ogre or the orc should also shake his head, unless there is a goblin is preparing to find A few pieces of the bones of the dog, otherwise they have no market at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these "things" always appear in the market here, like garbage to be processed, maybe we should praise the environmental awareness of Wangdu people They always feel that everything should be used up - these slaveless slaves are piled up in piles of dusty streets, waiting for the hot winds of the desert to blow them dry, and the residents here will mention them Going back as a fuel - the forests of Grenada are as rare as the conscience of the Gryada people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they are walking on such a street, the ground of the street is full of sand, the wind wrapped in sand shows an ugly relationship worn by people Hood,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wearing a robes with a folded collar, the folded collar can be lifted and hung on the small hooks on either side of the hood so that people You don't have to clean up the dust in your ears and nostrils every few hundred feet. It's closer to the desert, but the walls are much lower. The wind and sand on the desert can cross the entire street without fear. In order to avoid these nasty sands, some people even cast a layer of spun yarn on the outside of the eyes. Of course, this is a stupid act. The spun yarn blocks the dust and blocks your sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who looks like a tourist is so bumped into a short guy that he can’t be caught agilely. But at this time, a knife had pierced his abdomen, slammed, he fell, and the attacker grabbed his robes, no, not to help this stupid prey, he was just worried about the robes. It will be contaminated by blood stains or destroyed by the blade. When he broke into the knife, he also specially selected the slit on the robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He puts the businessman in the shadow of the wall, his hand is just as quick and quick as a pair of fish, first take away the dagger of the tourist, bow , Sleeve Arrow, after that is the money bag and one or two poor little jewelry, the lizard skin belt he also smiled, and the piece is only slightly stained with a little bloody robes, the heart of the hot thief looks at heart, but The end of his eyes swept into a vague shadow, and he jumped up and hid himself behind the body of the tour operator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the shadow didn’t want to pay attention to what it meant here. He walked past the thief and the thief didn’t dare to move until he determined that the other It was a long distance before I left the name of the thief god Mask. This is a curse for the thief and a comfort to myself. He is a caster, maybe a Gray. Nada's warlock, he was just a little thief who first entered the guild, but he was able to recognize the pace of the caster, whether it was a warlock, a priest or a mage, they wore wearing boots while walking in the sand and swamp. Soft-soled shoes are gently moved on the marble floor of the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich certainly knows that this little thief will immediately send this tiny information to the guild. Of course, in Grenada, there is only one thief guild, which is "fine net", but he is not worried about showing the trace, in this filth Dirty places are not in the minority, they have a variety of reasons, just like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Gülen’s ability to reach the Grenada so quickly or to make the Lich a bit unexpected, he quickly thought of all the thieves’ Block Rune Fragments - Once the undead had a deep suspicion of how long he could hold it, perhaps when he lost the piece, Gülen would lose his life. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost certain after a while, he thought he would see a strange face, but no, steaming In the public bathroom, he saw Gülen's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand reached out and pushed a woman who was lying on him. She might be a mixed race of snakes and humans because she was covered in blue-blue Small scales, and she spit out a splitting tongue about a foot when she was so excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grenada's warlocks have their privilege wherever they are," Gloria opened the cover of his nose, wet Linen said, "It seems that this rumor is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bathroom was divided into several parts, and the place where Gülen was, maybe he The relationship that was specifically requested was only two of them, but under the double coercion of gold coins and daggers, the manager who insisted that Gülen had to be stripped before entering the bathroom was like not seeing the robes and hoods. Guy - maybe it's really not seen, Gülen has some regrets that he didn't do that, really, even if he used magic, but this practice is still full of rough beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcer sat down beside him, and their feet were only five or six feet away from a large, well-formed bath, no more than the Cramerar bathroom. The one in the small one, but if you look closely, you will see the black wide seam inlaid in the middle of the gray-white rock in the muddy pool water. It is a proof that many people of the race have left here for many years, and fertile can Moisturize thousands of hectares. However, neither Gülen nor Kreima are here to enjoy the fun of bathing. Under the body of Gülen is a very expensive silk. He wears a gemstone ring on his finger. The lich knows at a glance. This is a triggering magic ring; his face is no longer so pale, and the bones are covered with thick muscles. Under the action of steam, his soft dark hair hangs softly on the cheeks. Side and behind him, he smiled, satisfied, scorned, and perhaps with some arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The thieves who are not members of the 'fine net' guild can be less friendly," said the Lich. "You are too reckless, Gülen."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides you, who else knows that Gülen is here?" Gülen said carelessly: "And I am just a small person, Kremar, if anyone I noticed that, it was also because I saw you, the most beloved nephew of King Grenada. Do you know how surprised I was when I heard this news? I always thought that you were Kerry’s "The little son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This joke is too cold," the Lich said. "But I can make it hotter. You think it’s more than a dozen. How does the 'fine net' guild member chase you for a warm-up match?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan raised his hands and said he surrendered: "Of course I have to see you personally to say "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say."dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need yours Help."<b r /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should go to Leona," said the Lich. "I have thought about this, I think you have been a long time ago."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to fight with the old boy of Birdwin to fight the princess's attention," Gülen said. "Maybe I originally had this preparation, but you know, the process. There was a little problem in the middle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich used his eyes to signal him to continue to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bedwin wants my rune fragments," Gülen said quietly, in fact, not only his, but also Mei Mei. Meimi’s body also contained a piece of debris that seemed to be embedded in the depths of the body when the rune was broken. They found it too late, and now they have almost merged with Meimei, and they can’t get it out—although it The effect still exists. Byrd's request, Gülen certainly does not agree. The problem is that Leona has always been difficult to make a choice on this issue - Gülen can understand, after all, the relationship between plum and Leona is only Better than the enemy, there is no deep friendship between him and Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
