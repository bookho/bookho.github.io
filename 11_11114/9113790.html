			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world asked a few questions, but when they failed to get an answer, they discovered that the lich was reading a big book on the bookshelf. book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be stated here that all the things in the original room, when it did not notice them, is a vague shadow, only it thinks And when the specific content is given, they will become clear and true - this is because its memory is broken, there is no continuity and no integrity, and the illusion of using this as a foundation of construction must feel that it is not lucky. - The lich is holding a book that impresses the souls of the outside world, thick, smooth coated paper, nuanced and colorful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is your building really so high?" asked the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 182-meter-high Burj Khalifa." The soul of the alien world glanced at the note next to the photo. "What's weird," It said: "You also have high buildings there." Like the Master Tower, the Castle Tower or the Temple Sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you have no magic and no magic." The Lich said: "They are all built by humans. How long can they last? I mean, no. Will it collapse or be abandoned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not sure about this," said the soul of the outside world: "But in general, a building below the building The life span is only a hundred years at most.” It tears open the potato chips bag that has just been found in a courier box, and explains the professional words such as the next type of building to the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A lot of buildings like this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Should.” After all, high-rise buildings, factories The gymnasium and the local buildings you know belong to a class of buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They take a lot of power and money." The Lich said, and the soul of the outside world nodded: "You have described your world," Lich Continue to say: "A peaceful world that I can't believe, I thought it was because you have too few things to touch, and now it doesn't look like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The soul of the opposite world smiled. Although it is very home, it does not mean that it has never left the house half a step. "Is architecture related to the peace of the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Lich said: "In our plane, it is difficult to see so many tall or vast buildings, because they need to be built and maintained with the power of God or magic." He remembered a knowledge and The followers of the singing god once used his will and used the power given by him to discard the original sanctuary polluted by the evil forces, and sang loudly day after day, with only a little help from outside. Under the air, a magnificent and beautiful temple that can stand for a thousand years has been built. His mentor once took him to appreciate the building, although this is a big adventure for the undead. But the mentor is like that. He seems to have never been imprisoned by any rules or conventions. "The gods mostly love tall and rich buildings, but people don't, because they can't make sure they don't throw a lot of gold coins and time. The beautiful mansions built afterwards will not be destroyed by the war the next day, especially those outside the city walls - but even in cities, you may not be able to get anything. The protection, think about the White Tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although some wealthy or powerful people will carefully build their own homes, it is only because this can also be highlighted Their strength." The Lich said: "But you can perceive that everything they have is not as good as the civilians here. To all of you, ordinary everyday appliances are used to show off to them. Luxury goods, our markets and stores never dare to pile up so many goods, because they are not looted or burned - and you have innumerable steel and other precious metals, but For many people, the concept of weapons is not in books and 'networks', or in the kitchen.” The lich looked at the pocket swords shrouded in a small glass scorpion, which were stainless steel, but At most, it can only be used as a toothpick. "So many people live in the same building. You and your neighbor are only separated by a wall. You can hear the sound of his nails. You Women and children can walk on any street as they wish - how many years have you ever had a war in your plane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The war has always been there. "The soul of the opposite world said: "Just... not here. Not in my country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small war." The Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world thought for a moment, he could not say that he felt another plane and peace, but except for the Thunder Castle... "The war is not far away." Although people still can't see, can't hear," the Lich seems to see its thoughts: "But there is always someone who can smell the suffocation of steel and blood. This continent has been quiet for a long time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be like this," the soul of the outside world lamented: "I don't want to go back, I mean, your world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past is not The deceased revealed a look of ridiculous surprise: "Is you still thinking about leaving?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," the soul of the opposite world is innocent and said: "Why should I stay in a world with only a goblin TV station?" It snapped a finger, and the machine that didn't know what it was called TV or called a monitor immediately fell into a darkness, and the noisy goblins were not seen. "How do we leave?" It pondered for a moment: "Is it possible to leave as if leaving a dream?" It is very good at how to leave a nightmare, whether it is chasing a scorpion or a Rex tyrannosaurus, as long as Realizing that you are in a dream, the easiest thing is to imagine a very high place, then still fall by yourself, wake up directly before falling to the ground, or feel the soft bedding under the body, then wake up Come also A matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The illusion can only blind those who believe in it." The Lich said, while stretching his hands, let the flames form together between his fingers: "Your world has no magic." But he did not release them immediately: "Do you want to see your loved ones?" Unlike him, this despicable thief is fortunate to have a pair of parents who love it. In this room, you can hear them talking in the room next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," the souls of the outside world simply said: "They are not real, and," its soft, white body shivered a little: " I don't want to see a mother with a pointed ear and a dad with a scale. Thank you, I already have too many nightmare themes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lich smiled and the fireball was thrown out. The burning flame suddenly swept the whole room. The air in the room became hot. The delicate dolls and gorgeous books were blurred and curled in the red light. The low cracking sound, countless crystal clear pieces passed through their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodbye, the soul of the opposite world said, my world, my home, my loved ones, my love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It closes his eyes, and when he opens it, he sees the darkness, but soon, its vision, or the view of Cremari Brightened, he stood in a snowy cave. The bright light poured down from the top. It was colder than the sun, harder than the moonlight, and the soul of the outside world looked up. He first saw hundreds of things. The shields are like silver-plated, and the light is what they radiate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shield is next to one side, familiar to the souls of the outside world without any reason. He looks to the right along the direction of the shield and finds that they are not the same size, or that they are becoming smaller at regular intervals. And become slender, and their edges are overlapping, the soul of the opposite world turns the body, while receding, he sees the long tail hovering on the ground, the tip is as sharp as an open sword He cast a spell on himself, letting himself float and float in this huge cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a beautiful silver dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin and Leona are blocking a dragon like a hill, it The scales are like brass in the sun, warm and shiny, and the head is surrounded by a circle of disc-shaped creatures that can accommodate twelve people to eat on it. It looks like the recent popularity of the southern countries. A round wrinkled collar with a sharp corner on its lower jaw, but a large part is hidden under its forelimbs and under the membrane wings, its eyes closed, like sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin reached out and touched the ice that covered him. The ice was smooth and chilly. He walked around the dragon for half a lap. The edge of the dragon's membrane wing is dark green, not like blood or visceral debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of Norman’s lord watching the dragon, for her, the dragon looks even more kind: “It’s a metal dragon "She said: "A brass dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good Dragon." Birdwin concluded that he was educated in the sanctuary of Tyre. Although the dragon has left this plane for a thousand years, there are still many books and records related to the dragon in the sanctuary. After all, when the dragon is still here, they have become paladins many times. Enemies and friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the last?" Leona asked, she suffered a lot of torture, spiritual, and ** in the illusion. The entanglement of evil has severely eroded her spirit, and she is now totally supported by the elf's snow honey. Contrary to Baldwin, although he was a little tired and somewhat awkward, his grey eyes were like rivers frozen by ice, and numerous turbulent whirlpools and torrents were hidden under a calm surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shouldn't be." Birdwin said that he found that the dragon should have been dead for a long time. Under the records of the sanctuary, White Dragon and Silver Dragon sometimes slept in the frozen caves, and their body temperature heated up. Ice, snow and ice melt on their scales to form a thick layer of armor, but in front of their nose, there must be two holes, because there is always a warm breath, but he is looking for There is no such hole, and even if he raises the sword shield of Mithril, the dragon is still motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about other people?" asked Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Birdwin first met Leona, who took off his cloak, wrapped it on the king's body, and placed her on The recesses naturally formed by the ice bamboo shoots, although the wind here is not as violent as the rest of the northernmost land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again looked at all the corners and couldn’t even find the dark ramp that they had just left. They are still short of food and water, Leo Na also has a water polo ball inlaid with rubies, which can be used to boil water for heating, but the silence that almost makes a person suffocate still makes them uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you met?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fantasy." Liona said. "Yes," said Bydwin. "This may be a test for each of us." To reach out and smooth the knot in the middle of the brow, but it quickly disappeared: "What have you encountered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some...very, Unimaginable things.” Leona said that her fantasy is simple and not simple. In the illusion, she lost Baldwin in this adventure and was forced to enter into a marriage contract with her uncle, but she was not as ordinary. The women bowed their heads and listened to the fate of the arrangement - her hands were finally covered with blood, the new king, the princess, the Dylan's, and more, she looked at her aging and became moody. Cruelty and tyranny, in order to prolong her life, she is so ugly and disgusting - compared to everything before, her own changes make it difficult for Leona to accept, she has rushed herself in the mirror for countless times. Shouting, she won’t do that, she loves Baldwin, but she also loves her. Home and her own people, the death of Birdwin will certainly make her painful, but she will never become evil, even if she is already the ruler of a vast country,<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes her desperate and helpless is that she is always just a bystander, or sometimes she feels that she is herself. The evils she has done make her own children intolerable, but what did she do? When she found her only son, a Tyre warrior who wanted to oppose her, she put him on his ponytail and pulled him around the king for three laps until the poor child was left. Two arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She unscrupulously used the hypocritical and awkward bureaucracy to extract the last copper coin from her people to support her supportive mage and Warlocks, dedicated to evil gods, just because they promised to give her a long life and youthful face, she seems to have forgotten everything, forgetting Bydwin, forgetting her father, forgetting that she had been in the balance of Tyre The promise of the past, forgot how much she once loved her country. When the orc army broke the kingdom of Norman, a fire was placed under the tower where she lived, and the whole tower was swallowed up in flames. When I didn't know if this was another person or my own, Leona even felt a sense of relief and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Norman’s lord of Highlands does not remember how he got rid of the illusion. When he woke up, Baldwin had guarded her and fed a coma. She drank a bottle of potion, and she was bruised and bruised. It was probably because she couldn't control herself in the illusion. She was terrified when she thought of the illusion. At the beginning, Baldwin could not even leave her sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona looked at her lover, Baldwin as usual, no injuries, no look, he was like walking in a flat and She came here on a safe road. She didn't know what to ask, but she really wanted to know what happened to Baldwin? Old Don Cray? Dylan? New king? Or... Penny, Leona found herself almost forgetting her. Although Birdwin’s tragedy kicked off from Penny’s body, the so-called hateful person must have pity. Sometimes Leona should ask herself whether she’s been stunned or not. When taunting and chilling, she did nothing as a prince and a possible heir who could solve this problem with her hand. If Penny became her maid, even the countess would greet her with politeness. Instead of a palace maid who has no title, she can turn a blind eye to her. But when Leona saw Penny, her heart was as painful as being bitten by a poisonous snake. Didn't the nobles look at her eyes and refused Penny, leaving her in a four-faced song State? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, will she not be so easily tempted, leading to the final fall? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, Leona faced her heart so harshly that she thought she was not an evil person, but she found that evil is omnipresent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin doesn't know how to describe what he has encountered... though he said that fantasy is a test for everyone, but his illusion is Glory and joyful like the sweetest spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He became the king, the king of Norman in the Highlands. Those who have despised him are kneeling at his feet; those who hate him can only smile when they see him; those who have hurt and humiliated him are not losing power. It is the loss of property, they have nothing, hungry, and the outstretched hands are skinny; and those who have supported him, those who love him, and those who support him, either hold the sword or wear medals. As he rode tall horses across the street, countless gorgeous petals, spice powders, honey and ribbons descended from the sky, much more than the previous triumphal style. He holds the sapphire scepter that he has seen in the hands of Pharaoh for hundreds of times, holding the ball, and his side is standing next to his favorite woman, Princess Leona, no, now is the Queen's Highness. Her children are holding in their arms and holding them in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ruled the entire Highlands of Norman, making the country alive and orderly; his army could drive the orcs without the help of elves. At the farthest end of the Whistling Plain, no bard would not recite a long poem about him, nor did the Norman receive a favor that did not belong to him—he had to return his surname and let Tang Cree’s pattern The chapter and the royal coat of arms are one; he stands in the temple of Tyre and re-offers his own balance. In the sun, the black iron balance is like a gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teil appeared in front of his eyes, giving him the glory of the electorate, he became young and strong, after he ruled his country more than three hundred years later He returned to the foot of Tyre as the most favored warrior in the Kingdom of God to fight for the god of justice and justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hardly wants to wake up, but when he raised his hand in the Kingdom of God and saw his secret silver arm, he was suddenly awakened. - Every warrior in the Kingdom of God who is ignorant of Tyre will not leave any regrets. He knows that he should go back to reality - but he feels that this is not just a fantasy, but a sign, fate. It was so generous that he was allowed to peek into what was going to happen in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can’t tell Leona like this, now Leona is the king of Norman in Highland, she loves him, but Baldwin is not sure if she is More emphasis on the throne, after all, that is her father's country and people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only girl who loves to run in the martyrdom, her footsteps are so light, and the people who see it will think that a big bird is passing by instead of one Humans are rushing away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the illusion of Mei Mi, simple and boring to her even the memory is not willing - a Fro priest, but in fantasy and a human male Marriage, raising offspring, until the two are white-haired, stature, perhaps after a winter night, they will be buried together in the black soil, their children will mourn and send off for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only girl who loves laughs out loudly the hateful, squatting and stubborn soul--the human soul is beyond her expected tenacity, though only love The woman must admit that she is the weakest time now, but she is still humiliated and angry that she cannot assimilate and annihilate it in the first place. She is not incapable, or she does not have the will to completely destroy her. Only after she descended into this body, any of her powers should be used with caution - but this embarrassing situation will only last until after she gains strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, perhaps without her doing anything, this despicable soul will die by itself because of the inability to withstand the impact of power. Of course, don't forget the thief. From his body, the only girl who loves smells a force belonging to other gods. From Meimi, she knows that Gülen was cursed by the priest of the death god Klanwo, but she felt It’s not that simple to tell the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light spot in front of her is getting bigger and bigger, and her speed is getting faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing in front of her is a brilliant golden dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the Giant Mountain tribe, more correctly, the “ambassador of the orc god Kawu luxury” "Put up your neck and let hundreds of tentacles reach into the air. The tentacles dance wildly, like an octopus pressed on a baking sheet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you smell it?" He said to himself: "The smell of the dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
