			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 474th chapter<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mite and the Dragon’s sentry The red dragon lady who talked about took off in the deepest darkness before dawn. Her scales reflected the sky, like flowing blood. The flame that she spit out replaced the morning light and awakened the people on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world has studied the tactics of the Grenada people, because of the existence of the lion lions, their technique is wonderfully combined with another Face-to-face, simply put, as in modern warfare, the first thing that comes to the enemy’s head is the blow from the air, like the last battle in the plane where the soul of the alien world was. The lion's body and the lion's body are the main force of the air strike force. The red dragon's flame and the warlock's spells pour from the air to the ground like a cannonball. The ubiquitous fire, smoke, lightning and acid are better than the other plane. The gunpowder and steel that people need to face are even more terrible. This kind of blow can destroy the strong fortress and the wall in the blink of an eye, so that countless mortals mourn and die, let the survivors lose their ability and confidence to resist and make them fear. Trembling, unable to think, but also allowing the hidden casters to be forced to reveal their own tracks, they will be the focus of the second strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city they want to conquer is second only to the king, and without it, the Grinada can be in three days or less. Let your shadows cover the enemy kings, there are tens of thousands of soldiers and knights, as well as the casters, who are either not accepted by Grenada or cannot tolerate Grenada. The chaos or evil, or the violation of the laws of Grenada, have to escape, or have a blood relationship with the people of this country, so they have almost no room for retreat, in the Red Dragon After the flames swept the walls, they were as jewels as they were mixed in the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mage sang a curse loudly, he was a brave man, but this courage did not make any sense in front of a red dragon, his spell hit The red dragon, let it make a scream, it is not so much a pain as an accident, she slammed on the wall, claws clinging to the battlements, hard stone bricks under its claws drop powder, it Wrenching the neck covered with scales, the golden eyes sparkled, and the black scorpion erected reflected the figure of the mage. The wizard, when the dragon landed in a place where he could almost come to a hot kiss with his own neck, did not show fear. He began to make gestures, and the second spell formed on his tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon’s wings suddenly twitched a little, but a hot wind suddenly got into the mage’s mouth, his spells and sounds together. Interrupted, and his throat was ruthlessly burned. He stepped back two steps and pulled out a wand from behind him tensely, but at this time the red dragon raised his paw and pressed him completely under the paw, blood. Immediately from the mage's mouth and nose, overflowing the ear hole, he has an arm to use, he struggled, trying to break the wand in the crack of the battlement, but the other front paw of the red dragon is like a human finger That lightly took away the wand, "a very nice little gift." The red dragon said in GM, its voice is so loud, like a thunder, and its huge head hangs down, the dragon kisses With the Master's face, it is taking a deep breath. The Master can clearly see that the sac under the dragon's head is violently bulging. He squints and knows that he will face a burning and pain that he has never felt before. But what he didn't think of was the fire that the red dragon spewed out. It's just as slender as a line, and its form is destined to be a hundred times more horrible than its predecessors. The fire line falls on the edge of the wizard, where the stone bricks make a cracking sound, and then the wizard's curls and The skin began to burn black and roll. The fire line climbed on his cheek like an active snake. The muscles melted and the bones burst. He actually couldn't die. He opened his mouth and the flame fell into his teeth. Before the sharp pain is the unbearable sorrow and bitterness - the red dragon can see that he is crying, maybe he regrets it, or it may be just a physiological reason, but no matter which feeling makes it happy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of the Master cannot be said to be fast, but it cannot be said to be slow. The firewire passes over his face and divides his head from the longitudinal position of the lips. In the two halves, almost no blood flowed out because of the high temperature. His first half of his head fell on the ground, and the red dragon let go of his body and satisfactorily looked at his work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames on the wall, except for the grease and giant wood prepared by the people here for resistance, the only fuel left is the enemy. The soldiers and the people who led them were ignited in the same way, the soldiers' flames were smaller, because they lacked fat, and the nobles wanted to burn more vigorously - but the red dragons were not satisfied: "Let me see More fire!" It screamed and snarled, and the casters behind the lion's lion were humbled down their heads and gestured to show that they had heard its orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon looked up at the sky. This time it was difficult to see on the peninsula, the sky covered by thick light gray clouds, but because of the flames, The air here is still dry and hot. It dragged its long tail and walked slowly on the wall, sniffing the smell of the air. When it was about to walk through an arrow tower, it suddenly paused, and then suddenly emerged from the face of the dragon like a little girl. The naughty look... Although this kind of look is hard to be distinguished by humans, the tower is silent, and there are dead humans hanging above the tower and the holes in the archery. It goes over and the tail is about to be wiped over the tower. At the bottom, extremely fast and accurate, it inserted the dragon kiss into one of the archery holes - the archery hole is a bit small for the lady's mouth, but the red dragon does not mind, its capsule is ominously It swelled up, and then it blew the flame into the tower. Every hole and gap in the tower immediately spurred red light, followed by a brighter flame, human beings in the flames. The Red Dragon took a breath and sat down with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It listens to the sound and feels the faint magical turbulence. When the flame illuminates the edge of the stone brick, it slams its tail, towering arrow The tower was broken at the waist, and the upper part fell into the wall and destroyed a wooden shed. But the people inside were not dead or fled, but the red dragon did not pay attention to this. It was concerned with the rest of the tower. - Standing in front of a miraculously intact wall, standing with a warlock, his spells ensured that he was safe and sound, but his look was not as calm as the ground and walls. "I surrender," he screamed exhaustedly. Cried, sweat flowed from his hair into his red robes. The red robes were much bleak compared to the flames and blood. "I am willing to work for you. My sister is the wife of the jazz, I know." All of them are arranged! I can..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds good," Red Dragon said, lifting the tip of his tail and licking the sticky liquid on it. The warlock's body slid down from the wall. "But I don't need this," it looks at the city that has been ruled by the flames. "I only need to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame will be more and more people Driven out, among those who have power and wealth, they try to pray, threaten and bribe, but as the Red Dragon said, their enemies only need to die, and they find that they can't survive with what they used to rely on. When they started to rebel, a businessman took out his hidden weapons. All the people, except the children, picked up swords, bows, and shields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I miss my embarrassment very much now," said a dragon claw knight. In the previous battle, this kind of thing was done to the affiliated legion, but This time, in order to ensure the speed of the legion, those people were thrown away: "This kind of thing is not interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't complain," he The companion is extremely enthusiastic. "I don't mind running through any body, as long as it can scream and bleed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon claws are in those The mortal ruthless front of the bureaucracy, the warlocks of Grenada made gestures, the solid walls collapsed like sand, and the people inside screamed, they saw the dragon covered in black armor with faces and body. The claw knights, as well as the fear claws under them, the claws of the dragons only leaped gently, and they crossed the soft sand. Their claws were scratching on the stone floor, making a harsh sound, not waiting. The temporary chiefs of these enemies have come up with a way of confrontation, which is strong and strong. The beasts rushed to the crowd, their weight made the whole ground tremble, and only a small number of people could wave the sword under this deterrent, but these swords only used a small slip on the front breastplate of the Deinonychus. The traces are pushed to one side by huge forces, and their heads or parts of the body may land earlier than their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon-knight knight’s spear penetrates one, two, or even three weak human bodies, and their strength ensures that the spears are lifted. At the mouth of the Deinonychus, their mounts satisfactorily enjoyed the unexpected meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman hanging on a spear was only pierced by the side of the rib, and she cried in pain, and the clothes were pulled off together with the flesh. The bare body was as soft as a creamy glow in the gray skylight, and the knight who grabbed her looked at her chest and hips with great interest, but when his eyes fell on her abdomen, A long knife quickly cut off her head and ended her pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavalier glanced dissatisfied at the nosy guy: "Are you sympathizing with her? Dragon Knight?" He asked, Dragon Tooth and Dragon Claws The relationship is not so good, this is a well-known thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
