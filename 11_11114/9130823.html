A voice suddenly remembered behind her, scared Jasmine, when she found out that the man was his uncle Let go of my heart: "He said that is true..." she muttered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you see it now, nothing happened," said her uncle. "Jasmine, you should believe me, Moussa is just tired of life here." Let the tribes leave here with themselves - he is insignificant, but hundreds of strong and agile fighters are different."Jasmine's uncle said that Moussa is not the first, nor the last one. Hard life is like the sand, killing their will, and the honey, silk and armor weapons that are looted are like spiders." The acid melts their persistence - the barbarian likes freedom, longs for freedom, they are never slaves, so they don't even want to give in to the red dragon, although the king of Grenada is rich and powerful. The city is on their side, their ancestors, their fathers never wanted to bend their knees just to find a place in the city - but they are all old, or have gone to mourn the wasteland, They can't stop the ambitions and desires of young people, and there are always young people who leave their tents one night and never come back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may have reached their own wishes, or they have already become sacrifices and sacrifices. It is also possible that they know that once they leave, they will never have a chance to turn back. The moment they left the tribe, they showed that they would only be enemies of the tribes, not their loved ones. Even if they came back with gold and potions, they would only be greeted by the arrow of the venom of the spider venom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should we do?" Jasmine asked softly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it," her uncle said: "Like each day before, we are just poor little people, even the corps of Grenada is annihilated. We can't get enough compensation. The kind of things that Moussa described is impossible. Have you seen people using a hammer to beat mosquitoes? And we are as quick as mosquitoes, and the king belongs to them. But the desert belongs to usHe hesitated, still stroking the rough hair of jasmine. Like other barbarian girls, her skin and hair are rough, like sandstone, lacking moisture, but as far as her uncle is concerned, she It's as beautiful as the flowers in the desert after the rain, but her uncle also knows that jasmine is far worse than the girls in other places - he knows that Jasmine has always liked Musa, which is why he doesn't The reason for telling more cruel words - there are women in the caravan, not a slave, but these women are killed by the tough demands of Musa's father, and Jasmine's uncle is also puzzled, but he returns When he got into his tent and accepted his wife's hug, he suddenly understood that those women were as clean and soft as water. If they had them, who would want a rough girl like Jasmine? Before the domesticated spiders, if they need to flee, they can only rely on other people's spiders, can they still have the speed of weapons and shields? Even the moth Uncle is not sure, if you have tasted the taste of these women, he can still leave them without hesitation when the disaster comes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Musa can become a vassal of the Prince of Grenada, or a slave. As a warrior, he should also have such a woman, just like the soldiers of the affiliated legions. They can still have their own differences with slaves. Property and weapons, but they can enjoy the inner city warlocks and knights in the pubs, baths and inns of the outer city. But for the barbarians, it is like a wonderful life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moussa will not come back, and will not remember JasmineDudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moussa out of the “red belly” they just I was able to take a shower in the most affordable big bath, which is unimaginable for people who live in the desert all the year round. Merchants also hired four slaves to serve them – even the cheapest. The pool water is also hot, the milky white water looks like steamed beef and goat milk, because the relationship with the herb smells quite fragrant, their youngest companion can not help but secretly drink a few mouthfuls, because He thought it was milk, but he quickly vomited and quietly told Moussa that the water was bitter and bitter.He, and others seem to have forgotten the desert, completely conquered by the riches and glory of Grenada. After the people responsible for looking after them took them to the pub for a big meal, they believed that they had already Came to the kingdom of the gods - because Grenada has a great demand for honey, all the food here is poured over the ****, the honey of this **** and the eater It’s completely different. The honey of the snail beast should be said to be a secretion. It tastes only slightly sweet, more sour and greasy, but the sweetness here is thick and pure, and it is conquered at once. Everyone's tongue<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can we have some drinks?” Musa’s companion eagerly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," the respondent said: "But we should go back to the hotel room and let the boss come up. He has a good blood wine. If you don't like blood wine, there are ordinary rum and ale." Of course he will not allow these people to drink outside. He can see that they are all rural, and perhaps the farthest place in this life is the village. The marketplace with the city - he does not know that they are the barbarians who are about to be destroyed by the Dragon Tooth Legion. After all, he came to this dry and violent place from Jianjian Port for only a few months, although because of the division leader Support, he is here to be like a duck, but like this key information he still has no contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moussa saw the excited look from his companion’s eyes, what he wanted to say, but still held back—the stalking beast’s sensory organs were very Sensitive, wine is something they hate, so the barbarian never touches the wine, but in order to follow the caravans to sneak into the Grenada, their spider beasts are killed by the owner, taking away the poison glands and honey. Forever buried in the desert - they brought in the eggs of the eater, the surface of the eggs covered with dust, the mottled bumps make them look like a pile of potatoes, so it can be said It was very successful to blind the eyes of the guards. They put them in their rucksacks, like the food that the mercenaries carried with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, in the hotel room, these eggs are still in their skins, these bags look as plain as their clothes Even a thief wouldn’t think of any good things to find in it, but there are people who look after them. When Moussa walks into the room, he is screaming, he is one of the tribes... one tall, But obviously there is no one who is wise. He only knows how to listen to Moussa. Although he is a bit embarrassed to leave him alone, Musa, who saw this scene, is a little bit dumbfounded. He wakes up this person and will bring The food was handed to him, and he smiled at Musa, sitting on the bed and gorging himself up. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moussa examined the eggs, which were cut out from the belly of the eater, all mature eggs, through the milk The yellow egg can feel the larvae crawling in the egg. It may take only three days. For the longest five days, they need a huge, living desert spider, piercing the body and putting the eggs in. There is no warm and nutritious cave. These eggs will not be successfully hatched. Without the eater, the parents of his companions will be reduced by more than half. At least in the fight, they can’t walk outside the hotel. The experienced mercenary is compared with the thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about whether he should ask their responders, but this is only the first day, the dark-haired dragons will not be reckless and impatient And impatient, refuse to accept their loyalty? Moussa decided to wait another day, but his heart was like being baked on a flame. At this time, he heard cheers and snoring. He rushed out of the room and saw some people rushing out. He followed them, and the streets were full of people. They all looked up. And Musa knows what happened before he looked up - every barbarian must be familiar and fearful, even the baby knows not to cry when hearing this sound - this is the lion lion The roar of the beasts, carrying their own knights, passing through the lavender-colored sky, densely like a rain cloud, people have been watching this scene, although in daily training and exercises, this scene Not uncommon, but they are the first to see so many eagle lions and their knights, the shadows they cast cover everyone's face and heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a welcome ceremony?" One asked: "Or something else?" He knew that Longya had a new owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War," someone answered him: "Or a massacre, but if you want to treat it as a welcoming ceremony, it is not impossible." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich rides on the male lion body animal, Keou accepts the price of ten honey cakes and accepts the saddle Block, but there is no gimmick, gimmick is absolutely impossible, the soul of the outside world will not accept, and the undead who used to do not need to use these unreliable things to control a male lion body beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the camp of the Dragon's tooth, the strong smell of Keou still did not dissipate, which made many knights have to repeatedly and comfortably violently Mount, but this is also a helpless thing, whether it is a positive or a sneak attack, Kreima's lion beast has achieved an irrefutable victory, and the winner always has quite a lot of privileges. For example, they can fly to the sky when all the lions and lions are present. Keo hovered over the top of their head for a week. The lich can feel the knights and the lions. The body is tight, and if Keo dares to humiliate them again with urine, they may be attacked by the group. Dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
