			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish my dear readers a happy New Year, a safe and healthy life, a rich source of money, and good luck! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be many people who are sick or fearful because of the eldest son, but sorry, He didn't know what a deformed monster was facing him. As a lich, the only food of the undead was the human or humanoid soul. The lich who was deprived of flesh and nerves had no taste. Without touch, ordinary food can't satisfy them at all, even if they can chew them - the food they put in their mouths is light and tasteless, or they are either hard or sticky, and the negative energy that is filled with negative energy is not dry and corrosive. Will accept and digest them... probably no one knows what the undead who still love the world of the living or who like to wear hellokitty will do it - they have a deep silver plate on their pelvis, all the food 囫囵After passing through the dry mouth and esophagus, they will fall through the tattered stomach and intestines and fall directly into the plate. If the people they invited to share the meal are alert enough and have a good pair of ears, they are in the quiet hall. You can hear the snoring of the honey on the silver plate and the snoring of the bones falling on the silver plate. ∑,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the undead will take out the silver plate after the meal, and those foods that are soaked in soft, sticky and sticky will be They are used to feed servants and prisoners - but several of the undead who are particularly bad will use it to scare his guests. In the midnight tea party of the undead, a female lich will relish a rude knight. How did she complain that her leg was not enough to eat at her table, and how did she untie the tights, open her ribs, lift the plate from the upper end of the pelvis, show him the mutton on the plate and ask him Do you really want to come here too? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ghost servant stuffed the mutton with the knight's mouth, he could be said to be suffocating and horrified, which made his dirty soul immersed in a weird rancid smell. breath. "But it's not too bad," the female lich said. "I still remember that the fishermen on the north side of the island of Azores have dedicated me to the shark meat that they have been marinated for three years and are waiting to be fermented. The two are similar. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich looks at the human guilty guilty at a glance. He is like a living sponge, looks big and strong, but as long as With a light grip, you will find that it has only one bone - even though it is a thorny bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eldest son of the East Crown lord thought that the black-haired spellcaster would say something, his father, the master and the eunuch around the ruler gently tapped the little golden dragonfly hanging in the corner of the hall. So the slaves who are dancing and singing generally retreat, and everyone stopped eating, drinking, talking, and turning to the position of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord made a gesture to indicate that the listeners did not need to stand up, he closed his eyes slightly, but in fact he took everyone’s look into the field of vision, he The sons didn't even dare to exchange their eyes. Only the disciple of Beavis, the black-haired mage, removed the cup from the lips if nothing had happened. The lord knows that he has half of the elf's blood, but in terms of hair color and ochre, that part of the non-human lineage should belong to Eyre, not Singer, but how does he accompany the only son of the Singer Elf King? What? Look at the message the lord got. The source may also be traced back to Beavis, where Beavis lives in the White Tower, and is deeply loved and trusted by Alva Master of Bituminburg, everyone knows. The White Tower is the outer hub of the Silver Crown Jungle (of course, it is no longer), and if you want to find the Elf Ranger Kerry Ben in the Bibi Dyke. Alva Master's smog lodge has always been the best choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is waiting for his voice, but the unusual hatred is that the rulers of the East Crown are at this time on a plate of white tumors. Inexplicable interest, the female slave around him immediately fed a whole piece of flesh into his mouth, he chewed, the bright red juice spilled from the wide lips, not like chewing a piece of fruit, it was like chewing A piece of blood; dripping raw meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to speak, no one dares to do anything other than listening - oh, maybe to get rid of those daring guests, black hair cast The person seems to have not noticed the boring atmosphere that is similar to stagnation into a solid body. The wine glass is moved to the mouth. The people of Longhuo Island like a huge wine glass. It is good to have enough drinks in it. The only thing he uses is to use it. Made of nautilus as large as a human skull, the translucent jade shell is inlaid with rounded silver beads, and a small Fro statue is mounted on the top, but the small finger-pointed sweet peas are decorated with each piece. The petals are clearly visible, and the central part of the snail has a saddle-shaped fixing piece. It is sterling silver solid with the shape of the devil fish in the shape below, and is dotted with ten sea pearls like stars - its heavy weight And know that almost all the people in the temple are served by the slaves around them to drink the wine from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not everyone can't afford a cup, at least only one of the people in Bedwin can't do anything about it, she can't afford it. The cup, but after she lifted it, she didn't have the extra strength to keep it balanced. Fro's priest didn't want to make himself feel embarrassed at such a banquet. She was placed on the couch like a bird. The beautifully colored hairy crab claws, the golden yellow petals have purple stripes, no branches and no leaves, only huge and numerous flowers hang from the air, as long as the plum is slightly up, these flowers can cover part of her. The body and face also gave her a good chance to look at other things and people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the table of the lord and the son of the lord, the tableware placed is naturally more valuable than the guests, but Mei Mei is not envious at all, because in addition to more gems, sea pearls and heavy gold, their cups are It is made from the skull of humans (maybe young and beautiful women). Don't ask why Mei Mei knows this. In recent years, Fro also asked them for such sacrifices. Those who dare to betray their own gods, ignore her. The intention is that Pastor Froe, who has fallen into a filthy unbelievers and false believers, will die of evil, and after they die, their bodies will be incinerated and thrown into the mud, and the skull will be left behind, after a series of treatments. After making it into a lamp, the wonderful thing is that it only needs to add a little bit of whale skull wax to burn for several years. Meimi’s mother told her that the real fuel is not the whale skull wax but the rebellious soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it is true, because every time Mei Mei prays to Fro in the hall, she can hear the vague mourning. Beside her is the daughter of the false believer. At that time, she just fled away because her daughter would not be as a fan of Fro. She took off the robe of Pastor Fro, lost the golden bell, and dressed herself. It’s like a chaste woman. She married a man in a remote village and became his wife, but she rotted in a few months. It’s ridiculous, she has a good husband. Not only did he not abandon her but also exhausted her family, she invited the pastor. After that, as we can think of, the priest of Rosada knew her identity as soon as she saw the woman. He could not treat her, so the farmer would His wife was sent back to Fro's temple - his original intention was to want her to live, but what he did not expect was that he had just left the temple, and the thieves hired by Fro's pastor were affixed to him, they killed him. Also regained the daughter of the false believer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Fro priest and apprentice must "care" the false believer, in fact only to torture the poor woman for a longer time and warn them - - I don’t know what Mei Mi was shuddering when she thought of it. She didn’t know what she was confused before. She wanted to be the wife of Birdwin, no, wait, what did she think? She was so grateful for a short time. Respected and fainted, but she is now awake, and perhaps even more grateful to Baldwin and Leona, but even without Leona, she probably won’t really become a strong woman, she Maybe I really loved Bydwin and wanted him to be her, but she was not his, she was not sure, Fro was on, she refused Gülen, but it was only her heart and not her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She already knows a bit about the thieves who are not saying under the tongue, they are just small bugs hidden in the dark and wet, Birdwin Very good, he is a flame, but also the sun, he brings warmth and heat to everyone, but he will dry her, burn her wings and eyes, waiting for her will be nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
