			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost no one knows, the second day after the Midwinter, the owner of the island and his friends left the side quietly. The administrative and military powers of the island and the side islands are all in the hands of Yadel and the repairers. For this reason, the Lich has to prepare the entrusted documents and seals with their own magic marks, although if there is any change, the most important thing is strong. Norman soldiers and casters, but this is not to deal with the enemy - Yadel has received a reply from the main hall of Rosada, there will be nearly 20 Rosada's most devout followers to the side of the island However, at that time, the owner of the side island had already left, and only Yadel was left to greet them. The identity of the latter was subtle. If there was a document written by the lord himself, it could be at the necessary moment. Play a role. A book www.1kanshu<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the message sent by Master Alva, he asked if the priest of Ilmot could come to the side island to plant The “tobacco” hills are carefully watched by tenants and serfs. After all, they are related to their next year’s bread. Although the followers of Ilmot also have the power of the gods, they are better than Other priests of the gods have mercy on these poor humans and will not do anything that might cause them to be more unfortunate - so it is difficult for them to collect fresh plants to explore the possible harm to humans, and With the arrival of winter, "tobacco" has also withered, their leaves can be used as a substitute for tobacco leaves, but useless stems can only be left in the end of a filled hearth, except for these two, the priest of Ilmot almost Black small seeds can only be dug out of the soil, only the only thing they can get now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the island is different, it has no winter, and the plants used as secret medicines are still growing vigorously, the priest of Ilmot It is entirely unexpected to want to enter here. In addition, followers of Ilmot, who are willing to bear the suffering of the entire plane, are more likely to see those slaves up close. You must know that because of the teachings of Ilmot, the priests who were hated by the lords have not been allowed to appear in the Longhuo Islands for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their ideas are consistent with Kreima and Kerry, and if possible, they hope to end this cruelty. A system without humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests of Rosada Suron and Cranvo are much more peaceful than the slightly radical priests of Ilmot, who are savvy Step by step, for example, although Yadel got the promise to build the Rosada Temple and the sanctuary on the main island of the East Crown, but the reply from the main hall told him not to act rashly, the priest of the main hall is even here. The letter reminds him that Rosada's glory lies in the soul of the believer, not in the stone or in the wood. It is not sensible to ask the lord for a tall and magnificent building.壹 Read the greed of www.1kanshu - an altar, a small spring is enough, and the devout heart will also let them exude a radiant and soft light like the morning sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words are even too harsh, but Yadel knows the reason for it - the first disciple of the Patriarch is the mentor of Yadel, the former pastor of the White Tower, the dereliction of duty and death of his disciples, and the patriarch It is a pain and a remorse. He is gratified that the successor of the disciple can redeem the sin. Regaining Rosada's patronage, but also fearing that he will become savage because of the young and sudden power. It is a disaster that should not happen like Baita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalal transferred the white priest’s chief pastor to him, and the second letter of the priest’s head was lit on the whale candle and watched it burn out. The slamming flame burned his fingers, and he woke up from the reading of the secret - that swept the entire white tower and half of the catastrophic disaster. Just as deep as the brand of Yadel’s soul, he will never forget... He used to think that his second brother, Demon, united some thieves in order to seize the power that was not his own. It might be the “fine net” guild. Made this unforgivable thing - polluting the water in the Rosada sanctuary, both to spread as much as possible the bloody drug, and to fight and torment his competition opponent. Yadel didn’t know how Demon made the eldest brother appear there and was killed by himself without any resistance, but he did achieve his original goal. The father and the eldest brother were dead. Yadel was carrying a slap in the face. With two heavy charges, he managed to obtain the support of Anzhen. It became an unshakable thing to become the governor of Baita and the lord of Baita and the hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, as far as he can tell, this thing doesn’t seem as simple as he thought, maybe it’s true, he knows that Demon is dead, and Ann She sent her and Demon, the only relatives of Yadel, to his side to the side island—that is, her side is already insecure to the point where it is not even a strange place, and those The red robe warlocks and thieves walking in the White Tower...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Yadel really didn’t know what women thought, he was more willing to put the children Beside yourself, even if the child might become a pastor of Rosada in the future, it would be more reassuring than being a pastor of Fro. He was forced to find Meimei several times, just because I wanted to see how the child was, and he saw a beautiful little girl in a white sleeveless top and a squid red dress, with bracelets and bells, hands and feet in a room full of cushions and cushions. In it, whether it is longer than the whole person, it is very heavy. Huge silver platter of fruit, or carrying a giant's arm so heavy jug, or replace it with incense and spices boat, pull up the curtains or shake the sheets are a poised, happy look. A reading book www.1kanshu<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel must admit that he is extremely worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the child assured him that he had never forgotten that he was a boy. His tone of speech and words were like an adult, and that kind of disease was caused by plum. After all, it should not belong to a child's complicated eyes. When Yadel talked with him in front of him, he raised his hand and touched Yadel's face: "The mother mentioned you," he said softly: "I know that this brand is the father's brand on your face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a while: "Is it still hurt?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It wasn’t long before." Yadel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child smiled awkwardly, and Yadel found that he was not like Demon, but he was not like An Zhen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will be together soon," said Yadel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." The child said, "I am looking forward to this day," he stepped forward, clinging to the neck of Pastor Rosada, quietly at him. The ear said: "In fact, I also hate wearing a skirt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to be sad." Mei Mi said, turning a blank eye So all men are white-eyed wolves. That's right, including only three-year-olds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar and others have left the smog lodge at this time, they have not stayed in the Bibi dike for too long, after all, there is a new king who is hung by the Norman of the Highlands The top ten former Thunderbolt lords on the list, and the Alva Masters’ reception of Norman soldiers have caused dissatisfaction among many merchants and parliamentarians in Beitburg, and they do not need to provide more handles to the villains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think they can do anything." Master Alva said, while boring to chew a dried fruit, poor old mage in the last few decades Almost as long as his shisha is growing together, the hookah is more proof of his identity than his magical mark. But since his shisha was mixed into the terrible "tobacco", he even gave up the hookah. If you don't give up, even if you have expelled the toxins in your body and eliminated the short memory of that time, the old wizard found that he sometimes had the urge to try a little "tobacco". How much temptation would it be? Allow yourself to allow another mage to cast the most dangerous spells on yourself - the most important thing for a caster is the brain, and no one can guarantee that the power of the spell will affect that part - fortunately, Antonio's spellcasting skills and personal The moral character is worthy of respect from others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But relative. Without the hookah, Master Alva always felt that something was missing in his life. His mouth is always dry, or it is tidal, and the left hand always wants to grab something, so after several failures, the Master of Bibi Dyke simply hangs on his belt. A dimension bag is different from other pockets with magical casting materials and reels. This Dimensional bag is filled with all kinds of delicious dried fruits. When the Master feels uncomfortable, he will catch a hand and put it in his mouth. Then, no accident, his weight is rising in proportion to the wear of the teeth. Pity him. Several of the Master's robes have to be redone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are businessmen. As long as there is interest, even if you go to the Biyindi Fortress, they will be silent." Master Alpha said, just now What he put into his mouth was apricot, sticky and sour, and his face was distorted: "When they knew they wanted to take care of the output of an entire island - they could drown a whole If you buy cane sugar and beet sugar, they will be as sweet as your sugar for 20 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really my place. Hope." The Lich said that the merchants on the side of the island have long bored him. It is better for him to be able to take care of this trouble, and Alvara can be said to be his ally. His position is also a powerful deterrent against the potential enemy of the side island. In any case, Bibi Dibao is the nearest city to the side island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a slight squeak, the blue light forms a door in the void, and this high-level positioning transmission spell will send them directly to the Starlight River. The elves were waiting for them there - Antonio Master took back the hands that cast the spells and smiled at Kremar. "May the light of the magical galaxy shine on your way, child," he said softly. "But any At the time, remember your heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who once sneaked at him, as a thank you and a gift, he is no longer the one just now Leaving the port of Point, there is no reputation and experience for the little wizard, although in order to avoid mistakes, he still respects the Alva Master and the Antonio Master, but there is no need to be as respectful as the first time to visit Bibi Tibao. The land was seen as a high-ranking mage in the capacity of a disciple - but it is still a child who will occasionally have a toothache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They step into the portal, Cremari is the first, the last one is the gnome McGee, the gnome is not as jealous and disgusting as the dwarf, but McGee was the first to leave from the transmission spell cast by a strange mage. He hesitated, or stepped into the invisible door drawn by the blue line. He turned his head and glanced at it. Alva Master Just raise your hand and swing gently to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
