			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather in the season of lilac is not very cold, but the Norman Highlands is located in the north, and the coldness of the night still makes people want to huddle back to the furnace. Impulse. It is conceivable that people who were pulled out from the hot white bear skin and the mouse skin blanket at this time would not be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially for a king, and in every toast, he drank the rotted wine or winter wine inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he can’t scream for his soldiers to beat or hang the one who dares to disturb him, because the person who tortures him is not someone else’s My sister-in-law, Princess Principal, simply pulled him out of the quilt in an impetuous manner—the pulling method of one arm and one leg. After all, the King’s Majesty was as big as her four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?" asked the king, holding his head and feeling that there was a group of brightly dressed gnomes who screamed at the cymbals and drums and sacrificed their gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your good lord, and your good brother!" Diane said dissatisfiedly, she was aware of her careful thoughts, but she really did not Understand why he had to get such a squat thing - Morton Donkley is not without a distant relative. If poor old Morton is out of his own little selfishness and is unwilling to let Dylan inherit his territory, the twelve families also I can't find a second Don Cray - she said that the pedigree is traceable, although Diane doesn't know how to get them, but in any case, it is better than I don't know from the wife's skirt. The little bastard is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king grabbed a silver pot on the cupboard and took a sip of it, filled with honey and water with mint leaves. The wine was used to hangover and eliminate the hangover sequelae. He was a little awake, shaking his body and grabbing the servant's shoulder and standing on the bedpost. With the help of the other two servants, he put on it. The wool pullover that was taken off a while ago, wrapped in a silver rat skin, a servant wanted to wear a gold necklace for him, and he refused by waving his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it?" he asked as he stumbled down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know very well about the specific situation," Diane replied: "It seems like that... people want to kill the Earl of Kel, but you know The protector of the Earl of Kel is Fukai, and Fukai is just with John, then John stopped him, but that person... thank you for his favor, he obviously has forgotten, he turned to a duke , oh..." She swallowed "the heirs of a kingdom": "Raise the weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard a mess." The king said: "Why did Badwin kill Kel? They have nothing to do with it. How is Fukai and John together?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John wants to ask if Fukai can help him buy more slaves - 2,000 soldiers will be struggling even if they are a duke. As for that person, who knows?" Diane said indifferently: "The inferior always loves to go crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if a servant ran quickly to ignite the torch, the chill in the corridor was still The king shook his head, and he tightened the big sister. Fortunately, as the king’s younger brother, the residence of the Duke of John was not far from the king’s room. To be precise, it was a tightly adjacent tower that was connected by a ramp. ——According to the written and unwritten rules of Norman Norman, they belong to the heirs of the king and the king. If the king can obtain the support of the nobility, modify the inheritance law, and let the daughter inherit the title and territory of the father, then live in the future. This is not the Duke of John. Princess Liao Na. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where things happened is not in the bedroom of the Duke of John - Fukai is neither a young girl and John is more inclined to talk to a gentle lady. Love, they talked on the second floor of the tower, a more secretive living room, and a fireplace with a flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is large and there is not much furniture - a round table, three chairs and a writing desk, a storage box, two holding brass The statue of the bottle is all equipped here, so it is empty, but not shabby. The ground is covered with a pure black giant wolf skin, with head, limbs and tail, and the eyes are replaced with yellow beeswax. There are colorful silk carpets hanging on the wall. Although the fluorspar is not suspended on the zenith, the cetyl candle lit by the chandelier with forty-eight lamp arms can still illuminate the entire room. The Earl of Kel, hiding himself behind Fukai and the Duke of John, and the Lord of the Thunder, the Count of Birdwin, stood opposite them. As Princess Diane said, he took a wide sword, which was given by His Majesty the King. His handle, the king recognized, because the sword has a pattern like a black and white snake, and a stone embedded in its weight ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Duke of John held a one-handed sword. Well, it’s not that the king doesn’t like his brother. In all fairness, it’s just that you want to rely on this victory over Birdwin. An impossible thing - in order to cater to the arm of John Duke, the one-handed sword was cast by expensive Mithril, and its width and length were inferior to its kind. In order to further reduce the weight, the dwarf craftsman did not even Dare to set the gemstones on top, but just engrave the pattern on the hilt and fill it with gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Duke of John’s hand was trembling, but it didn’t matter. He just wanted to show his attitude. When he saw the king coming in, he immediately dropped the tip of the sword, and Birdwin followed closely, at the king. In front of the aristocracy can handle weapons, but if you dare to lift the tip of the sword, it is a rebellious one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin looks terrible, pale and his hair unkempt, his clothes are soaked in blood, and the wounds seem to have healed initially - He should have prayed to Tyre for a small treatment, and the king looked carefully and turned his attention to the Duke of John and the Earl of Kel, who did not think that these two people could make Birdwin so embarrassed - the bard The lord who once praised Thunderbolt has the wild deer-like dexterity and the astonishing balance of the sheep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing King Baldwin’s uncontrollable thoughts about what Diane said to him...the ridiculous stupidity, this is impossible, he said to himself But he did get upset for a while, and just got sleepy and was woken up by Diane - he couldn't even blame her, because the situation is really only he can handle, but he has to say, There was a little over in Baldwin. A Viscount wanted to kill an ear and point the sword at a duke. This is not the right he should have. This right belongs to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that he said that he gave Bedwin too much privilege - but he really couldn't find a second Bedwin - - There is hardly any trustworthy person around him. They are not from that family or from this family. Only Bydwin is a lofty man with no background and no ambition. He is also a loyal follower of the god of justice and justice. The same is true of his knight, Morton Don Clay, who is available - but if Diane is true, Leona really... the king is turning over and over, looking for a replacement for Bywin The person, in the end, has nothing to gain, which makes his heart involuntarily anxious, like a devil dig a piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruler of Norman Norman has to work hard again to calm down the confusion in his mind, he almost succeeded, if not his daughter Leo Na hastily arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona rushed into the room and searched in confusion. Her eyes swept past the Duke of John, the Earl of Kel, and Fukai. On Bedwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Byrdwin can't be said to be good-looking, no, even the cleanliness can't be said, it looks like a murderous ghost possessed by a demon, King I thought, but he only saw sincere, gentle pity and sympathy in his daughter's eyes, although she soon wanted to move away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart sank violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me," the king asked. "What happened? Let my brother, my courtier, be loyal to me, let the Highlands Norman most The heroic knights tried to kill each other?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," the Duke of John gave a shallow embarrassment to his brother, "I just want to Fukai talked about things and played chess. Suddenly, the Earl of Korgar rushed in, kneeling at the foot of Fukai, praying for protection, and then... the Viscount slammed into the room extremely rudely... and asked Fukai to surrender The Earl of Kel, Fukai refused, and then, as you can see," he said with no irony: "A viscount came up to the two counts and a duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have anything to say?" The king turned to Bedwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked for a duel with the Earl of Kel," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The King asked inexplicably, the Earl of Kel is a beautiful young man who has never been to the battlefield. He has no territory, so it is impossible to What is the grievance of Devin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Panne is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king frowned and thought, oh, yes , Penny, Baldwin's wife, the king did not have any impression of her. When he was in Rebecca, Penny was in the village where Bedwin had lived. After he became king, Birdwin sent Penny. Wang Du, but how can a king be interested in a woman who is not as good as his maidservant, whether it is from appearance or cultivation? He never called her, even the reward for Birdwin is direct. Sent to Reyburgh instead of his home in Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry, Byrdwin, but what does this have to do with the Earl of Kel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "He lured her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" The king was surprised to see the Earl of Kel, it is hard to imagine, this seemingly normal young aristocrat actually There are so weird hobbies,... Of course, I’m sorry for Baldwin, but this is not a rare thing in the king’s, yes, he seems to hear that Penny is dead – then he’s dead, he Slightly annoyed to think that a strong husband killed someone else's wife, if his wife is a noble, it may be a little trouble, but Baldwin's wife is just a spinning girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed. "The Earl of Kel... I think you should apologize to Viscount Birdwin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have done that," Earl said sincerely: "The problem is that he doesn't seem to want to accept it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not an apology!" Birdwin growled: "It's a shame." How dare you... How can you! She is pregnant with your child, and for you want to kill me! She loves you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes "The Earl of Kel smiled and opened his hands: "But what does it have to do with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king blamed the Earl of Kel, reproachfully But what made him even more headache was Baldwin, the damn stubborn bullfight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of Thunderbolt did not hesitate to kneel to the person he was loyal to, "I ask you," he said hoarsely: "I ask you My master, my king, please take back all the rewards you have given me, all... every, gold coins, land, castle, title, armor and sword, I no longer need these - my only request, Your Majesty," he looked at the Earl of Kel: "I only want to fight with the Earl of Kel, only his blood can wash away the shame, mine, my wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next king is really distressed, Count Earl, a count who has only a title but no seal, there are many such young people in the king, because their territory was taken back by the king for various reasons. Or escrow - the king let them live in the outer city of the king or the king, give them gold coins, slaves, houses and manors, allow them to squander and guarantee their happiness, he can not let Birdwin kill Earl of Kelly - the king does not want to be taken tomorrow morning. Nobles surrounded by fear, to demand the return of their territory or to leave the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will have a wife," after a long time, the king said: "Bedwin, I will give you the title of the count as soon as possible - you will get a Young and beautiful wife, a woman of noble descent, good character, intelligent and lovely, her blood will flow in your child's body, you can choose by yourself, as far as I know, many counts and marquis have brought Their daughter or niece, I promise that her father and uncle will happily marry her to you, with a rich dowry, Byrdwin, no matter which one you look at..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Birdwin said categorically: "I will not take back my request - sire, no matter how beautiful, how noble or how beautiful the girl is." Smart, I only have one wife, that is Penny. I beg you..." He raised his sword flatly: "Only for this request, please allow me. I can swear to Tell, it will be a fair Duel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not damn fair! The king thought, a delicate little petal boy facing a Tyre knight who had fought the orcs for fifteen years, and the result was not conceived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The king refused harshly: "That is just a despicable inferior! The gods are on!" He raised his voice: "Byder Wen, she is short, ugly, stupid, she can't even keep her chastity for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is my wife!" Birdwin is equally determined The attitude responded: "I love her, kneel, only her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let me down! Bywin!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What disappoints me is you! Birdwin did not introduce this sentence to his lips, but his painful eyes and expressions have already explained everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes the King more restless is that he can feel that someone is taking a step forward behind him - his right side is Diane, and left On the side is Liona, who arrived later. It was Leona. The king panicked. If he really thought, his daughter wanted to plead for Baldwin—not to calm his anger, but to satisfy Birdwin’s wish; if she really ignores the key to the matter, allowing a viscount to be a woman—even if she is a wife of Birdwin, but it’s just a serf, and fights with a count and kills the latter. ... Then, in the future, after his daughter becomes the owner of Norman in the Highlands, will he give him more things? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before there was no stupidity to take off his crown to the queen who was worn on the husband’s head. The king thought with trepidation, will Leona be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will, the king thinks, she will, her love for Baldwin can even annihilate the woman’s nature, she should be Penny’s, But she can control herself just because she loves Baldwin - but he can't let her have the opportunity to make this feeling public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you insist, then... I replied..." The king said in a hurry, and the face of Earl of Kelly suddenly became blue and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Princess Leona!" he suddenly shouted. "Princess Leona! - Are you watching your lover kill a person who loves you deeply? Just because you want to please him?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole room suddenly fell into a terrible silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king’s face slowly rose red because of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" The Norman ruler of the Highlands said slowly, full of threats, but the Earl of Kale suddenly changed. It became a blind man and became a fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Princess Leona," he said without hesitation: "...do I still go on?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what you are saying." Leona said that the Earl of Kel's sight was like a frog staring at a bug, making her feel sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go out," said the King, "You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Masters from the Shadows When they came out, they bowed to the king and walked out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And yours." The king looked at John and Fukai sullenly, so after they briefly bowed their heads, the other two mages were also one After the curtain came out from the silk carpet that blocked the wall, Diane also followed and went out. Although she was very curious, she always felt that it was better to stay away from the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also closed the door intimately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's say, Count Earl," the king said quietly: "... Leona, close your mouth before I say yes." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was approaching Penny at the death of Princess Leona, that is the poor little idiot - because the princess fell in love with her husband." The Earl of Kelly twisted his fingers: "She ordered me to confuse the woman, keep her away from her husband, run away with me, hide it or something else, and then stop appearing in Bedwin and her." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible!" Birdwin shouted in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princess Leona cast a grateful glance at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
