			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little tail added in the last chapter, I am afraid some adults can't see it. , so repeat here (less than five hundred words, no billing, don't worry). :../<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich left a slender gold stiletto outside the change and wrapped it in the swamp, as a He can't attack when only a soft mud monster, but if another soft mud monster is willing to swallow the sword, it is another matter that the magic attached to the fine gold dagger violently counterattacks when the short sword is corroded. The flame will evaporate the inside of the melted monster in one breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the toughest rejection ever, the soul of the outside world commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big "jelly" has shrunk with the naked eye, through translucent, The skin of a fish gelatin can see the magical gold dagger with the handle. It is unique to the gold, and the blue-and-white radiant glue melts the body madly and continually transforms into various The strange shape finally slammed out the hard, sharp, and hot bones. Finally, it sadly "looked" at the "Italian" who is now more than three times larger than it is. The snoring of his intentions quickly left the line of sight of the Lich and the alien soul in a rolling manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer’s chocolate mud monster sticks out a tentacles, rolling up a fine gold dagger that still carries the burning energy, which can’t be called In a body where the solid is not completely liquid, the strange soul of the alien world can now see the sword as if his eyes have been transferred to the body. The dangerous weapon has not been in the belly for a long time. But its light is not as bright as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you think about preparing first, um, this? The alien soul asked curiously and made a gesture to represent the explosion. It did not know whether the lich had read the meaning of the gesture from his memory, but obviously, it did not interpret countless spell gestures. The dead are no more difficult than breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are a warlock, and the lich says carelessly. But I suggest that you better still be able to study the wizard's spells and the priest's magic so that when your enemy is standing in front of you, cursing and making gestures, you still wish that they are singing. I will listen to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a dragon arrogant, I am sorry, the soul of the outside world complains. You have to give me time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our time is almost the same, once the undead said, after he hesitated for a while, but considering that there will be no second melt Ghosts come to court, and he feels that talking to the idiot occasionally is also a harmless thing. I cast a spell that turns our body into a mud monster. He explained that in the swamp, mud monsters are the most taboo enemies of all creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how do you know that we will encounter swamps? The soul of the alien world asks, when you prepare the spell? Have you used a prophetic spell? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose this spell not because I foresee that we will face a dirty mud, the Lich said that this spell is used to invade and escape. Yes, mud monsters immunize a lot of damage, as you have seen before, and it can pass through most of the gap. Even if they are as thin as a piece of parchment or only hold the foot of a beetle; the weakness is that you can't attack or cast spells when you use this spell, or the spell will be dealt with immediately. And your clothes and other items, as long as you are with you when casting spells, will also be converted to mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you left the dagger outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to be prepared, the Lich said, fortunately, in the swamp, many creatures like to swallow, no matter what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me guess, you should be more than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so happy, child. The undead who once said falsely said that you are getting smarter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world makes a face to the depths of the sea. Is your spell enough? It asked straightforwardly, I thought you would never rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After driving a group of bats, I can't use a few spells. I also have a scroll potion wand and a staff. The Lich said, but I think I need to remind you that rushing and acting is a completely different matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the soul of the outside world asks, what makes you decide to make this decision? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich closed his mouth because he was stupid enough to be told by the cohabiters. He firmly believed that he was infected by the stupidity of the guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't forget that we are together. After a while, the Lich said that I am doing something that is good for both of us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that you have moderation, the soul of the opposite world said helplessly, I don’t want to be pulled up suddenly, the taste is not so good, just because you did The bad thing is to be shut down by the great existence that cannot be said by even the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they didn’t talk to anyone, the lich manipulated the chocolate mud to reverse the direction of the swamp, some were rolled down by the mud, and it was weak. The radiant moss or insects occasionally illuminate an area. This flowing swamp is about a few thousand feet. Although its depth has become ridiculous after being transferred to this place, the soul of the outside world can still estimate its original. The depth can be seen from the monsters that are about to run aground. They are huge, with claws and fangs. The specific species are difficult to distinguish. For example, a monster that looks like a otter is covered with crocodile scales. A, with countless tiny tentacles, no tail, and a head with no eyes and ears at both ends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also a lot of small creatures, their shapes are strange and strange, when they are crowded together, you will think they are "one" Monsters, the souls of different worlds have seen such a giant worm, which is smaller than the gift of singularity, but the number is very large, and it can feed a dwarf of almost a whole pit. As for the other, the outside world The soul is completely out of name, but it notices that the lich will catch a part of it and carry it in the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul in the opposite world can’t help it anymore. I want to ask the kind of red lips, like crab-like creatures, can’t eat, okay? When you eat, can you eat it, the flow of the swamp suddenly accelerates, and even if you hide it in the depths of the sea, you can feel it. The various creatures in the mud are mixed. A fresh reed flows through them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We arrived, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the swamp is a narrow tunnel that allows only one person to walk through, not a tall, strong adult male like Birdwin. Even plum and Gülen must keep their heads down and sideways. Passing through the tunnel is a room, very square, the walls and the rocks on the ground are polished very smooth, just like the room on the ground. The top is suspended with broken shackles, complete sets of furniture, but no beds, like reading and copying, with empty bookshelves on both sides, a copy table used by the Master is moved to the center of the room, topped With a large bowl of obsidian, the mud emerges from the bowl, and the life contained in it is reduced by the magic, and it grows invisibly when it falls to the ground. But the biggest is not so big, the soul of the outside world suspects that they will not return to the original size until they exit the tunnel, which will prevent the tunnel from being blocked, and let them be well-blooded in the swamp. Killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mud accumulated in the room is always maintained at a stable height. The Lich notices that the opposite side of the room is a black oak door with a beautifully carved pattern. The previous spell, cast another, carefully observed before casting the third spell to open the door and then quickly close it, some mud rushed out, but the outside is dark. They didn't encounter any enemies worth mentioning. Only a few grievances floated around doing nothing. When they saw the lich, they wanted to scream and scream. The undead who used to screamed. The invisible forces swept silently, and their call signs were annihilated in their throats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich involuntarily wants to sigh, this is one of the many spells he has been able to cast so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the deserted corridor, quietly recalling his residence. Every lich’s mansion has some similarities, giving a chestnut. They will set up portals in various places that you can't think of, or inscriptions that carry spells, sometimes used by them to escape, and sometimes used to punish their apprentices and kill intruders. The copying room of the swamp is not the local master. A lich's study and copying room will not be so safe, but it will not be far from his residence. He needs to monitor and appear in front of the apprentice anytime, anywhere, warning and torture. They, no, may be far away from unwitting people, but for the undead who presided over the construction of this underground palace, it may be just a place to be able to reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich took a reel from the pocket of the divorce, and tore it open, the magical light flashed in the darkness, and the outline of the door appeared. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portal, he said, but disappointingly, the portal has been damaged and cannot be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also found a rune plate, which is also able to send people somewhere, but the gem above appears cracked, the power of magic is still flowing, but The lich didn't dare to take risks, and how terrible the accident caused by the spell-like spells was, he already understood and felt it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich who was forcibly dismissed went to another room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Asmodeos!" Demon shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He probably only waited a few heartbeats and began to get impatient. The fingers wearing a gemstone ring violently tapped on the table, without any rhythm. He said, he looked at his fingers. They were like other people. They were not obedient at all. He raised his hand and his fingertips trembling on his wrist. "What happened?" he muttered, he remembered clearly. Not long ago they could make thousands of subtle gestures: "Is it magic?" He asked: "Is it still poison?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, He smiled smugly, he was protected, by the insidious thieves and the powerful red robe, and the devout priest, in Baitata, he was safe and worried, and he was more than anyone else. comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand slipped down his waist, he was looking for his whip, inserted in the belt, he was going to read the spell, read the little devil The real name, summon it to the eye, and then torture it in every way he can think of, listening to it's screaming can't stop, he fumbled, but only found one layer after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster screamed angrily, he jerked open the table and wanted to jump from the chair, but he finally failed, he panted, one The syllable reads a spell in a syllable. He thinks that the spell has failed, but with a static squeak, a little devil with a fluff and a long tail is picked out from the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appeared on an unprecedented courtesy, "My master," it screamed urgently: "Your slave is here waiting for you." "Commanded!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too slow!" Demon scolded angrily. He wanted to cast a spell that would make the little devil into a flame, but how could he I can't remember those spells, and he can't find the whip, so he can only throw an empty bottle to the little devil as punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil caught the heavy crystal bottle agilely, and it also had a pure gold lid. This made Demon more angry. He decided to cut off the tail of the little devil after getting the answer he wanted. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anzhen...how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As always," the little devil screamed It’s a pity to lick the bottle and make a good liqueur. “As always, my esteemed master is with her children.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“She Is there anything out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She went for a walk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Stay in his cradle," said the little devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at them," Demon said. "But now, come over." He smiled viciously. "I want to cut your tail."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the little devil stayed in place, motionless, not only did not follow his orders, but also deliberately stretched out his tail and shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorrow of the White Tower Archon rose to the highest point, and the out-of-control flame made him shout out the real name of the little devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos trembled a bit, but still did not move, just tightened the long, spiked tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Demon didn’t drink so much alcohol, he might still have a little precarious mind, but he was already stunned by Alcohol and Fro’s pastor. Head, he didn’t choose to run away from the first time. Whether he jumped from the tower or tore a reel, he grabbed a bottle of gold and inserted a purple-red sweet pea. , swaying to the little devil, want to knock it into a pancake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil is in extreme pain, but for the little devil, this pain can only be said to be a game or a joke, it can endure it out The wings flew into the air, and the tail stabbed Demon's eyes and hooked the eyes. Like the innocent children, they pulled it out and ate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
