			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say that the tongue of the jester is more slippery than lard, more beautiful than the feathers of the birds, and more vicious than the saliva dripping from the python. But in front of the Grenada, the tongue of the jester is like a frozen lard, the broken feathers and the venom put in the flame lose all the advantages, but his courage is not without return. The lion's beast that was quieted down by him, he will not form a fatal threat to the Grand Duke and his officials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Grenada people looked at the jester, and then glanced behind him: "Who is Dagong?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtiers looked at Dagong, the ruler of this territory stood up with the help of others, stroking his chest and casting a look at the mage by the cover of the courtiers. The mage shook his head slightly, and he did not tell the Grenada Grand Council to meet them. It was unnecessary and would make him feel ashamed - the Grenada people could find him, but he could not find Greiner. Daren, even if he can, he does not have enough courage to disturb a Dragon Warlock, they are known to be irritable and irritable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong went forward, but none of the knights came down from their mounts, they were condescending, overlooking the Grand Duke, like a court judge overlooking the sinner Dagong didn’t think that he was deeply stunned. His brother died in the hands of these people. He was not angry about this. After all, this brother gave him more humiliation than interest, but he absolutely did not want these. People think that he is resentful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We should complete the task as soon as possible, then return to where we should be.” With a bard Singing, jokes, jokes, entertainers, and banquets, a dragon tooth knight whispered unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think the first thing we should do is to make sure we can go somewhere. As for where I am, I don't care very much," his companion said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't think that because the Highness chose us, we should be loyal to him." The previous Dragon Knight asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companion looked at him with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Grenada, the smile is often not a smile, it can include a lot of things, the knight’s companion is too lazy to explain too much to him, for example, they From being selected by His Highness, Mr. Kremar, he stood on the same stand with him—who would choose to have an enemy rather than a friend standing around, especially if he knew that the task was not secure? But he knows that most of their respect for His Highness comes from his mounts - given that the warlocks still can't figure out what the drugs that would make the lions and lions die, let alone Find out where it came from, and from what people. However, this highness does not seem to be very concerned about it. His arbitrary desire is based on his powerful strength. He did not pick out those who were conquered by him like the red dragon, just like a naive child. A few nice-looking berries were taken from a rattan basket called the Legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are willing to work for him, of course, this is good, but if they don’t, then the Highness will not be kind enough to let the traitor complete the whole Leaving yourself, or saying, because His Highness Seremal is always very gentle, he will always be highly vigilant - if he only makes a lot of noise like Kelmen or Kelsey, On the contrary, it is better to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong naturally will not complain about the gentleness of Kremar, he has no ambition, although he also supports a mage, but this mage can be said to be Objects like masters, not very enthusiastic about magic, power or strength - when Dagong's brother is still alive, every visit he makes these two headaches. To be honest, they are very worried that the Greinada people will use human flesh and blood to crush a terrible path in the kingdom to show their power. Fortunately, there are no eagle lions that are said to feed humans. After the feasts of the catering officials offered a fat burdock, they also showed a very satisfied look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because the proportion of human bones and meat is not in line with our aesthetics," said the human face lion beast. "Of course, if that This kind of is quite suitable for our spleen and stomach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised a paw and pointed to the food officer who was hiding in the corner to peep at them, no matter where, the chef almost Not to be hungry, the catering officer who manages the kitchen is not to mention, the slaves and the lions and beasts heard a fierce cry, and they saw the meal officials escaping from their sights. This time, even the slaves showed a slight smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keou showed a surprised look. If these slaves say that they are different from other slaves, they are very clean. Obviously, they are also one of the meals provided to the lion beast. Keou can’t understand how someone would treat them. The people who give the beasts are still not resentful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," a man older than the talking slave said: "In winter we are allowed to live with livestock, mainly pigs, they are very Warm, and we can still eat the remaining drowning water. If you are sick, you can get rid of the mill and the goods, and die, you can be buried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It seems that he did a good job.” Ke Ogan Baba said, at least better than the slaves of Grenada, the soul and body will be reused after the death of the slaves of Grenada, and they will be complained by the warlocks. Poor color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich certainly knows that his team may even have a person who is willing to be loyal to him. No, but this is really nothing, the selfishness of the Dragon’s blood carries the Grenada people who do not know what to pay, even Greed, their gods and mothers, their dedication It is also a reward for repayment. If the compensation is not enough to satisfy them, or if there is not enough power to make them fear, then even the only remaining red dragon will fall into the most tragic situation. After all, she is extremely precious. Rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still immersed myself in the beautiful imagination of dissecting the Red Dragon, or that the Lich never regards it as an imagination, but as a preparation and The plan, although his road has produced some deviations, but he believes that one day he will put his hands into the hot red blood of the red dragon, and win her strong and strong heart - the dark dragons along the flat gallery As the road went forward, Dagong wisely gave up his entire palace. His palace was a square building with a flat square and a circular courtyard in the middle. It looked very cute and brought With a little leisure and exquisiteness, the lion-headed lions chose to rest in the courtyard, and their masters lived in the two wings of the palace, and the room of the grandfather and wife belonged to the leader of the knights. It's very wide, but it's not extravagant. It may also be because of Dagong's personal preference. The focus is almost comfortable, so that there is no table for reading and writing. They are eager to know where they moved from. One Like a heavy stone grew desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world stretches out and wakes up. It feels a little uncomfortable to sleep in the sea. It "sees" the lich to reach out. On the table, I stroked it a few times. With a slight rolling sound, the table was tilted at an angle, and then the two seemingly decorated gold inlays jumped up, and the Lich wrote a hand. It slides smoothly from the head to the other end, and is close to your companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——A copy table for the caster, the Lich said, he closed his eyes slightly and touched a small finger on the raised relief with his fingertips. Point, it was carved into a pearl of Medusa, rotated seven times, there are three small drawers jumped out of the relief, the panels of the drawer are irregular, respectively, two snakes and one rolled together The palms of the front, the drawers are still placed in the scorpion and the bottle, some have been spoiled, but the gem powder and some things that can last for a long time are still shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The dragon scales, the lich is eager to say that this table exists longer than he thought, this is the broken scale of Jinlong, you must know The first to leave this plane is the Golden Dragon, and even if they are still there, Jinlong is also the most difficult dragon in the dragon group. Even the evil red dragon can't resist their magic. He is like being confused. I usually reach out and then stop when there is a gap between the bottle and the hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this scorpion will curse, it must be old and savage. The soul of the alien world thinks, of course, knowing that the lich is not stupid enough to be confused by a bottle of dragon scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pause was only a moment, the bottle was lifted up, and at that moment, a group of darkness jumped up, "Aha!" The little devil who hides himself in the shadows screams with joy, flutters up, and suddenly pops up from the fluffy hamster body not only beyond the original body, but can even swell to the darkness that can annihilate the entire dragon The red mouth is completely engulfed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I must say that this scene is not only terrible, but also a little funny, the soul of the outside world said that the little devil seems to have no way to immediately melt the "thing" It lay on the carpet on his back, his stomach rising, looking like a hair ball, and it took a lot of effort to find its nose, claws and tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
