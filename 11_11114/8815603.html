			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Orc? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--You don’t think that the orcs who are swaying in the Port of Mind and the Gray Ridge grow out of the ground like potatoes, the Lich says, they are also From the mother's belly with a bloody hot climb, there are homeland, a god of faith and priests, an army, a ruler, no king - but perhaps soon, in that accident... He glanced at the soul of the opposite world. When it was not happening, the news that a soul brought to me said that among the thousands of tribes, the strongest of the dozens of clan are preparing to unite, like human beings. The establishment of the country, this thing has been continued to this day, only because they are fighting for the throne that must be only one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The territory of the orc is located on the north side of the Dragon Mountains. It spreads throughout the mountains, but the largest number of tribes are basically cruising in the screaming plains at the foot of the Longji Mountains. They are used to invading the south before the broadleaf trees have lost all the leaves, filling their stomachs with the wealth and flesh of the aliens. Feeding your own people to spend the harsh and long winter in the screaming plains... If the god of winter, Oulul, is willing to give compassion to humanity, she will use blizzard, wind and energy every time as she used to. The low temperature of the steel is covered by the cold ridge, or only the dragon's abdomen where the Thunderbolt is located. Blizzard will bury the road and the pit, cover the cliff, blur the line of sight; the wind will push the feet and hooves that are not stable. The swaying body and the crunchy ice and snow make them unable to move; the terrible low temperature will freeze the whole army overnight - the orcs have not crossed the dragon's abdomen for ten years, if this time is like the elf Place Measured, they got a warm winter, then Fort Thunder humans may be forced to face the surging tide of hunger and crazy orcs had wrought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- So they are asking for help from the elves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——As long as they give them a reason, the elves are always worthy of sticking out their claws. The undead who once sneered, the range covered by the silver crown jungle Even over the Longji Mountains, although the jungle at the end of the mountain has been cut down by the orcs, it does not mean that they are willing to look at the densely ended side of the vegetation, they burn the jungle to get from the silver crown tree. Get precious Mithril, invade the elves' palaces to plunder wealth, and elves, as they do to humans; no, they hate elves more than humans, human males have the opportunity to be slaves, humans Women will also be left with a life-threatening tool, and only those who are dying and useless will be slashed, cooked and cooked as the food of the army - but all the elves, no matter how noble you are. Identity or a beautiful appearance will be used by their priests to worship the gods of the orcs... Before the sacrifice, the sacrifices will inevitably be insulted and tortured by the long and cruel, and the orcs believe in the sacrifice. The more screaming and mourning, the more clearly they can get the favor of their gods. In the end, they cut off the hands and feet of the sacrifice, dig out the internal organs other than the heart, facial features, peel off the whole body skin, and put it clean. Blood, and imprisoned its soul in the blood of the soul before it loses the last temperature - your expression makes me feel sick, stupid, what are you thinking about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Hey... I was just thinking, that, when you said this... always look... extraordinarily excited? The soul of the outer world scornfully commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Because this is my most loved job, the Lich says that it’s a sneak peek, of course, you can’t understand, it’s normal – good Well, in this case, we don't have to waste each other's time. You only need to know that the south side of the dragon's belly mouth has a city of elves in addition to the human city, that is, the one they never allow non-elf to enter. The souls of the world heard the gloating that was about to overflow, so the elves had a covenant with the king of the Tyre Knights who swore allegiance. The owner of Thunder Castle did not seek help, but asked them to fulfill the agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-War? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the discussion in the sea came to an end, the conversation abroad was coming to an end, and both Bywin and Kerry were broad and bold. People, although to a certain extent, the ranger and the knight can be regarded as high-ranking people, but they do not think this will affect their own life, so the conversation between the two is short and bright, neither There is no insincere and no swear words - but this is also related to their not being the ultimate decision-makers. Their duty is to complete what they know and to go back and bring them to the people who swear allegiance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen a more luxurious wedding than this?" Cavalier Byrdwen asked, but apparently he did not need an answer: "If it is a I also believe in the wedding of the Duke or the King - the nearly 40-year-old contest of 500 knights; hundreds of bards, harlequins and bears, monkey-players; the number can be compared with the former The priests and crickets of the beautiful Fro, are full of flowers and brocades, gifts for the guests; free liqueur and bread... the price is as low as the ice given... whether it is the dwarf's saltpeter or the wizard's spells The cost of making them is not too low."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage," Kerry Ben said: "Demon is a mage, he recently gave white The tower recruited more mages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hate the Master," Birdwin holds the gold cup and thoughtfully says, "I don't like it either." Demon, I think it’s a coincidence that happened to him – look, his father fell in the man-made riot The wall, his little brother madly killed his brother, and he, he ended the riot, cured people's madness, and gained the trust and love of everyone in Baita. And it is logical to put the whole city in a bag." He drank a spicy and sweet liquid: "Do you think he will be a good ruler? You know, although I am thousands of miles away, I have heard him. The name, even in the Master, his gloomy and eccentric is quite famous - and he does not like the elves, does not care to show it, he can even say that he hates you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about that," Kerry said indifferently: "He doesn't dare to do anything, and can't do anything any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I think in Baita," Birdwin said bluntly: "Your decision is wrong from the beginning - you should not let people participate in the management of the White Tower, and should not agree with the proposal of the lord. In exchange for his daughter, a half-elf to become the lord in exchange for his brother's lifelong and inheritable rule of the White Tower - a woman!" He shook his head: "This is really a big mistake, a hand holding a scepter The woman is just as bad as a man who will have a baby." He sighed and said with sincerity: "Hey, they are always confused by jewellery and sweet words, and then easily send themselves and everything that they have. - The army, the land, and the people are no more lovable to them than a small flower with dew - they are themselves a small flower, you can pamper them and protect them, but you must never give them right Even if they deal with their own rights, because they can always get things out of control, you can never imagine that a knight will not point the sword to his heart, but they can dig their hearts out. Give someone else to step on it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is her choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wrong Choice," Birdwin said categorically: "I can see her ending. Demon will soon abandon her. After he has such a great power, do you know that he is on his behalf?" The documents of the hills? He will get more wonderful beauty, more mages and the army, more wealth - if Demon wants to maintain a certain degree of dealing with you, she will give birth to one or two The child dies; if Demon does not want to continue to maintain contact with the elves, then she and her children will not be spared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is her Choose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin smiled, he laughed The gray eyes were shiny and beautiful: "The elf is a creature that people can't fully understand," he said, raising his glass and saying "please forgive me." "People sometimes say that you are very tolerant, but I think that you are not tolerant, but rather harsh in another way - especially for your half-family," he glanced at the dark-haired child: "Be able to test from your test." It’s too hard to get a good one, especially if you don’t even want to make it clear.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But this is not impossible, "Kerry's look is as usual: "Is it, Cremari? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
