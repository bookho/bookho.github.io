			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a human baby, the kind of scent that makes you sip a bite, like a female lion Especially the lure of the temptation of the buttocks, especially during the breeding period, they can almost see the fat and boneless meat and the same degree of deliciousness. Two eagle-faced lions unconsciously opened their mouths, and saliva flowed out of their teeth, infiltrating the rough sands - Keou pumped his nose, and his claws scratched the roots of the wings a few times. The powder in the scorpion slammed into the breeze and fell opposite the two idiots. They had lost their vigilance, their eyes were scattered, they lay on their backs, their claws swayed unconsciously, and their tongues were pulled out. Itchy, but as it is said, nominally he is now a group with these birds, otherwise he can play a few stomachs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it was discovered that the wrong patrol squad ran over, Keou had already left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those two days, the lion-faced lion was suddenly scared by the male lion body beast that suddenly jumped out, and the male lion body beast The opening remarks can be said that there is no change: "Hey, brother, do you want some excitement?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------- —————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keou returned to the black-haired dragon At the time, his body also exuded the smell of "catnip". When he returned to the courtyard, he began to play with his nose. On the other side, the female animalized person saw it immediately to help. After all, the lion's meat pad was not so suitable. Some of them were too delicate. After the two plugs stuffed in the nostrils were taken out, Keou took a big breath. He glanced at the part of the female animalized wing with the metallic light shining at the end. The sharper Mithril phalane can even pinch an ant without any damage after being skilled in these beasts. Their wings are no longer cumbersome. Because the body part is too small and delicate compared to the wings, they can only swipe from the courtyard to the side of the courtyard with a slight flap of wings, and Cremari and Keou said, under the theory, there is magic. The blessings, they can fly for a night and do not feel tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male lion body beasted a few sneezes, then took a deep breath and took a few deep breaths. The powder that the black-haired dragons got also tried him once. Specifically, he doesn't remember, just remember that when he was awake, probably a whole animal in the courtyard was playing on his stomach. Then, in order to familiarize him with this smell, the dragon had tried him twice. Two times he tried to control himself but failed. The only thing that was remarkable was that he finally kept a little memory - the feeling of lightness and joy occupied all his senses, even when he was with the female lion Not so slack, he can accept almost anything, just don't wake him up from this impeccable dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is now, this residual smell still makes him want to lie down a bit, don’t want to do anything, don’t do anything, do everything Snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long will they come to you?" Keou asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you know this idea, Keou must say that this idea is really a bit mean--he thought at first that his master got the powder just to guarantee himself and the lion When he was involved, he could get away from it if he had any problems. Afterwards, he thought that the partner who apparently had some cognitive errors in the camp problem was trying to abolish the most important force of the Dragon Tooth Legion, but he thought I want to know that this is impossible. This is absolutely impossible to tolerate, unless the brain of Greedy suddenly degenerates into a lizard. Even those who are deprived of power will be crazy, and the madman can do it. Anything happened; come back to him and get the answer, will these powders hurt the birds? Except for the sequelae caused by the swords, of course, this powder will only make the heads of the birds fall into a very comfortable and lazy dream, and as soon as the powder is removed, they can quickly get rid of this situation. No negative effects such as dizziness, convulsions, numbness, etc. appear on these precious assets. On the contrary, they will appear to be mentally awkward and look good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is, like the knights that the birds and sheep heads will ask them to provide themselves with the freshest, most delicious meat, scrub the fur and feathers, clean up Like the servant slaves of the nest faeces, the powder that makes the two planes of cats fascinated by them will be included in the necessities, they will make demands and hope Satisfied - and the black-haired dragon is waiting here, this plant from the "everything is the best" is still a very novel thing, in view of the spleen of all things, its use and planting The method may take a thousand years to become widely known - and Ke's partner is even just some powder, although the amount is sufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on this point, the Dragon Knights have nothing to complain about, the Warlocks' works have always been very expensive, especially those in a monopoly position.The Warlock Tower provides a fixed amount of potions, runes, wands and reels every year. If it is not in the war years, they will consciously regulate the magic potion market, just like the black pockets in another plane. Like the merchants, all the places occupied by Grenada are only the Grenada's casters who can make potions, and when they need to rush to gather local money, food or other production, they will consciously pick Fighting, and then raising the price of the potion, in order not to be disabled and to die, no matter how absurd their demands, people can only accept it<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Dragon Knights will encounter the same as we described before, in the process, the Black Dragons have not left their homes step by step ( Although everyone knows it well, this can only be said to be a trivial matter between mounts - and Keo can't even say that it is malicious, because this powder has the same effect on the lions, and as long as it is handled properly , it will not cause any harm - if it is not the money bag of the dragon tooth knights<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They certainly can’t buy it, it’s okay, these powders don’t have much stock in their leader, but when they go back they will be swept by their own mounts to dozens of wings. Outside the ruler - if they are in peacetime, they can let their mounts recall how they were conquered, but the battle is imminent, and there is a news that the eagle-faced lion is not known - the female lion in the desert The beasts seem to have migrated, and their warlocks have not found them or new ethnic groups. That is to say, in the coming year, these lion-faced lions and beasts must have no bachelor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these knights...poor, this is a situation that has never happened in their most absurd and terrible nightmare, if it is not so true, they seem I have to laugh out – the dragon knight’s sheet metal was originally very rich. Every time it was encroached, no, when they seized a city or country, they were allowed to plunder, although the most valuable part of it needs to be turned over. But it’s enough to stay in their hands to create a new rich man; they stay in the barracks all the year round, and there’s no big expenditure besides pubs and pubs (Grenada is responsible for raising their children), so every Before the death, the knights thought that they would return to the inner city with a prominent and rich status, but now? They didn’t even think about some powders that would make them ruined...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation forced the first captain of the dragon tooth, the leader of the dragon tooth The eldest son of the new king, the current commander’s brother seriously talked with his youngest brother. After all, they can’t let the knights have to think twice about the bloody wine, according to the carnival speed of the lion-faced lion. They will be able to plunder three cities in succession in the future, and the knights’ pockets are still in danger of being emptied at any time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world is very innocent, really, no blemishes, it’s not him who gets these powders, it’s not that Keo’s marketing of these powders is not He doesn't sell him the price of a powder, and he has plenty of reasons why they are so expensive. Everything from the devil and the devil is very expensive - maybe some people will argue that some devils You will also come up with something that is cheap or even costly, but dear, you know, the most expensive is nothing else, it is free - you don't know what the devil will take, but as everyone knows, the devil has never done it. Loss trading<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, this is not a must, these are the remedies he used to lure the face of the lion and the beast, and the knights should probably be with their own eagle Talk about the lion beast and see if you can change them to their fingers or something else.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of course not the case. Finally, the dragon of the black hair has reluctantly agreed. In addition to the gold jewel, the slave can also be used to charge - he really needs A large number of slaves - this is probably the most whimsical thought that Mittitch has ever heard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not in the gravel, nor on the rocks, but on a soft sea sand. This requires the new king to be almost He did not hesitate to agree, he and Greed are also very curious, how can such a city be built, if possible, whether it is a new king or agrid are willing to try to build more cities - in order to Gerry Nada's tentacles extend farther, which is almost a must, and the next war ensures that they will not lack slaves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another plane, sand filling into the island, building a pile of city has proved to be feasible, but even if not, the lich does not matter, he needs It is the killing of the Grinada who left as much life as possible - without being suspected of real identity - as if he saw it in the broken memory of the soul of the alien world, one Ordinary humans do the same. He spends all his energy and family property, and ultimately can only protect 1,200 lives, but the lich will have to do ten times more or more, he does not know. Other redemption lichs (perhaps never before) will feel something in the process of redemption, but he did find that after the desert barbarians were sent out of the scope of Grenada, the shackles on him were indeed Become lighter<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
