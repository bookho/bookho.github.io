			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul from another plane is very serious, and it is correct to say that it is a sin that food cannot be absorbed at all, although it does not remember this Celebrity quotes should be on the wall of the elementary school or the corridor of the middle school, but the elastic squid meat has attracted all its attention. The white fish is delicious and full, the soup is full, it is not bitter, and there is a trace of softness. The sweetness; the toasted bread is torn into small pieces and soaked for a while, it becomes a soft powder, only the outer skin is a bit hard, but it is full of toughness, with a strong wheat flavor - so he has to give up bread and fish Soup, in the face of a boring but necessary entertainment, can not be said to be very willing. But it wasn't someone else who let it break the meal. It was the old master with a silver hair. He came to express his apologies and gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am disturbing you for dinner." The older mage sighed for a while: "But I think we will be separated soon, but in Before that, I must give you, and your companions... the highest level of gratitude - for my disciples, and my duties..." He gripped his hands with difficulty, after all, officially The team owner hired him and his disciples instead of accidentally met guests. He was injured when he rescued his disciples and could not cast spells. His disciples were not so helpful to the post-war situation as they were looking for trouble. - His lightning spells hit dozens of gnome dragons, but they also hit two mercenaries, leaving a dendritic electric striate on their chest and back. Fortunately, praying at Plum. After the treatment, he finally saved his life. He also mistakenly cast a fireball and almost burned the reed boat next door. If it wasn’t for Krimamar’s timely return, a gust of wind would extinguish the flame... and, Like this, etc., he almost put one The way teachers can make mistakes all over again. Although it is because they are casters, mercenaries and apprentices do not dare to tie them up and throw them into the water, but it is almost inevitable to give a few white eyes and a cold experience that is similar to disregard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said for a long time, it can be said that it is embarrassing, and euphemistically explained to the young wizard of the black hair why his disciples would be so... stupid . Of course, he doesn't think so. He only feels that his disciples are just inexperienced. Of course, there are many praises and praises to Kremar, and he still left his own name. Committed that he would not hesitate to lend a helping hand when they needed help; he also left some reels, and several casting materials, both gratitude and sealing fees - the older mage shyly and uncomfortably raised if Yes, he hopes that they will not preach things that have happened in the past few days. Especially about his disciples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about those people?" Gülen said, holding the soup bowl and using his eyes to show the apprentices and servants who are noisy and want to get some squid to cook soup. Soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have talked to the owner of the caravan," the older mage said. "I give up all the commissions. He will keep the children silent, as for the mercenaries," he sighed slightly: "I am here." There are also some healing potions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, is it only us?" The thief said with a good intention, adding to the pronunciation of "we". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glan." Kerry warned . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief shrugged and turned and continued to fight with the sweet squid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry..." The older wizard smiled awkwardly. "I didn't expect to encounter this situation..." He gave Krimamar a ritual - not a one-handed chest, that is, the gift of an older mage when the young mage returned. I took the lead with my hands on my shoulders and bent down deeply. An equivalent, even a courteous mage: "But I really have nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However, he still insisted on leaving those scrolls and casting materials,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima politely thanked him and returned to the same kindly wizard. Perhaps this white-haired wizard is a bit selfish - if he or she is guilty of this mistake, or the least of them, they will not be in the public eye... doing so. Because this is similar to a kind of coercion, as long as it is not short-sighted, evil and violent, used to see the dignity and value of others as a mixture of things. The average caster will be more tolerant and restrained, and he is still facing a young wizard with a bloodline of the elves, and with the elves, who is in control of this body or a country that has a obsession with respect for the old. The soul of the opposite world for nearly three decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you look at his age alone, the alien souls who always respect the old and love the young will not make any arrogant and rude behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The age of this body can probably be his high-grandfather, and the former undead person said with enthusiasm. Moreover, I am also very old, why have I never been respected by you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The first question, the soul of the opposite world replied, I am always 19 years old; the second question, I respect not the age, but Age-matched morality and literacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Don't you think he is disgusting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alien soul glanced at the old mage who walked back to his tent, bowed his back and looked a bit overwhelmed - a little, he admitted, but He is for his disciples, I believe he has been very upset - every caster is arrogant, this is normal, anyway, even facing the gods their souls will not be too obedient. He was so whispered, cautious and humble, purely for the shackled stubborn kid. After leaving the Master's Tower, each disciple has to find his own opportunity and way out, but you know that the Master can be said to be a career entirely built of gold coins, casting materials, ink, paper, weapons, runes... as long as There is no cheap thing related to magic; before they are strong enough to be recruited by nobles, lords and kings, they have to enrich their money bags in order to continue on the long road of magic instead of staying in place. Desperately watching others climb the steep peaks - this not only involves their future, but also their lives - the only way to exempt the caster is to cast the devil, the devil and the dragon, and the casters The battle between the two is closely related to the scrolls and runes. Even their last weapons are expensive but do not hinder the secret silver or fine gold of the cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the reputation of young mages is very important, unless he is born noble or has a father who is the leader of the guild. If you have a bad word of mouth, he is likely to fall into a vicious circle of mission failures—no one is hired—it is forced to collapse—the scope of the spell is narrow—the mission fails. Some wizards are accidentally left after leaving the instructor. After committing some mistakes that should not have been made, they had to fall to the thieves' guild or some places where they were indiscriminate. Finally, they were not assassinated in mutual conflict or were sentenced to death after the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we said before, the relationship between the tutor and the disciple is similar to that of the father and son, or closer to the father and son, and more reliable allies and helpers. So as long as a mage is not so evil, the little rookie who tries to fly for the first time after leaving the Mage Tower will always be more careful - like some high-quality, generous wizards, like Alva and Antonio. Even the young and straightforward young casters such as Kremar will be given extra guidance and protection, even if he is not their disciple, and they have no blood relationship with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Look at these reels, once the undead said, he did not want to recall his mentor - an evil and mad half-lich. Even the devil will frown at his name, not to mention his disciple - although the lich has been grateful to the mentor who took him out of his father's court, but sincerely said that these meager gratitudes are early It’s been tempered and ridiculously “guidance” again and again – in the seventy-seventh islands, every apprentice in the Master’s Tower has a culmination rate of more than 60%, but no Master The tower will be filled with as many jokes as death, and a chestnut, the midnight tea party that is popular among the undead is the mage tower from the half lich, and the poor apprentices not only suffer terrible torture. In the face of death at any time, their souls are also subject to boring and lengthy jokes, many of which have a very close relationship with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich doesn't like jokes about him at all. Is it a ridiculous place to accidentally dye your bones into fluorescent purple when doing experiments? This color is very gloomy, very consistent with the style of a half-Lemon Master Tower! At least better than the long arrow with baby powder on the hip bone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-There are scrolls that transmit spells, and the souls of the aliens say that they are not aware of the shadows that hang over the heads of the cohabitants. There is also a protective spell... Hey, it is Lee's shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Hey, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time they heard a loud noise, from a small box of blood red wine provided by the caravan owners to the mercenaries. It stands to reason. Mercenaries should not drink alcohol before they arrive in the city, but they have killed many companions by the genius, the fear of the vine and the two-legged gnome dragon, and tomorrow they will be able to reach the edge of the swamp - a small amount of alcohol can Encourage the spirit. Peace of mind, so that they can get rid of the chills and depression caused by death as soon as possible - the mercenaries are noisy and excited, except for the squid, a few drunken mercenaries from the gnome dragon who jumped on the boat There are dozens of legs, but unfortunately can't be baked. Can only cook, but with hard bread and butter is also a good meal, they invited the thieves Gülen and former Paladin Baldwin, but no one dared to rush to drag the casters and elves into them In the circle - they want to be more fun than to play the ice bucket challenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Gloria who brought the legs of the gnome dragons, which are not only long like turkeys, but also like turkeys, meat. The thick one can ruin the tongue, and there is no savory taste. In addition, the mercenaries have no special features and knacks in addition to the skill of "cooking"... Kerry is funny. The caster who looked at the black hair cautiously looked at the legs of a gnome dragon for a long time—there was only a triangular notch with a big thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike many people, Kreima is the kind of little guy who gets along more and more likes, for example, he is not a favorite luxury gangster The person who consumes, or his character, is more inclined to the elves than to humans. His requirements for clothing and shelter are limited to comfort, cleanliness and spaciousness. Although he has a picky tongue, as long as the food is in the mouth, if it is not toxic, it is just boring or eccentric, he will twist his eyebrows to eat them. Clean instead of discarding - because of this, when he encounters novel food, he behaves like a vigilant raccoon, screaming, smelling, cutting a small piece and taking a bite - gnome dragon leg meat The small gap on the top is also cut out by him, but Kreima is a good boy who knows "do not want to be applied to others", so he is very embarrassed now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
