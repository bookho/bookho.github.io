			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there only these?" The thief climbed up from the ground. If he only had the fog and bats that confused the line of sight, then he could manage to leave here even if he was alone. It may be hurt, but the injury will eventually heal, but if it becomes a sacrifice, it is only a rare peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Once the undead said, he lied to Kerry, and he read a few pieces on him. An attractive message, but he doesn't want to explain how he can communicate with a non-dead person decades ago. You know, the undead are floating in this main material plane, but their bodies and souls have In another category, their ideological language and spells are completely different from those of the living, which is why they are hard to be annihilated. You never know where they will go next, what they will do, and public opinion. Part of the undead will be in a state of madness for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symbols and patterns on the fragment are essentially a spell set by the lich on the spell book to ensure that his spell book will not be used by others. Look and steal. But according to the knowledge that Krimeral got from his mentor, even after more camouflage and change, the rest of the spell is incorrect, and the torn cover or page should be Like a torn scroll, the spell above will be lost because the line that dominates the flow of magic is lost, instead of being used as it is now, and it is used by a good priest to bring death, but There is no common resentment and chilling when Kremar is still a dead person. It gives him a feeling like some of the gods cast by Cranbo’s followers, although it is stronger than them. Much more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who had been silently engraved all the patterns and symbols in the memory when examining this piece of debris, he almost couldn’t wait to see it. This is true of almost all the lichs. Some of them may have chosen this evil because of fear of death or other reasons. It can be said that there is no way to turn back, but the vast majority still From the fear and greed of magic and knowledge, you will choose to become an immortal existence that is fearful and abominable and far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very wonderful, if we want to divide Krimer, he should be the former, but in the mentor’s tower, he is like every new student. Like the undead, they are fascinated by the innocent unknowns. They always stretch out the long fingers that only have the bones of the forest, and get magical magic from any place that can be touched. For them, it is wealth, that is, honor. It is life, that is, soul and faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn't say anything. He knew that the Elf Ranger would do all the things for him. He always noticed that he didn't completely separate himself from the soul from the outside world, but he didn't want to overdo it. Repress and disguise yourself. There are very few fools around him, including the knight who was abandoned and betrayed by his loyal king. He is slow to respond to his wife and loyalists. It is understandable that after all, they are all loved and respected by him. I was blinded by the feelings of more than a decade, and I couldn’t see the false impressions in the eyes of others as black spots in the snow, but that doesn’t mean he would be like this to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to cover up the difference between him and another soul is useless. They are two souls, one is a warlock, one is a mage, and can be said in terms of position. Is standing in two opposite positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current practice of the lich is to dilute its existence as much as possible. Yes, when he gets along with those who are good gods, the soul of the outside world is better than him. It’s more brilliant, and he’s like hiding in the morning light, the light shades he knows they will like the stupid thief, he will keep quiet while he controls the body, reserve spells, copy the scroll The potion is made to protect the temporarily dual-use body and to allow his cohabitants to get their identity faster, to induce them to bet on him, to give them confidence to force them to be physically abnormal. It will subconsciously avoid and ignore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, he must be grateful that he has carefully studied the emotions that many undead people regard as cumbersome and useless, and his mentor once said that he was alone with him. His approval, "Emotion is not born from the body," said the semi-lich from the external form, which is not much different from an ordinary gray robe. "Emotion is born from the soul, as long as the soul remains Existence, emotions can exist whether they are born or dead, devils, or gods, they all have emotions. They are weapons, shields, and how you use them."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do a gesture to return the thin silver rope to his wrist. The former undead person divided himself into two parts, and some still thought that he was not prepared to completely suppress Your own nature, although this means that he will walk dangerously on a line that is thinner than the spider silk, but if he really wants to be a soft, hot and cute thing like a strange soul, the lich confirms himself. Will be crazy in the shortest possible time, he does not know The mad self will do something, maybe he will kill Kerry, he will fail, and then he will be punished. This body may be completely transferred to a thief who should sink forever in the endless abyss. The lich is simply I can't believe that he will use his body to make something unbelievable. He can imagine that the midnight tea party will not add his name, accompanied by countless jokes and parody, just like a small cookie. The crystallization of negative energy is swallowed up in the belly of the undead. There may be a story of a bard who sang about him. It will be circulated for tens of thousands of years, possibly longer, and the life of all the plane elements is also wise. With memory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, the fierce will of the Lich's continuous transformation through two conversions will involuntarily tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in another part, he is analyzing the sights he sees, the smell of smell, the wind that touches and the whispers heard, and the power of magic. A psychic sensation that a caster must be able to feel when working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is indeed a festival," the Lich said: "That won't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He raised his finger and cast a spell. It was just a trick. The spell illumined the woods, and the bats swayed. They split a small piece and rushed over to the caster and the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard threw a fireball and burned most of it, and the remaining few were solved by the thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a step forward, but slammed down the solid land suddenly became a slippery swamp, which is the kind of bird that can’t be Falling in the water swamps, floating heavy moss and green duck, these tiny and lush plants cover the thick black mud underneath, and the thicker mud lingers on the caster's feet. Putting him down, the mud suddenly drowned the waist of Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief took a step back sharply when he was suddenly abrupt, but when he could understand what was born, he immediately pulled out his fine gold. Cut a thick sweet potato vine and give it to the mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the fog dispelled by the caster gathered without warning, with the smell of swamp turbid, the thief inhaled the first mouth When it was wrong, he held his breath in time, but he was still dizzy, but he still caught the sound of the bat flapping his wings. He wrapped a piece of vine around his waist, put his knees down, and disguised it. A pair of poisoned and comatose, when they swooped down and wanted to tear open the humans who dared to kill their companions with sharp little claws and the triangular sawtooth teeth, they were first smashed by the thieves' fine gold. life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gullan pulls the bottle of honey from the skin in the belt, it is not really honey, because it is not made with honey, just by Kerry Ben added the honey wine of the winter honey, but the thief had nothing to complain about, he connected and drank two big mouths, the melted ice water liquid from his throat into the body, like the hurricane that the caster had previously cast. Powerful and swift to drive away the discomfort caused by the fog, like the forced devour of a whole bottle of rotten rat mashed and blood red wine mixed products produced, severe vomiting and colic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog became more turbid, but its adverse effects on the thieves had been reduced to a minimum. Gülen listened cautiously and could not hear the bat's movements. He suspected that they would also fear the more venom in the fog. He Standing up, a bat with a broken wing at his feet proved his thoughts and twitched, spitting out the rotten internal organs from his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Master..." He said, and then dragged the swamp over the sky, the moss and duckweed have been closed, if there is not the sweet potato vine, he It will be thought that the caster did not fall into the swamp at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen saw the Antonio Master in the sanctuary of Rosada. The current garrison captain, as well as the leaders of the three guilds, who operate and control the jewellery and silk wines of Baita, are the industries that are most harassed by thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guild’s collars are dressed as women. In normal times, this behavior is to be laughed at and smog, at least by the priest of Rosada. Condemned and driven out, but now, in order to avoid the omnipresent eyes and ears of the members of the "fine net" guild, both them and the followers of Rosada must be patient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothing worn by the jewellery guild was apparently stripped from his wife, his wife was a slim beauty, although it is now no longer But still hold the original five or six-point posture, and the guild guild is a fat man. Sometimes he does not ride a carriage but walks on his feet and the stone road will ring straight, so just like What Anzhen saw, he was tightly stretched by the robes, and every move would make people worry that the fragile clothing would be instantly torn apart, and people could see what was not suitable for exposure in broad daylight. Perhaps he also noticed this. Point, so the texture of the cloak is always very inferior. In the past, even his servants at home did not bother to wear such clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wearing a veil, thick like a shaded curtain, now the women in the White Tower will wear this when they have to go out The veil is more closely controlled by the guild, and the behavior of the guild members is beginning to become rampant. Ordinary, women walking on the road will become their prey and goods at any time, and a veil can at least reduce their A little bit interested, especially when women wearing veil are as big as two of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also covers their identity very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
