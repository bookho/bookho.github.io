			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of information in the kingdom of Grenada is very strange, sometimes it is as slow as the moss climbing on the wall, but some It was faster than the wind, but in a few days, people were very familiar with the priest who had recently returned to Grenada, the youngest son of the new king, and the branded priest on the face of His Royal Highness Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Grenada, there is almost no other priest in addition to the priest of the red robe of Greedy. There may be several orcs. The priests, or followers of some evil gods, can only be here because the god they follow has a ally of allies with Gree, they are guests, and they are hired like gray robes. But a white robe? He could only be sent as a gift and a good because of a private grievance, yes, before the appearance of the white robe around Kremar. He made Grenada's dark and calm water surface a little bit awkward, but the strange voice disappeared before blinking. The face that was clearly branded with the words "渎神" and "弑亲" can explain many problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say that God may be mistaken or negligent, then it is obviously a more sinister crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think he has redeemed his sins?" Someone guessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think so," another said. "Otherwise, he won't continue to leave this brand on his face." The ridiculous thing is Some people questioned whether Yadell was qualified to serve a prince - Gryada also had laws, and a loser who proved the crime also had to be punished, but under the insistence of Kremar and the connivance of the new king, Yadel became a clerk of the Dark Dragon, and his first job was to organize the Warrior Directory of the Dragon Legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody thought that this is still very strange to Grenada, and Grenada’s dragon who is equally alienated from him is really sharp to the Dragon Tooth Legion. The fangs - just like no one knows why the warlocks known for their isolation are accepting his employment, and no one knows what criteria he uses to measure the casters who are going to be removed - he has not exchanged Knight, "All I know is just the caster." He said modestly, but the knights cursed millions of times. "May he be tortured by the devil in the endless abyss for a hundred years!" Mumbling whispering, as we said before, the Cavaliers will never be happy that their Warlock or Master partner will be voluntarily or forced to change, or at least give them some time, the Cavaliers and the strange casters. It takes a year, or two years of running-in and familiarity. It is known that the other person's temperamental hobbies, even martial arts or spell-casting habits, avoids the loss of the battlefield, conflicts, or more serious problems. But in the face of a caster who might be more powerful than his original partner, the Cavaliers remained wisely silent. Fortunately, they do have some time, and Greedy is not too embarrassed this time. The crushing power ensures that they are still quite confronted when facing the enemy. Calmly, they can make mistakes, um, a little bit wrong, and there is room for recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New King got the list of replaced casters, and some people who are concerned about this issue, but they don’t see anything, only It is true that the caster who was replaced is not as good as the new warlock and mage - this is indeed the difference that the Grenada people can't see, but Yadel knows that because this information is compiled by him and Kremar, The black-haired dragons chose three teams. These three teams cannot be said to have great advantages in the entire dragon tooth, but it is worth noting that although their three team leaders belong to two different forces, these two In fact, the forces are more inclined to order. Yes, they are evil, but they are not interested in turning the territory they have turned into another endless abyss. They hope to rule humans in a human way in the plains and hills of the occupation. Instead of looting and burning like a dragon, it will go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among the three teams, some of the casters who like to kill and torture are also a headache for their knights. Sometimes they need to be jealous and tongue-in-cheek. Is the hostage good? But Gretty likes chaos and enjoys chaos, so they can only tolerate these abominable sluts. "Thank me." The lich did not say a little shyly in his heart: "You will soon find yourself lucky." The new warlock, as well as the gray robe and the black robe, are all integrated with Gülen and Xiao. The devil also has the memory of the previous Creimal search. Of course, they are not good people, but they have a reason and calmness that the caster should have, love magic, know how to weigh, know how to be patient, and how to know how to Obey the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of letting them bow down is not a great idea or a fancy speech, but an inexhaustible amount of precious casting material or In exchange for the former gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no secret of the North Sea, this plan is certainly not feasible, but now the island that is constantly hovering in the undercurrent has completely sunk, which means that the Lich can set a coordinate for its portal. When he was on the island of Longhuo, he had already left a part of Bedwin, which was enough to subvert a country, but it was only a small, small, small part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generous gifts of the dragons ensure that the black-haired dragons can temporarily do whatever they want, and perhaps there is the indulgence of the new king and the grave, maybe they Just happy that someone has saved them from the casters, but it doesn't matter, the lich just wants to make sure that his commands are obeyed by every knight and the caster, especially if he can't make too clear orders. In their own habits, the casters will not arbitrarily brew too much disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he has not been able to determine how the rules of the war define the war until now, if it is just to turn him off the dark house, if it is used at the time It’s another soul, and this soul is judged to be evil... well, then... in the language of its plane, they are GAMEOVER, and there are no twenty lives waiting for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They played in the middle of the night, the eagle lion body gradually climbed above the clouds in the cold wind, and the clouds looked like a layer under the stars. A soft but broken wool blanket, from which you can see the misty kings, then the kings become smaller, and the territory they see becomes bigger, they can even see the edge of the gravel and the desert . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Red Dragon Griffith is extended to a land in the territory of Grenada After she was reluctant to satisfy her situation, she paused, but as far as the Grenada’s desires were concerned, the so-called borders were limited to places that their knights could not reach. The small battle between national borders and national borders never subsided. However, when the descendants of the Red Dragon are polishing their claws and teeth, they also remove the fragile skin of the country or region bordering them, at least when they transfer the disaster caused by the Red Dragon to another country. No pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when the stone goes to pick up the eggs, of course, you can be invincible, but in front of the steel hammer, the stone is just a fragile gadget, when Gerry When Nada's Dragon Tooth Legion and the Dragon Claw Legion came out, they didn't have any power to fight back - almost everyone thought so, and the original battle was the same. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Dragon is certainly not likely to have reached the 8,000 dragon tooth army and the 12,000-foot dragon claw army even without the number of affiliated legions. Although the number is the least, the 3,000-year-old Dragon Spurs, which have an indispensable position in the war, are all on the battlefield. Grenada is a huge country, and these sly reptiles will never forget to look after themselves. The nest. So in the end, the knights and casters cut out from these three were reorganized into a complete three-armed army with a number of about 10,000. Even so, this number of troops could not be placed at the same time. In the same place, this is a waste of fighting power and it is unreasonably delaying time. After the integration, this terrible and evil army is like a turbid river. It is divided into six tributaries on the hot plain, facing each other. The goal is to go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ke Oufei is in front of all the lion-headed lions, and the mischiefs that are despicable and don’t know when they will come here let the birds head subconsciously He opened a distance - even if the smell of the lion's lion is not very good, and their knights are always filled with the smell of sulfur, but they do not want to be always lion-faced Urine or feces are poured out - but even in a place close to them, it is very difficult to hear what the masters of Keou and Keou say. At high altitude, the sound of the wind is like The drums are as loud as loud, and all but the sounds are shredded and rolled away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is really a beauty." Keou said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A red dragon." Once the undead said: "And she already has eight hundred or nine hundred years old. Keou, and she is The wife of King Grenada gave him two eggs. As for who the two eggs are, I think you should have already guessed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Kelmen and Kelsey," Keo said, "it is said that even in the dragons they are the most annoying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no "The Lich seriously corrected: "If I follow the dragon's opinion, I am the most hated one, with their most abhorrent blood, but can get the status that their descendants can't reach - Kelmen and Kay I have killed me once, I think they still think now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
