			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is looking down, the little, rolling up the palm to hide it properly, the golden scorpion in the elf The palm of the hand exudes a beautiful luster like the sunset, its surface is not smooth, the Ranger tried it a little, and found that the root is like a grain-like imprint, in fact, some thin wire-like metal body. The reason why it is a line body rather than a line, because of the sharp eyesight of the elves, of course, can distinguish that they are originally a square strip with a square root section, they are bitten together to form a regular and mysterious The pattern, the reason why it is only a scorpion, is because the end of the first part will leave small gaps, of course, these gaps are small, so that an ordinary human can not find it at all, but in Kerry In this eye, the gap left by them is like a black dot, the kind of small spot that people often leave on the scorpion. Please search (product% book ¥ ¥ net)! The fastest-updated novel<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these little dots are not fixed. When the elves stare at them, they are surprised to find that they are moving, just like climbing The snake on the smooth rock, or the water that slides over the ice, flows slowly, with an inexplicable sense of rhythm and beauty - a hand suddenly falls and takes the scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...magic?" The elf hesitated and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was originally a magical appliance." The Lich said calmly, putting the scorpion back into his pocket: "The spell before the catastrophe is really wonderful." "He said with great enthusiasm: "I just made this scorpion according to the hidden part of the spell book, but never added magic to it, whether it was before production, after production, or In production, but Kerry Ben, after you finally formed it, it has magic - no, this is not the most amazing. You become extremely dangerous in its components, remember that we are in that small village I met the priest of Ilmot, who was ecstatic about how he could cast powerful power. But he probably didn’t know that this power was not given to him by Ilmoth, but the rune. The solid rune extracts the magical energy of his body and transforms it into power—so that Ilmot is a godly and tolerant deity, like this can be seen as a degenerate act, even if it is Su Lun. Or Rosada may not give it Forgive me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf raised his eyebrows. He is not a caster after all. He is not too sensitive to these things: "But you said this is a metal dragon stay. The next legacy..." Then it shouldn't be so... cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A trap," said the undead. "Some of them are out of control, but it is clear that the person who left this clue does not want the person who gets it to be a guy who is too greedy for strength."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the priest..." The elf shook his head and wanted to say something, but stopped in time. The death of Pastor Ilmot is completely accidental. Can they still pursue the responsibility of the original owner of this spell book? "What kind of person do you think will leave this clue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the metal dragon had soared on this continent, They don't know how many good-handed casters. After all, they can be said to be kind in the dragon. According to me, in the Wanweilin, there are elves, humans, even dwarves and gnomes, but they can learn about the dragon language. There are very few people who copy a dragon grammar book in the Dragon language. Given his little jokes on the cover, we can rule out the elves, as for the dwarves. They may prefer to engrave the map in only one of the strongest fighters. Only under the big hammer can be lifted, so only humans, or semi-humans with other blood, may not be so evil, but they are not good, but they must have his bottom line. Otherwise, the metal dragons are not Will give his inheritance to him, then the scope will be further reduced... but in this case, the remaining number will still be a headache," the lich walked back and forth a few steps: "So I changed to look for it from another direction, Yes I didn't go on to find a human caster who had made a good deal with the metal dragons, but instead turned to find a metal dragon that was handed over to the human caster. The meaning of the two is different."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you found it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead person once said a name, he used a sound this time The stranger is quite strange, the elf thinks a little, and understands that this is the dragon language of the metal dragon. The dragon language of the metal dragon is not the same as the dragon language of the colored dragon, but after all, it comes from the same embryo, so it is slightly on the tip of the tongue. After repeating it a few times, he knew that this is the name of a metal dragon. It is translated in the language of the elf. It is the meaning of the pearl in the ice sea. "Is it a female metal dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf can not help but smile, knowing that this is a legacy of a female metal dragon, his alertness is no longer so strong, "That can be true "Yes," he said happily. "We might be able to get a pink palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich followed the smile, no, he didn’t feel at all It really only is a nest of female metal dragons. After all, the caster who made and wrote this dragon grammar book is a caster who has been admired by countless people and hated by countless people. He is in the millennium. Maybe it was a good man before the catastrophe, but in the catastrophe, he has no longer been a passionate and simple mage, but he does not know whether the metal dragon who gave this secret to him has noticed this, maybe they I will be deeply remorseful in another plane - at least in the production of this spell book, the producers seem to be less tolerant, the traces of the fall are clearly visible everywhere, and even without Wan Weilin, the lich knows He finally became - He used to be a seventy-seven Islands yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just don't know why he didn't take the treasure. Maybe he just made a small accident when he was transforming, and it hurt his memory. He doesn't remember that he once had such a huge fortune, and a small one. The devil, or the devil, defrauded from him, took away or stole the spell book, and thought that this spell book was stolen by the thief Gülen from a half-dragon with abyssal biological blood. This inference Not surprising at all. Another possibility is that he has taken the wealth and hid it and used it in a place that is unknown. It is very likely that a group of people have found it there, but found that except for a cave. There is nothing outside of ice and sea water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you are in favor of us looking for this little dressing box?" asked the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leona said it was good," said the elf. "I don’t think anyone in us is too attached to wealth or power, but even It’s just a beautiful lady’s little nephew, whose value may be far more than the inner treasury of a country. Grenada is like a giant tumor that grows vigorously. It is being drawn from every place where the tentacles can reach. Life, I can't imagine how crazy and barbaric this country would be if it was acquired by Grenada - there is enough evil on this continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The opinions are the same." The Lich said: "After all, the poet's poems always say that - an adventure squad should always fight a dragon and get it in the nest. All the gold coins and gems. Maybe one or two princesses can be saved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have a Highness here," Kerry said in a serious joke: "Just she doesn't seem to need to save."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I’m very curious,” said the Lich. “It’s not that Baldwin’s proposal, Leona’s opposition, but Leona’s proposal. Byrdwin’s opposition – anyway, if we can get this wealth, they immediately You can recruit thousands of soldiers and knights..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leona is still a heir to the throne." Kerry Ben said: "She There is nothing wrong with the proposal, whether it is based on the warrior or the position of the king, Badwin... He was only unacceptable for a while, and he was unable to stand in the king because of such personality."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So is he ready now?" The Lich made a gesture: "Slightly changed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will." Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think so, the undead who once said in my heart, your former paladin seems to have gone to a dead end, but what about it, right? He said. He doesn't need a good friend, and he has no more loyal subordinates than he and his Necromancer. He has already reminded him that he can do his best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bywin after receiving Kerry’s answer, Silence for a long time, he knows that his companions are willing to embark on a dangerous journey again, half in order to prevent Grenada from getting more resources, half for himself, as Liona said, human beings are a kind of creature that is changeable and forgetful. The civilians of Norman in the Highlands will certainly miss him, but how long can it last? Not to mention that the new king will spare no effort to erase all the traces he left in Norman in the Highlands, if he really has to wait until the redemption of all He was allowed to return to Norman in the Highlands. Will it be a few years later, ten years or twenty years, and how many people will remember him at that time? And he has also been dying, in this process, Thunderbolt may be defeated by the orcs, countless cities will be burned. Countless villages will be looted, and who can save those who are innocent and kind? Isn't this a crime? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he did what Liona said, he would at least be able to prove his qualifications from humans. He and Leona can return to the highlands. Norman, Leona will become the new king of Norman and his wife in Highland, he will return to Thunderbolt, where he will stick to his son and be able to swing wide swords and lift shields, then he can take Honor and pride returned to the kingdom, and lived in the prosperous Wangdu with Leona, and their children and grandchildren ran and played in the courtyard. At that time, the merits and merits he accumulated should also be able to get Tyre’s forgiveness and permission. How much he hopes to re-enter the temple of Tyre, and return to Tyre before the balance of the black iron. In the gods, he was able to wear a white robe of Tyre's followers into a permanent sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are we going to start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will take some time," Kerry Ben said: "Crimmar has to study the ... thing, we have to make some preparations. If the direction decided by Kremar is not wrong, we may not be able to do it in the next few months. You Do you know the sea of ​​the North?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our destination is there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin is like many knights, not very interested in complicated instruments, but in any case, they are still on the map. Very sensitive, there are not many accurate maps drawn on the mainland, but no matter how rough the map is, it will depict the sea of ​​the North, which is closer to the harsh winter and bitter cold than the Orc’s Whistling Plain. It is said that there is In half a year, all day will be in a dark and unclear day, and in the other half of the year, it will be eternal darkness, and after entering the night, the hurricane of tentacles will endlessly pass through there to capture any biological remnants. The last bit of warmth, the ground is covered with dozens of feet, hundreds of feet or even thousands of feet of thick ice, steel will become crispy like biscuits in just a few days, there is no precious production there. Out, even whales and seabirds are rare, so even the lich is rarely there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the North Sea in the picture book that his father painted for him, it is said that the original white dragon and the good silver are still living there. Dragon, but since Yinlong left this plane, the white dragons who are enemies with them have gradually disappeared for unknown reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to go to the sea of ​​the extreme north, not only to pass through the original continent, but also to cross the whistling plains of the orcs, of course, this process is not It will be very enjoyable, and it means that they can't carry too many supplies and personnel. Maybe there are only Birdwin Kerry and Kremar in the end. As for Leona and Plum, and Gülen, they are not at the beginning. In Devin’s plan, Leona and Plum are because they are women, and their weak bodies can’t afford such heavy responsibilities. Even long journeys may make them sick or die, Ge Lan, Although he was humble enough and docile enough, Birdwin felt it was hard to trust him, but if there was a Master, maybe he could still tolerate Gülen in the team - if they could reach a wish, then Byrdwin I wouldn’t mind if the thief took all the gold coins and gems he could take. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this is one of the ways to ensure that Gülen is always loyal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to avoid the night of the North Sea," Baldwin said. "Then I can take a break during this time, and My new arm," said this, he couldn't control the smile from the heart: "It's awesome, Kerry Ben, I didn't think it before, it would be so strong, I just fell in love." It is... second only to Leona."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
