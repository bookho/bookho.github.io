			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not fair!" The soul of the outside world protested indignantly. "She was still trying to disguise herself as a mother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom and aunt can sometimes be said to be two concepts," Ignor, a priest who didn't know when to go to the caster, said: "At some point, some men are willing to wear As a baby or a child hiding in a soft chest or hiding under a warm skirt called a mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got a surprised side view. The souls of the outer world know that Ilmot is like Rosada, and their followers believe that humanity’s most primitive desires should be met, like drinking water, feeding and sleeping – although it is not possible to enter into a marriage contract with someone because Their bodies and minds belong to the gods. But it is always surprising that a priest of Ilmot suddenly talks about something that is not so suitable for discussion in a large audience. At least the souls of the outside world did not expect that a pastor of the god of crying and suffering could have a very profound study of this - always felt that something had collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing strange," Gavin said, apparently he was used to being misunderstood in this regard: "We help all the wounded in the world." Of course, including 娼妓, they occasionally talk to us about their affairs.” In fact, many women who have been engaged in this ancient profession have illly asked the pastors – like the suffering they have suffered. The holy line of perfection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you suffering for others?" In general, Gavin would answer them like this: "If it is, then it is worthy of good deeds." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some cockroaches will laugh and walk away, while others will silently speak, but no matter which one, the priests of Ilmot will not refuse to do them. Treatment – ​​it is hard for people who have not witnessed it to be harmed by such low-lying women. Sometimes their injuries are almost as serious as those on the battlefield, but they are not Respect can't get pity, and a few poor women can't even get a few copper coins, when the priests of Ilmot give them treatment, give them herbs, food and water. There will be people who constantly remind the pastors that they are just awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the person lying in front of me?" The priest of Ilmot would calmly ask at that time, "I only saw one." The injured person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the illusion presented by the demon is glamorous enough, but when the priest of Ilmot gaze at her with the eyes of a pair of healers. It was just a body that was displayed in front of his eyes. He escaped from the dream of confusing almost all the multi-spirited men without any effort - although he still could not understand the inexplicable spell, he still remembers This dark-haired young caster is his companion, and with caution, he cast a spell before approaching Kremar. This magic can wake up the companions who are confused and controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the soul of the outside world feels like being stuffed with a neck of ice - thanks to the sorcerer’s sorrow, he has been able to tell What kind of magic is this - the priest immediately prayed for a healing, because he had seen two serious injuries on Cremal, but the black-haired caster immediately made a rejection. The gesture, the priest condensed his doubts in sight, and Kreima shook his head and summoned his own spiritual servant - the flame from the fire element plane slammed the priest whole, in eight Under the control of the fire element of the foot, these flames will not hurt the priest, but will help him to drive away the vines and branches that are ready to move - fortunately, the tree monster is still afraid of the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame can't hurt the demon. But the huge light of that moment made her blink her eyes uncontrollably. When she opened her eyes again, she found that one of her prey disappeared from her vision. She shook her body angrily and shouted and waved. The arm, which drives the roots and branches of the tree monsters - the roots of the tree monsters are hundreds of feet deep. If they are in the shadow plane, they may cover an area of ​​nearly a thousand square feet, but her time for coming to Lingling is not long enough. In addition to this, there are nearly twenty feet of branches. They smashed around with the roots that rolled out of the soil, stabbed and excavated, trying to find the caster with sweet flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part of the tree monster is not satisfied with this, even if it grows in the shadow plane. Surviving by the flesh and blood of the innocent, it is still a tree, and no plant is willing to happily pull out its roots and run around on the ground, but it can't violate the idea of ​​the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the black-haired caster did not escape, on the contrary. He appeared at the center of the courtyard, which is the trunk of the tree monster. It can be said that he has cast a spell with ease - this spell can transfer the damage he suffered to the involuntary target - the devil made a sharp Calling, the white arm suddenly stretches like a branch of a tree monster. He wants to catch the caster who gave her the damage, break him, wring it, shred it, and eat him without wasting it. Every bite of flesh and blood, and his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not the priest who casts a magical spell in time, delaying the movement of the arms and branches for a short time, maybe she is likely to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, Krimari still suffered a blow, and a branch was like a baseball game that smashed him out of a mess. The priest ran with the fire elemental creatures attached to him, and finally caught the mage before the vines and branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage gestures immediately after restoring balance, begins to cast another spell, and the priest can finally cast his heal, half of the caster All the chests are stunned and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irmot's followers can't tell what spell the wizard had cast this time. After the spell was finished, he saw neither the flame nor the thunder, and then he Feeling that the whole ground was shaking, the monster screamed louder, and when he wanted to throw out his magic, Kreima grabbed him and they fell together in the flames - the priest could feel it What was cruelly and mercilessly torn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat of the flame distorted the air, and his eyes inevitably flowed out of the burning tears, but the priest of Ilmot could still perceive that the entire courtyard was It became clear that it was not as empty as it used to be, although most plants have withered and withered, but a dark black weird tree and its branches occupy every part of the courtyard, only some variegated vines can Reluctantly coexist with it. It looks like a plant grown on the offshore and islands of the South, known as the eucalyptus. The tree is entangled like dozens of hidden snakes, hanging on branches that radiate in all directions. Inexhaust twigs or gas roots, they are deeply plunged into the soil, without leaves, without flowers, and the skin is black and covered with scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the strongest tree, a deformed upper body is extended. If the rot is neglected, she can still say that she still has some attraction. Force - that is the upper part of a female succubus, fluffy silver hair sticking out two corners like argali spots, she has a slender waist and soft chest, a pair of round arms, and a Full of greed and sinfulness, but beautiful and moving face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is twisted and screaming constantly, and the demon is like a dagger-like paw scratching the body of the tree monster. This damage certainly cannot form a tree monster. What effective blow, but after a while, the upper part of the fruit began to frantically wiggle and shake, trying to grasp every place that could be grasped - they heard a rumbling sound, very It’s low, like coming out of a deep underground. The pastor listened for a while before thinking that this might be the shadow of a shadow tree strange that humans rarely hear – those that whip like a whip pull out from the dirt, violent The face and body of the demon are smacked, and the devils are desperate to grab them, but this does not help. In the crowding of women, the half body of the demon is squeezed out of the trunk of the tree monster - Connected to the lower part of it, even the priest of Ilmot was able to see some nausea - that is, half a pink chubby locust, and the strange thing is that there are six shiny eyes at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon who was driven out of the shelter (even if she didn't like it before) was so angry that she supported herself with the body of the locust, and only jumped lightly, she jumped to the deep cave that she had revealed after she left. Inside, put the arm deep into it, and grab the bloody scorpion from the inside before the tree stalk has been pulled out, and discard it in the place burned by the flame, then the tragic tree Howling and leaping into the flames, she thought that this would escape the pursuit of the tree monster, but the tree monster seems to have lost the instinctual fear of the flame, its branches burning, tightly wrapped around the body of the demon The tip pierces her soft lower part and grabs the juice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cremari and the pastor seem to have been forgotten by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to them?" asked the pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marital violence caused by arranged marriages, the soul of the outside world wants to say this, but the priests of Ilmot have a face that is just and majestic. The two eyes are like white snow, and the soul from the plane that regards an old and young child as a moral criterion is not too dare to joke with him: "Spell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp More accurately, it's two spells. The first spell will cause the target's mind to split a small piece of personality against it. The soul of the outside world doesn't know if the two-in-one sorcerer is One or two, but the results are as they hope, they are not so friendly to break up; and the second spell smashes the devil's mind and lets her attack the creature closest to her. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world involuntarily made a deep breath after the piece of the scorpion was dug up and discarded in the embers: "It's very fragrant." He commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor looked at it, "That should be the seed of the tree monster," he said. "The tree monster can grow an uncountable branch from the body, but that It is a part of itself, not a child of it - its child has only one such thing. When it matures, it will be parasitized on a creature, and he will take it to a distant place. If that place is suitable for the growth of shadow tree monsters, It will take root from the body of the creature and settle there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So is it a fruit?" It smells like the fruit of fried bacon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...that," said the pastor euphemistically: "The food reserve in Dorsett City is still very abundant... I think." .)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
