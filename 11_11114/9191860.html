			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what you will encounter?" Arthur asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being a large group..." The lich has omitted two words: "Chasing after running?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Arthur reveals a bad smile that is quite rare even in Zelata. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who can hear their conversations may only think that they are bloody after the discussion, but the lich is very clear that his mentor will not be so tolerant Keep his secret at the end - but his fear has become weak with the power of return, not to mention his body has his best ally, one will never betray... There may be occasional minor troubles allies, but under the guidance of the Lich and his mentor Edel, the soul from another plane also has magic that makes the devil and the devil too jealous. It is a remarkable psychic warrior, perhaps because there is no god-like relationship in another plane, and its belief lacks the most fundamental foundation - it is an unquestioned unbelievers, and its associated cognition is even better than some The arrogant who thinks that the god is just a "strong" is more determined - this makes it very likely to be nailed to the forefront of the wall forever, but it also makes its spell power almost independent of any established cognition. Restriction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the target that the psychic warlocks of this plane cannot achieve. Like every mortal, they are controlled by the gods’ fame at the beginning of their birth, even They are just general believers, or false believers, or unbelievers, but in the end they can't really believe that their spiritual power can transcend those inexpressible beings, which makes each psychic warrior a powerful spell. Not the threat of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a thousand years ago, a family that once had a psychic warrior almost overstepped this terrible boundary, but unfortunately, their place was an evil The gods watched, when she discovered their attempt, she sent no less than twelve high-level demons to slaughter the entire family, from young children to old men, no one was spared, even their fortress was pushed into the magma. Their souls are missing, and may have become a good meal for the summoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who saw the lich and the gray robes were allowed to leave, whether they were enemies or strangers who reached a temporary covenant, rushed to approach them. Obviously it won't be a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone tower here, obviously, this is also a small test - a wizard summons a monster, under his command, the monster tries Passing through the area between the bone towers, but when it touches the shadow of the bone tower, its shadow merges rapidly with the shadow of the bone tower, and then, as one might expect, it is pulled toward the bone tower. Its flesh sticks to the surface of the bone tower and sticks to it, like those who are still struggling to cry, first deformed limbs, then sharp forepaws, fat body, its skull It was finally integrated into the bone tower, and then the bone tower was gently agitated as humans saturated. The slightly rough surface raised a face that belonged to the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the bone tower is like a sparse but exhaustive giant net covering the earth, when another impetuous candidate wants to rely on flying As they passed through them, the ghosts flew out of the keel, and they caught him all at once. Although the protective spell finally saved the life of this idiot, he was still injured and his blood caused a commotion. All the people are far away from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His life was only barely prolonged...about ten times of breathing, and the ground that suddenly collapsed caught like a whirlpool in the sea. His feet dragged him down and chewed his ears before the vortex disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since someone has deleted the wrong answer, it’s much easier for the rest to make the right choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was stared at by a mad bone tower, its performance was very strange, and it seemed to be cringing, and it was like being crazy, like a woman The squeaking sound of the crying and the trepidation, it stood up, literally - under the pedestal of the keel is countless tiny spider-like feet, each of which has three tall, tall, and sophisticated It’s as sharp as a fine gold spear, and then it’s focused on chasing the man who is dressed in a white robe – other candidates don’t know exactly why it’s suddenly doing this, but it does make them I got the benefit - this bone tower didn't care about its kind. On the way to chase the lich, it didn't break the one, it turned over the one, and the bone tower collapsed and quickly combined itself. Of course, as devils, and then as devil's creations, they don't have a good temper that they are obedient, so they give up those cautious prey and start to anger the same kind of so-called similar<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it chasing you?" Arthur asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe because it still remembers being killed by me." The Lich replied that he was killed by a female dragon warlock on Longfire Island. Her soul fell into the hands of Grazit because she violated the contract with the prince of Wuhuan. He was set in a bone tower. Maybe Grazt just wanted to return the scroll he gave to Red Dragon Gredor. It’s always very embarrassing, but Gredi is not a generous person. This soul is abandoned by her. In the bone tower, the souls are always busy with each other to snatch the control of the bone tower. Obviously, Greed's abandoned child won the final victory. She manipulated the bone tower and chased her enemies, even if it could not last for a long time—the souls that were once swallowed by her appeared in her weak spirit, like The diners who invited the big meal, they finally found the opportunity to cut this tough and powerful kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Arthur said that his curiosity was satisfied, and then he summoned a black tentacle, black tentacles to support his master, Just like the octopus on the bottom of the sea, in the twinkling of an eye, with a faint smog, the wrist with at least one hundred pieces ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich did not waste time cursing the same door. He steadily threw a petrification, petrified the bones of the bone tower, and immediately turned them into sand. The bone tower lost part of the body and then collapsed to one side. A lich appeared on the surface of the bone tower. With a familiar face, it shouted silently, and screamed at the tower with the tower--the bone tower directly hit the stone wall called by the lich, and the inexhaustible souls were mourning. The ghosts flew like a horror in the trash bin that was overturned. They were greeted by the lich's spells. They suddenly felt confused. After that, according to the orders of the new master, some ghosts began. Attack other ghosts and candidates who have not yet had time to cross the bones of Tallinn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone tower was cut off by the sudden appearance of the stone wall. It squirmed like a living object, and the face was sideways to the sand, and the pain was extremely distorted. Like trying to escape the fate of being eaten by other souls, a pair of gray, seemingly inconspicuous boots stopped in front of it, and it tried to look up and saw the belonging to the Mithril Staff. Soft light, on the forty-seventh floor covered by cobalt blue light, this beautiful light reminds it of the moonlight and the Milky Way reflected in the sea. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; This is the last of its consciousness, the Lich mention Mithril Wand, with the force of ground pterosaur teeth will face emerge parts thoroughly crushed. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; when he continued through the pagoda, the pagoda were quietly standing there, chaos before do not see, and even their The shadows were also carefully taken up, only a distance of three or four feet from the tower. The bone tower is similar to the magic image, and the soul among them is like the core of the magic image. If the dominant soul is not destroyed, the bone tower can be bridged in a blink of an eye, but on the contrary, if the bone tower is even closed, It takes a long, long, long time, and the other bone towers will not let go of this opportunity to grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur was waiting for the lich outside the shadow of the bone tower, consistently brazen, he put his hands in his sleeves, and the black tentacles underneath became More, it seems that he is not really able to escape as some people think - but after the increase, he looks like sitting on a translucent dark anemone, this scene makes The lich was hard to contain, remembering some unseen waste in the souls of the outside world - as a matter of course, he refused to share this strange mount invitation with Arthur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long trek, they can already see the delicate swirling lines on the milky white ivory tower, but they can neither touch them nor see any A threshold or a window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else do we have to do?" A candidate whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death." Another person replied that the former's dagger cut his throat before the former began to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these people, only Arthur and the Lich finally got the qualification to see the prince Grazite. As for the other people, not all have become the feed of the bone tower, but in the future, it is conceivable that they will not have other positions besides the cannon fodder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
