Li Aona said with a strange look: "I have not bought a group of artists, though..." She is still in Wang Ting, her father, the old man of Norman Norman also Raised a group of gnomes - not the gnomes of the Dragon Fire Island, but the deformed little man, the big head like a beggar, but the body is only as big as the children of four or five years old, they often run happily in the hallway, in At the banquet, the people under the long table under the shackles and the dogs waited for the meal to drop the bones. Some skilled gnomes would drill the fire circle, throw the knife and dance, and they can use the head when they dance. The hard stone floor turns into a lot of laps, or play some mischief. Every guest can be played by them, like getting into a female guest's skirt, or getting drunk at somewhere. The knight's wine glass is filled with vinegar instead of wine, but left to Li Na's most impressive gnome is not one of them. She is a woman with a sweet voice like a nightingale. It is just like the ugly appearance. When Leona just returned to Wang Ting, she couldn’t sleep at night and quietly got up. When she climbed out of the window, the gnome discovered her, but she didn't yell at the big man and alerted other people. Instead, she picked a purple flower from the lilac bush around her and handed it to the princess who was at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes ** bought for me." McGee said that the two men looked down together, and the gnome showed a sorrowful look: "She thought Let me be happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shakes his head and climbs into the chair. Today he wears a fake beard numbered two hundred and eighty-three, and his beard is black. But he forgot to rub the grease, it seems to be weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But one of the bards said he had seen you before," McGee said. "Perhaps you are willing to meet him."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bard walked all the way to Bedwin before taking off his cloak, and Baldwin stared at him with a pale complexion. The heavy shadows under the eyes, the Soltley, the brown headscarf, the tunic, the belt woven from the countless knotted small ropes - all of a sudden took him back to that cold winter day. He jumped up, completely out of habit of grabbing his wide sword, but his body suddenly lost balance - he forgot that he had lost his right arm for a long time, but the bard, that is, Rica did not give him Too much reaction time. He cast a spell and hitting Baldwin directly. The fierce current is like a beast eating his skin, burning and sizzling, and Tyre’s former paladin screamed and didn’t fall. Instead, he bends his knees and puts his shoulder against the table. The table is covered with snowstone and is extremely heavy. But Baldwin only tried it once and pushed it up. He rushed to the warlock like a shield, but there was a Ruiyite around Rika. She raised her hands and cast her spells. A viscous sphere flew to Birdwin and glued him tightly to the stone table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dagger was thrown at Ruiyite, and Ruiyi was on his cheek, but he was taken away with a few red hairs. She looked at the enemy. She has the same red hair as Ruiyite, but one is more similar to the flame and the other is more similar to blood. "Go to Gavin and Yadel," Liona yelled. Then a talisman was thrown to the ground, and the Amethyst inlaid on the Mithril Charm suddenly smashed. The spell hidden inside was accompanied by the rising wind. The flame wall of three people divided her, Birdwin and the two enemies. Open - McGee jumped out of the chair when the accident happened, and he did not return to escape, but he heard Liona's cry. So he immediately went to find Gavin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gage and the knights together, Kreima generously gave the entire fortress and the southern wing of the palace to them, here just has a wide square The courtyard, in the warm days of the day, the knights took off their upper body clothes, and the sunshine of the Dragon Fire Island converted the pale skin into the color of wheat and olives in a few days. When the gnome rushed in, They are doing a sport that can be said to be training or to repair armor - the knights put their chains together with the sea sand into a tightly woven linen bag, then connected to the sea sand, chain A and the bag are thrown together into the sky, then caught, then thrown up, and then caught, the sea sand inside the bag will rub the chain armor, rubbing every small ring, and the heavy sandbags become training. Good assistant, because they have been in exile before, they have not been trained for a long time. There are several knights who are unfamiliar because of the technique, and the sandbags are not fastened. As a result, when they throw the sandbags in the air, the sea sand is connected with a whole set of chain armor. They were given a heavy blow, being beaten by a chain armor or a small thing. Haisha entered the eyes, ears and nose were much more troublesome. Others laughed and walked over and took them from the edge of the courtyard. Rinse and drink the water and help them flush the sand off the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?!" Gavin was the first to stand up, and McGee didn't look like watching training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy! Enemy!" McGee yelled, and behind him there were two guys dressed in two-color suits, like jesters, their There was a metallic reflection in his hand. When they lifted the crossbow, Gavin’s spells arrived. The first spell was to set up a sand wall to block the arrows that almost hit the back of the McGee, the second spell. Suddenly a lot of black tentacles were summoned and the two men were caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Master, no, the two Masters seized Bywin and Leona!" McGee said: "They look like an entertainer." One male, one female."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights grabbed the chain armor and the wide sword. "Wait a minute!" Gavin shouted, but it was too late, a knight was hit by acid, and his mourning came to an abrupt end, because the acid had already made his whole Zhang's face is completely eroded: "Don't face the enemy with the caster." Gavin sternly snarled. These knights only confronted the orcs. Even if the orcs had priests, they were more accustomed to them. The warrior "blessed", that is, the angel who prayed for the luxury of Kawu, came to the orc warrior, or summoned the beast, but rarely prayed to directly harm and kill the soldiers, perhaps because it is not worth it. But this made the Knights of Thunder Castle hardly face the experience of a caster alone - the first battle to the side of the island may involve the caster, but when the soldiers rushed to the pirate, the battle between the casters It has also come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spell that may not be so evil falls on a knight, but it creates a more terrible result than an evil spell - the knight The chain of the body and the wide sword in the hand all melted. They climbed and flowed on his body like a living creature. "Throw them away," Gavin looked for a tiny gap while preparing for the spell. Road. "Get rid of them!" But the knight couldn't do it at all. The bright liquid melted by his chain and the wide sword wrapped around his body for several laps. When the spell failed, he was like a piece. The giants of steel were tied to each other. He couldn't breathe. Other knights wanted to pull it away with their hands or branches. Finally, they even hurt their companions to cut with wide swords, but the chain armor and weapons that Krimari offered to them were all steel. Did not wait for them to pull one of them away. The knight died of suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are so focused that when a huge fireball hits them, they don’t even have the chance to raise their arms, the fireball melts the steel, and Before that, those heroic knights had turned into black bones and a smoky smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaiwen’s eyes are red, they have been in exile for so long, they have suffered so much torture and injury, they suffer from the humiliation and curse that ordinary people can’t imagine, each one can The knights who arrived here are the ones who have been kissed by the god of life for the forehead. They should not die here. Under the wizard's spell, the gods, even if their destiny is doomed, then let them return to Norman in the highlands, return to the Thunderbolt, die on the wall, die for the king and the people of Norman in the highlands, and It is not here that the strange enemy is burning like a mustard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Master," Rica said, "but not the black hair caster. Are they not saying that he is still on the island?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His friend is here, he will never hide." Reyte said that she carefully stepped back, when the slaughter could not see the ordinary people of the Magic Star River. Her mood is unpleasant, but after seeing Gavin, her look is not so good: "This is the Norman Master of the Highlands." She said that a spell is ready to go in her hands, and The surviving knights were scattered with the help of Gavin, and they were silent. There is no roar or curse, but this silence is more depressing than shouting loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me where is Cramerar?" Ruiyite said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is not on the side of the island." Gavin said: "What about Leona and Birdwin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The two?" Ruiyite showed an evil smile: "I have invited them to my tower to be a guest - please ask Master Crarimar to welcome his friends, no matter where he is Where, remember to tell him, with the thing that does not belong to him." She paused for a moment: "Perhaps two, tell him, he will understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finished, violently cast the spell in her hand, a darkness suddenly appeared between them, the sound of the knights waving wide swords shrouded the entire open space, Gavin shouted, but fortunately the knights were In this respect, after numerous trainings and internships, even if the darkness is as sorrowful as they are now, they can still do not hurt their companions, but the life that has been sacrificed can no longer be recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They followed McGee to where Leona and Birdwin were, where Bedwin was training with them, but only throwing Sandbags, the training of Baldwin, can't be added to it for a while. After all, the weight of the sandbag is very amazing. It can be caught by one hand, Bydwin, but it is easy to lose balance, so he has always been in this small greenhouse according to the requirements of the gnome. Training the residual limb, according to McGee, whether the residual limb is strong and sensitive, will directly affect the use of the silvery prosthesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small and beautiful greenhouse that was originally beautiful and quiet is already a mess, Gavin looked around, the highland Norman’s dynasty daughter Leona and the former lord of Thundersburg The temperature has been taken away, and no traces have been left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did the artists come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mckey hesitated: "Yes My fiancée bought it for me," he said weakly. "She wants to make me happy, and I," he said, unable to spread his hands: "I want my grandmother to be happy."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
