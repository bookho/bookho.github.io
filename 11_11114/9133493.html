Together, the little devil sticks out his tongue and makes an ugly face. This eyeball was taken three days ago, just like the trick that Demon played in the outer city of White Tower. The glass ball of the eyeball allows the caster to see the magical device from 30 feet to 300 feet outside. The glass eyeball is placed in an abandoned crow's lair, and the dry branches reveal the gap just so that they can see under the tree. The road, so the mage in the city can know if there are any enemies or the caravan passed by<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe now the wizard in the walled city has jumped up and shouted at the enemy, but this does not matter to the army of Grenada, even They only have a knight of about a thousand people and a caster who is less than a hundred. It is enough to conquer a country. As a leader, what his dark-haired dragon master should pay attention to is not to make this team too bad. Otherwise, if the statistics after the war can't offset the casualties, Kreima is going to be punished, dragging the heavy stone statues of Gree in the nakedness, and under the whip, the king is struggling to move around— -Think of it, the little devil really wants to see this scene, but unfortunately it can't shake the battle alone, and the contract from the top of the warlock tower is not for appreciation, the various details are used in various ways. The article makes up for the gap that almost all the little devils might find. Almost, Asmodeos thought that the clever Asmodeos could always find the thread and unravel the bad situation or simply make it More chaotic<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada’s army is marching along a narrow road, in front of it is a cornice, like a dragon’s belly, with opposite cliffs And the two towers stand at their peaks. There is a wide bridge between the towers. The bridges are wide and sturdy. The height of the bridge's low walls is flush with the human chest. It has the same walls as the city walls. The soldiers stood down the bridge or threw stones, and the buildings below the towers were like staggered canines. They hovered around the towers and connected to a small fortress-like house. The narrow steps and steep slopes of a fully armed soldier can be imagined as long as one person stands at the corner of the ladder and sticks out the spear, or stands on the top of the slope and rolls round the wood or stone... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those ladders can't even accommodate my cubsKeou exaggeratedly complained: "Don't say that I still want the bird's head, right, plus the reptile of the Grenada.""He is talking about the clawed dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Grenada did not encounter such a situation, carrying the sorcerer's lion's lion's body to tentatively rushed to the walled city In the air, if the casters can cast flames and lightning from the air, then the same can be used to flatten the dragon claws of the knights, but this walled city is also the nest of the casters, the birds have not yet entered the periphery of the walled, It was stunned by a strange wind, and a bird even broke its wings and fell from the air. The black-haired dragons gestured, and the gravity where they fell suddenly changed, though not yet. Let the bird's head and the passengers on the bird's head float together, but greatly reduce the strength of their impact on the ground, although inevitably there will be some bruises and dislocations, but the dragon claws rushed over and dragged them out. After that, the knight and the warlock can stand up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eagle lion is not willing to fly higher, its guess is not wrong, after a certain height, this spell will be invalid, the problem is At such a height, if the casters of Grenada cast their spells, even if they would not be disturbed by the spell, the rest of the power would only resemble the fireworks set off at the Greinian celebration. Keou relies on sharp The eye saw the warlock sitting on the eagle's lion body beating his lips patiently. He smiled slyly. "I am not targeting anyone," he said. "But I have to say, I will go. The guy who chooses the bird's head should check his mind carefully, because they actually believe that there is something in the skull of the bird that has only a big fist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should still be something," the soul of the opposite world holds an objection. "Their appetite is quite good.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keou quickly laughed, he waved his wings and flew around the city for a week, during which time there was a mage in the walled city. The released monsters and monsters want to attack them, but they can't keep up with the speed of Keou, or they are shot down by Cremari's spells.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that we don't have to worry too much this time," said the black male lion beast. "I saw the giant.""People standing in the good camp will not live in peace with the giants who feed on human beings. The giants are evil, without exception.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are still orcs"The soul of the opposite world said that his eyes are sharper than the lion beast. He not only saw the giants at the end of the slope, waiting behind the coffins and stones, but also saw the orcs, they wore human clothes, but the hair And the arched back reveals their true race, and at this time, the city has cast another powerful spell that ignited a smog that shrouds large and small buildings, even those two The contour of the tower like a sharp needle also began to tremble slightly and became less real and precise.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth squad leader frowned slightly. "That's the one," he said. "I seem to remember that it is the new color of the Warlock Tower. Isn't it true that all the goods in the Warlock Tower have to be reviewed by the pastors? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For some reason," the warlock, questioned by the fourth squad leader, said implicitly: "In fact, it is a fake, more correctly , a failed waste..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact," the fourth captain said: "It is rejecting our knights and dragon claws. Outside the city wall, it is quite successful in this regard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has a fatal weakness..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there are any weaknesses," the fourth team leader said: "Hurry up and say it, this city is not worth our time wasting too much."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But some people don't allow it," said the warlock. "I tell you only because you are special, you are allowed to know, but stop here, for you. "He said: "We always have other ways to get there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————— ——————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;——I did hear that a warlock tower was studying a defensive array before leaving Grenada, the Lich said, but I didn’t expect it to be used in Grenada, but Being taken over by a dirty walled city - I think it's because they found the unreliability of this idea... bigger than they thought, so big that they were too lazy to correct and perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretend to disguise the products and products of failure and sell them at a price that would make the Dagong or King’s inner library weak. Of course, there are merchants' credits, but there are also the reasons for the apprentices and disciples in the Warlock Tower. The tongues used to sing the spells are equally dexterous when deceiving and flicking. The Lich is out when it is still Kremar. After a lot of such heterodyne, in the face of ordinary mortals, they have to play with some terms that sound extremely deep and mysterious, um, like another nanometer, broken wall, molecularization, etc. Wait a minute, etc., but also cast one or two small spells, emit some light and cast some phantoms to intimidate and convince them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captains came to see their leader, they are not familiar with Crimal, and there is a bit of worry that this dark-haired dragon has Kyle The door and Kelsey's eccentric temper, they can of course accuse the leader of the incompetence, but not to mention that under the protection of the new king and Gredi, he may not be subject to any real punishment, now they have to listen to it This order made many people discouraged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the Dragon Spurs will send more information," a team leader suggested: "just wait..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we must join our army after thirty days," said the fourth captain: "And our enemies can be more than this walled city. And we don't know if there will be this. Intelligence." He asked the warlock if he could use the heavy money to buy the information, but he was still rejected. It seems that this is related to another plan of Grenada. If they are here to destroy the battle with this weakness, Then it may affect another location, and this location is far more important than them, let alone this walled city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to wait," said the dark-haired dragon. "If you just want to destroy the squad - we have a very simple way."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said, almost the next moment, all the lions and lions flew high again, except for the injured bird’s head, they tried to approach The two towers swayed in the hurricane and the claws creaked on the rocks. The knights with their warlocks and spells leaped down the lion's ridges. Their mounts almost couldn't wait to leave. They never encountered such a wind. It seemed to come from all directions, the lions and beasts. The feathers were blown up, and many of them were broken or deformed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The casters first sent their own elemental waiters, magic pets and little monsters, ghosts, etc. Search for the magic of the Walled Mage in these places. The eyeliner did find a lot of things like glassy eyes. There was also a half body of a little devil, fixed in the solidified sulfur. Asmodeus did not hesitate to take a bite with sulfur. As time went on, the power suddenly filled in its stomach. Asmodeus shook his tail satisfactorily. It had not eaten such a rich meal for a long time. It had several masters in the main material plane, but Except for the first one, no one has generously allowed it to take precious stone gems at will, let alone such precious items like the same kind of wreckage, even if only half of it, it is rare to let Asmodois have a full rise. a feeling of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
