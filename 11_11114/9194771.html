			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgs made a mistake, perhaps because of the weakness and retardation of Ferry Hill, which caused him to lose the vigilance he deserved. This mistake made him lose his original advantage. A huge explosion made him lose the trace of Ferry Hill. He did not suffer serious damage. Even the robes did not become blackened or torn, but as a A noble Batt's hybrid, his pride was severely hit. He closed his lips and sweared, but the skin that had turned from grayish gray to grayish black exposed his anger and remorse. He floated himself up, on the one hand to better search for the traces of Felix Hill (this plane is already theirs, and Felix Hill could not use any means to escape), on the one hand, to guard against The eloquent Duke Buhne, his old opponent, does not say anything else. If Bunier plays tricks and releases Ferrik Hill, he will laugh because of Foggs’ failure; The devils are all untrustworthy, chaotic and despicable. Ferguson is so convinced that he can't guarantee that when he shows weakness, Will Wynn will once again rely on Bone, and regard him as this riot. The victim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A powerful and ingenious spell was released by Fergus, which exudes a low, penetrating squeak, passing over this Every inch of the plane, from the sky to the ground, and from the ground to the sky, Ferek Hill was forced to appear under the expectations of Fergus, but she has got rid of the shackles of Fergus before, and the spells are back. In her mind, she reached out to the palm—she knew she was very weak, so she couldn’t lose even one spell. When Ferguson waved her arm and stabbed her with a sharp edge, she still insisted on singing the last syllable, one The colorful spherical force field will be shrouded by the Duke, the spherical force field that Ferry Hill once applied to himself, but with the same effect on the enemy, Ferguson glanced at her with surprise. I'm not sure why she chose this spell, but he knew it right away, because Ferry Hill's other spell made the spherical position dangerously shrink, and the force field collapsed inwardly in the sizzle. Gus busy When it was cracked, another spell from Ferry Hill came one after another. It was like a normal, white mist floating around the ball. Fergus could hear the sharp sorrow of the blade. The cry, Woking’s screams. He knows that there is a spell that can collect the pain and resentment that the subject suffered when he was tortured, and use it as an important casting material for the curse - everyone knows that the god of wealth, Woking, was more than a thousand years ago. Was imprisoned by the Uzbek Lord Grazite for a long time. During this time, Grazt, who wanted to make a god, summoned an abyss monster to absorb the power of Woking, and injected the power into his daughter’s fee. In the body of Rick Hill, it is a pity that this plan ultimately failed because Woking deposited his character in the hands of another god, but the pain and resentment that Woking gathered in the past 100 years is absolutely impossible. Ignore, some people say that it has been integrated into Woking’s power, so Graz will choose his daughter instead of himself as the recipient of divine power, and Ferguson is ready to extract the relevant spells and utensils. These dangerous creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, even he is not willing to be easily entangled in Woking’s resentment. But if his spell doesn't break the ball, then the continuous compression of the ball will pinch him to the minimum, maybe it will be as small as a dust, and Ferguson can't infer the follow-up of this situation for the time being, but if He crushed the ball, and he was immediately occupied by a godly resentment and pain, which was equally dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you need another master." The eloquent Duke saw this situation and couldn’t help but proudly say that his voice was loud and beautiful, even if it was only one. The short sentences of the two words are also extremely inflammatory, but Viking just shook his head: "No one is my master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This At that time, Ferry Hill has turned to them, the succubus is constantly bleeding, as the weapon of the Ba Ba Mo can cause, the edge of Fergus also has the negative effect of making the wound difficult to heal, she originally It’s not that the most beautiful face has become more ugly, but because of the nature of the succubus, her current charm has increased to the maximum limit. Even the dictator Duke has been silent for a moment, and at this moment, Ferry Kehir pulled out his wand and broke it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinyl growls, but the lightning in the wand has occupied every part of the plain, and the huge currents cause the land to burn, the rocks melt, and the At the same time, Bunne released the most sturdy protective spells. The blue and white brilliance flashed in front of their eyes. Without a gap, they smelled the stench of the air, but not the devil and the devil. Generally speaking, In the main material plane, the powerful lightning that can tear the mountain will leave such an odor, just to be short and light. They heard Ferguson yelling, then Bonne turned to Vienne and made a gesture. This gesture belongs to the devil, but as the most trusted demon of Grazt, Vivian can certainly understand this simple gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the wand was broken, the daughter of Grazite created a black dimension crack under the protection of lightning. She used it as a weapon to cut and slash on the Luo net set by the devil and the devil. It is hard to say what this is. Feeling, because every manipulation of her is nothing, and her attack, as well as the location of the attack, is nothing, but before the lightning disappears, she finally captures a gap, which is a tiny to possibly even the little devil. Unable to pass through, but Ferry Hill casts all of her most powerful spells, the spell opens a passage, and she eagerly raises her hoof, she doesn't know where the passage will send her, but There may not be a demon general and two devil dukes in that place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Ferguson has broken away from the shackles of the ball and turned himself into a mist, and the resentment of the gods fluttered, looking for no To the prey that could be entangled by it, the Duke fluttered cautiously, opened the bottle after opening the distance, and sucked the mist into the bottle. He also sighed because he knew he might not be able to Get more rewards, and Bonne shouted, his spell hit the channel, but the passage still exists, and Ferry Hill has already entered, leaving only a small back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps only Wei Yin still maintains the previous indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freke Hill took a deep breath, and she stepped forward, knowing that she once again escaped from a deadly crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short sword pierced her back and was deeply embedded in the part between the ribs, and Ferry Hill felt it was being forced Twisting, shredding her heart, and taking the blood from it, she twitched and fell, like all the succubuses that are dying, and Ferry Hill is now deadly than she used to be. The attraction, she fell to the ground, turned to the side, not to make the dagger deeper, she looked so weak, not threatening, unable to focus on the eyes, like looking for the kill Her people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cray...Mar..." She whispered that she knew it was him. He twice betrayed her and both succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman of Grazt gasps in pain, her eyes are always open, her fingers are holding the ground, "Let me... look at you, Cray Mar... my lover," she prayed humblely and softly: "Last, let me see you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but once mastered The sword stabbed into her back did not appear, even if Ferry Hill really stopped breathing, without a heartbeat, her body became cold, and so was it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferggs, Bunne and Vienne have heard the temptation from the dark passage, crying and crying, and the curse of sharpness - Ferry Hill may not have thought of it, The short sword that fits into her flesh and blood finally draws (as literally) all her flesh and blood, bones and souls. Correctly speaking, she still survives in some way, but not in the form of a succubus. In the form of a short sword, the power of her body did not suffer a little loss (except those lost when confronted by Fergus), and it was completely preserved, just like a potion loaded with a bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the undead came out of the passage, they saw a demon standing in a triangle, two devils, their eyes were concentrated in his hands. On the short sword, this spell is rare, but it may not be for the stalwart Duke Foggs who owns the entire octagonal library. Since Wei Yin can teach this spell to Crimal, he will not As far as I know, as for the eloquent Duke of Buny, his knowledge is not as profound as Ferguson, but he only needs to see Fergus, let alone the last curse of Ferry Hill is so loud - she must Know that they are listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She certainly wouldn’t allow a guy who sold her twice and did succeed to take the biggest prize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fulfill your promise." The stalwart Duke Ferguson said with a gloomy voice: "You have promised that she belongs to me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dictator Duke snorted loudly, as he said, the squatting tower where the hybrid sold a good to two people, but he was only with Fergus When you look at each other, you know that they need a temporary truce. If the devil changes his mind, they will kill him together with the main material plane, and take the power of Ferry Hill. As for what to do afterwards, that is the devil's thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
