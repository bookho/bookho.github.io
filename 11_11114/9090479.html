			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan Don Clay’s victory has closed many people who have questioned him, and he has repaired Yadel and the Cavaliers, and those who once belonged to Bird. For the warm Thunderbolt soldiers, it can't be said to be a complete bad news, but it is obvious that many of the Sir Alex Ferguson and Chamber of Commerce who had expressed support for Boldwin and his subordinates, either expressly or implicitly, began to hesitate. — After all, John is the new king of Norman in the Highlands. Even if Leona’s inheritance rights are before his children, he is only the heir to the throne. What's more, Leona has not been able to get her family name and power – so in Dylan. When another large-scale expulsion of soldiers, almost no one will stand up and speak for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, they all saw that in the battle of the casters, the soldiers who were ordinary people could not play any role at all. The orcs were thundered, blazed by flames, by ice cones, by acid, and by poisonous mist. They couldn’t even approach the double wall of Thunder Castle. The priests of Kawu were trembling with mourning and running away. The light obscures the light of the Milky Way and the moon, the scene is both amazing and fascinating, and...the surrender<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier who left this time and his family More than the last time, fortunately, they have already seen how their companions were expelled. They are not surprised and afraid of this result. Even if the weapons and armor are left, whether it is a girl’s skirt or an old man’s There are daggers and spearheads in the pockets - they have already replaced every accumulated copper and silver coins and a few former Thunderbolt merchants with food that can be stored for a long time, as well as tarpaulins, carriages, jugs, etc. When the commander announced the order of Dylan Don Clay loudly, he got a heart-wrenching silence. The soldiers walked away without saying a word and put everything and their family on the carriage within the time limit. , In the attention of the people of Thundersburg, they left in an orderly manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of rude and despicable guys." A red robe warlock said, "I think you should deprive them of all their possessions." The contempt and anger of the atmosphere made him feel uncomfortable. He came from Grenada and was used to seeing distorted faces because of fear and flattery - if they suddenly knew they had to take their family with them on foot. Throughout the great wilderness, the look on the face should become more interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think this is enough." Dylan said that in the three nights of the night, he has already discovered that as a caster, he does Not the strongest of them, or more correctly, his strength can only be ranked in the middle and lower, but what about it, his bloodlines are already destined that he will live on most people, not only mortals, but also There are casters, especially after Norman’s inheritance law has been changed, his mother, Princess Ang Principal, has not given birth to a child in John New King. Her Royal Highness Princess Leona was the second heir to Norman when she did not restore her family name. As her son, he is the third heir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only ones that belong to him now are Thunderbolt, and there may be more in the future - no matter how powerful they are, the casters still have to kneel to him and work for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The tall towers of the elves?" asked the warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you can take it," Dylan said. "We don't need elves anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock smiles with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers expelled by Thundersburg entered the wilderness, and today is not a good time for a long journey, the harsh winter has ruled the entire Highlands Norman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse struggled step by step through the snow up to the knees, and the merchants who followed Dylan Doncre to Thunderbolt refused to trade with them. Only some of them lost their lives and their entire family in the tragic massacre. They have been breeding in Thunder for several generations. The merchants who have deep friendship with soldiers and knights (some of them are in-laws) are willing to provide them with goods and cars. With horses, because more of it is out of gratitude and compassion, so many things can be said to be unrecognized gifts rather than buying and selling, such as those who dragged a heavy vehicle can still calmly move forward, this kind of horse is good at Farming and carrying goods, hard work, endless power, the best is to withstand the bitter cold, if they are still using the castle to match their horses, those blood horses on the battlefield can be said to be invincible, probably already cold in the cold In the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be blizzard tonight." A soldier said that he had an old face and time gave him stiff limbs and curved backs, but He also gave him sensitivity to temperature and weather changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moorma can move forward in Blizzard," their leader said: "I don't have to worry about the direction, I have a compass." He opened his fingers, that is An exquisite compact compass with only one pointer and sixteen directions, a brass chassis with a long chain that covers only the knight's palm, but its silver pointer glows with light. "This is a A magic compass?" The soldier was happy and surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
