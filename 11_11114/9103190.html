Perant asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leona and Birdwin are very good," said Kerry Ben, who is actually very sweet. They seem to be taking a few days as a journey. On a short and comfortable rest day, Baldwin showed his skills as a hunter and warrior, and for Leona to hunt a group of fat long-legged rabbits and a seal, and Leona was like a woman of Alati. In that way, the warmth and cleanliness of their igloos was organized, and each rabbit fur was smashed, and the seal meat was smoked: "McGee...not bad." Unexpectedly, the gnome seems to be extremely close to the children in the tribe. Harmony, although later Kerry found that his behavior was essentially quite speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribe of the Alatilites is of course extremely poor, but this is not to say that there is no ordinary person in their hands, so the treasures brought by the sea More than just fish and algae, amber, coral, tourmaline, sea ivory, fish brain bones, these things are polished and sparkling, sometimes slick, sometimes accompanied by fishing nets, and sometimes you can get from the sea sand And found in the gravel, sometimes you can find these small things that are swallowed by them as a fish egg when you dig the belly of a big fish. The Aratiats may not know their value clearly, except for a few aesthetics. Most people will think that these bright little stones are very cute. Even if there are no tools that can punch holes in these stones, some young women will use the lines of animal hair to hang the stones around the chest forehead. Children are more interested in using them as toys and spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what does the gnome McGee use to exchange with the children, using his little toys, like flapping his wings, can fly to a few feet tall Birds, can catch the little crabs that they climb, they will rotate the dancing dolls face to face... and these things are made of wood with whale bones and floating with the waves, except time and manual The cost of a copper coin is arguable, but Kerry has not said anything after watching it for a while. The children’s smile is the most powerful persuasion. In this tribe that may never be passed by or stopped by a caravan, the gem It's just a little colored stone. For these children, the work of the gnomes may be more worthy of cherish and nostalgia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glan..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I already know." Perant look To the black hair caster: "Kremar, I think you'd better be able to talk to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world nodded, although he is still incredible until now, whether it is Gülen or Mei Mi, it is not like a person who will lose reason for love. Mei Mi is a pastor of Fro, she is admiring Bedwin’s. At the time, he did not give up his life or identity for him, and Gülen was the leader of a thief guild, and he could have countless women. They don’t feel strange when they walk together. After all, many Fro priests will go with thieves for a while, sometimes for asylum, sometimes for cooperation, and more for their own desires. Gold coins or intelligence, but the performance of Gülen and Meimi shows that their emotions are not as shallow as people do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you," Perant admired the look of the shells on the burning slate: "I saw it too," Drew Yi provoked the eyebrows on the left. "It’s quite enjoyable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to squid?" The fresh squid only wiped a thin layer of salt. It’s like a cloud before sunset, and it’s aroma when it’s slightly roasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me two copies, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight I have a room with Gülen "The soul of the opposite world said: "I can just talk to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it okay?" Perant asked, he and Gülen, still There is an igloo in McGee not because he likes thieves and gnomes, just to limit and monitor them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a mage." The black-haired caster said, "You are with Kerry Ben and have a good night's sleep."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kreimar is right," Kerry Ben said. "You really need to take a good rest for a night." The druid's face is not so good, maybe even It was gray, and his eyes were covered with dark blue like a cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster casts the last small spell before he walks out of the igloo. This spell not only takes away the murmur and dampness of the igloo, but also lets The igloo became a little warmer, and the adobe's masonry roof and walls melted a little, but then it freezed and was harder than before. The elves watched him push the snow bear's fur and walked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kreima looks much better," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Kerry Ben said: "Do you want to sleep or sleep outside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened before?" Perant asked, Kerry Ben obviously didn't want to tell him what happened between him and Kremar, but Druid really didn't want more unrest in the team: "Is his injury healed?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be no big deal." Kerry stood up and began to sort out the lichens and fur on the snow-covered bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He had hurt his eyes before. Is there anything else...place?" Perant said: "For example... thoughts, or, soul?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has turned around: "I thought you knew, Uncle Perant," he said. "Medusa's petrochemical gaze only works on the body. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He escaped us and escaped from you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was seriously injured."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't it be because of a serious injury that you need to seek help from your peers?" Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, please..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that I didn't want to eat celery and climbed to silver. The little Kerry, who has hidden himself in the leaves, has been away from us for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar is not celery."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He asked you to call me Uncle Perant instead of Perant." Perant said: "I think he is more terrible than celery."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say that," Kerry has taken a deep breath: "You said you should allow your companions to keep their secrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "When this secret will not hurt you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He won't." Kerry said categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so." Perant said: "Well, we should rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a pity that Perant’s wish is obviously impossible to complete tonight. He has not had time to stand up and heard a tragic cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid only gently pats on the ground, just like a little deer jumps up lightly, Kerry grabs the quiver and longbow Throw it to him, then quickly grab his own "Starlight" and "Silver Crown", the elf's double knives linger in the light light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the elves rushed out of the igloo, what they saw was a mess, and the Aratial igloos were about two from their igloos. Hundred feet, in this distance, Kerry Ben and Perant can certainly see their faces effortlessly. What makes them wary is that these strong fighters who can face fearless even in the face of killer whales and snow bears All of them were horrified, and some of them even fell into the snow, trembling, and even a scream was released, and some were desperately scratching their throats, as if they were stuck in the neck by an invisible hand, a woman Climbing out of the igloo, then with a blue-purple horrified face dumped next to a dark green lichens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar!" Kerry yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the black hair caster has cast the first spell, the eye-catching light breaks through the dark white light, between the igloo and the igloo The corners of the corners and the glimmers of the glory, the dark shadows were suddenly exposed and the tribe's shaman stumbled and ran out, shouting: "Sea Ghost, Sea Ghost!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that they have been discovered, the ghosts are no longer hiding their tracks. They screamed out of the snow and mud, and made a smile to humans. Their faces are like that. The ugliness and ugliness are like a pile of rotten seaweed with five senses, and like waxed people who are melted. Their skin is scum-like blue-yellow, and the epidermis is spread over large and small sarcomas and pus-supply pustules. Their teeth are black and bent inward, like a barb on a harpoon. Once they are bitten, they will be pulled a large piece of skin. Every sea ghost has already caught a prey, not a woman, or a child. There is a particularly strong sea ghost and even a hand Holding one between his teeth still biting a. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their faces and expressions are like the fear aura carried by the lich itself. There are people who are not strong enough to faint, and at least lose the power of resistance. However, the Alatirits headed by Nanuk, who recovered their courage almost in an instant after the initial panic, were not the others, their wives, their mothers and Their children, besides them, who else can protect them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shaman prayed loudly, constantly grabbing something from a large shell and sprinkling on them, whatever it was, further waking up and strengthening these strong warriors, who roared and threw them at the sea ghosts. Spears and harpoons, these weapons used to deal with whales and seals split the skin of the sea ghosts, let them scream, and the headed sea ghost suddenly grabbed a piece of festering flesh and threw it to the tribe's shaman fester. The flesh of the flesh exudes a dirty, rancid smell, and even if it is able to treat the salted puffin buried in the belly of the seal as a kind of delicious Almaty, it can’t help but vomit, and Nanuk rushes over. Pushing the shaman, the flesh falls on his bare back, the place suddenly red and swollen, and the coherent, bright abscess spreads across the back in several breaths, as well as spreading toward the neck and waist. trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t let them go!" Shaman shouted: "Don’t let them go to the sea, then we will never find our children again!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almaty who had been invaded many times by the sea ghosts know this, of course, the sea ghosts live in the sea, the cold and cruel sea has always been Their best shelters, and those who are brought into the sea by the sea ghosts, will be killed if they are not eaten. But the sea ghost is like having endless strength. The harpoon and the spear can't cause fatal damage to them. Many times, the sea ghosts just pull out the weapons that are stabbed on them, and they don't care about it. Staining blood wounds, even if the wounds can be as many as hundreds of them, they can still jump in the air, or directly pull out the obstacles in front of them, throw them to the side of the Aratial igloo from the sea. Less than a thousand feet, and the sea ghosts run like a stinking sea breeze, human harpoons and spears fall behind them, and some Almaty people have cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrows of the elves have arrived. The shimmering steel arrow whistling, and the strength of the road even after running through the neck of a sea ghost, shot another foot of the sea ghost, she fell from the air, chasing the back of Allah The Tilit immediately rushed to the ground and broke her head with a stone... The arrowhead of Perant’s arrow is only steel, but it does not prevent it from destroying the soft navel of the sea ghosts, and perhaps the eyes. Although they are as difficult to capture as the hummingbird's wings in the fast motion, the knives thrown by the thieves Gülen are slightly inferior to the elf's bow and arrow, but they also bring a lot of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are still four sea ghosts wrapped in their prey to the sea, their feet in the sea to pick up huge waves, just a little, just a little The leader of the sea ghosts was full of joy and thought that the prey in her mouth, the little daughter of Nanuk, had warm blood flowing between the teeth she did not consciously tighten, and the soft skin of the child was the love of the sea ghosts. The woman she caught in her hand began to resist, but it doesn't matter, the sea ghosts and other wise monsters like to see their prey struggle and lament, they like to watch the prey being drowned alive, eyes protruding, mouth The poor appearance of a big piece of paper is like a human being adding pepper and salt when tasting a small steak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
