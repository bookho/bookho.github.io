			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich’s spell book is well-collected in his pocket, the problem is that the spell inside can’t be used even if he can remember it - he doesn’t The same is true of other penitent lichs. He can't cast spells with negative energy, even the simplest negative energy rays. After tearing open a rotten scroll, it burns his hands. Didn't hurt anyone anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a few "take" spells from other wizards, very subtle and practical, but they are all placed in a safe place for him - for For a lich - he used to be so eagerly set up with so many traps, organs, golems and transmissions that are closely related to the cold and powerful negative energy, without the slightest omission of the present deity Far from being isolated, he couldn't get it, even couldn't see it or hear it. For this reason, the Lich cursed himself and the wicked alien soul for tens of thousands of times until he was desperate to stop thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell book from the thief can be said to be a small surprise, its cover and paper have no special place, neither human skin nor Not devil skin, just ordinary waterproof goat paper, the special ink for copying spells can only be said to be flat, there is no high-level spell inside, it is very common - the lich thinks this wizard may belong to a ship, because the most broken The spells on a few sheets of paper are basically related to wind, float, transmission, and ranged attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich took off his boots, opened the window and let the stars shine into the room, illuminating the cot, the spell book on his knees, he chose one Try to be as comfortable as possible, put your hands in a tower, start to concentrate, and analyze every spell you need. This boring and boring spell book consumed a whole day. On the third day, the lich began to remember the spell and transcribe the scroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Lady of the Golden Lady, he used the last scroll that was not related to evil and negative energy. The Lich admitted that this was a small adventure, though It was just a strong acid arrow spell, but it was released for murder. He didn't know if the eyes in the dark would allow him to do that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He succeeded, the Lich guessed perhaps because the wizard had already stood on the standpoint of justice, just like the difference in his body. The soul of the world kills the three evil thieves without any condemnation. Ending the life of an evil person does not make him punished. Is this perhaps one of the ways to repent? He looked forward to, but failed to get even a hint of nothing, no light, warmth and flowers, he had expected but involuntarily felt resentment and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has had a lot of reading in the mentor's tower. He knows that his atonement may last for hundreds of years, thousands of years, tens of thousands of years... even if the country is destroyed, the race is dead, the continent is broken, and the god is fallen - as long as he does not Destroyed by those who have not forgiven and forgotten him. When is it over? Where is the end? no one knows. This body will be his strongest shackles and the most sinister evidence. He will be alone, controlled, manipulated, and endlessly humiliated, betrayed and hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to die peacefully like a good mortal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fifth day, when the cook on the boat sent him bread, the lich calmly cast a bunch of damage to the fat man, the cheerful humanoid goblin. Sexual sound waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell failed, the force was drawn from his body, he shrank on the damp floor, the front was the fat and dirty toe of the cook, the most lich The panic is that his mind is blank. He no longer remembers any syllable in the spell, a gesture, and the soft whispers, beautiful streamers, and delicate touches that accompanied him from his birth disappeared. , gone, he no longer has magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible and majestic existence ruthlessly pushed him into the depths of the sea of ​​consciousness, and the lich got a pity when he passed the floating soul . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world comforted the panicked cook, came forward to visit his captain, the first officer and the yellow eyes thanked and supplemented with the need In order to eat a whole stewed chicken, instead of the lich, copy the whole day's scroll, wasting half a bottle of precious gem dragon blood ink and three rolls of fish paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich believes that the punishment he has received is already deep enough, but it is counterproductive. On the seventh day, it is still the despicable thief who occupies and uses this body. The connection between the deceased and the outside world gradually became vague and thin, and eventually he was put into a group of nothingness - he thought he would scream, cry, be crazy, but how do you have no throat, eyes and brain? Do this, so when he returns to the surface, the caster reveals an unusual indifference and sobriety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——How do you feel? Outsiders asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Very good, the Lich said, I am glad that I have not shown a weak drag, this is the first few days? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tomorrow, we will enter the Bibi dike - now know what is called no. The soul of the alien world asked helplessly, pro? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Just an experiment, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Don't do this again, the soul of the outside world yawned, you are not white happy, he shouted, sinking down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, the Lich said to himself that he took over control of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window of the cabin is open, the sea breeze slaps the paper on the table, the lich walks over and lifts it up carefully, the magic shines in black-red lines Flowing, flashing, a successful scroll. He put the reel back into the pocket, and the finger stroked the spell book. According to the direction of the star, he also had about a quarter of a night to choose the spells that might be needed tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that he has lost his joy and satisfaction when he remembers spells and feels that magic flows through his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After remembering the law he needed, the lich did not stay in the room, he went out, the strong sea breeze immediately wrapped him, and A new day is coming, spinning day by day, the magical star river near the vertical is no longer shining, the huge arc-shaped enamel presents a gorgeous purple-blue color, and the east side of the sea has already been lit with gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Early, sir." The sailors greeted him briskly, and their leader knew more, so he smiled and asked: "Have you finished your homework? Sir?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Lich said, "We will arrive at Bibi Dibao tomorrow. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said the captain. "We have a smooth and short journey. It's a pity. We all like you, sir. He paused for a moment and turned to look at his guests. "Since you have an open space, then I wonder if you are willing to have dinner with us, to celebrate and say goodbye?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster should have tried to deny it, but he now knows how to return to the humility he had already abandoned, so he just thanked the captain and determined the time with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner is of course full, but the lich is keenly aware that those people are trying to entertain him, they say some horrible jokes, some strange affair, the cook gives him the most butter and the biggest peach, thin The ship doctor also showed a set of needles without wire holes from the distantly locked Serris, pure gold. It is said that these needles can play different roles when inserted into the acupuncture points of the human body, which can make people live and can kill people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When their guests showed interest in this, others began to eat and laugh, because the boat doctors have not been able to find a so-called acupuncture point until now, that set of gold needles The biggest role in the little bird is to pick teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may have found out," said the captain, and now he and his guests are standing on the port side, near the bow, and the wind is propping the sails in the evening. The tiny splashes of water splashed on their clothes, and the crew were eating and singing in the captain's room. "I hope you don't give birth to them because of these extra things."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't," said the Lich. He knows why the captain said this. They don't know that this body is occupied by two souls. They only see a lovable guy suddenly becoming lonely and indifferent. Of course, he thinks he is being unable to resort to words. Bothering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have any help..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Lich Quickly but gently replied, he was surprised that the alien soul could actually gain the trust and love of these mortals in such a short period of time, without his help - the idiot did not even fully grasp the lingua franca : "Sorry, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain shook his head indifferently, he untied his dark brown short cloak, turned it over and put it on again. The reverse side of the cloak is dark gray silk, a coin-sized Sulun sacred emblem - seven silver stars around a pair of female eyes, located above the lumbar vertebrae, when it faces inward, it is almost It can't be seen - unless that person has his excellent eyesight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caubert of the Little Birds." The captain said, extending his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich looked down at the hand - the hand of the goddess Su Lun, a month-old goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
