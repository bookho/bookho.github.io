After all, the side islands have been abandoned for too long, and the inner library is almost It is empty, and the silver coins and coins that are exchanged for sugar beet and cane sugar are taken by their new owners without hesitation in exchange for the weapons and armor of the soldiers, although they also know that this is the most important, but out of the day after tomorrow. Some of the geniuses that have been cultivated, these servants who look at the master's majesty and comfort are more important than anything else that is unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s interesting to say that after coming to this plane from the soul of the alien world, he is the first to truly participate in the human festival to go to him and the lich When I first landed from Chaos Sea to Jianjian Port, it coincided with the celebration of the goddess Fro, the day of the goddess, the first day of April, when the sweet peas were at their peak. In fact, the next fifteen days is the Grass Festival. It is a day when people celebrate the winter and leave, and the spring is returning. Only the people living in Jianjian Port are not pirates, black merchants who sell for pirates, or thieves. There are few good people who rely on their own hands and the land to live. Of course, they will not pay too much attention to this festival; after the grass festival is the Midsummer Festival, which is a celebration of music and love. Young men and women are in the woods at night. Meet, play, and pour love, so there will always be a lot of marriages after the Midsummer Festival. But at that time they had already arrived in the Grey Ridge. The festivals and celebrations of human nature have nothing to do with the elves of the Silver Crown jungle. After the Midsummer Festival is the Harvest Festival, which is now a busy festival for people around him. As the name suggests, The hardworking people pray for the same good luck next year after celebrating this year's rich harvest. Although on the Longhuo Island, whenever people work, they always work, and the people who enjoy themselves are always enjoying themselves, but this one The festival is highly valued but it is an indisputable fact. Even Amos on the East Coast Island sent a sergeant to send a can of beet sugar and a can of cane sugar. Recently, he has been trying to make a good match with the side island, which may become After the lord of the East Crown, for reasons that everyone knows well, he has some taboos and alienation from Kremar on the side of the island. Now he is obviously too hard to say that it should be the last of the island’s advanced tribute. A jar of sugar will be returned to the East Crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wants our soldiers," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He didn't recruit a lot of soldiers?" asked the soul of the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not a soldier," Cavalier sneered at him. "Just a mercenary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give him?" Gülen asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We still can't lose Amos," Liona said, while she grabbed a piece of lamb leg meat directly in her mouth, she is now more and more Like a mercenary or a warrior, but the education about the lady only accounts for less than one-fifth of the area in her life: "If the East Crown has no lord, then the remaining three lords will not "That's the opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are just about to move," said Gülen. "It’s a pity that our Amos, though still pretty good, The piece of mutton we left for him was too big. He was still desperately trying to gather the strengths left by his father and his brother. He wanted to bring the army of so many people before his child could not grow his teeth and fangs. It’s not that easy to get together as a force.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Child? Then he is no longer an eunuch now?” Birdwen asked, giving Leona sipped a cup of coconut wine: "There are not many priests on the island of Longhuo. You know who it is. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Yadell was embarrassed to put down the glass: "It's me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "When?" What makes Bedwin a little uncomfortable is that this thing, Gülen knows, Krimaar and Elf Kerry seems to know that only he heard the news for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When we were invited to visit Baita," Leona said: "I don't know, don't look at me like this, I just guess. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's right." Gülen said: "But I know that this thing is not what Yadell told me. I have my source of intelligence." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mage around Amos invited me," Yadel said. "And at that time... you know, you, Your Highness, and Crema. Lord and others are not there, I am not sure what will happen after the rejection, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this thing is difficult to start," Leona comforted Baldwin and said, "Look, what can Yadell say, Sir Birdwin, do you know, I helped the king of the East Crown, Amos, repair his Jinjiang?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birdwin barely lifted his lips and found that he could hardly make a heartfelt smile now. He tried to keep himself from thinking, but he still couldn’t erase the inner shadow. If the owner of the island is not Cremaar is himself, then the concealed person is probably the black haircaster, or he is the lord of Thunderbolt, not an ex-inferior paladin...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took Leona’s hand, kissed and kissed, and then nodded to Rosada’s pastor: “I didn’t blame you, my friend, I am just... a little surprised. In addition, please don’t use the title for me. We are companions. Just like Kremar and Kerry, you can call my name, repair, you are no longer the Thunderbolt. The lord is no longer your lord, we should get along like a friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan’s sight moves among these people, and he ends up Grinning, just like I didn’t find this little unhappiness is exactly what he caused. "Okay, friend," he aggravated his tone: "Let's make a cup for his friend, he took the lead to raise the silver cup, and then others responded to his actions, although Birdwin seemed a bit disgusted by him. When we arrived, then we continued to discuss..." He ignored some cold atmosphere, "those things about the military."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people do we have now?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3,500." Revised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember only about 3,000 before," said Kerry Ben. "And you told us that some of them will take some time to get used to it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More people have left from Highland Norman..." Cremari chose a milder word, but Leona and Bo Devin, and the repairs still inevitably have the look of sorrow and remorse: "There are some people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people have set off a rebellion," Leona said: "The new king executed them and their relatives, and also set up wooden stakes, from the rebel territory to the king, everyone involved, or suspected of participating in the rebellion were taken off. The clothes, the wooden piles, the free people, the tenant and the merchants in their territory were given food, armor and gold coins because they were believed to have provided food, armor and gold coins for the rebellion, and were all shackled and sentenced as serfs or It was sold to slave traders. I have several children here. Their parents are businessmen from Norman Norman. Members also used to be in a city in "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"He is crazy." Yadel said that he had not received an education on how to become a ruler, but in the sanctuary of Rosada, there are many books for him to understand these high-ranking people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe because of my reasons." Leona said, "His weak body made him unable to give birth to his children..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait," Gülen couldn't help but interrupt her: "So who did I murder?" He didn't forget his biggest crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The child." Li Oona raised her arm and her fingers resolutely crossed: "It’s my grandfather, the upper-ranking old man of Norman Norman. A request was made because someone suspected that he had an incompetent eunuch son. He threatened my uncle to say that if he could not let a woman give birth to a child, my uncle would be expelled from Norman Norman."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a real life," said Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our Normans are very concerned about this." The explanation explained: "In particular, he has become the king of Norman in the Highlands."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are people who have a heart, of course, they can always hear the sneaky whispers in their ears." The Elf Ranger shook his head, which should be good news for them, but I thought of it. What does this mean behind, Kerry is not happy anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for the army..." The soul of the outside world looks to Leona and Birdwin, yes, in the recognition of most people, these soldiers Both the knight and the knight should belong to the side island, because the owner of the land they live in is not Leona or Birdwin, but Cremari, but whether it is the soul of the outside world or the undead. It won't take advantage of this powerful force that seems to be very valuable to others. The soul of the outside world is because of the ethics it must adhere to, and the lich is not interested in a group of stupid soldiers, so how does this matter decide? Still have to look at the two of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona touched Baldwin lightly and moved the glass to her lips, giving the initiative to her lover, Bo Devin smiled at her, "five hundred people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a little less?" Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he complains," Birdwin said: "Tell him that we are only 20,000 in front of the number of orcs that are close to 100,000. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they briefly discussed a question about the gnome McGee. To be honest, a gnome has always acted as a helper in the poet's poetry. They are hiding in deep ground like a goblin. Staring at the heroes who dare to challenge the vicious rulers with red eyes, tiny, hard-toned arrows or huge monsters with oily iron smell are the weapons they use most, but It doesn't hurt the protagonist, it's more like a harlequin or a joke. This is of course a mistake. As far as they can see, the gnomes are a selfish to extreme race. They can't be used at all. To act as an obstacle, they will run without a trace when they have not seen the enemy trail. The most daring among them is just like those on the East Coast Island, surrounded by prey in the trap. A few mouthfuls of spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now McGee insists on going with them, but his performance is like being sent to the altar by the caster to dig out the heart, everyone has the opportunity to watch him All kinds of preparations were all ridiculous. There were several times. They wanted to persuade him to stay. McGee didn’t bother to talk. He just shifted his eyes to Baldwin’s Mithril arm, so they couldn’t help but have nothing to say. Can you say that unless you can let Birdwin stay, can you really let Birdwin stay? Even Gülen can't say this, even thieves have to pay a lot of effort to steal or snatch someone else's property, and even if Baldwin doesn't need this asset, he can't watch it. Friends are in great danger, but they stand by and watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has asked Crimmar, after all, the Mithril arm uses his magic, but Kreima can’t guarantee, the Silver Golem Originally, it was the magical product before the Great Holocaust. How specific is probably only the real master of the Lich. I can say that they are favored by the lucky god once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that we have to take him." Li Oona sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the gnome is assigned to the magic creature column," Gülen said in a consistently rude manner: "We can put him into the magic pet." It’s very convenient to carry it in your pocket.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin glanced at the thief with a warning: “You need to be more respectful,” he said. “If we I agree to let McGee join, he is our companion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief licked his mouth indifferently, he looked at Kremar: "Today's business Is it finished?" He said: "I want to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
