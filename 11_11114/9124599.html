Although Chimera is deformed and described as eccentric, his temper is not very good, but because it can be called violent combat power even in monsters, it is still very popular with people with power and identity. They often use this kind of monster. Deterrent subordinates or to remove their own enemies, and to protect themselves - the monsters of Grenada have been cast spells, a rune crest can guarantee that the holder can use it arbitrarily, although the rune pattern The chapter will also be taken away, destroyed or have other minor problems, but people will always think that they will not be the one who has suffered unfortunately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A controlled Chimera not only represents a huge sum of money, but sometimes it may represent a knight or a territory, and the businessmen are gearing up. The face rose red, and several of them even stood up - the soul of the outside world couldn't help but think of some less harmonious words, like my ** has been hungry and thirsty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you need?" A businessman can't wait to ask, look at him, even the awe and jealousy that Mittitch should have. I completely forgot, I believe that if there is nothing special about Mitt, he will try to get them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Iron." Mittitch walked down from his seat and snorted in a sly cat's gesture, lying in the pool. Chimera, which is bigger than Kyrimmar and the elves, and the Chimera that has been changed by the orcs, but when Mittitch touched it, it was as smooth as a small one. The sheep, even the tail of the serpent, slouched down on the ground and circled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business people face each other, just as every businessman has his own guild, and there are also monopoly instruments signed by the lord or the king - silk guild Merchants can't buy and sell alcohol. Merchants in alcoholic guilds can't buy or sell livestock. Merchants in livestock guilds can't buy or sell wood... even those who are allowed to enter here can put their fingers into their hands because their identity and wrists can be slightly relaxed. The pockets of other businessmen - know that if you are outside of Grenada, the person who does this will not only be expelled from the original guild, but will also be convicted for failing to come up with the relevant monopoly instruments. All the property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that they can represent black iron, as we have seen before, if you can get black iron and steel, a squat in the narrow gallery The ordinary businessman between the roads can immediately jump out of the original level and become a special person worthy of value and trust like Larry. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman who holds the black iron will never give up his share, but other countries will not easily open this gap, they are It is with this to curb the expansion of Grenada, even if their king or Dagong is stupid, it will not be stupid enough to allow the enemy's tentacles to stretch without limit - if there is a small amount, there may be a way, but Mitt Kurt is the eldest son of King Grenada, and the thing he exchanged is a strong Chimera, indicating that the deal is definitely not free to perfuse and deceive the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mittert showed some disappointment, the lady in gray robes who had become silent since the disciple left, suddenly stood up, she I ignored Mitt’s questioning eyes, grabbed a heavy box from the sleeves and threw it directly on the floor. People heard a loud and loud squeak. Larry’s ear trembled and he could hear it. It was the sound that the steel could make - he rushed to pick it up and found that a crack had been knocked out on the gravel floor, the crack stretched around, and the piece of steel was not damaged. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitit has taken over the piece of steel, the cold metal reflects the fire, the surface is delicate and smooth, it is a very rare steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms.," he asked with respect: "Do you have the black iron and steel I need here?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not me," said Ms. Gray Robe: "It’s my disciple, Mullen Lorenos, who is a Highland Norman and a lord of a small town, but in him On the territory, there are black iron and brass.” She took two steps forward and looked at Crimall: “I just accepted the invitation for him,” she said. “But he is now your brother. I think that even if I don't say anything, you can know it very quickly, but since I have already arrived here, I will finish what I wanted to do before."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
