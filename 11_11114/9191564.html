After finishing a chapter at noon, I found that it was more appropriate to put them together, so I sent them together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin. Tang Cray is outside the village, a mill break abandoned by the orc attack— - In fact, the mill can be said to be quite intact, except that some metal parts are removed by orcs or thieves, it has roofs, walls, even heavy stone mills are in place, and are discarded. Because the orcs have milled human flesh and blood here, and since then, the flour from the stone mill has the smell of flesh and blood and the coldness of the tomb, and people often hear women and children in the mill. The cry of crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as an outsider, it’s good to have such a place to live, and the farmer’s son sent a bunch of dry to Bedwin. Straw, Birdwin and he thanked him, but the thin teenager looked like he did not hear anything - then Birdwin heard ominous footsteps in the middle of the night, he put his hand on his own short On the sword, still with his eyes closed, some people in the dark passed through the mill without doors and windows, and went straight to Bywin's side, carrying a heavy bucket in his hand...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer and his wife were awakened, or everyone in this small village was awakened, and they were horrified to find that the creepy scream came from the mill, the farmer The wife looked around anxiously because she found that her little son was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The torch shines like a day in the mill and the place around the mill. Birdwin saw a young man coming out, probably the village chief or the villagers trust. Man - When he saw a white man wearing a white robes embroidered with grizzly bears, Birdwin flustered without a reason, but fortunately it was not his Grizzly Knight, but the latter. The brother or father, the knight’s relatives held the torch and looked serious at the mill: “The outsider,” he shouted. “We heard someone shouting here, is the beast attacking you? Or the thief trying to take it away. Your bag?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not sure," Birdwin said, inserting the stiletto into the sheath and extending himself to the old man. The palm of his hand said that he did not mean to be an enemy of the villagers. "Please come in," he said. "But don't be too many people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knight's When the father and brother walked into the mill, he easily found the place where Bedwin had been, and there was straw. Lying on a person, the farmer's wife immediately issued a cry of alarm, because that is their youngest son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't approach him." Baldwin immediately said: "He has no life, but I am not sure if he..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" asked the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He tried to knock my head with a bucket." Bydwin said that the old man and several villagers saw the position of the straw bed near the head. With a distinct pit, the farmer's youngest son can be said to have used enough strength, the iron hoop of the barrel has broken, and the board is even more divided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it possible?" One of the villagers muttered to himself: "What kind of child is Xiaoboji."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too," unexpectedly, the stranger said: "I think he is controlled or tempted - there is no pastor in your village yet. If you take him to the temple or sanctuary in the kingdom to see it, if he is not eroded enough, then a holy water can save his reason."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance after Xiaoboji’s wake-up seems to prove this. They sent Xiaoboji to the temple in Rosada. The pastors determined that he was tempted by the devil, and he attacked Baldwin. Just because he wants to take his dagger and kill everybody he thinks has humiliated and bullied him, including his father, mother and brother. The villagers thought they should thank their guests, but the traveler didn’t want anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you should at least leave a name." The farmer insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chazo." Birdwin said that in the Norman Highlands, Chazzo is a very common name, meaning a hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birdwin Don Clay is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Chazo is not a good name," just as the hunter Chazzo walked on the deserted path, a sharp voice suddenly said: "Humble, squat, incompetent. It is also suitable for a king." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter looked up and he saw a furry black hamster lying on a branch, it looked like any ordinary hamster, except for exceptional The "circle", when it squats on a branch, looks like a ball, fat and hair almost obscures its claws, ears and wings, its eyes are yellow, in the dim light like a fire Generally shiny. The hunter didn't look at it. He knew it was a little devil. He was once raised by the black-haired dragon Krymall, but it was an abyss creature that betrayed his master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My master ordered me to come," the little devil's figure disappeared, but its voice was like a gossamer lingering in the human ear. "With sincerity and gifts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which master is yours?" The hunter smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who else, the one with the most power and strength," the little devil whispered softly: "He heard about your business for you. Deeply saddened by the torture and humiliation, "Yes," it spoke out of this title and satisfactorily saw the hunter's muscles tighten: "You should have been a hero, you are fighting the most powerful red dragon in the entire plane." - Victory over her, your king, your people, your wife and son, all survived under your protection, but what do you do when you are unidentified and angry? They shamelessly abandoned you, made your son a new king, sent your clothes to the mausoleum, you are still alive, but they let you die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "But as the highland Norman King, Birdwin Don Clay is indeed dead," said the hunter. "It’s just his vanity body, his soul and ideals have long since died."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, how can you say that?!" Ghostly said: "My master, of course, and I think that only you are a good king who can reproduce the glory of Norman in the Highlands. Who else can do it besides you, those hypocritical nobles? Are those weak Marshals? Or a woman, or a child? They will only let Highland Norman slip into the abyss of poverty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am just a person now." The hunter said: "They won't admit me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who said you are just a person?" The little devil said: " As long as you reappear in the king, appear in front of your knight, all the lies will be immediately revealed, as long as you wear armor, hold a wide sword, and wear a gorgeous robes to sit on the throne, your people will Crouching in front of you, they will worship you like a god, just ask for your blessing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My son expelled me, The hunter said: "An unnamed hunter cannot enter the court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My master will help you.” The little devil said: “Everything you want can be satisfied.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Tell me his name.” The hunter ordered: "Otherwise I can only say that you thought I was as stupid as a farmer's son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil pretended to think for a while: "Good "It says, "I will tell you, but first, you should first look at the gift that the grown-up gives you. "It doesn't know where to pull out a big scorpion and throw it directly at the hunter's feet: "Look, I think this is really sincere." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter opened his glance and for a time he couldn’t even control himself as before, it was his secret silver chain, the enchanted wide sword, And the silver arm that shone with soft light.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really..." He said hoarsely, "a very generous gift." . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They originally belonged to you. "The little devil took a little triumph." Wear them, they have been waiting for a long time, and the king is kneeling. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent temper of the god of the storm, Talos, does not seem to be very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the port was once again in the dead, the hurricane screamed and screamed from here, then passed through the entire Azores - the streets It has become a half of Zeguo. The body of fish and humans floats on the water. The water is poured into the hall of the blunt pub. The pub owner swings the whip and continually beats his kobold slave, making it heavy as soon as possible. The wine barrel was carried to the room on the second floor, otherwise the sea water invaded the wine barrel and the wine was broken. But as previously described, the stairs were narrow and steep, and the thin, thin head of the dog didn't step on it, and fell into the water with the barrel. The guests gathered in the hall couldn't help laughing together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub owner is going crazy, he stands on the stairs, grabs the handrail with one hand, and waves the whip in one hand, but the kobold flies away with the barrel His whip can only pick up gray streaks in dirty water. The guest's ridicule made him lose his proper reason. He went down to the water and almost reached the chest with the water surface. He grabbed the chain of the kobold and smothered it in the water. When he found that the chain was empty, it was too late - I didn't know when the shackled Kobold pulled him down the water, and after a while, the cinnabar spray was set on the water. The guests screamed wildly, excited for the thrilling scene, they rubbed their feet, their eyes glowed, and they laughed and fainted when they saw the pub’s face being turned over. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The recent tip of the port is indeed too lacking in entertainment." Drake said, closing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell in the blunt pub is not flattering. For Drake, it’s no different from the goblin’s lair. There is also a so-called The bed, or the wormhole, the inferior whale oil lamp smoky, the mottled piece on the wall and the top, could not find a flat or intact place, but since this is the request of Gülen - he even pulled out The small movement of the handkerchief in front of the nose did not dare to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, Drake also has a little doubt about how things will develop to this point. He and Gülen can still be said to be "friends" at the beginning. Of course, you know that the "friendship" in the port of Hong Kong is always very short. Drake thinks so, but now he is almost uncertain. - He may not be interested in Gülen, but Gülen may have really had one or two points for him. He is still so complete and healthy, and has certain power and strength. Gülen has become the biggest. After the leader of the Thieves Guild - Drake thought that Gülen would take him and then fatten it to the little goblins who used to deal with the body in the port of Mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;African female grandfather’s illegitimate child sits cautiously on a swaying three-legged chair, and Gülen lies only a few steps away from him. On the bed, when he entered the room, Drake saw with his own eyes that countless worms crawled out from under the bed and on the bed, and in the corners and corners of the room, disappearing like a tidal wave, which made him A bit skeptical of the ridiculous rumor, it is true - he used 50,000 gold coins to buy information that Gülen is the son of the thief god Mask and the human son, and everyone knows that the thief god Mask from More than a thousand years ago, he began to hate all the worms. In the place where his priest was, the worms were extinct, but the priest of Mask also needed to release the gods or cast drugs to clean the worms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the thing I want you to do?" The tattered smash (if it was really awkward) suddenly sounded a lazy voice. It’s like the owner doesn’t care much about this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are already 130 items in stock," Drake replied reverently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drake sighed and swallowed the explanation In the stomach, he knows very well that Gülen and he like no one to hear any excuse. If incompetence and slack are crimes, then the only difference is that incompetence is more sin than slack, if you are just Slack, then... At least, you can get a one-and-a-half-point respite, but if it is incompetent, the leader of a thief union will not want you to continue to shamelessly encroach on the air, water and food of other available people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for a better way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but not too long, The longer the time, the more unfavorable you are, my dear friend," said Gülen. "The timing is the best. The king of the silver-crowned jungle has passed away. His heirs, Kerry Ben and Singer. Being single-mindedly entangled with the orc king of the whistling plains, the king of the orcs, and the orcs; Highland Norman, the despicable hypocrisy, Birdwin. Don Cray is dead, and he inherited the throne. He is only seven years old, but now he is only ten years old. The sons of Norman, the people of Norman, have different opinions, especially after the death of Princess Leona; Grenada and the country are also recuperating, and the Longhuo Islands are no longer there."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will do whatever I want," Drake said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German gave a sharp laugh after the squatting, Drake waited for a long time, but Gülen was not talking, he took the courage to go forward I found that the bed was already empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gülen’s mood may be as bad as Talos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw him and Mei Mi’s daughter, Afra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan thought she had died long ago, perhaps being dug up as a sacrifice, or silently dying in the priest’s apprenticeship—her body There is no red dragon's blood. When I was a baby, it looked like a normal child. He...believed that she was dead, but she didn't, although Gülen never saw her since she gave up her. I passed this child, but when he saw the current owner of Créfa, she knew that she was his daughter Afra – she was like she saw herself in the mirror when she was young, and her eyes were inherited. Yu Meimi, a rare gemstone eye, she sits on the throne, the tiny is like an ornament, but she is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe she can’t do as much as Craymar, like her arms, but she is also saving her own power, just like The bird is growing a hard positive feather. In her soul, Gülen didn’t see him or see Mei Mi. It’s like seeing another Kreima, full of contradictions, but because of this Contradictions and extraordinarily tenacity and stubbornness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she looked at him, there was no hate or love in her eyes. He could only say that she was a stranger to her. People - Kremar did not deceive her. His description of Gülen and Mei Mi can be said to be neutral, without any thoughts and perceptions of self. This way of thinking is fair, and justice is not like a Dragon, Gülen doesn't care if she hates herself, but he still feels a bit unwilling to do it - Afra can ignore him, but how can she forget her mother? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan does not regret his original practice, maybe Afula stays with him, he will kill Mei Mi’s only relic in this world. Uncertain, but he will still be angry, but he is also calmly aware that Afra is still under the protection of Kremar, and the silver whip he is very familiar with is quietly acting as the belt of Afra. . Also, although people say that the caster other than the devil and the devil is involved in the bloody battle, there is only one death, but Gülen implicitly feels that Kremar may be the exception, and if he can really get from the bloody battle Return, then this powerful mage will not be happy to see that his ward has changed into a pile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan hates Afra, and Afra does not like Gülen, but personal emotions have not affected the trade between them, Gülen and The invisible contract of the master of Kryfa seems to be able to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, Gülen will also speculate maliciously - Afra is an ambitious child, he can feel it - maybe not for a year or two Let the emotional deterioration and corruption, then ten years, twenty years, and even longer... Afra will grow into a charming and powerful female lord, when she has a look, a gesture, a whisper, and Or a short piece of paper, you can play the fate of countless people between the palms of the hands, she really willing to hand over the expensive and rare authority for a meager gratitude when she is young? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal may have nothing to complain about compared to Gülen. When he is busy with the bones, his loyal Red Dragon has become The king of the orc, Geshe, and the demigod lich, Edel, had a plate meal, a glass of wine, and he learned the bad news in a dangerous midnight tea party, and if it wasn’t for the help of the thief’s god Mask, he probably Only with resentment has become another ghost wandering in the seventy-seventh islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only useful piece of information he got in the seventy-seventh islands was that Edell was the gray robes that were kneeling beside Crimdale. But maybe Edel's original conspiracy was to win the fat soul of Gree. He did not return to the kingdom of Grenada. After all, he had already guessed that King Grenada was in this ridiculous tragedy. What role played a role, as a person who was once really favored by Grydy, he can not be trusted by the new king, he does not need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came to the place where the Dragon Dragon Greedy had hidden dragon eggs. There were no fewer than 100 colored dragon eggs, and there were few metal dragon eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are they all alive?" The sage of Mask, a seemingly delicate woman, curiously stroked the eggs. They feel different when touched. They are smooth, rough, warm, hot, and cold. The surface of the egg has patterns, spots, and some are solid. "Can they still be hatched?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Ostall had participated, so his answer was very positive, but these hatched... It's hard to say that they are dragons. They only leave the body and talent of the dragon, but only the wisdom of the beast. The memory cannot be passed down, and it can't be systematically studied. Simply put, under the pressure of the law, they can best Hatching out the black dragons that have been encountered by Cremal and others, but they are still dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Mask, this seems to be enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you must say that there is any dissatisfaction with Austal, maybe it is...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you hiding?" asked Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not your prisoner," Ostall said: "I have nothing to hide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Glory reveals a gloomy smile. "If you think so, you can get some comfort," he said casually. "That's it." He walked around Austal. "Just don't let me catch your tail, I will lift you up and pump you out your own intestines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have that power," Starr smiled and said: "I am not working for you, it is your father, respectable Mask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I just let you spit out Intestines, not the heart," Gülen patted his hands and made an exaggerated and surprised look: "Wait, I might say wrong, red robe, even if it is the heart, I can let you chew it and swallow it." Go inside.” He turned and smiled, looking at Ostal, the two of them were enemies, and the “mother” of Ostal’s “Grandi” took Mei Mi’s Culture and life, and Glenn "father" god of thieves Ma Sike will undoubtedly have an inescapable responsibility in the death of Grenada. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this place, under Mas, perhaps with the conspiracy and conspiracy of the gods Shrek, they can only become "friends." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be careful when you leave." Austal said falsely: "Pay attention to my trap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————————————— —————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You know "After a moment of calm, a sharp voice said: "He will trigger every trap you have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hopefully." Tal said that he looked at the figure and was busy sorting out the little devil Asmodeos. "It seems that you have failed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asmodeos did not want to let others know that he was almost caught by a mortal, even if he used a very powerful rune: "Bedwin. Don Cray is finished," he said impatiently: "One With a walking dead, There is no value worth saving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't say him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He It's a fool, a piece of wood, a stone!" The little devil was so angry that his hair was erected, while swearing from the bottom of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal does not feel very sorry: "So let him go." A mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we not kill him?" said the little devil Asmodeos: "Put his soul into the gem." Chicken flavor, and perhaps beef flavor, anyway, the experience of this soul is really rich and complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," said Ostal. After a pause, he added: "Is it not more interesting to watch him fall into endless confession? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
