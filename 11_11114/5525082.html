			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ker!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone shouted outside his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors and Cremari agreed to go out to play together (they felt that his name was a bit of a mouthful, and he simplified himself into a Kerr). And said that he should not pay for himself, to thank him for writing letters and dispensing ointments (to resist the nasty little creatures), yellow eyes is the most ardent and enthusiastic among them, he stood in Cray Outside Mar's door, he is dressed in a gorgeous, wide-sleeved linen shirt with a ribbon on his cuffs. The small silver button on the vest is buckled from under the neck to the underside of the ribs. The leather belt and boots are shiny, daggers and The metal on the scabbard is engraved with nine sea dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kreima walked out the door, he was boring but swaying the whole body regularly, they were used to the bumpy deck, and the solid and stable land would be reversed. Let them feel dizzy and sway like a goose will make them feel better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster is very curious about where the sailors will take him - the brothel or the casino, poorly seeing the same in the world where the souls of the alien world are Old and illegal, you can't complain that every passer (both men and women) would want to go to these two places. They are too mysterious and seductive, and they are so easy to get safe and secure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The egret is a hotel, but Kremar feels that the pattern is not much different from the blunt pub, serving wine in the back hall of the first floor. Food, two and three floors for accommodation, but its room is really much better than the blunt pub, the servant of the hotel will ignite the smell of a bit pungent in every clean room, drive away Unpopular small guests, bedding with goose down, wool and washed white cotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the yellow eyes and Kremar walked side by side down the last step, there was a happy and frenetic wave in the front hall of the hotel. Everyone Laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, they are playing 'pull down'," Huang said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the second round of "pulling off the horse" has begun, and the crew of the Little Birds thoughtfully opened up a small piece for their new friends. Empty place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "pull down the horse" game is very simple. First, you need a man who is kneeling on the ground, then a woman lying on the back of the man, and finally a man standing in front of the woman. The latter two need to lift one foot to each other and try to overthrow the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman who is not young, her face can only be described as ordinary, full of vitality and sensuality, she lifts one without fear The fat feet swept the calves and knees in the air. The man's feet were a few times larger than her, and the ankles were much thicker, but she was full of war and had no idea of ​​retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether you are drinking or eating, the guests staying here are cheering for them, men are men and women are women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural gap between men and women is balanced in the posture of standing and lying, not to mention the woman and her "horse", she is dead The backhand grabbed the man's body, the upper body lifted up, the buttocks grinded his hip bones, used his strength to fight against her enemies, and the other did not need to confront the feet, the five fingers bent, smashing the cracks in the slate floor, she The face was red, the skin was hot, and the snoring gasped, the hair and the placket spread out in the battle, and the Ru room on both sides of the body swayed like a pendulum on a festive day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, dry her!" the men shouted, and the women screamed and spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle became fierce, the male opponent’s legs had been lifted over the knees, and he clenched his fists and split his lips to reveal two rows of yellow and sharp teeth, not Pushing is a stepping on, the woman is not willing to show weakness, her legs are separated and lifted up high, the skirt is piled up at the waist, the thighs and deeper are at a glance, the men become crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She didn't wear pants?" Kreima said in amazement and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do women wear pants?" The sailor of the little bird said in confusion: "They have no need to be careful to protect things, only men will wear pants. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕~~," said Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden burst of laughter at this moment, the woman was kicked to the ground, her thighs lifted up high in the sky, the skirt covered Her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is quite a bit strong," Huang said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then go to her." The sailor said: "There will be no more than five silver coins."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creathton is clear, this is not a game, but a way to attract guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on," the ship doctor held the caster's arm, although this action was not easy for him to be close to Kremar's head. "That's not for you." He has a son who is about the same size as Kremar, so he talks unconsciously with a lure of ingredients. "It's still early," he said. "We can go first." The market, you said that you want to go to the market, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the port of Mind, the hawkers are in the dark alleys and In the gap between the piers, food, potions and handicrafts are sold. Of course, you don’t have to look at it. It’s not the inferior counterfeit that is pinched in the black and thin fingers. It’s a “bait” with a beautiful appearance. They are more about fraud and theft. And robbery; merchants have their own shops, two to three-story black and white half-timbered houses, facing narrow and dirty streets, but their business methods and service attitudes are no better than those hawkers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no law in Minato, or that their governor is more concerned about the gold than the balance, more accurately, he only values ​​that; When the captain is doing business there, he must bring his most powerful crew and the sharpest knife to be his own guard, judge and executive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruler of Bibi Dibao is more willing to master all that can be mastered. He does his best, and he has to do his best, no matter what, put it in his mouth. In the pocket of the bag, worn on the finger, worn on the body, on the verbal, written on the parchment, the bright face, the dark face, the bought, the sold... all in his Within the scope of attention - in his prison, there are bakers who bring white bread and sawdust to the bread, merchants who use the old-fashioned lizard leather for the dragon skin, and there are rogues who are stalking and stalking. And those smugglers and thieves who often make a business without a deal, even one or two apprentices who dare to sell inferior potions and reels in Bituminburg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailor and Kremar of the Little Birds walked out of the hotel, even in the outer city, the road here still allowed six people to walk hand in hand, the road The stone is dark brown with a slight arch in the middle, and a dark sewer covered with perforated slate on both sides. The houses on both sides of the road have porches that are outwardly picked out, painted with white lime and blue windows and doors. It is decorated with gray-yellow thin slate, surrounded by and dotted with wisteria and rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This street is almost always a hotel and pub, hot and sun-drenched, a variety of painted wrought iron pieces hanging in the air, people who come and go silently clarify their identity - the pub's pattern is grapes and There are wine glasses, and there will be knives, forks and keys on the signboards of the hotel. Some hotels will also mark the holy trees or holy flowers in the corners, which is to suggest that their owners welcome the believers and pastors of the gods. In the case of a small weapon hung under a single leg, it is said that the owner of the hotel is happy to entertain mercenaries and adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went through a pub where the people were dancing, and a strong mercenary lifted up the slender woman, her skirt flew over her hips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two hands are dragging their boots at the shoe store. The cows are a dairy store, the wheat ears and the plate are the bakery, and the pigs are the butchers. And there is something that looks like a rope loop...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Face," said the yellow eye. “A very tasty snack.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for him to explain, they have smelled the smell of oil, tumbling in a boiling whale pan With the rope they just saw, the maker is putting a hand into the well-mixed dough and then pulling it out quickly, his fingers flexibly flying in the hot air, the distance between the cracked grease However, a piece of parchment is so thin, the dough falls into the oil, bubbling, rolling and swelling, forming a beautiful double-eight-word pattern. The whole production process is like performing, and the crowd watching the crowd excitedly drink. Bring up the color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doughnuts that were picked up were rolled in soy flour and brown sugar and wrapped in a wide leaf, each of which was expensive, but It tastes crispy and delicious, and it is so delicious that it makes the souls of the outside world think of twists and sprinkles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what he thought was fried buns or hemp balls - wrapped in sugar-boiled fruit or marinated fish, fried also, The surface is sprinkled with sesame seeds; the noodle cake called “Couscous” makes him unable to contain the burritos in the 24-hour fast food restaurant; a “round soup” that is highly praised by the sailors – The mutton, vegetables and olives are cooked together. The clay pot lid is conical. It is like a witch hat. The top is white, he remembers that in his own world, this Taji pot is used in the Northeast restaurant. Who is the person who has no research, but the shape of the pot, the mouth of the pork and chestnuts are still impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
