			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft prevention section, updated at 9 o'clock tomorrow night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanwai--Dragon (2) The story of Ingway and Edelna<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't stay here," Perant said. "The hurricane is coming." When he changes into a giant squid, he can feel the three hearts deep in the body. At the same time, there was a warning from the tremor that the giant squid was also an embarrassing predator in the deep sea, but the fierce storm would tear its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingrid took a look at the other side. From the outside, the intruder is between adult males and teenagers, and is a dragon, a bloody dragon. If the father is not a dragon, then his mother must be - almost all of his exposed areas are covered with silver scales, which makes Ingway and Perant slightly loose. With a sigh of relief, the good-natured silver dragon descendants are more reassuring than the red dragons or black dragons. And, "Is this your mother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Mother." Edelna said: "She is an elf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't continue to get close to the island," Perant said: "The lock of Lindao Reject any non-elf intelligent creature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mother wants to go back to where she was born." Edelna said: "But except me, she No one is allowed to approach and touch her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her starry is about to dissipate," Perant lowered her head, that The female elf is half lying between the narrow, cold arms of the young elf. She is still in the fainting, but perhaps because she heard familiar voices, words or other indescribable feelings, she seems to know that she has returned. Around the tribe, the eyebrows that have been close to each other are elegantly unfolded. Even if the clothes are messy and the hair is faint, the complexion is as pale as the sea sand, but it can be seen how amazing the beauty and posture she once had: She is about to return to the temple of Angris."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what she has always expected." Edelna calmly replied, For the mother's death, he doesn't seem to grieve, even with a little boredom, or, a little embarrassed, Perant doesn't know if he sees it is true, because the expression disappears faster than lightning strikes the air. . "The lock of Lindao doesn't allow me to enter, so what about her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She can." Ingway said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then take her back," the young intruder said, "I can leave here by myself."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ship is already on the bottom of the sea." Ingwell asked with great interest: "How are you going to leave here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I have wings." Like to prove himself, a pair of silver dragons, shiny curtains spread from the back of Edelna, it is wider than the wings of the albatross, single wingspan Almost as long as Edell’s height, it looks very light, so there is no need to worry about whether the dragon’s back will be shattered by heavy burdens, but in the violent wind, its thinness can’t help but People are scared - as if the next moment, they will be cut into countless pieces by the sharp wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They look really unreliable," Ingway quickly decided: "You bring this female elf back," he said: "Me and..." He looked at Edel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gray." Edel is not ashamed to say that it sounds false enough - it is not even a name, Gray is in lingua franca In addition to the gray, it also has the meaning of suffering from illness or suffering from disasters. No one will use such ominous words to name their children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I and Gray stay here," Ingway said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He may be a dangerous enemy," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I am so staying," Ingway said: "We can't leave such a dangerous enemy at the edge of the island." He said While paying attention to not allowing the sudden waves to hinder yourself from speaking: "Fortunately, there are only a few hundred feet away from the locks." After Edell got rid of the entanglement of the lock, the locks calmed down as a druid. Perant still has a chance to transform, he can quickly take the woman to the island and then return to Ingway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
