			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please," the baroness shouted. "Take me with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even at this time, the Baroness can still be called a stunner, especially her face is full of real horror and sorrow. When she reaches out her arm, the cloak lifts up and slides down, letting it be turned for help. It is easy for people to see her soft breasts - the robes don't know whether they are intentional or unintentional, they are torn from the shoulders, and the broken silk hangs under her ribs like a withered flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count that she turned to for help for a while, he hired a small group of mercenaries with all the ornaments and gold coins on his body, really, not even hiring It should be said that they were allowed to leave the king with them. He originally had his own knight, but most of them left him to go to the wall of the Norman kingdom. The count thought they were stupid, who I know that King Norman has almost no chance of being lucky. Of course, in Pharaoh and in the previous period, King Norman could be said to be the second Thunderbolt. The loyal and brave knight was as much as the stone bricks on the wall, but since John became Norman, the king was against the army. Support suddenly weakened. This can't blame John. When he was a younger brother, he was weak because of his physical weakness and he was so thin that he never got any respect for the good warriors. Even his own knight is also In this way, the noble character is swearing, and the low morality is to use John's incompetence as a joke and a gift in the pub and the urn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, in order to win the favor of Gregory, King John has an heir as soon as possible, and has greatly promoted any one that can bring him money and slaves. The villains, these people were not businessmen or thieves before, and the people of Gaojie were not unwilling to leave with them and left with anger, or they were set to be put to death or exile; as for the magical law that Dylan Hyde had envisioned... ...he should have thought that the wizards and warlocks recruited by gold coins and casting materials could not have any loyalty to Norman in the Highlands. Now the casters who can stand on the wall are only white robe priests and Norman pedigrees. The orcs not only have priests, but also in the grayish-black and yellow-brown, they are also dotted with reds that are not theirs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl asked himself, he was not the most timid and shameless person, but he saw it with a magical instrument called "Peeping", first captured the wall. Not an orc, not a human, but a group of monsters. They are only human size, dense like ant colonies, dark skin like wild boars, soldiers with black iron spears are not punctuated, only the knight's steel wide sword can cut it, but what is the use? However, a knight almost has to face more than ten monsters at the same time, and the teeth of these monsters can not only bite through the steel, but also carry poisonousness. When the count’s eyes see through the peephole, the knight’s face bitten through the arm After a moment of death on the gray of death, I never dared to read it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please," the baroness shouted again, her fingers clutching the edge of the carriage window, wearing a ring of stone, the count remembered After the joy of dripping, he also sent a stone ring to this glamorous and charming woman. He couldn’t bear to be in the heart, but he looked at his own car (not the best). ), and the people in the carriage (silent and disgusted, his wife and son), and the mercenaries who cruised outside the carriage. If he brought the baroness, it would not only cause the wife’s jealousy but also lead his son to him. Dissatisfaction, if the two are not what, and the most deadly - the mercenaries will ask him for more money, and the speed of the carriage is undoubtedly destroyed, the count turned his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Baroness is not a baroness. She shouted before the count could not say anything about the rejection: "I know Fukai’s money. Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count turned his head faster than he turned a hundred times faster: "What do you say?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't think that Fukai adults will only put his money in his house," the Baroness quickly said, the count's carriage had begun to move, she While holding the silk rope tied on the door handle, I tragically followed the stumble run: "I know that he has two, maybe three unknown places, yes, I am sure at least one of them. It’s a money cave.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count looked at her with suspicion, but before the baroness finally fell out because of exhaustion, he shouted: “Wait ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baroness was pulled into the carriage, and her beautiful face was covered with tears. "I hope you didn't Lie," he said. "I may not be able to do anything, look at our previous sentiments, but," he used his eyes to signal the mercenaries outside. "If they can't get anything, you know, best. As a result, you will become a slave to a hundred goblins - you know they like to use the faeces to spread the whole body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count gave them a look. In this family, he might weigh and consider his wife and son on some minor issues, but in a major incident, women who are short-sighted cannot be respected by men. He is Father, husband, authority and master, if they can really find the wealthy caves of Fukai, then these mercenaries will not look at the meager money in his territory, they may not wait for them to get the money. The land left, so that the three of them were truly safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can be sure." The baroness said tiredly, "At least one, full of gold coins." She cleverly sat with the count's wife and children. Instead of sharing his seat with the Piage, it was very crowded, and the abominable boy also had the opportunity to kick her legs constantly, but it doesn't matter, it is warm and safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They left behind those who were still fighting, for one day and one night, they couldn’t rest, they couldn’t eat, and the horses didn’t have water and feed. They just ran forward desperately. The carriages and people who were crowded on a big road gradually became sparse. Finally, only one carriage and about a hundred mercenaries were swaying forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Stop and take a break,” said the mercenary’s leader, saying, “The horse is not going to work.” All the people are like a special purpose, especially It was the count, even if he went to the king, he would take a break every three hours, but the mercenary leader did not speak, he did not dare to say anything. When the carriage opened, the mercenary on the side shrugged his nose, disgusted. The ground walked away, and a dirty smell of sweat, secretions and excrement overflowed from the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take your cloak and throw it away." The countess said that they couldn’t get off the bus during the night, but the basic needs of humanity were Containment, hunger and thirst can endure, but the inability to excrete is almost a kind of torture. The count’s wife maliciously asks the baroness to take off her cloak to hold the excrement. What can the baroque do? On this small issue, even The count cannot be biased towards him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Water," the count’s son shouted hoarsely: "I want to drink water!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Just in the distance, the mercenaries got the water from the stream, but the water is not free, a small gold coin, the nursery rhyme, the count has all the gold coins and valuable Something, but the baroness still has a ring, so she took it out wisely. They didn't even bring the water-filled utensils, so they could only suck one by one from the shared skin and didn't know if it was clean or not. The water, a mercenary pinching the skin to make sure they don't drink too much. When the count's son came forward to grab the skin, he blinked at the baroness and was forced to be in the count, the countess, and the baroness behind the count's son was not so anxious immediately, she pulled up her robes, it seems Just to make it easier to act, I made a knot underneath, revealing her legs. Obviously, although she is at the end, she can certainly drink the most water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, the baroness looked up, she had a glimpse of it and thought she had an illusion, but she was able to survive until now. Played a role - she grabbed the count's son's hair, slammed it, and pushed him in front of him, and the monster who had just bitten the mercenary's head had already rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water bladder fell to the ground, and the mercenary broke in the neck of the neck to eject a hot, sticky blood spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster bit the child’s neck, its teeth even pierced the baroness’s hand, her heart violently leaping, almost rushing out of her chest. But the opposite is that her mind is turning calmly and meticulously. Before she can understand what she has done, she retreats to a few dozen steps from the monster. She heard the mercenaries. Panic cry, there were some messy sounds she couldn't understand, and I saw the count - the count's wife was bitten by a monster, and she used all her strength to grab the count's boots, the count. Crazy shouting, falling on the ground, desperately kicking the woman's face with the kick that was not caught, he finally broke free, because the monster grabbed his wife's liver, her intestines slipped Falling down in the sand, perhaps this horrible scene, let the count lose the ability to think, at this time, he was stupid enough to run to the mercenary leader, maybe he thinks that man Will protect yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the mercenary seized him, and the head of the lord was smashed with a knife, then the hands and feet that were still twitching, the mercenaries around him would The scattered limbs are thrown at the monsters, and the monsters hesitate. After all, these fresh meats carry temperature and blood, and they won’t resist and escape. It’s just a little while, it’s enough for the mercenaries to jump on the horses. I did not hesitate to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
