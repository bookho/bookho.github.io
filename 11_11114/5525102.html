			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the cracks in the maple are 15 to 20 feet above the ground. The elves use the hollow branches of the vine to make the drainage tube. Black bark all the way down, access to oak barrels or sheepskin skins - there are three kinds of work to choose from here, one is to change barrels and skins, some of which are full of overflow, more It was broken by bears, foxes and even squirrels - the sweet and nutritious juice of maple is also good for them; the second is to increase or decrease or change the position of the vine branches, some maple trees can produce nearly fifty pounds of juice at a time. Some half-pound small skins are filled with dissatisfaction. If the juice is depleted and the drainage tube is still inserted in the crack, it will suck the moisture and nutrients of the phloem and directly damage the innocent maple tree. Remove the vine branches or transfer them to other honey-scented maple trees in time - this is also good for maple trees. After all, the sweet juices that flow from their bodies tend to attract countless worms. Will care about it It sucks the part of the tree, but the work is basically carried out by the elves who are as light as the birds. The half-elves are still a bit heavy, they will break the branches of the trees - they are responsible for observing the knocking of the barrels and Knock the skin, take the full and the bad, and replace it with a new one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the current mages and the undead who used to be, this approach is simply inefficient, they could have been directly near the ground of the maple Open a triangle-shaped mouth so that the juice will come more and more quickly. They can also apply poison on the edge of the barrel and outside the skin. Animals are sometimes smarter than people. If there are two or three bodies, they will leave those. The delicious sweet water is far away - no more complicated than doing double-digit calculations - if it is in his father's country, these foolish people who are slow to respond will be dragged out one by one to puncture or saw in public. punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't agree with this, are you?" Fenway suddenly said, at the same time, he violently turned his body and cast a caster in a white robe. Go to the sharp and violent sight like an eagle: "Do you think our approach is stupid? I know that you have been living with human beings, but," he raised his voice and raised a thin, sturdy finger in an awkward manner. The attitude points to his leader: "Listen, don't bring the human set into the gray ridge! Otherwise I will be the first to ask you to expel you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; A gray squirrel looked at them with amazement on the branches and ran away quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich smiled indifferently, and of course he knew what kind of smile would irritate the idiot in front of him - the hand he had in his sleeve had already done Gestures, this is the second time about having his own experiment - if those who are considered to be standing in the "good" position pre-emptively shot him because of their own lusts and emotions? Can he counterattack? To what extent can you counterattack? For example, death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ready, he will accept it once again without fear, and be deprived of all torture, no matter how terrible or how long it is. He must do that, and ignorance of living is never a way for a caster to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that things didn’t work as he wished, and he raised his arm at Fenway, as if he wanted to make a new one that would make this newcomer unforgettable. At the time of the spell, a golden feather arrow broke the opposition of the two wizards and shot into the mud before them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fenway!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich raised his head and a slender female elf was From a maple tree with a huge canopy, hurriedly approached them - she grabbed a vine with only the thickness of her fingers and swung it down, elegant and light, and even the most alert tree frog when she landed on the ground. Nothing was alarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fenway." When she was close enough to them, she repeated the name of the leader, her dress was close to the Ranger, that is, tights And boots instead of skirts, sleeveless jackets over the hips, belts, carrying bows and quiver, wearing gloves with a small silver ring, but these have never affected her beauty, her eyes are like It is the lake under the light of the morning sun. There is a little golden light shining in the green. The hair that grows over the waist is lighter than Fenway and Kerry, like flowing gold or moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ill." Fenway replied, the lich disappointed to release his fingers, the man’s anger was calming, it’s okay, he said to himself, as long as The shadow still exists, he will not lose this wonderful test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is still a child, Fenway," said a female elf with a noble name but harshly said: "You know that he has been living with humans before." Together, then you should know that we have to show more tolerance and patience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that tolerance and patience will bring disaster," Fenway Looking at her without fear: "There are enough soldiers and mages in Gray Ridge. We don't need new blood, especially this mixed blood. - Since he has grown to this age in humans, he should Continue to live in humans, not to the gray ridge - with his purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to live here for a short period of time." Time, two or three years," said the Lich, in a calming tone that concealed but made Fenway more unbearable: "After those red robes are searched and pursued, they are no longer so urgent and mad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With a huge map and intelligence," Fenway said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Il妲 sighed deeply: "Don’t be like this, Fenway, he is brought to Gray Ridge by Kerry, he is his guarantee. Man," the Lich did not miss the gloom of Fenway's eyes swiftly passing: "He is worthy of trust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can do whatever you want, Ilva Fenway said, then turned around without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fenway is still the same?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's still the same." Gray Ridge's manager, a male elf with steel blue eyes, replied that he and other elves could not identify from the outside. Age, but with the calmness and solidity that Kerry Ben may not have, he put his fingers together on his desk and put it into a tower shape, posing a thinking posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you let him be the guide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the child is very cute "The manager said: "I hope he can change his eccentric eccentric thoughts a little - I really don't know where he got this from."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Does he hate half-elves?" Kerry asked in an unimaginable way: "But he is a half-elf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He feels there The living things of non-elf blood are untrustworthy," the manager said with a grin. "He once told me that if possible, he would like to drive every one, including his own half-elf, out of the gray ridge." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of thinking..." Kerryburn paused and revised the word: "It's too intense."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be related to his father," the manager said. "His father had only a quarter of the human blood, but almost sold the entire gray ridge to the thieves and red robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood does not dominate everything." Kerry Ben said: "There are also perfect people in humans."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
