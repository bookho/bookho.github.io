			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's words: Forty-three chapters have a bug. In the words of Fenway, in fact, Kreima has no way to use transmission-like spells. The ridge to the silver crown jungle elves have set the lock, limiting the use of the transmission spells... In addition, the last chapter of the elf chess has a name - "astrolabe", by the way, see the picture volume, (this It is a small astrolabe, the kind of 288, and Kreima and Il are under the big star disk, which is twice as large as it is.) Please read it carefully by readers with intensive phobia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five small dots that will be surrounded by the black part are the ones that will be eaten. It’s clear that the number is the simplest, but it does have more More than the newspaper's winning rules, for example, how many children left in a certain direction in the final game, the remaining children need to form graphics or text, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, this kind of board game is both a test of the mind and a test of luck... This, the lich’s mind is of course good, that is luck... that point... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good, relax, then the text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway reveals an indescribable expression - anxious, yes, Anxious accounted for a large part, and there was a small amount of annoyance and regret, mixed with hatred and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage looks into the house, the messenger follows his sight, and a book with a tan leather cover is placed in an open box. - The latter is not clear why Cremari's spellbooks are here at Fenway, perhaps because they were unintentionally forgotten by the black haircaster when they discussed the spells - but as far as he knows, the spell book is for the wizard. A very important thing, then this is just a collection or can it be replaced? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked if Fenway needed him to hand over, and Fenway just looked at him, focusing on making him think he suddenly became Ilva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," the Master finally said, "No," he said in a vain voice: "Since he wants me to wait -" he said: "I will wait...but don't rush, friend," he grabbed the half-elf's wrist with agility that was completely out of sync with the voice. The hair of the messenger was erected because of this movement, and Fenway's hand was again It’s dry and cold, it feels like a dead branch, a snake: “It’s raining outside,” Fenway said. “I think I should entertain you with a cup of tea.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong ominous premonition caught the messenger. Fenway’s room was warm, dry and lingering with the smell of spices, and the place outside the room was covered in cold rain. His heart was warning loudly and ordered him. Run away immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to do this, but Fenway raised his hand and slipped a fine sand from his clenched fist, and the messenger resisted. Fenway bends his fingers, makes gestures, and an irresistible drows hit him. He relies on Fenway's body to slowly fall down, holding his dagger in one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway stood in the same place and listened carefully, sure that the rain and the night had helped him drive away the extra eyes and ears. He bowed his head and looked at it with nostalgia. Suspicious sadness, "I don't want to do that," he said softly. "My friend, I am sorry, but I really don't have time." He turned and the invisible servant grabbed under his silent command. The half-elf, it followed him and came to the closed room. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can see this room at this time, I will be shocked, because all the things in the room, Fenway once regarded the books of the treasure, Materials and magical appliances were removed, the carpet was rolled up, and it was placed against the side of the wall. Instead, a layer of demon skin that was stretched to resemble translucency, the skin was treated, fat and hair, scales were Was scraped, soaked with black dragon's acid, sprinkled with a mixture of saltpeter and sulfur, from iron ash to bone white, it has long since left the owner's body, lost life, but still covered with fine The red veins will be twisted and twisted from time to time. If it is not the nails of the stars that will be nailed to the floor, it may actually escape quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master has already painted the patterns and texts he needs on the devil's skin. The fine gold lines are as dense as the net, and the dragon blood for the magic flows in it. - Fenway picks up the spell book that should be destroyed soon, carefully and one by one. He only has one chance. If he fails, even if he is not aware, he will not have the courage to face those who are torn. Broken body and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is in the mind of the mage, he remembered it a few hours ago, and Fenway finally glanced at the half of the struggling in the forced sleep. Elf, he is one of the few close friends of Fenway. They grew up together in Grey Ridge, study together, dine together, play together and work together - he was the most common before Ill. The person who sits side by side and enjoys the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fenway needs him to die, and this bad luck should have fallen on the shameless Aya hybrid, as Fenway said, he already There is no time - the invisible servant's invisible fingers clasped the half-elf's neck and suspended him into the air. The pain of suffocation made him unconsciously swing his hands and shake his feet, trying to get rid of the control of sleep; Fenway quickly Taking off all the clothes on his body, ** went to his friend, without hesitation, cut his throat, and then all the way down, all the way down to his ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood flowed into the ready-made bottle under the influence of the spell, mixed with the blood of the first two half-elf, Fenway pulled out his heart and lungs, and the hot internal organs were placed in small jars, jars and bottles. Fenway himself burned, in addition to clay, as well as fine gold, Mithril and the blood of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's slightly reverse the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the Lich is still upset about the chess pieces on the chart, Demon and another mage are also busy completing their game - they stand in the city In addition, there is an inaccessible, empty stone-filled place, and the white tower in the rain and fog has only a vague shadow. In their notorious place, it is the place where the starlight river branches out, and they watch the silver flashing. The river, which comes from the Starlight River, passes through the White Tower and disappears into the hills and plains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Time is just right, my child." A deep, rather moving voice said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demon bent down deeply on the man, more than a hundred times more respectful than his own father, when he was Rosada The priest refused, seeing that only when he went to his father's Grange to watch the serf and the crops lively and bleakly spent his life, this person saved him, gave him strength and hope, and led him to a glimpse of the magic of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, he puts wealth and power in front of Demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wanted to do something more perfect," Demon said regretfully. "But my brother came back, and my father almost listened to him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Being a father always tends to the eldest son," his mentor said. "This is a very normal thing, and you can think of it as fate in you." Reminders and reminders in the ear - it says that you should act, then you will go to action, sometimes it will lead to failure afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s quite right,” Demon said, and once again expressed sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the magical effect, the rain evades the instructor and his students, their shoes, cloaks and the ground they are stepping on are dry and clean, and they The half-orcs, ogres, or giants who have been commanded have been completely soaked. They shouted and shouted at each other, spitting, holding dirty hair, scrambling to climb a strangely shaped platform, saying that it was strangely shaped. It's because it's like a square thick-bottomed tray with thin edges slightly raised and thick and heavy in the middle. It is suspended about three feet from the ground, and a pair of gorgeous and funny gnomes are running around. It’s a bit hard to run and carefully adjust its balance and height, because every passenger who boardes it will sway and sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge magical tool can carry ten giants or twenty ogres and half-orcs at a time. It can float, but still needs external force to pull it. The gnomes take it as a floating disc, but get the white tower for sale. At that time, only the ridiculous and curious onlookers were exchanged. Merchants preferred horse-drawn carriages and ships, and did not trust the work of gnomes. Only Demon thought of it or could use it for other purposes. He used the excuse to study the runes of the gnomes and bought three and put them in his own warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-human soldiers are provided by his mentor, and the shaped potion allows them to enter the White Tower in a human form, and Demon recruits them and trains them. In the name of bringing them together in one place - after the governor asked them to leave, Demon took a large sum of money, with about three-fifths of them out of the white tower - they were originally going to another Local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All giants, ogres, and half-orcs have climbed onto the platform, clutching their arms in one hand, and clinging to the platform in accordance with Demon’s requirements. The surface of the strong handle, a few ropes mixed with Mithril throughout the platform, into the tributary, the other end of the rope reached a ring knot across the snake's shoulders and chest, they exposed the scales of the face from the river, waiting The order to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A snake man sent a squeaky voice to his companion: "What are they waiting for?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are waiting for Asmo Deos, Demon's magic pet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has two big pairs, like a batwing wing, which allows it to fly and change like lightning, mortals simply can't Capturing its shadow, in their view, it is a small black dot that flashes a hundred feet or two hundred feet each time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost the same as the common, harmless little hamster, which is common in humans, with shiny eyes, furry, dark, rounded Its hair is much thicker than people think, the hair is covered with a thin layer of wax, and the rain does not completely wet it - but as soon as it falls on Demon's arm, it begins to violently shake the body, 甩The water of the nominal owner's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon is very annoyed, but he knows that with his experience and knowledge there is no chance of signing a contract with a little devil - about this about him The instructor also talked with him in detail. This magic pet had a master before. Yes, the tutor recognized its owner, but then somehow its owner disappeared and may have been hit hard because Asmo Deuss felt Pain, weakness, and the connection between them has become weak, if there is nothing, and the little devil needs the owner on this plane, no master provides magic, he will die and return to the endless abyss. Before being forced to disappear, Asmodeos found Demon. He was only the second son of a mortal, but he did have the power that the little devil needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract with Demon is not complete, and it is biased towards the devil. Demon is helpless. He knows that Asmodeos prefers a strong teacher like his tutor. The problem is that the tutor already has a magical pet. Asmodois was stronger, more agile and awkward, and Asmodeos almost ate it when he first tested it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this untiring guy will still hold on to any opportunity he can find to flatter his mentor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos knows that the two casters have been waiting for a while, and what they don’t need most is 啰嗦, it’s smart to just open again. The wings, standing with two hind paws, holding the two front paws respectfully gave a tribute to Demon's mentor - although this ritual made it look like a black lining with leaves," The self-made clever half-elf remembered the spell," he announced. "As wise as you expected, before I left Gray Ridge, he had killed two half-elfs and tried to blame another. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fool who was blamed, Asmodeos thought, it was strange, it would feel a sense of familiarity, but don't be kidding." How could it be familiar with a half-elf mage, unless his other half of the lineage belongs to the devil, but if there is such a thing, the elves will never take him, even if his other half inherits them. The king is not possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So before dawn, the entire spell will be completed." The instructor said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is one more?" Demon asked: "The blood of the two half-elf is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that our Fenway Master will find the third one." Demon's mentor said that he reached out to Asmodeos, with a soul jewel in his palm, the little devil excited Extremely elongated and ready to take the reward himself, he was a little bit flattered - but before his claws touched the instructor's skin, the latter's magic pet was silent from the shadow of his cloak. When the ground came out, Asmodeos almost jumped into his open mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back to your master!" the instructor's demon screamed, it is a poisonous snake with two heads: "Little Thief!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon’s mentor touched the head of the demon pet comfortably and handed the soul gem to Demon. His disciples were trying to hide a smile of gloating. Behind the eyes and lips, Asmodeos escaped quickly, but the hair on the top of the head was still burnt by the venom ejected from the tip of the viper, and it was busy combing the surrounding hair to cover the piece. Unsightly blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake snaked sharply in front of the shadow of the instructor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos angrily stuffed the soul gem into his cheek pouch, its head hurts, "If my master," it Silently shouted: "My master is not such a useless guy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sighed and found that he was missing its true master, though He is eccentric, tempered, violent and moody, but he is really strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and generous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon’s mentor certainly wouldn’t pay attention to the idea of ​​a magical pet, who projected the command of the departure into the head of the snake man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves regard the Starlight River as their own, but even if they let go of the authority, it is difficult for ordinary ships to drive on the Star River. The reason why the Star River is like Sri Lanka's anger is precisely because its riverbed is full of prominent shale, they are like a layer of stairs, in addition to the flying elf ship, what kind of boat can jump over them? But the snakes can, the rapid vortex of the Starlight River is not difficult for them to grow in the sea, they can resist the storm surge, they also The flexibility to change the way you travel, where the river roars out of the ladder, their claws can be inserted into the hard rock, firmly fixed on the surface of the rock and crawled stably and rapidly under the push of scales. And those rivers are deep and flat, and the waters are no longer so sturdy. They will change to a more relaxed and quicker movement. The platform carrying the soldiers, as guaranteed by the gnomes, even a 10-year-old human boy. Can push, the snake people sometimes even forget that they are still carrying a small burden, when they move too much, the platform will shake up and down, there are a few honest orcs who have fallen, but they are quickly replaced The snake man of Lahu sent out of the water and pulled the rope dropped by his companion to climb back to the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long do they think they will need to arrive at Gray Ridge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon's mentor Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this, Demon has already counted countless times: "It’s faster than the elf's ship," he said. "But even so, they arrive at the Grey Ridge." It will still be exposed to the morning sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
