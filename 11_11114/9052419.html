			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three ships are near. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Red Dragonfly" and his pirates who have no evils are almost laughing, the beautiful ships that they regard as prey are not wary. Heart, maybe its captain is just a little guy who listens to the poet's poetry, but also wants to smell the sea breeze. He has never held a knife or drunk human blood. He has no sinister human and sea. Knowing that I only want to add a page of glory to my diary - the sailors are walking around on the deck without any cover, some people are untiringly untiring the ropes that hold the springboard and dragging them to The ship's side, completely unaware that they are erecting is the road to their own death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the leader of the pirates, the eyes of "Red Dragonfly" are more critical and sharper than other pirates, and only one glance can identify the "goods". The sailors are very strong and very young. They can sell a good price on the Longhuo Island. The boat doctor can sell it as a slave with special skills, although his height makes the "Red Dragonfly" a bit guilty. Hey, he and a man around him have heights that are closer to the other sailors. They may be northerners. Men in the north are generally taller than men in the south, and their facial contours are more vivid. If they are not fighting later. Stupidly want to resist and then be killed, then their price may be much higher than the sailors - this kind of goods is somehow favored by the Lord of the Dragon Fire Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hung Hom" only allowed his thoughts to shift for a while, but for a while, the boat doctor in the gray robe was blocked by his companion, waiting for his companion When I walked away and revealed the "ship doctor" again, the back of the "Red Dragonfly" suddenly passed a cold current, and he could even feel his hair straight up like a sea urchin thorn - experience The alarms that have been provoked by numerous sneak attacks and battles have caught his heart. He did not make any consideration at all, and rushed back to his body. It was not a great but very useful place to roll over. Hiding himself behind the bucket of water storage - this move saved his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What "Red Dragonfly" didn't see was that the ship doctor, no, more correctly, Master Gavin entered the meditation under the cover of the Cavaliers and did With a spell gesture, all he has to do is “pull the trigger” and throw a few hot fireballs onto the weird ship after the knight gives up his vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♀ style_txt disguised as a corpse; the pirates made a sharp scream in the dull thunder and whistling, they jumped up from the deck, with raging The burning flame runs around. Or fell to the ground and rolled around, even if the "Red Dragonfly" loudly called the command, and wield a knife to connect and killed two pirates who almost ignited the sails, it was useless, the pain and fear of being burned by the flames was never The people who have experienced can't imagine it anyway. The human-shaped fireball suddenly spreads to the front and the bow. The white smoke brought by the flames makes the pirates hiding in the cabin unable to endure coughing. They climb out of the cabin. In the room, several pirates grabbed the buckets and watered the first fired associates they saw. After a brief chaos, "Red Dragonfly" finally managed to control the situation, he retracted the rune plate, after all, the spells it contains are magic-driven. A wizard told Hung Hom that these forces are used less and less, unless he can ask a mage or warlock to inject magic into it again, but you know. Masters and warlocks, especially those who are willing to fill the magic of an abominable pirate, are generally not good, and the rewards they receive are always unusually high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic in the rune plate can create the illusion that "Red Dragonfly" wants. But it can't resist the invasion and interference of smoke and fire, so keeping it is just a joke, although "Red Dragonfly" can't understand how they found it wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red wine and blood are two very different things," said Xiu, while taking over the longbow, these East ** are used as beds for the bed. Below, after receiving the captain's suggestion, they found weapons in the box, clustered, with the smell of anti-rust grease: "Do they think we have no long nose?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now let me laugh, fix." Gavin complained, whispering and preparing for the next spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaiwen is not a ship doctor. He is the same person who was exiled by Norman Norman. Although he is a mage, he refused the generosity of Dylan Don Clay. Leaving Thunderbolt with his companion - perhaps because the girl he likes is the relationship of the younger sister, but unfortunately, in the wilderness that spreads thousands of miles outside Thunderbolt, the sister who was repaired was first scratched by the orc. And because of the drinking of the water in the mud, the heat, although there are Yadel's herbs and the best possible care, but the poor girl finally left them quietly at a dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have once persuaded Gavin to return to Thunderbolt, or to play for other jazz, the Master is a rare resource, let alone such as Gavin A veteran who has experienced actual combat, he will receive preferential treatment and care wherever he goes, without having to go with them. Gavin still decides to stay, he is willing to be with them, even if he knows that life will become very difficult afterwards. Especially for a caster, the lack of casting materials, reels, and ink may make him a mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these things are fully complemented in the Bibi Dyke, and the Alva Master has unselfishly given the help that can be given, just like those who can The soft-shelled whale leather, according to the rich food, tents and other necessary supplies sent three times a day, although they must stay outside the city of Bibi Dibao, but the supply is even better than the Thunderbolt. The muscles and strengths that had to be reduced in the previous exiles quickly returned a part, so they can now lift the longbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the smoke dissipated, "Red Dragonfly" opened his eyes in amazement and anger and looked at what was opposite. It was a row of strong and majestic northerners. - He had hoped that the taller northerners would be as good as possible. Now he hopes that the less they are, the better. He does not doubt that they have tasted blood, cold and firm eyes, unmoving arms. The iron-like fingers and neat queues have been able to explain everything - "Red Dragonfly" can almost confirm that if there is a string of sharp arrows from the head to the end, you can definitely put these people together It is like a fish worn on a rope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not sailors, nor mercenaries. They are soldiers. The "red dragonfly" has seen the army. The army can be said to be the most taboo for pirates. If it is said that the Ranger such as Cobbert and Kerry is a sharp dagger. Then the soldiers of the king and the lord are an irresistible siege hammer. Any pirate ship will be broken under such a giant hammer, even if it is the Sea Monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There wasn’t much time left for him to think. The moment the smog was gone, the arrows of the northerners poured down like a rainstorm. They used to face fierce and violent, rough-throated orcs, so they never retained their strength, and the weapons that Cobbert hid in the box were also very sharp. The strings of the longbows were steel wires or tendons. . The arrows are all triangular steel, the lethality is greater than the average arrow, and the pirates pretend to be ordinary businessmen, wearing only a simple soft armor under the shirt, this soft arm can not resist the arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gavin casts a second spell, which is a lightning-like spell, but the effect is not as good as the previous fireball, after all, the pirates are almost all It is on the ground, let alone. And they are now hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's put down the springboard!" the Cavaliers shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still have spells." Gavin argued, "I can burn that boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "They are ready to escape." After the phantom was removed, they were able to see the ship - like the new little bird, it was a three-masted ship. But the hull is slender, the bow is filled with black iron bumps, and the bow is like a devil's statue, biting the human limbs in the mouth of a fang. The hull is painted black, which is the most common color used by pirate ships. A triangular flag hangs from the top of the mast. The flag depicts the emblem of Mask and Talos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caubert has also ordered his sailors to put down the springboard as a little bird that makes countless pirates hate. The springboard prepared above is the same as the pirate ship. With large copper nails, the sailors used their pulleys and levers to rotate one end of them. The small bird rushed to the "red dragonfly" boat. The watchman at the top of the mast screamed to remind everyone to collide. Coming soon - the two ships violently collided in the next moment, but failed to penetrate the hull of the little bird, as the "Hung Hom" expected. The bow of the little bird ran into the pirate ship and pushed it heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both boats had fallen people, but the sailors clutching the springboard inevitably hit the deck, but they remembered their duties, and the springboard with the copper nails slammed into the deck of the pirate ship. Now, the two boats can become a one-piece baby, and no one can leave until the end of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repairing and his soldiers have picked out the usual wide swords from the box, while they are archery; the other weapon is lying quietly Lying at their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They jumped on the springboard, the narrow springboard was undulating, but no one fell into the water because of the loss, a pirate shot the last person with a bow, he shook At that time, when the pirate cheered, he glanced at the shoulders indifferently, pinched the short arrow, and pulled it out easily and threw it into the deep black water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the battle is no suspense. The Normans in the Highlands faced the orcs before. They not only had tough skin, but also a large body with thick hair. The hair is covered with grease and turpentine. The general sword is not slanted or bounced on the top. Therefore, the soldiers of the Thunderbolt have the power, sharp eyes and agile reaction that the soldiers do not have elsewhere. Next, compared to the orcs, the pirates who are delicate and weak are not flying their heads or the body has become two, and the situation is not good. Some of the pirate’s more flexible guys will kneel down and pray for forgiveness. It is thought that these terrible people do not seem to know what kindness (please forgive them before they have ever seen the orcs who bend their knees to humans), and in the end they will only die faster than their associates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Cobbert’s sailors jumped into the pirate ship and found that they had nothing to do, Captain Cobbert sighed in his heart and told himself anyway Even if these pirates are alive, they will be sent to the Bibi Dyke for hang, but he is more worried about the little black wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the leader of the pirates." Xiu said that the clothes and cheeks were contaminated with human blood. When he came over to Captain Cobbert, The two sailors couldn’t help but put their hands on the shackles in their waists—the thick bloody smell made them vomit, and they found this and smiled apologetically: “He said,” he Slightly frowning: "He has important things to report to Alva Master of Bituminburg, about...his friend Kerry Ben, and Master Crimal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?" Cobbert asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exchange!" "Red Dragonfly" miraculously did not suffer anything, he saved himself very well: "Exchange!" He shook, screaming in disgust: "My life, and my boat!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible," Cobbert said. "Your ship will be sunk and you will be hanged."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or now," said: "You can save money on the next hemp rope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is the life of Alva’s friend more important?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you know?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know you, you are Cobbert, swear to your god Su Lun, and then swear to the river." "Red Dragonfly" nervously said that the scar on his face was bright: "Otherwise, I am nothing." I won't say it, and Master Alva has to wait to chase his friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me some time," said: "I can Let him remember that it was a baby before dawn arrived. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Dragonfly" heard a loud laugh: "Before dawn?" He taunted: "Don't wait until then, just cook a pot of broth All the things are over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear," Cobbert said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Include all the people in." "Red Dragonfly" said: "I don't want to have such a group of people to shoot arrows at me behind my ass. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only for today." Cobbert said: "I can't let them chase you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be kidding, seven days," "Red Dragonfly" also knows that it is impossible for Cooper and his friends to never hunt him: "Seven days, at least, don't bargain with me, Alva." The mage’s friends don’t have much time to grind.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Seven days,” Cobbert said: “But don’t fool me, you won’t want to know that. Consequences - you will not be hanged, but I will hand you over to him." He looked to repair. “My new friend is very sophisticated, you don’t want to try it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
