			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona is killing the despicable old Lorenos in this room. The guards and the maids have carefully cleaned up here and removed the body. Wipe the blood, ignite the incense, and then sprinkle the dried cloves and rushes in the place where the former lord of the Spirit has fallen. Even so, as a soldier and knight who has been fighting the brutal orcs for more than a decade, Baldwin is able to sniff out the fresh blood in the air, and the feces that only flow from the anorectum where the deceased relaxes. The stench of the smell, they are mixed with the smell of oil and talcum powder that must be used to maintain metal weapons, forming a strange smell that is quite uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Pharaoh’s eldest daughter sat there safely, like sitting in a rose from it – Birdwin knew she had never seen it before. The gentle gentleman of blood, a sentimental little cute is not suitable to become the crown prince of the Norman and even the king. When Pharaoh has no choice but to admit that he will have a female heir, he will completely treat Leona as himself. The son of the Normans in the Highlands is always encouraged to be cruel and ruthless. Sometimes their father will also order them to beat their mothers or sisters, kill their maids and lovers, to ensure that they will not Being as indecisive as a girl, being manipulated by those senseless emotions - Pharaoh did the same. He boasted that he had a cold-hearted daughter who was not inferior to his son. "She will be a good king." "Pharaoh said to Baldwin, "How many faces are beautiful, the noble boy who gave her a courtesy, but she ignored it, and even beat her face with a sabre, just because he Dare to stop her from going - this is really great, Byrdwin, do you know what I have been worried about? I am worried that my daughter will also be like a sweet woman, just for a few sweet words. The crown of the king is not there is such a thing! The curse, do they not understand that the crown of a king is hundreds of times more than the crown of the queen?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Pharaoh knows that Leona is not as cherished as he imagined, so that he is indifferent to the love between men and women, but unexpectedly falls in love with an unidentified When the son of a civilian, his degree of anger can be imagined - he even said what he should not have said. It reveals the secret that should not be made public... Bydwin now recalls that his past was both sad and ridiculous. He used to be so trusted by Pharaoh that he was allowed to sleep under Pharaoh’s bed and also guarded His side. Pharaoh has also rewarded him with his amnesty, pins, or belongings more than once. This is the treatment that a very intimate lover can get. Before Leona’s father lost his senses, madness, insults and attacks against Byrdwin, he never thought about it in the eyes of his loyal people. He is also a mean and funny clown. Ironically, Tell tells his followers to remain humble at all times, but Birdwin knows that he can be said to be slightly lacking in this respect. He may be a modest and courteous person, but he cannot be a nobleman. Inner respect, whenever they attack him with disregard, ridicule, and provocation, the paladin’s heart is always full of pity and pride – these poor people can’t rely on him and Thunder Castle. At the threat of the orcs, he despised these people and secretly compared them to rabbits who were jumping and dying. Who would care about the cold eyes of a group of rabbits... He only loved Lao Wang as his brother or father. I thought he also had the same opinion as himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that he is very wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, he was even more difficult to hold a suspicious and alert attitude towards everyone, and Leona was one of those on the list. But very quickly he felt deeply ashamed and sorry for his suspiciousness. As a victim, Leona made more sacrifices for him than he had imagined - without her, the Elf Ranger and The reaction of the mage around him could not have been so rapid. It is very likely that he had died in disrespect before they found him; and when they fled all the way, Leona continued to run for him. I hope to be able to elute his grievances; when she finds that this method simply fails to achieve the intended purpose, she chooses to give up everything - give up her surname, give up her identity, and give up the entire Highland Norman. Just to share this terrible and heavy crime with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he saw Leona, the little girl has grown up, but that stubborn and stubborn strength has not changed, Birdwin thought he would A lot of words want to be said, but when he really squats in front of the king of Norman in the Highlands, he finds that he can't even send a syllable. Too much emotion accumulates in his throat, like a squashed clew, and a section of the clew hangs his heart. Fortunately, Leona is not prepared to let the silence occupy the rest of her time: "Bedwin," she said calmly: "I summoned before the ceremony." You, not for anything else, but hope to get some answers before the ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say," Birdwin said, "I will There is nothing to say, no words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona leans forward and pulls Bedwin’s distance to one foot or one foot. Half, at this distance, Byrdwin could see a miniature in her eyes, half-squatting, overlapping her hands, and kneeling, humbly listening to her will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I want to know is," Leona asked: "My father, the old man of Norman in the Highlands, is it really you killed?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin closed his eyes, and that awkward night came to his mind again, and he feared not to carefully recall each of them. One moment - he only remembers that there was chaos and chaos at the time. All the scenes appeared in his nightmare like pieces in the kaleidoscope, and the end of the nightmare was that Lao Wang squinted and lay on his back. On the carpet, the blood blew out from the wound on the neck – where was the Duke of John and Fukai? He couldn't tell exactly... He hesitated, would it be that they cast evil tricks - they are very willing to watch the pharaoh die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm not sure," he said, his voice was like another person's, and Baldwin wasn't sure if he was talking: "I'm not sure." Yeah, a voice said softly in his ear. If the Duke of John and Fukai are willing to come up with their talisman to save the Pharaoh (he is sure that they will have such a rune talisman that is used at the moment), then the Pharaoh will not die - that will really be old It is not him who is placed in the dead, but those who are more evil and selfish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Tell me the truth." Li Oona pleaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth is..." Birdwin whispered: "The truth is..." His voice gradually became firm: "That is a huge Conspiracy, Your Highness, a conspiracy against your father and me - I am just the weapon of the vicious hand - Your Highness, this is all the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Kerry Ben whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room where the ceremony was held, almost everyone looked at the young black hair caster intentionally or unintentionally—no special reason, just because he was wearing It's only a little bit worse than the king's girl - it's a black velvet robes adorned with rubies and stones, and it looks brighter than the rising stars in the dim light of the twilight moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A...long-winged hamster, which claims to be a magician made by a warlock, who came to me specifically because he lost his master in the plague. Self-recommended."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I remember that you already have an elemental servant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's why," said Kremar. "They beat up and ruined the entire room, including my clothes. (Fortunately, the white gown that Tyre gave was equally powerful against acid flames). So..." He pulled a slightly shorter cuff: "This is my mentor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," the Ranger suddenly realized, "Yes. Beavis is the son of the lord." (To be continued.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: Half-baked tea to reward the Nine Fish 100 starting point<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
