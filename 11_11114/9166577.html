			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Longshan State is the fruit of many small city states and the Principality, which have been rubbed and blended together for hundreds of years. They and Like the original Bibi Dyke, it was controlled by a 12-member parliament. Each member of parliament is the agent of a city-state ruler. They can guarantee that every resolution made by the parliament is at least beneficial to most people. Although there is less to fight, all things are controlled in a relatively moderate category. The worst punishment is only exile for 20 years. The exiles are allowed to take away enough money to live outside. It can also be served by someone, and he can still return to Longshan State after twenty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some ignorants living in the backcountry may question the name of the city, but the name is not in the same way as the Red Dragon ruled by Grenada. If you have to talk about the relationship between the two, then it is probably that the people of Longshan State think that they are descendants of Yinlong. Even if there is not even one Dragon Warlock in them, they still believe this way - Cray On the flag that Mar can see, there is a silver dragon on each side, but some are claws, some are wings, and the middle of the flag is drawn with the head of a silver dragon. The most powerful of them, but these will not make the young female red dragon feel happy: "I hope that there is such a silver dragon that can come here when their blood is immersed in the entire fortress," she still maintains humanity. The form, but when the sound is made, every word repeats like a huge building in the open space. "That will be the best sacrifice for the mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;——See her Floor's ass, the lich rudely commented that these red dragons have never seen a real silver dragon, she simply doesn't know...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Have you seen it? The alien soul asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——No, the lich has stunned, but my mentor has seen it (and perhaps has a deep relationship with Silver Dragon), ruled by the dragon In this era of planes, their enemies will never be human beings, they will only be their own kind, and each dragon will grow up under the other, or the claws of many dragons. And the children of Gredi are unfortunate. They are the last dregs left by the dragons in this plane. The balance of power that cannot be balanced makes them become arrogant and violent, but there is no experience that a dragon should have. Skills and Knowledge - The descendants of Grein often say that flames are burning in their blood vessels, and I think their brains are probably evaporated in this burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it is precisely because the people of Longshan City State think they are the relationship of the descendants of Yinlong. There are almost no evil generation among their rulers. They and the elves, The relationship with the priests of the gods and the dwarves is very good. They have received more support and help from their allies than other countries and regions, so that these human beings can be the three of the Grenada. The legion is facing and disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longshan City State is located on a gentle high ground, connected to the undulating low hills at the rear, connected to the foothills on the east side, and connected to the dragon ridge on the west side. The mountains extend out of the lateral branches of the mountains, and after the hills, the terrain suddenly drops, from the hills to the tundra - the snow melts in winter and then descends from the Longji Mountains, gathering small or wide streams in the jungle. They gather in the low places of the tundra, forming large and small lakes - the hinterland of the tundra where the lake gradually stretches and expands, which is the snow cover swamp we are familiar with. The land here is vast and fertile. The blizzard from the Wuthering Plain is blocked by the towering Longji Mountains. The monsoon from the south sea area brings ample steam and warm weather in a timely manner, although it is still cold in winter. Further expanding the range of crops that can be grown, there is also kaolin that can be used to make porcelain. The porcelain it burns is slightly inferior to the works of the Seris, but compared to the scarcity and weirdness of the latter, their The quantity and shape are clearly superior to the hearts of the merchants, not to mention the fact that on the hills full of rocks, the grapes used for winemaking are simply not at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These make Longshan City State almost as rich as Grenada, and as mentioned before, they can trade Mithril Gold from Silver Crown. Snow honey white lead, you can also buy sophisticated weapons from the dwarf merchants, sturdy machines, and recruiting craftsmen - the walls of the state are built by the dwarves, many of the parliamentarians of the Longshan state have more than once It is a sigh that the walls of the state are equal to the same weight of gold – this is not an exaggeration. The walls of the state are different from the walls of other countries or regions, and they are built into a zigzag shape, which leads to their enemies. It is impossible to find a complete plane launch attack, and because Longshan State has a total of twelve city-state relations, on the inner side of the main city wall, there are sporadic walls - all of which were left by the original city-state. Some people say that they should Was demolished, but after the dwarf came, he managed to climb to the tallest tree and suggested that humans keep them partially. The dwarves removed some and built some. After that, if someone overlooks from the sky, you can see the gray lines gut twists and turns, they may not be as tall, strong main walls, but also a nasty obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
