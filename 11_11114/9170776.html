In this small tribe with only a few orcs, this behavior is extravagant, but this horn deer I have been dug out of the intestines by a lonely goblin. There is no hope of survival. Therefore, its liver and heart are returned to the priest. The most fertile meat belongs to the leader of the tribe and his children, and then the rest is only tribal. The other orcs in the carcass, because the orc family, has a strong, still female relationship in the breeding season, perhaps plus a male who is about to become adult, they are divided into two deer legs below the knee, compared to those Those who can only get the skeleton and the head, they are already very lucky, but the orc boy is not grateful for the leader who decides how to distribute it. First, this horn deer is his own, but the slave is negligent. Underneath it made it jump out of the fence. Second, the tribal leader did not allow the males in the tribe to look for Gersh, because he knew that if Gersh found them, maybe other orcs could Fortunately, he became a warrior of Gersh and got more and better spoils than horn deer and argali, but he could only help death with helplessness. Every tribe is like this. Gersh doesn’t want a second voice, not only the leader, but Even some priests have had a variety of accidents - if you must be an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the orc boy thinks, he has a companion who once brought him sugar, know what sugar is, a hundred times more sweet than the spring grass stems He only got a piece that was the size of a thumb cover, but the kind of dream that can make people dream of it has not been forgotten until now, and he heard that humans will put these sugars on their heads with horns. In the big jars, if you want to eat, you can take out one piece at any time. They also add sugar to the bread, brush it on the barbecue, or mix it into the wine. He can't imagine what kind of life would be like? Even the kingdom of Kawu luxury may not be able to compare with it... and as long as they capture the human city, they can arbitrarily plunder all the things they want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Boy’s wide mouth with almost the entire face divided into two halves ugly, he will still go, even in a black When the winter wolf’s eyes could not see one hundred feet away, it would be too late. He even felt a little lucky, because this battle was ahead of time, if his horn deer was fast enough, He is still able to find the army of Gersh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唧!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, the orc boy’s eyes suddenly grow wide His eyes flashed with ominous green light like many nocturnal animals, and his ears had captured the sounds without any difference—he dropped his bones and quickly moved toward the dense grass. Run, the footsteps are as soft as the big cat, and soon he sees the sounding animal, it is a fat hamster, and it screams so stupidly because it is being forced to fight a A snake that has not yet entered hibernation is like a hamster who wants to fill his own nest with grass seeds before the snow seals the earth. The snake also needs to store enough energy before hibernation, although the average snake will finish this in the summer. Cruel things, but if the food falls from the sky, then the snake will not refuse - the squirrel screams because the snake bites its hind legs, the snake is not very toxic, the hamster can still The slanting run slanted, and the snake followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Boy will not refuse an extra night owl. As soon as he reaches out, he grabs the snake tail and pushes it in the air. The snake's spine is smashed. Broken, it is still alive, but it is no longer a threat, and then the orcs are not so difficult to find the squirrel that has been breathless, he is not going to bring them back to the tent, so his mother will split half, he is on the spot Sit down, twist the snake's head, and stuff the snake into the mouth and suck it. At the same time, he heard a slight wind, and the sound of the wind on the plains never stops. This is the origin of its name, but the wind is not The messenger of the beast god Kawu luxury, he jumped from the ground, this is a movement that humans can't do at all, but it is useless, covering a gentle but tough buckskin with his head and shoulders. The human beings are very familiar with the orcs. They rushed up silently. A tall human female first rushed to the back of the teenager. She wore the ring of the orcs on her fingers, and the pure gold that was kneaded could be posted. Serve her though big but still The finger joints, which can't be compared with the orcs, can protrude from the deadly sharp angles. She just puts her fists up and hits the orc's neck with a click—perhaps the threat of death, and the orc boy's struggle becomes crazy. Three adult males, and a body that may be heavier than men, can hardly suppress his resistance. When the orc juvenile raises his head from the buckskin and screams, a thick horned deer bone slams into it. His throat, sharp fracture cut his mouth and esophagus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken never had a pause. Except for the wind, people could only hear her breathing, which was so violently suppressed. Her fist broke into the neck of the orc boy. Through the chaotic fur and thick skin, the orc juvenile's saliva and blood flow down the horned deer bones, and his resistance becomes weak, but the human is still cautiously holding him until the horned deer bone stabs the ugly Chicken finger skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————————————————— <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female orc as a mother certainly does not care where her little scorpion has gone. The orc breeds are not from love, but because of instinct and greed. Every little orc who failed to leave the tent was a slave. Before they could defeat their father and mother, they had no say in anything, like ugly chickens and other surviving human slaves. They knew Only slightly higher than the human status, the owner of the tent, whether male or female, will not allow them to own their own things, from food to freedom - just after the humans have once again hidden in the thatched, they I saw a female orc who was more than half the height of the Orc Boy in the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female orc looks around with a puzzled look, and it doesn’t take long to dig a hole. She wonders if this kid is running away to avoid the knocking of the pyroxene. The work of breaking into the end - the pyroxene is the minerals of the Wuthering Plain, but like them, it is not qualified to use the pyroxene unrestricted - after knocking into pieces, the pyroxene can be used for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what made her more angry was happening, she actually smelled the smell of fresh blood! It is impossible to keep the meat on the bones of the horn deer. In fact, they also broke the bones of the horn deer and sucked the bone marrow inside to eat. Then she can be sure that her son must catch other prey and then swallow it. And decided to eat them outside - her cheeks trembled in horror, and the mouth whispered, she decided, she would seize the abominable "feces", take his food, and then peel off There is a skin on the back of his head that is as long and wide as the palm of his hand - this punishment can be so painful that the little scorpions of the orcs can remember the lesson and will not give them a chance to escape from work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People may find it hard to imagine that such a bloated creature can be as light as a newborn horn deer when running, her footsteps are better than her The son is bigger, but more subtle, and she changed to a running way on all fours, which made her disappear into the dense thatched grass. If it wasn’t for humans who had never diverted their sight, they simply wouldn’t Knowing where she went - the mother couldn't find her son, only found a little discarded food, maybe because she was too escaping, it turned out to be a hamster with internal organs, and the female orcs picked it up. The smell of the hamster was removed, but it looked really fat and hesitated for a while. This female orc who had more horned venison than her son put the hamster in the teeth. Between, the voice she chewed was so loud, the blood and internal organs of the hamster, and the feces flowed out of her flipped mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ugly chicken counted fifty, the female orc suddenly slammed down without warning, and the thick thatched grass dissipated the sound, the ugly chicken The male looked at the other tents, and the two orcs that disappeared did not attract more attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should be honored," said the ugly chicken with a light voice that he might not be able to hear. "This is the agent of the elf." She grabbed the messy hair of the female orcs and used them to hang her alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These humans, the slaves of the orcs, the tools and the food, swallowed the little tribe one by one overnight, the only mistake It’s a normal thing to be on the priests. They are like this nine times in ten times. After all, the followers of the orc Kayou luxury still enjoy some special powers and master the ordinary even if they are not favored. The power that the orcs couldn't grasp. For this priest, they lost two people, and several others were injured. Maybe they would only have to die. After all, the teeth and claws of the orcs and the curse of the priests are poisonous. If the ugly chickens still have snow honey, they may still be saved, but those precious honeys have already been consumed in the previous campaign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken was also injured, but perhaps because her resurrection is the gift of the god of life, Angris, her healing ability is better than other People must come strong, but the pain of losing their companions is something she can never get used to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat in the dumped tent and looked around, the companions were cutting the horned venison, and they were put into the mouth simply on the pyroxene board, they also Do not dare to raise the bonfire, so as not to cause the attention of the orcs - but their stomachs can adapt to hay, feces and bone slag, digesting such soft meat is certainly not a big problem. Yes, everyone here is a slave to the orcs. They thought they were humble and lived, and they will die in humility. The ugly chicken gave them new choices, but in the end they all had to admit ugly chicken. It was a fearless to almost inconceivable guy - when she was still alone, she dared to burn the orc's tent, disturb their horn deer, assassinate their leader, and snatch their families from their minions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chickens received the gifts from the elves gradually disappeared in a battle that followed one after another, as well as chasing and being chased. They did not replenish and no reinforcements. Their final writings were already written in the death god Clan. Wo's books, and they can see them themselves, but it is precisely because of this, they can calmly welcome the most fearful shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I have an urgent and important task to give to you.” Young Red The dragon said to the dark-haired dragon: "This is a scroll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich snorted and said that he was listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bring it to the owner of the tower," said the red dragon. "This is the reward and token I agreed with him. I think he will definitely do it." Joyful - his attitude will be directly related to the war after us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————— ———————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Where is the magical animal going?" (12)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Newt was unable to help himself because of this sentence, the gentleman with the name of the mouth suddenly Looking up, "it seems that we have an uninvited guest." He ignored the confused Newt and Megage Jacob who licked his lips in a panic, only slightly shaking his body, and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... What is this?" Jacob asked nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Phantom shifting," Newt said uncertainly: "But it may be something else...what." He knows that there are many ancient families who have their own The magic, not known, is not taught in school. The snoring of the birds and snakes calls back Hufflepuff’s attention. This gentleman may be very dangerous, but Newt really can’t think so. Look, when he is in a hurry to leave, he still remembers to put the birds and snakes back into their nests, just sniffing and stalking the beasts in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do we do now?" Jacob asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newt remembers that they escaped from Tina’s house, but he couldn’t just put Jacob alone here, here is a magical animal. The nests, many of which are marked by the Ministry of Magic, are X, that is, deadly, not tame, and so on to the wizard, let alone an unarmed Muggle/Machi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go up," Newt said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Newt wanted to pick up the lid, he found that the lid was not moving: "I’m in trouble," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newt can’t open the lid. Of course, it’s a trick for the lich to play. He didn’t leave the half-plane and noticed the wizard’s magical fluctuations. It’s the two sisters, Tina and Quinnie, and the poor pity that is obviously tempted by Quinnie’s temptation. They can be said to be against the wizard’s legal use of the hidden and confused spells of Maji. Among the hotel guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," said the older waiter at the top floor: "Guests, but I remember that the owner here should not invite you, I need a waiter to give you Take the lead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quinnie looked at her sister Tina, apparently the girl who looks like a rose is still the first time this kind of misbehavior, in the man Before the wizard said something, Tina’s wand slammed at the waiter: “The soul is out!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Wait!” the male wizard shouted: "That is illegal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a last resort...very resort, yes," Quinn received the signal from Tina, and quickly Stutterly explained: "Just... it doesn't matter, no one knows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a wizard here!" The male wizard said annoyed : "And Tina, you are not an Oro, do you want me to do Oro?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;</div>
