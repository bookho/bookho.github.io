			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yalale!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel was involuntarily exposed when he heard this familiar call A gentle smile, this situation was expected when the eunuch agreed to ask his master, he did not wait in the tent as the merchants requested, but stood outside the tent, he saw the young caster Without any joy, he found that he had not suffered any harm, as if he was still in the spirit of the Rosada Temple, and he was so proud that he reached out and greeted Kremar, who hugged them tightly. It wasn't until Baldwin rushed to throw them on the ground with the genius Kerry Ben. His intention might be to have a big hug, but he forgot that he now has only one arm and weighs three hundred pounds plus The result of the impulse was that four people rolled on the ground, and Kreima laughed, and Kerry and Yadel laughed as they understood what it was, and Baldwin smiled. I am eager to climb from my friends. Cremari and Kerry Ben, even if the elf's body is not as slim as it seems, and Kremar is the kind that can be done to the orcs by hand. Yadel was healthy, but the prison and the brand, There was also the miserable death of the companions and the teachers, and the subsequent exiles severely destroyed his body. Baldwin’s hand was placed on his chest, and the raised ribs could still be felt through the heavy linen. , <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also because of this that it’s not easy for Baldwin to get up. Any one of Yadel’s bones is not as able to withstand him. In the end, Li Oona, who couldn’t help but walked up, took Bindwin’s hand and pulled him from his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the merchants and slaves looked at them with a stunned look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness..." Yadel was the first to see the king of Norman in the Highlands, but Redhead and Birdwin had already let him guess her honorable Identity, he bent his knees and wanted to salute her. Leona grabbed his shoulder first. The former Rosada priest found that he was suddenly lifted by a woman, just like a woman. Is carrying a cat or a doll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really touching and seeing again," said Graan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember you." Yadel said with a good temper that there was no warning about Gülen, and the former pastor of Rosada gave him a Embracing, the thief was taken aback and almost gave him a dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are blushing." Mei Mi said that after Yadel walked away, she and Yadell only needed a slight confrontation. Although Yadel was no longer a pastor of Rosada, she could not follow the custom of Pastor Fro. Give him a kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up," said Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a delight to be able to see Yadel again, but the news from Yadale is not very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is Dylan Donkre thinking about?" Liona said weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wants to build a city of casters." Kerry said calmly: "There is no elf, and there is no need for too many human armies. The caster will do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is he sucked his brains by the devil?" Birdwin said bluntly: "The caster is not worth trusting, sorry. I am not talking about you, Kremar, but it must be admitted that some of the casters are dangerous and selfish. They have no faith, or false believers, and there is nothing for them to sell, including their own souls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The beasts have gold and gems." Gülen said: "They don't need to buy a lot, one tenth, no, one percent." The disasters that can be caused by the disaster and the disasters caused by several soldiers are completely out of one level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel is silent, his hair is already white, covered in His face is like a frosted dead branch covering the land, and the brand on his face is still deep. Black. But I don't know if it is an illusion, or something else. The pain it brings is slowing down with the sun. Instead, it is another pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that Dylan became the owner of Thunderbolt was to streamline the army. He brought more than 50 spellcasters to defend the Fort, and may later To be more, he regards the soldiers of Thunderbolt as a distracting burden, especially those soldiers who still remember and admire in Bedwin. He has nothing to say to them, nor is he prepared to descend. Going to beg their trust and love, he decided to take a road that was completely different from Old Don Cray and Birdwin, and their families were taken away in the outer city, or apprentices assigned to the caster. The disciples were either dismantled and built a new mage tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a friend of both Cremal and Birdwin, Yadell was the first person to be driven away after being sent a few silver coins. Being alone, and getting used to drifting, it’s much better than the soldiers who have to travel trekking in the wilderness with their own family. Among them are elders who are old and squatting. Babies, and even a few pregnant women with big belly, if they are not the merchants and craftsmen of Thundersburg, they sold them to a few horse-drawn carriages at extremely low prices. They may not be able to walk in Dylan day and night. Leave the outer edge of Fort Rey for a specified period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were almost in vain. The last time they were driven out because of the orcs, this time they were supposed to protect their lords. They walked in the grass that grew over the waist, wondering where they should go, carrying them with them. With very little food and water, they are quickly consumed. To add insult to injury, some scattered orcs found them, they were attacked, women and children were taken away, and the male was killed by Yadel, who became the leader of this group of unruly people in that chaotic situation. Teach them to build simple fortifications, arrange patrols and lookouts, dig traps, cut toxic herbs and cook them on sharpened wood thorns (poor they are not allowed to take their weapons, they are not allowed to leave) Now it is rusting in the warehouse), extracting drinking water from the mud, collecting berries, grass roots and edible branches and leaves, catching prey, and after losing nearly one-third, there are more than 4,000 people out of the piece full of The wilderness of sorrow and pain, but the bigger problem is coming, there is no place to accommodate them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many nobles coveted the 3,000 soldiers, they must know that they are the brave people who have truly confronted death and blood, and their The enemy is not a human being but a fierce orc, but they are also afraid of the new king of moodiness. About Dylan Donkley, Birdwin Don Clay, the entanglement between Pharaoh and the new king is about to become one of the talks in the streets. In Baldwin, there is the king of the daughter, Leona, who is a protector. They don’t have it. It’s quite uneconomical to be hated by the new king because they have taken soldiers from Bedwin, and who can guarantee that these soldiers can really be loyal to themselves. What? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When these soldiers expelled from the new lord of Thunderbolt were exhausted and their families were almost exhausted, Luzer’s grandfather generously extended his help. He could not accommodate the enemy's army, but could give up a ridiculous land between the Norman and the Luzer Principality in the Highlands, but he only gave them thirty days. After thirty days, the stunned knights will use their spears to expel these uninvited guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that we really want to thank Luther of Luzer," Birdwin said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't," Gülen said, he knows the inside story: "We can help him save 500,000 gold coins."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know that we are here?" Kreima asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if you are here," Yadell said. "I just asked the businessmen to take me here. It is said that the Dragon Fire Island is always missing. Soldiers, in addition, there are many vacant islands, but as soon as I got here, I heard that there is a black hair caster on the side of the island to be the new owner. There is an elf around him. I think that may be you, my friend. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
