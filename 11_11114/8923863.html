Sorry. ***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you listening to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our king is singing. Ruiwen replied that the starlight is bright, and the jungle slowly and regularly rolls under the breeze, and even in the winter, the silver-crowned tree nourished by the spring of life is still blooming, and the translucent white flowers fall. The ground is like snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of the flowers of the silver crown tree is not gentle, or sweet, they make Ruiwen think of the wind coming from the plains of the whistling The wind of metal and ore is more clear and clean than it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the three incarnations of the female elf smiled, to the manager of the Gray Ridge, Elf Perant extended her arm, the shiny skin is like a pearl and Mithril, her fingers are so delicate and soft, unless you witness it, you can hardly imagine how sharp and powerful spells they can cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty is not good at this." Perant said, gently hug her and kiss her forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard's smile has become more apparent, and the king of the jungle is not good at this. The Singh Elf knows that their king can make the entire silver-crowned jungle quiet when playing the sitar, and he has the same effect when he sings the song - the opposite is true. What needs special explanation is that Perant was the guardian of the king of the jungle. They have been together for thousands of years, both as ministers and friends, so even if Perant no longer follows the Elf King, he will still not be conscious. The land stands on the same position with his king on any issue - even if it is just such a fine and innocuous detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rui Wen’s doubts are difficult for many elves to understand. The voice of the King of the Jungle is as picky as his face and strength. The king of Emerald has praised the king of the jungle as the starlight river rushes through the valley, and the horn of the west wind passes over the dense branches of the silver-crowned tree. It is generous, soft, but invincible. Fearful - that's not so... According to Perant, not so good at singing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But neither the king of the jungle nor the Singer elves care much about this. The king of the jungle is because there are more things he needs to pay attention to. I think their king has such a small flaw... still quite cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the king of the jungle didn’t touch the sitar piano a hundred years ago, and the last time he sang was more than five hundred years ago, when Kerry was still a little baby, perhaps he felt his The mother is dead, he is crying day and night, neither the potion nor the magic can make him sleep, until the king of the jungle sits down by his bed, picks up the sitar, sings the mother of Kerry, his The short lullaby that my wife sang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the king of the jungle only sang for ten years, the elves in the silver-crowned jungle in that decade were quite wise to keep up with the baby Kerry. No, as we said before, the voice of the King of the jungle is certainly not as hoarse as the devil or the devil in the endless abyss, but every sound he sings is subtly different from the music and the accompaniment. Ordinary humans may not be able to hear it at all, but for the elf with great hearing and rich music, this is a torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, Kerry is not so upset for ten years." Ruiwen whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little disrespectful, Perant also thought so, but he immediately keenly caught the same thing: "What have you encountered?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry, Raven and other elves have returned to the Silver Crown jungle without going through three sunsets. Only their king and their friends and relatives are greeted. The other elves are tacitly not disturbing. They - the elves have never been, and will never be willing to kill in the future - they cry for the death of nature, but they will not feel sorrow, the only greed and ** that can make them disgust and rejection from the heart Death, whether it is elves, humans, orcs, or giants, and other objects with wisdom and life, when they are killed by swords, pierced by arrows, burned by flames, swallowed by rivers, crushed by boulder... every life The shouts that are made when they pass away will make their pure heart instinctively tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when they return to the silver-crowned jungle, even the king has no right to ask them to go back to that nightmare again, they need a quiet rest, Warm daylight and clear moonlight, under the stars, in the snow, in the arms of friends and relatives and the constant music of the sitar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peranton immediately found his mistake as soon as he spoke, and Ruiwen raised his hand to caress his lips and stopped and received him in time. apology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have served several times." Ruiwen said, the voice is as low as a whisper. "I am not so vulnerable - I want to tell you." Yes, Kerry is almost dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant’s hands on her back were slightly tightened, and Riewen hugged him tightly, her lips pressed against the skin of Perant’s, with the tiny drops of water after bathing, she sniffed deeply Smell the smell of a lover, it is like turpentine, silver crown wood, cold snow, and her favorite lily of the valley, the heat brought by Perant's hands makes her strong and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cremar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar." Ruiwen replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what is Kerry's hesitation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe because of Cray Does Marr summon a devil to catch the heel?” Rui Wen guessed half-heartedly: “Even so, I still want to thank him, even if we will eventually reunite in the temple of Angris, but if this The war will lead to someone dying," she said sincerely. "Don't be Kerry, not Kerry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We all hope so The great catastrophe of a thousand years ago has caused the king of the jungle to lose his lover, and Kerry is his only blood relative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar is a good boy." Ruiwen said: "Although he seems too secret."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other half of his body," Perant said: "Kerry is closer to him than anyone else, and he sees and hears more than us. He swears because he is a good friend, but Fenway can't help but be vigilant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doubt a friend really It will make him feel painful," Ruiwen said. "Especially that person did not make even a threat to the silver crown jungle. This is unfair to Kreima."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry is a young elf," Perant said. "His feelings have not been precipitated for a long time, it is still vivid and intense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emotions like new wines," said Ruiwen, "the natural enemies of reason - but this is the most precious because it will eventually die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; I only hope that it can produce pure fruit, even if it is sour," Perant lowered her head and kissed Riewen's gray-blue eyes: "Not a rotten dreg."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant only stayed in the Silver Crown jungle for a short period of time for Ruiwen, he is still the manager of Gray Ridge, he has His responsibilities and obligations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw Kremar, who was arguing with the Minamata. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starlight river between the grey ridges is the widest and quietest in the entire basin, and the shallowest water surface can only slightly escape the elf's hip position, but This does not mean that it is gentle and harmless. The gentleness is only a relative statement. The water flow is still very urgent here. The underwater stones have been polished for tens of thousands of years. The algae can be stalked in the starlight river. More rare than human beings, except for the elves, no human or orc can swim freely in the Starlight River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Starlight River is not the river of death without life, it is also full of vitality, the most familiar of which is a white-headed three-bone hard-bone fish They grow up in the lakes downstream of the Starlight River, fat and strong, and go back into the Starlight River along the narrow tributaries of the Starlight River in the late autumn, all the way north, up, until the source of the Star River, the blue lake spawning fertilization - fertilization The small fish eggs hatch into fish in the spring of the next year, then go down the Starlight River and swim back to their parents and their ancestors to recuperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this fish is famous is not much different from another world - it is because it is delicious - and it has different flavors at different stages. When they are still in the lake, no matter which one has thick fat and soft white meat, it is more suitable for stewing fish soup. Adding parsley and mallow is very delicious; when they swim into the Star River, Against the raging rivers and towering stone steps, the hard-bone fish that jumped all the way quickly consumed the excess fat, and the meat became tough and fine. It only needs to be cut open to spread the salt and roast. Three feet, it should be noted that its dorsal and pectoral fins each have three colorful long thorns, each of which is as long as a finger, sharp and hard, causing edema and unbearable pain when piercing into the human body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves occasionally block the bony fish - when their number clearly exceeds the load of the Blue Lake, then the bears, foxes, and otters will gather The riverside of the Starlight River is waiting for a free meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar and the Minamata dispute not for anything else, but because the fat otter is actually carrying the fresh bony fish that the elves have thrown ashore, But at the risk of being smashed by the fire, the ran to the fire and the black-haired caster is roasting the fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No,” the soul from the outside world explained patiently: “I put a lot of salt, spices, and wine.” He remembers that no matter how much cats and dogs can't eat salt, too much intake seems to cause hair loss— - He doesn't know how to eat salt, spices and wine for the otter, but he doesn't want to see a bad guy in a few days, although that seems interesting, but according to Perant, the last big snow in winter Will come to the gray ridge after two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otter yelled at him angrily, and Kremar tried to grab the big fish that was about to fall apart from under his claws and was bitten by it. For a bite, fortunately, the small teeth of the leeches are not enough to pierce his firm skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant came over, lowered his knees, talked to the leeches, or said that the violent and careful leeches were telling him that it was like The man stood with two hind paws, and the two small, flexible front paws were placed on the chest, and he said quickly and urgently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It wants that fish because it is holding honey," Perant said. "You use winter honey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said Kremar. "But I also salted it with salt and spices. Can leeches eat salt?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Perant said that he and the otter explained it, but the guy who had always been very docile in front of Perant suddenly violently squirmed and smacked two small feet on Perant’s trousers. hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't want winter honey," Perant said helplessly: "The fish to be marinated, grilled, spiced and brushed with honey." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you are bald, don't blame me." Krimaar shouted. He caught another bony fish, deliberately added less salt and spices, but brushed more. A few honeyspots - the otters did not find the little elves' tricks. They thought that they had defeated and enslaved the big guy, and happily dragged the grilled fish bigger than its body back into the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It likes you," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, is this called like?" Kremar asked without confirmation, pulling a bony fish from the side of the fire and handing it to Perant: "Then What do you dislike? In the middle of the night, climb the tree house and bite the throat of that person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
