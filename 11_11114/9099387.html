The lich may be, but the soul from another plane can't just order him to treat himself as if nothing had happened. The crocodile meat placed on the leaves of the reeds is cold, and the cup The broth that had been abandoned was also initially condensed - it shouldn't have been so cold in the hut, but there was always a chill coming out of the human heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I can..." Gülen said, but his expression told Kremar, maybe he didn’t know what he was talking about. He tried twice in a row to stand up, and he walked to the still-sleeping plum, or some gods--who knows, roll his mother, and the thief falls down. Down, looking down at my lover with a big head - after a while, he looked down and looked at Plum's lips, then extended a hand and placed it between her fluffy, curly hair, with a touch Touching the strength of the butterfly's wings gently strokes, as he gradually lowers his shoulders and brings his lips close to the plum, the soul of the outside world turns a little bit awkwardly, and looks at the one that the elves rushed to place the reed leaf cup. Small group of edelweiss, if you can, he should go out instead of playing here as a bright fluorite, but this spell is destined to fail immediately when he goes out, although Gülen may not care about this, but the outside world The soul is still not willing to take A risk - after all, this may be their last so intimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Block him! The scream suddenly screamed, idiot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world violently turned around, while a spell was ready to go at the fingertips, but he already saw the silver flame - the moment A black dragon's flame was burned between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gülen leaned down, his heart was almost calm, but the dagger in his hand was like an invisible heart violently bulging Shrinking, if it's an individual, maybe it can't stop cheering up - it needs power, it wants strength, nothing can make it more ecstatic than piercing a god's body - it's already embedded in it Like the moonlight white skin, only a little, only a little, only a little... The bottomless abyss is down, there is a pure and fierce force passing along the blade, but stop here, "Mei Honey opened his eyes, the silver flame flowed between the scorpion and the iris, and Gülen’s eyes reflected the flame. It cut his chest and abdomen like the sharpest blade, and the flame swallowed his skin. Muscles, about to invade his bones and internal organs, just in this moment, Gülen suddenly realized that this is the power of the gods, it can destroy the curse or blessings on his body, after the flame is extinguished, his Ashes are just ashes As he dissipated soul, they will be destroyed forever, can no longer be cured and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world thought that he was too late, and the deep regrets held his heart like a claw. He cast a spell, and the lightning pushed Gülen away, but he had the flames around him, and the power of this flame they were It was obvious that it was too late, he thought, but he immediately heard that Gülen was screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this goddess feels that such death is not enough to punish a mortal who is trying to blaspheme, the lich is screaming in the sea, even if they are It can still be said that there is no chance of winning a saint, but he knows that his cohabitants have the damn bottom line like Perant, Kerry, or other white robes. He has to frantically turn his precious brain and try. From this ruin, I found a trace of life... He actually found it - before Gülen completely turned into ashes, the flame gradually weakened and disappeared, and the thieves stood there, horrified to see that they were bare. Heart - his ribs have been burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meme!" The black-haired caster shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, standing there is plum, Gloria’s lover, not a saint, not a god, her eyes are only on Gülen’s body. After a short period of inactivity, it was filled with infinite struggles and sorrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan trembled, half out of pain, half out of joy, maybe some embarrassment and doubt, but he was looking at Crimdale At that moment, the black hair caster nodded. The next moment, the thief fell, cut off the breath, after a few breaths he turned into a deep red ashes, the soul of the outside world can be said to wait breathlessly, but fortunately only three times longer than before Time, the ashes re-condensed, and Gülen gasped heavily and woke up. Still full of limbs, the senses are sharp, but the power of the gods still left a mark on his body - a strip of lightning-like wounds covered his face and body, especially the chest, where the dark gray color It is like the infiltration of the internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She still..." he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is still there." The black-haired caster went on and said, then he saw Glan’s face slowly showing a real smile from the smile He laughed until he laughed, and his eyes were filled with hope again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This is not a bad thing. Of course, except for our Lich adults, there is no other person, he floats on the surface of the sea, which is really rare, because knowing that he is floating on the surface, can not control the body, except for the necessary moments, he Almost all meditation in the depths of the sea, remembering and pushing spells, or flipping through the memory fragments of another soul - of course, not that he has been looking for films and novels, even if it is only for Get information and novels from another plane faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the undead is simply gearing up, just waiting to study the body when he masters the body tomorrow, a saint is already special enough, and a mortal, well, a less devout priest, can actually Competing with a god, although her resistance is so weak, it has succeeded for a short moment, and this moment is the key point that Gülen has not been completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Don't be too much, the soul of the opposite world warns that she is the lover of Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I know that I know that the Lich is perfunctory, I have to suspect that she is not the lover of Gülen, but your lover, okay, Even if her lover is not, but she is at least a god, I will definitely be cautious. But we can guess now, when I wake up again, is Mei Mi still the goddess? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————————<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meiwa wakes up on the third day, but even if he wakes up, even Baldwin can detect that this is not the Pastor Fro who once admired him, but one A god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How should we call you?" Perant asked, the elf is the creation and darling of Angris, and there is no second pastor among them. In the absence of a paladin, the only one who can ask questions about this strange (although everyone has speculated) gods is only him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can call me the daughter of love." Mei Mi said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people secretly exchanged a look, and as they guessed, it was Fro who stood in front of them, the only daughter of love was her One of the many names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, why do you come here," said Perant, "This is the Snow Covered Marsh, a deserted by the gods." The ground is full of filth and mud, growing ugly beasts, even the alabasters and flowers that put your show feet are hard to find, and the nearest one of your followers is far beyond the hundred miles."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only girl who loves, that is, plum, smiles a little, this smile is just like the morning light, even Leona can not help but think for a while:" I am not here," she said softly. "I am coming for you, beautiful and innocent elves and smart and strong young people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We?" McGee said stupidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," the woman of love only sluggished a bit and took her eyes back from McGee: "Of course, there is a lovely dwarf." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then." The black-haired caster said after a deep bow, "What can we do for you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Only the woman of love said without hesitation: "I know that you are recovering the secret of a metal dragon," she said: "This secret There is a treasure belonging to me in the possession. Fortunate people, I need to get back to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know where the collection is?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only woman who loves to smile and smiles at the highland Norman’s prince, a noble god looks at a shallow mortal look like this: “The location of the treasure Constantly changing," she looked at Crimal: "Is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The soul of the opposite world said, one side of the jaw ,This The location of the collection will change a little every day. The only constant is that the final destination is always the sea of ​​the North. It is conceivable that if there is no gold scorpion to guide the direction, they will be in the sea of ​​the North, but also because of a little If you don’t have to sleep in the icy land where snow and blue are coexisting, you can only return to Longhuo Island in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if they are not so willing, they can also catch a few snow bears or foxes to go back, so that they are not empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can help you," said the woman of love, "My strength is something you can't imagine - and I just need to take back my own things." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even without your generosity," Perant said: "We will also deliver your treasures safely to your hands." This can be said to be a euphemistic rejection, but the only woman who loves it only slightly shakes her head, "The arrogant elf," she said with a slight reproach: "You don't know what you are going to face," she said. The face has passed a shadow of uneasiness and hatred: "Your enemies are stubborn, strong and mean, and with a little negligence, every one of you will die without a burial place - even your soul can't Return to the feet of your beloved gods, especially you," she raised her fingertips and gave a slight touch on Perant's forehead. "The shadow of death is like a lead cloud under the night, and you have nothing." I feel that the elf, in front of a god, you must know how to be humble." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember my words." She said this last time, and she fainted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was Perant who caught her soft body in time, waiting for a while, and Gülen turned out from a puffy pine forest, he The look is gloomy. For the souls of the outside world, the face of the thief is like a lead cloud under the night. He took the body of Mei Mi without saying a word and walked back to their tent, Leona. Retracting the line of sight, these two days are thieves who take care of Mei Mi in a meticulous manner. She really doesn't know what to say, but she doesn't think Mei Mi is still in that body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar cast a spell under the guidance of the Lich, this is a high spell, although it may be insufficient if you want to hide a god. However, the undead who used to be keenly aware that the daughter of love is now in a very, very, very weak state. When she is lethargic, she will only wake up when she is in danger of being destroyed by her body. The ridiculous thing is that as a god, she can't completely destroy a mortal soul. Mei Mei is still there and can even resist her. The lich is grateful to Gülen. If it is not him, Mei Mi will not A less devout pastor became an almost false believer. She once infinitely revered Fro while gaining strength, but as her love for Gülen increased day by day, she became tired of Fro's teachings. And the emotions of the conflict, which caused Fro to have no way to manipulate the plum as much as other priests - but Mei Mi is indeed a man with a strong talent, or among tens of thousands of Fro priests, Luo did not choose her, and more correctly, it was a pity that she could only hear Fro’s call. If Mei Mi was not born in the Temple of Fro, she might be a good caster. But since her mother is a Fro priest...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How," Perant said, "Do you have anything to say to me?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome McGee twisted his arm indefinitely, and it took a long time to decide to tell Perant, if he could, he wanted to return to Longhuo. Before leaving, he vowed to thoroughly and thoroughly check Baldwin's arm to make sure it didn't go wrong in later battles, or he could leave some confidential drawings and documents to the caster. In the event of a problem, the caster can also repair the arm as described on the drawings and documents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But," Perant said: "We are now deep into the snow cover swamp. You are sure to be able to walk alone for such a long distance without encountering possible dangers. "Gnomish thought, his face suddenly became difficult to look at. Of course he knew that they were calm in the past few days just because Black Dragon drove out most of the monsters here, but if he folds back, there is no guarantee that there will be no hungry. The monster is ready to treat him as the first meal to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
