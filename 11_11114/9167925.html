			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before readers asked whether the warlock and the psychic warlock are a concept, that is probably the relationship between the outline and the purpose, that is, the psychic warlocks are Warlock, but not all warlocks are psychic warlocks<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon is roaring loudly, “Destroy the giant!” it shouted. At the same time, a hot flame was ejected, and the flame immediately ignited a newly launched brake. It burned with the people around him, but the hurricane like a hurricane swept away, one dressed in delicate black. The robe's mage is watching the red dragon. His spells have not caused too much damage to the red dragon. The red dragon turns his neck. Its eyes are like amber, pure and pure eyes are covered with a thin layer of ice, but it is just a flaw. After the 眨 膜 film, the ice and snow melted into warm water, flowing from the nose of the red dragon, it looks like it is crying for what, but everyone knows, the red dragon will not cry<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soldier was yelling, and several warlock's spells came one after another, hitting the figure almost indefinitely, the figure of the mage was broken, that is An illusion, this concept makes the red dragon more and more violent, it does not fall on the wall as before - other Principality and city-states do not have such giants as Longshan, their smashing arrows can not even run through the red dragon's scales. But it may not be here. When the red dragon twirling on the red-red sky, it is like a slender seabird that passes through lightning and clouds, and when it is condescending, the human mage is immediately large. The brakes covered the blinded eyes and the perception of the spell - people saw the red dragon suddenly slammed down and disappeared at the other side of the wall, they cheered loudly, thinking that they had removed a powerful enemy, but the soul of the outside world But shaking his head slightly, a hit dragon will only open his wings, instead of completely closing his wings. It is consciously swooping, not helplessly falling, perhaps just to avoid a Be big The arrow thrown by the car, the eyes of the black-haired dragon can see many things that the mortal can't see. He saw the arrow that didn't even touch the red dragon scales. Its height and speed not only made the red The dragon was taken aback and let the Lich re-estimate the power of this weapon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——This large-scale brake is not just a dwarf's work, once the undead said, maybe there is a dwarf<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he suspects, in the interior of a large brake, the place covered by dark wood is filled with small gears and chains that play The magic may not be able to match the effect, so that this large brake can only be operated by three mortals - two soldiers squash the bowstring, one soldier calibrates the direction - a strange look on the brakes, it looks Like a bird's claw holding three rings, the soldier knows that if this huge arrow hits the target, the target must be in the three rings.They also knew that the arrow was lost earlier than other mortals. "Does it have eyes on its tail?" A soldier yelled, and his companion glanced at him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave here!" shouted the wizards around them, and the soldiers hesitated for a moment, then a terrible sight that might not have happened in their nightmare. The ground appeared in front of everyone - first the spines, then the horns, then the red dragon's eyes, they searched on the wall, can hold the lower half of the gnome's stone bricks under the claws of the red dragon, smash, collapse, in it can Within the reach of the city, the city wall suddenly lost as much as one-third, and a large-scale brake that fired a red dragon and was jealous of it was slid down in the snoring - the dwarves used small The steel balls are used to move their tracks so that they can move quickly on the top of the road and the wall. The dwarfs at the bottom also have brackets that allow it to stand firmly in a tilted state, but this is not They can also stop in the air, and the car slams into the collapsed place. A soldier jumps up without thinking and grabs a group of bows. No one can think of this stupid move. Let him get back his life - the red dragon did not spit the flame, but directly bit the car with his own teeth, the hard rocky wooden part in his mouth is like a piece of dry bread, metal part It was only the white pelt in the bread. The broken brake broke. It fell from the mouth of the red dragon and slammed into the outer wall of the wall. The same was true of the soldier. He fell to the ground first - a cluster of lush The gooseberry clumps made him just break a few ribs, then the base of the brakes twisted and descended from the sky, just put him in it, the sharp steel passed through his arm, and he fainted at once.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier didn’t know when he was awake, but this time the Grinada had started his first full attack.He couldn't know the situation above the wall, but he could see from the gap that the claws as big as his head were moving in a chaotic manner. The claws were connected with something like a bird's foot, but the birds were not so strong. The feet, not the thick scales on the feet, the claws, and the weights of the claws are so heavy, but the shackles in front of the claws make their footsteps not as loud as the soldiers think, and fall into the dirt. The parts are not very deep, but when they jump up, the pits left can allow a human male to put all the parts below his knees inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Deinonychus jumped high and his claws were embedded in the wall, and the gravel fell from the crack on the soldier, he took a deep breath and the gap above the light that could be thrown in was covered. He knew There is a Deinonychus on his sky, and he counts the defenses he knows - in this case, what they do most often is - pour oil, and it is hot oil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark whale oil is from the long slits reserved before, not just like the ordinary fortress and the wall, just from the shooting hole, the spacing of the long slits may only be Three feet, and this gap simply can't allow a huge body of the clawed dragon to climb up. They ensure that every part of the wall is covered with greasy grease. The soldiers hear the clawed dragon in a sharp call, then His temporary shelter suddenly collapsed in a loud bang, and the soldier immediately lowered his head. The whole person was squatting on the ground by the pendulum of the steel. His back could feel himself from time to time. The pressure - if a large brake is not a material that is extremely flexible and resilient, he may have become a cushion under the fearless dragon's buttocks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this dangerous situation only lasted for a few breaths and disappeared, but the soldiers did not feel at ease.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dragon claws gradually approaching the wall – the zigzag wall against the fear The dragons are also a problem. They are not as big as a small hill like a lion's beast. But they also have more places than ordinary humans and even orcs. The narrow wall makes the Dragon Claws. Our squadrons were reluctantly split again, six, or a group of seven dragon-claw knights, which slowed the command in the dragon's claws—the knights were not surprised that humans would dump Grease, this is a defensive way that can be seen in many places. They skillfully slip off and stand up against the unstable clawed dragon. What a lot of money to simply make some roll rough skin and flesh of these creatures<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first squad leader of the Dragon Claws gave a fine and long sound, and the sorcerers of the Dragon Claw raised their hands and entered the state of disappointment and began to sing a spell— - Most of them throw out flames and thunder, perhaps toxic smoke, flames can burn grease, even into the gap, let the enemy inside eat their own fruit, and lightning, they are small spherical lightning, swallowing in the air After swallowing the ground for a while, they drilled in through the gap. Sometimes they only caused the death of one or two people. Sometimes they also led to fuel fat. As for those poisonous smoke, the warlock would assist. They are sent to more, and perhaps even the eyes of the dragons may not be able to find the gaps.The dragon-claw knights looked forward with anticipation. A knight frowned frowningly, and his mount, a strong frightening dragon, moved his claws as if he was echoing his warning signs. It hit the ball. Another feared dragon that retreated from the wall attracted the monster and the owner of the monster to glare at them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but in the next moment, they suddenly lost their peers, no, maybe not So say - they didn't leave, or they were suddenly thrown by a spell, the ground<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, the ground that was very solid before the attack started suddenly became wet and soft, and the soft one could pull out the dull water, and it was too late to yell. Remind, or react, the hexagrams of the hexagrams, the Grenadas who carried them, suddenly fell into a huge mud – the body of the Deinonychus was like an awl. Strong hind limbs, strong muscles and thick scales are also destined to be not the kind of creatures that can easily float up. The mud swallows most of their bodies at once, and the warlocks pull out, except for one. There isn’t much damage outside the robes and boots, but the knights in armor are much worse. If it’s not the chilling caster in the Grenada’s army, it’s such a trap. It may bring significant losses that cannot be explained by any general.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the warlocks, the mud that lost gravity is like the oil hoist of another plane, the fear dragon and the knight that will fall into it. They are thrown into the air, they may also want to be gentle, but the problem is that just in the next moment of the trap, all the shots have arrows in their shots, and the arrows pour down like a rainstorm, the skin of the claw dragon Not so easy to penetrate, but these arrows are tied with the gimmicks, like minerals, as long as you touch the hard things will explode, the knight's spear and sword are the same The flesh and blood that is smashed at one time is like the evil flower blooming in the black mud. The Grinada people are cursing loudly. They should be grateful to the red dragon and the dragon tooth. If they are not suppressing the wall, the arrow from the mouth of the mouth. It will make them more dead and wounded, but even so, it is enough to make these arrogant Grenada people feel humiliated and angry. After they get out of the mud, they want to launch the offensive again, but the rolling Marsh are continuing to spread toward further afield<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
