Get up, gently pinch, once a beautiful treasure is a small useless black slag, he let go of his fingers, the residue fell into the sand from his finger gap. He doesn't want to pin all his hopes on a Grinada, but he and those who are willing to follow him have nowhere to go. He even has the urge to throw a spider to the desert. Go, as he thought many years ago, but he knows that this is impossible, not only his people, even he does not know what else he can do after leaving the spider, may even appear as a slave Too thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every desert barbarian is extremely slim, except for a poor diet, too heavy to escape on his own spider beast One of the reasons - Moussa involuntarily recalled the wars that the elders had talked about before - the caravans that were lost in the face of sandstorms; the reckless or the speculative outsiders, the little ones, no more than the tribal warriors More than half of the number, the dragon claw soldiers patrol ... In addition to these, they encountered the kind of caravan that was used as a bait, or the dragon claws of the elite or dragon tooth knight, the only thing that can be done is to escape, The spiders and beasts are amazingly fast in the short distance, and they are forced to turn around and fight with the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, like the latter half of the elders who can only be named with scorn and despicable title, they will not tell the children, even Moussa, It is not until the age of 20 that he can hear and see the truth and darkness in the tribe. Although in the years before that, he has analyzed and identified those lies from the words of the words and shadows - but he How do we do this? Is he going to tell the children that the heroic warriors they are for are just the lucky ones who survived by the enemy's carelessness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he didn’t think was that the lie said more, the lie was not only the others, but also the self, the elders would think that they were serious in Grenada. When they got up, they could still escape with the old tricks that had long been known to the Knights of the Dragons and the Warlocks... Or Moussa showed a bitter smile, they just started to be dissatisfied with their own Strict rules - he is not allowed to arbitrarily rob the caravans of unknown circumstances, nor to buy and sell prisoners and slaves, nor to allow them to harm and rob people of the lions - the human face lions Close relationship with the barbarian, but since Moussa’s father died, some of the tribes were heart-warming because of the warlock’s offer, and they made unforgivable betrayal by the human face of the lion’s beast. Moussa did not Know why they think that one or two bags of gold coins will be more important than a smart ethnic alliance. But they did just that, although Moussa was similar to snatching the eggs of the lions and beasts back to their territory, but from the moment when those people reached out, the covenant between the barbarian and the human face lion beast It broke down - this time the human face lion body did not hesitate to choose the migration, but they did not even ask if Musa humans have to leave the desert with them...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the male-faced lion beast is willing to take him to the dark-haired dragon, just because of the eggs that Moussa had brought back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moussa thought for a long time after getting the news, he found that if this thing is true, then the best end of the barbarian is just to become a slave. Or if they are displaced, Moussa may choose to go into exile a few years ago, but in the past few years he has vaguely learned about the situation in neighboring countries. They are shrouded in the shadow of war brought by Grenada, a large number of young men. Become a soldier, the field can only be cultivated by the elderly, women and children, which makes these countries' peaks of slavery and serfs reach a peak, they will not be free, they will only get endless slavery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way the young leader can think of, the way the desert barbarian can continue, seems to be only the vassal of the black-haired dragon, or like the elders Reprimanded, become a slave, but since the dragon can be trusted by a male lion, then he may also hope that he is not as cruel as other Golden Dragons? They can raise a group of spider beasts for him. Although it is true that the eater has some value, it seems that it is not worthy of the exchange of too many things - but the black dragon has not yet been established. Before starting his own power, Moussa dared to say that his power was small, but it was like a lancet on the belly of a spider, and at a critical moment, they might be able to play an unexpected role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does the warlock say?" A young desert barbarian said that he is not very good with Musa in the tribe, but he is willing "Believe" Moussa and leave the tribe with him - Moussa knows that he is just tired of continuing to live a barren and unstable life day after day in the desert, eager to be a strong and wealthy king or The lord hired, became his right hand, and took power, becoming a person who can freely manipulate the fate of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." the young barbarian asked tentatively: "Did we go so far? We have not been touched by the first outer wall and we will be killed or imprisoned."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said he would send his messenger," Moussa said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They waited for two days in the desert, on the day that Kreima set off for the military camp, a merchant carrying heavy black iron steel The team passed through the end of the desert, and under the guidance of the fire element waiters, they found Moussa and his people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian is no different from some brown-skinned Grenada people on the outside, to say that there is something different, perhaps their clothing— -Grenada is a country of the caster, so even if you wear a chain armor and a sword, people will be happy to add a loose robes to the body, and in order to cater to the dragon's preferences, they are in the neck. The forehead and the wrist are full of jewels - the barbarian is not. In order to reduce the burden of the eater, not to affect their speed, the barbarian prefers tights, and at most wears a huge headscarf to resist the sand. It is also small and exquisite. As for accessories, only girls will wear a pair of thin gold rings on their ears. You can only see the talisman on the male. Most of these charms come from their elders and are a blessing. There is no power beyond human expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change clothes," said the owner of the caravan, from which he divided the caravan into two groups, one for his believable subordinate and the other for another. The group is the mercenary hired, the mercenary guarantees that they can come here, and the next route needs to be handed over to these strangers. There are many people who admire his courage, but what he has to say is that the fear of the thieves’ union owner in the Port of Mind is greater than that of Grenada – and Gülen said that he is A member of the royal family of Grenada works, hopefully, he thinks, while swiftly sweeping those who need him to take away, but fortunately there are only a few women and children, otherwise he will have a hard time explaining why he has a group Family mercenary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moussa knew what he was thinking, and he thought of those women and children, but he couldn’t take them, they didn’t want to leave the tribe. Unwilling to be a slave, this is correct - just sometimes Moussa wants his own cognition and judgment to be wrong, even if he has to lose his dignity as a human being for today's decision, but the least innocent lives can be preservation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companions are eager to try on those leather armor and shirts, as well as cloaks, which can match the identity of a mercenary, not enough Exquisite, somewhat rough, but the barbarian is excited about their weapons. As a mercenary, all can't be just a dagger. They can have long swords, big bows, double scimitars, shields and long spears. They don't seem to miss the people who remain in the tribe. This is also the place where Moussa is different from other barbarians. The barbarians are not a soft race. They are hard in some places like the sand that has been polished many times by the hurricane. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are only responsible for taking you to the outer city." The businessman explained: "All employed mercenaries can only stay in the outer city, they do not It is allowed to enter the inner city, but the outer city is also very good, there is wine, there are women, and there are comfortable beds."dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Moussa Seeing some of the companions immediately showed a coveted look, they like wine, they like women, and they like everything that can be called enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go." Moussa finally said that he looked at the desert before pulling the hood on the cloak, and now he has nothing to ask for, only Asking the dark-haired dragons will not force them to point their swords at their own people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Moussa’s thoughts, the soul of the outside world does not know at all, In other words, it only did a very reasonable and simple thing, just as someone crossed into World War II and knew that everyone in a Jewish settlement would be arrested and sent to a concentration camp, so they managed to warn those people as soon as possible— - Although it is embarrassing, they are the person in charge of this task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the lich does not seem to care about his behavior - they won't believe it, the former undead said if they are still the same as before - in I haven't left Grenada before, I have dealt with them. I have to say that the whole process is disgusting. Their IQ is probably as low as the spiders they support. No, maybe lower. They are used to numb themselves and settle in the status quo. There may be some people who flee, but that will only be a minority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
