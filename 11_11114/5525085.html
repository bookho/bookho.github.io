			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the devil's finger, um, we humans call it, the elves call it 'poisonous tip', that is a unique species of fungi." The ship doctor said that they had returned to the foot of the egret, sitting in the front hall, surrounded by a warm hearth, in front of the grape juice mixed with vegetables and watered milk: "Only the swamp in the depths of the forest can see the stuff. When it is not grown, it is white, it grows bright red, dried, and ground into powder. The wizard uses it to summon the devil. The mortal uses them to kill. It only needs a small point and can be hidden in the nails. It is soluble in water and can be turned into smoke. The effect is similar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very expensive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's very expensive," the ship doctor smacked his mouth: "The mages weigh it in grams - and the elves hate this mushroom, which is almost exclusively distributed in the backyard of their vestibule, perhaps because people almost call it For the sake of the elf's fingers, when they see it, they have to ruin it. Of course, they are not willing. Humans collect them and then take them out for sale or use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva The mage's face is full of regrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the Ranger stand face to face on both sides of a pool of fire elements. This pool of fire elements is small, it is limited by the Master in a hand that can be lifted with both hands. In the mica stone bowl, the bowl is stuck in a black iron bracket that is cast into vines and gnome arms. In the place near the bowl, the iron bracket becomes dark red and emits turbulent heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you really leave me some?" He said: "As long as the weight of two grams, I just want to do some experiment."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The Ranger answered gently and stubbornly, the Master grinned sadly, but he still cast a spell on the Ranger's wish. After the spell took effect, the Ranger will take the cylinder. Throw into the pool of fire elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke was dispelled as soon as it was produced. The dried mushrooms made a baby cry in the pure fire element. "These summons can summon more than a dozen devils." "The Master said that for a while, the Ranger thought he would reach in and rescue the remnant part - but fortunately, he said sorry to his mage friend in his heart. Few people know that the elf hates this mushroom. Because of a name and the evil use that humans know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood until the fire element pool returned to its original appearance before leaving, and the Master carefully locked the room with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I may not be prepared for this spell." Alva said that he was a little bit worried about the mushroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't take a long time to leave Bituminburg," said the Ranger, comfortably. "At least not enough to make you tired of your old friends." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master likes hookah is a well-known thing, but he is equally busy, so he keeps a small spell to disperse the room and body in an emergency. Smoke smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else do you have to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Ranger Slightly over the head: "Need help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caubert wants me to meet someone, a stranger who makes him feel good," Alva The voice echoed in the empty corridor, and the Master and the Ranger were used to walking lightly and silently: "He hopes that I can give some instructions..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is still unknown," Alva said. "But in my opinion, that person is not extremely kind, it is extremely evil. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Incidentally," he said: "He wants to go to the White Tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——White Tower? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Yes, White Tower, we must first get something there, and then go north along the Starlight River until the Grey Ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- is the end point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The temporary end point. The Lich said that we need a safe place to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I thought you would be eager to restore strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There is also a place where the blade is sharpened. The former undead said that the gray ridge is the frontier and guard post of the silver-crowned jungle - the goblin, the orc, and the human being. The battle and danger are never lacking, but not too frequent. It is right for us now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Will they allow? Skeptical about the soul of the outside world - in his world, 80% of a funny little interview said that he could not recognize his neighbor and could not name their name, but There is almost no harm to them, but what about this? People will hold a suspicious and vigilant attitude towards an unfamiliar face. Travelers of unknown origin will be expelled even if they are only passing through the village or staying in the field for a while, let alone settle down and invade their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Yes, the Lich said, simple and unquestionable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world has no more to say, he can detect that the lich's emotions are in a state of volatility. The once-dead person seems to be forced to face something he does not want to face. The most ironic thing is that it is none other than himself who is beating him with a whip behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich used magic tricks to give himself a rough mirror, the handle was made of wood, the mercury paint on the back was cracked, and a small piece was missing. . His pale face was reflected in the mirror. This face had been rotten as early as seventy years ago, but now it is back, the Lich is not happy with it - he never liked his face, although it once gave him shelter, in him Still very weak and humble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His forehead is wide and high, the hairline in the middle of the forehead is slightly down, forming a small tip, the brow bones protruding, and the eyes are deeply sunken Under the cover of sharp and thick eyebrows, they are extraordinarily gloomy and elusive; the bridge of the nose is narrow and towering, and his lips are beautifully lined and suitable for kissing. Although he lacks blood, he is still a personal class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair is black, maybe those who lack education and lack of words can only say: ah, that is how beautiful hair is black, but as long as When you put it together with other dark hair, you can immediately discover the difference - it's black is so pure, in the absence of light, it's like a nightmare that can be touched, but only slightly A little bright, you can see the metal fold of the indigo and silver ash, this refraction is often seen in the feathers of the lone eagle and the raven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich remembers that he is still in the mentor’s tower and the days before, he learned how to keep quiet and converge when he was in the squat, at least not let It comes to the surface - a wrong smile and an eyebrow will be mistaken for ridicule or contempt, you will be whipped (when you are lucky), or be executed, the worst is to become a sacrifice or experiment Materials - but sometimes expressionlessness can be a crime (when you are not lucky). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
