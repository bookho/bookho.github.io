			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the huge dam built by the revenge of Talos, there are three tall and elegant figures staring at the distant wilderness, as if splitting the sea and Within the man-made buildings of the earth, human villages and fields have spread to the end of vision, and at dusk, closest to them, a small village that seems to be within reach can even ignite torches, although in recent years, people here have There is a steady and stable life, but the torch can still be called something other than the necessities, especially the number that almost ignites the entire village and is comparable to the sunset.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a wedding?"Kerry is pleased to say that as an elf, he can see more things than Yadel as a human being. "Look at the groom, his face makes me familiar, is the descendant of the farmer called Wolf." ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should be his great-grandson?" "Yalale squinted and attached.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His seventh grandsonKremar corrected that Yadel looked at Kerry Ben in surprise and got a positive look. If it was other humans, then they might not be so clear, but Wolf, he is rare, though not Those who have received orthodox education but still have reason and wisdom, perhaps among the nobles, these two qualities are not uncommon, but among the civilians who are cringing or ignorant, he is especially rare, especially Krimal. In order to create a new series of new initiatives, new laws and new ideas in order to create his ideal city, he almost did his best to support and shout. This is like a little grit in the sea. But especially gratifying<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have been here for 90 years, Yadel"Kerry Ben said<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unimaginable," Yadel, he smiled and shook his head, the white beard trembled in the wind: "There are ninety years, I still remember the first Seeing the way of the new Cree, it was like yesterday.What he didn't say is that for humans, this seems to be a very long period of time. They have a short life span, and they also have unparalleled adaptability. After losing the guidance and care of the gods, they only Being able to rely on oneself, such a life is undoubtedly hard, but in this dull and painful, human wisdom is constantly bursting like the fire after the stone strikes - of course, there are also the guidance and encouragement of the lords here. The reason, any kind, big or small, or the discovery and invention that doesn't see anything special at this time, will be encouraged – even finding new grains or raising huge pigs is also in it. I’m thinking about it. It seems that there was a similar thing in the shrine of the god of morning light, which was once served by Yadall, but at that time, these glory belonged to the gods, and the pastors accepted the offerings and rewarded the people. A sum of money, or a gift of one or two gods, as for what they have contributed, if not with great power or a long history The noble reason is generally only being shelved - but Kreima...he does not seem to think so. Everything that might be considered by him to be helpful to "people's livelihood" will be treated with caution. On the sacrifices, he pays more attention to their wisdom. Yes, it belongs only to the wisdom of mankind. He never denies. No, he always thinks that humble mortals can do things that they thought they only did. Even better, the fact seems to be the same, he rewards them, let people know their names, give them official positions and power, and all they have to do is spread the things they have mastered and professors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time people were frightened, the second time they began to enjoy respect and love, and for the third time they seemed to forget even the gods. - Nowadays, people in Crefa have become accustomed to life without gods. They don't remember the sacrifice day of the gods, nor the sacred emblems and marks of the gods. Only the mouth of the bard will occasionally come out. The names of one or two gods, but they are getting fewer and fewer. After all, the majesty of the gods is about to be forgotten. Their followers and priests are still deeply remembered because of the pollution caused by divine power. the<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Yadell sighed deeply, he didn’t know... he was abandoned by the god of morning light Rosada, cursing whether it was a He was punished. As a good friend of Krymar when he was young, he was greatly trusted and indulged in Crayfa. It is precisely because of this that he has also been exposed to many outside intelligences, a large part of which is related to the pastor. The temple is related to the miserable things that happened in the sanctuary—some of which were made by the priest when they prayed to the gods, but because of the polluted power, they became the abyss passage, the devil's lair, and others because the ignorant and ignorant people suffered from the former. After the maiming, blindly destroying the temple because of fear and anger, expelling and killing the priest... He can't blame anyone, but almost imagined that if he was a pastor of Rosada... while creeping, he could not help but recall again and again. Rosada left his last glimpse, did he still have the wisdom? Perhaps it was such a little bit of last reason that he was expelled from voters who might not be the most loyal to him but could truly understand and follow his teachings. He cursed Yadel and made him unable to pray to Rosada. He even even Saada’s name could not be said, but it was his curse, and Yadel was able to walk brightly on the streets of Crefa.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a pastor of Rosada, Yadel must despise and hate these human beings. They have been sheltered by the god of morning light and regarded him as the master. Who knows that only a few decades, Rosada’s trace in their hearts Almost too weak to see, they should have been punished; but, as a former human being, he has to be gratified by this coolness and shortsightedness, Yadel is very clear, when the gods fall into the unknown chaos, pray There is no point in being devout with piety. Compared to cursing, praying, or crying on the ground, it is better to cheer up and use your own hands to open the way to the future. What's more, at this moment, in addition to the pastor, the most worrying thing is those who are too devout believers. Their stubbornness has made them encounter very embarrassing things, not to mention the devil and the devil who are disguised as gods. Those, after all, they are just mortals without talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has happened in Crefa, but in Crewe, the strict and meticulous laws are deeply imprinted in everyone’s heart, It’s the devil, or the devil. The catastrophe brought by them was forcibly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also related to the ratio of the spellcaster of Crewe, perhaps in addition to the Seventy-seven Islands, where the Red Dragon’s country, Grenada and the Lich Cluster There is no such thing as a crowd of intensive casters—Krymall’s floating city Kreif had a group of casters from the Dragon’s Army, and Bishop’s Fortress was almost completely destroyed in the war with Fallon. Before the revival, most of its wizards moved to the new Creefa, as well as the wizards of the Silver-crowned jungle and the Emerald Island, as well as the escaping from the chaotic Fallon, the surging Grenada. Guys, of course, many of them are scum, but Cri's law is good for it to distinguish between mortals and talents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar is an extremely powerful mage, not only powerful, but also rich, this rich not only refers to mortals, but also to the casters, scrolls, runes , magical clothing and utensils, etc., especially before the millennium, this is simply a treasure that is difficult to replace with equal weight of gold, but accepted the triple gift of the Northland, the Jade Forest Island and the Dragon Io In the eyes of Kremar, they are never better than people. In fact, power is more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of them did not use spells or summon human face lions, but slowly walked back from the towering dam to the center of the city - the ruling palace This huge wall like a dragon stands between the sea and the earth. It was originally the "visit" of the priests of the tyrannical storm god Taros, several times a year, perhaps because of the constant degeneration of the gods. The priests of the Storm God are becoming more and more mad, hundreds of islands or coastal cities. If they can't satisfy their endless greed, they must face the looting of storms and even tsunami. Some cities have yielded, and some have simply given up. In the native land, only a few cities can resist and counterattack, and Crayfa is undoubtedly one of the most tenacious and persistent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The souls of the outer world will never satisfy their requirements. The god of the storm, Talos, is not a god of gold and silk. He is going to live. , livestock, and humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar said that when the levee was to be lifted between this long and narrow sea and the roaring sea And Gülen is willing to believe that in another plane, such a project is almost impossible, but in the idea of ​​the soul of the outside world, the advantages of the two planes can be combined into one, and the result is The incarnation of the druids, when overlooked at a height of 30,000 feet, can also clearly identify a long line of snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they didn’t think was that this miraculous building actually lured tens of thousands of people to abandon their homeland and spent months in the country. Go to this place that was originally infertile. Perhaps it is because in this chaotic period of time, a powerful caster will not be afraid, away from it, but will be defamed. They also hope that they can be sheltered by the adults like the people here. There has always been a legend that this adult is an evil undead, but compared to the abyss creatures that breed in the main material plane like mosquitoes, the heavy and diverse labor has almost taken away the tax on the last bite of food on the mouth, but here is like the ground. The kingdom of God is average. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalal is separated from Kremar and Kyreben under the dam, he is going to the "hospital", a temple and sanctuary belonging to humanity, inside They are all educated mortals who can use herbs to treat injured or sick people. When humans have lost their sanctuary, their existence is no less than a long drought, and Yadel even found one or two of them. The apprentice of the pastor, but he did not say anything. Because of the teachings he received in his childhood and the decades of exile, Yadell’s understanding of herbs is better than anyone in the “hospital”, and the knowledge of the other side is given by the soul of the outside world. He is very respected in the "hospital", even if some people still feel fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry’s eyes sent Yadel into the holy white building, and he couldn’t help but feel mixed. He turned to Kremar: “This belongs to another world. Things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I couldn’t even imagine what kind of world it was at the beginning,” Kerry murmurs. “How could it be, a world without gods or even demons and demons... What kind of world is that? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar turned and smiled at Kerry Ben, who has been in the world for so long, no longer that innocent I was only thinking about the little fool who came home, but Kerry’s problem brought him back there in a moment—before the Bibi Dyke, he first came into contact with the real side of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is not too good," he gave Kerry a similar answer: "But it's not too bad."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————— ——————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the light is gone, it will not come back, and there will always be many beautiful things that can be destroyed after being destroyed. Under the protection of Kremar, the people who lived carelessly probably didn’t know that they had suffered from the unimaginable catastrophe in places other than their cognition – the gray plume fell from the sky. When it falls to the ground, it turns into chaos. It is hard to tell what it is like because it has almost no traits. It is not a liquid, nor a solid, or even a gas. There is no barrier to block it. Everything can only be assimilated by it. If you want to escape from its swallowing, the only way is to use other things to satisfy its appetite. Yes, only, can make this "thing" expand speed. The way to slow down is to give it... everything you think you can throw away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human beings, the elves, and the creatures on this plane are still able to reluctantly delay the cause of the remnant, even in the bottomless abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be people who remember that the power that was polluted by Alibaba’s power opened up a convenient passage for the devil and the devil to the main material plane, just in these When the abyss creatures were screaming, Aliman’s tentacles also invaded the abyss. Like the gods of heaven, the underground abyss were also quickly eroded by them. However, when the heavenly kingdom of God has not yet fallen into chaos, these eroded Part of it is like a small hole on a solid ground. Although some wise devils feel uncomfortable, they have not caused much commotion, but what they did not think is that after the collapse of the kingdom of God, the torrent of chaos actually passed through the main substance. The plane directly broke into the bottomless abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more intuitive analogy is that when the sewage flows across the table, it drips from the small holes and gaps in the table to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, not only the devil, but even the chaotic demons are panicked. Of course, they are the product and defenders of chaos, but anyway, they It is absolutely unacceptable to be part of a chaotic snake - and this can hardly be said to be Ariman. It is more like a rotten creature without thoughts and only desires. It has nothing to do but to devour everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil and the devil have fled the main material plane, but they also clearly understand that this is only a probation, the reason why Chaos first swallowed the bottomless abyss It is only because the bottomless abyss was originally Aliman’s lair, and the fusion of the chaotic snake Aliman and the serpent of the order, of course, will also call for chaos, but after the chaos has swallowed the entire abyss, Like the poison that overflows from the cup, it will still return to the main material plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These creatures that have emerged from the source of chaos, and who eventually perish in chaos, are still able to keep their minds in chaos, seeing the turbidity of the filth When you bring a dead silence, you will surely laugh and succumb to it. After the Kingdom of God and the abyss, the main material plane will also face the fate of destruction. This is a joyful song, for destruction, to give Darkness, giving chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos waved his wings and landed next to Grazette of the Six Fingers. They were surrounded by low-level devils and devils who fled, like the Lord. In the forest of material planes, in order to escape the flames and smoke, both predators and predators have single-mindedly released their hooves, claws, tentacles or wings, only some unlucky guys. Colliding together, the result is not that the weak are trampled and injured or even die, that is, the two are caught together by the gray tide, only the strong like Grazite and Asmodeos can glimpse this terrible The opportunity to devour the former allies or enemies, of course, they do so, it can be said that they use their own existence to make a bet, this turbid power has no form, it comes without warning, spread more than any plague and curse To be fast, if the power or body that they have swallowed has been contaminated with even a trace, then they will eventually die away, but who are they? A great demon who can hide for thousands of years, even turn his own existence into a legend, a great demon who has mastered three levels and has touched the power of God and even the godhead. Their previous calm was just before the drama. Overture, and now, is the moment they are looking forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Asmodeos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grazrt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are malicious to each other Shouting the other's name, feeling the instinctive counterattack to tear the body and even the pain of the soul and the clear killing at the same time, they have done so for many years, after swallowing so many demons, devils, abyss creatures, Their will is gradually beginning to be unclear. This has the influence of Alimande, and the curse of those who are unwilling to die. If they lose their self-awareness, then the next moment, maybe, no, must be honored to become chaotic. Part of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They watched the gray torrent of Aliman’s incarnation to assimilate the entire abyss. The place where they stood was already the last pure land of the abyss, and their feet were piled up. Like the corpses of the mountains, and the devils that can be counted next to them so far, the devil, when the gray tide is approaching, these creatures, which are almost destined to be enemies, make a loud scream, no one can More clearly than they are, swallowed by the tide, is the real death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we trust him?" Glazte asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have no choice," replied Asmodeos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the unfortunate future of the main material plane is no longer a secret, but at least in many people. In the eyes, it is no longer a secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the gray chaos, the creatures that had been swallowed by chaos and had to escape to the calm place - the bears and wolves from the northernmost land The group, the giants and the barbarians began, and the orcs on the plains of the whistling, their bones could almost be flush with the steel walls of Thunderbolt. This is no longer what humans can fight. The remaining beasts are more than a hundred years later. Once again set foot on the human territory, but unlike the last arrogant arrogance, this time the orc eyes are full of tears of despair, they live in madness and chaos, just alive, even if there is more than a small time, they There is no longer any discipline or thought. It seems that this race has finally abandoned the latter word and has become a beast without wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relatively, the people of Norman in the Highlands have also begun to use unscrupulous means, almost hysterical resistance, which is no longer a battle for honor or power, and It is out of the most primitive desire for survival - after all, the survivors of Thunderbolt have witnessed the arrival of the gray torrent - those torrents that follow the orcs' heels, they are not defeated by the orcs, but fear This is an unknown thing that can be combined with steel and stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singer elves also had to give up their homes, Silver Crown, and they even gave up the opportunity to return to the Anglos Gods, but Their hearts are not remorseful or frustrated. Before the gray torrents came, the trees had withered. Fortunately, before this, the elves had folded off the fresh silver-crowned tree branches and the branches or branches of other plants. The source of the water of life, and the derived Wanweilin, have also been transferred to the first homes of the elves, the Jade Island, and even the animals, especially the otters who have grown into a large family, also take the ride. The flying wing of the elves settled in the Emerald Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not only the extreme north and the whistling plains, but the stubborn dwarves insist on coexistence with their Longji Mountains, Red Dragon Grenada, which Ruidi once proud of, has disappeared. This sinful place, once occupied by power, gold and magic, has not left anything, except for those dragons and mages who have escaped from the emperor, they have been paying close attention to there. Kreima immediately sent his own dragon cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kreima’s dragon cavalry flew in all directions, and they carried the black-haired messenger’s messenger to convey the unfortunate news of the casters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life span of human beings is short-lived, and those who are remembered by Kreima have gone to mourn the wasteland, and their children, or familiar, or strangers But they have at least heard of the city created by the caster. They thought that the city would be destroyed for various reasons sooner or later, but no, it stands there, as strong and silent as the rocks on the beach. This is the first. Once, the lord's messenger appeared in front of them, and some rulers did not hesitate to heed his warnings. At the very least, they would send a mage to check, after the news was confirmed, the village and the city were large. The migratory action began, but there were also some people who thought that it was only the caster who was guilty of ignorance, and even ignored it, until the army and mage of Grenada, or the enemy that could not resist the other side, came to his city overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just from the map, there are not many places and time left for them. In particular, before they solve the gray torrent, they have to face more enemies. I don’t know if it is a kind of irony. As the center of the fort, the gray torrents leave them the most blank space. Just like the world of outsiders, the global ocean surface rises one day, leaving only one island, even if it knows that the island will eventually sink, regardless of the island. Whoever belongs to the original, as long as it can, no matter who will take care of everything on top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just human, it’s probably not that terrible, but in addition to humans, there are more intelligent lives in this plane – goblins, gnomes, gnomes, monsters With all kinds of magical creatures... Before the arrival of the gray torrent, they never knew that their numbers could cover the sky and cover the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most terrible of these is the dragons who have lost control since the disappearance of the dragon god Aiou. They have never had the wisdom of the once dragons. And reason, just a group of beasts, and even can be said that many places, before the arrival of the gray torrent, have been completely destroyed by these terrible lives. It is precisely because of this that they become the most difficult enemy of survivors, because they can not be convinced by any words or means, except for something more horrible than them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any power worth fighting for?" Yadel asked tiredly, and the life and vitality that the god of morning light gave him seemed to be in this short period of time. In the year, he was exhausted. He leaned against the armrests of the chair, his limbs were slack and his voice was hoarse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has shaken his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar was silent for a while: "Yes," he said: "The Seventy-seven Islands."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale and Kerry Ben stared at him, and Yadel could not help but scream: "Tell me this is just a joke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not a joke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s a local resident here, even if you know that this is a good solution, you’ll be undecided, after all, the undead The gully between the living beings cannot be flattened. Similarly, the undead will not be subject to the legal or moral constraints of the living. No one knows whether this catastrophe will be another catastrophe. But for the visitors of another world, it is still a materialist. For it, it is possible to catch the mouse. There is no difference between the wizard cat and the lich cat. To say the harm caused by the lich - how? It won't be terrible than the end of the gray torrent - the former has at least a chance to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If," Kerry said sensibly: "Even if there is only one, I want to try a sacrifice method in exchange for my own survival, what should I do?" The population on the territory of Kremar has been densely populated to a point worthy of awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Try it," said Kremar calmly. "Since the gray torrent has appeared, they have already tried it, more than once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————————————————————————<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is something else, the lichs on the seventy-seven islands may follow the jokes, but the moments of the seventy-seven islands will make these long-dead guys shudder. The reason why they gave up the glory and enjoyment of the living is to obtain an eternal life, not to provide a large gray slime. For the proposal of Kremar, they accepted, but a female lich ( Although it is difficult for mortals to distinguish from the skeleton, or step forward, the head of the black-haired dragon is stroked under the subtle gaze of many lichs: "We used to think that you are more inclined to humans."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I rule them." Krimaar replied softly, maybe he has grown A caster who is second only to the madness of the demigod lich, Edel, but almost all of his "elders" here, the seventy-seven islands are full of dangers and conspiracy, but he must admit that he is able to walk out of the mentor. After the Master Tower, he suffered a lot of tolerance and favor from the Lich. "Respectable Avian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female lich trembled gently under the cheekbone, which is almost a smile: "You are always so flattering, gram Rimal," she said, while withdrawing her phalanx, she has determined that Cremaar's body is not a ghost, a spell or a magical appliance, and that she is sincere, perhaps this child has a little thought of herself. But time is tight – as Kremar said, they have tried various methods, and for the gray torrent, even if they only probe one or two, the result is that even the bones of each of them become dimmed – and The results measured by other casters are just empty, no wisdom, no memory, no sensible mouth, everything will be assimilated into it, even the earth will be eroded, and it It is not so much energy to devour it, but the most arrogant and undead person does not dare to claim that he is not afraid of it. When they watched it, they all feared to tremble. When they tried to contain or eliminate it, they could feel a guilty heart – as if something was irritated by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich comes in the night, the casters cast spells, make the thick The fog shrouded the coast, but the first thing they saw was not the clothes, the skeleton, the undead who jumped the fire of the soul in their eyes, but the endless bones – from tiny fish and shrimps, crabs, to sharks. Dolphins, whales, and sea monsters that people have only heard in legends... The bones of fish and shrimp are like white sand. The bones of whale sharks are like bricks, and the bones of sea monsters are just like fortresses and mountains. Fortunately, since the gray As the disaster comes, there are no more mortals living near the seawall, or it may be ushered in an unimaginable chaos.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardians of the New Cree Law did not think that the dragon came faster than the Lich<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These dragons seem to be driven by what they have, but they have no wisdom, but they have the instinct of beasts. They fly in the clouds and dive toward the only continent. I don’t know. Is it a malicious joke of fate, they actually encountered the Lich’s team in front of the white seawall, and the war broke out<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a horror, from the shout of the human wizard, Ai Stone, surrounded by a lich, burst into a dazzling light, and he couldn’t help but It fell a short distance in midair, but when there was more than a hundred feet from the ground, the transmission spell on his body was launched. Then he hit a transparent wall, a white dragon from the same color. The cloud swooped out and bite his cheekbones in one bite - if he still has a human body, he will be swallowed, but the benefits of the bone shelf are here, he did not care about his leg bones, but instead Using it as a casting material, a powerful attack spell broke out - the white dragon's mouth suddenly dripped, and the lich continued to fall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companions immediately wave their arms and wrap themselves in protective spells. Several wizards also cast spells. They still dare not approach the lich, but use It’s okay to have a spell delay his drop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elf reminded the tree to catch the bone shelf, and he trembled disgustingly while withdrawing the worm when he was sure that the guy could still move. The branch, he dared to swear with his own beliefs, he never thought that he would have one day to rescue an undead<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More dragons peep out from the clouds, their eyes are full of predator-like greed, dragon's acid, frozen breath and flame Brewed in the larynx, whether it is a living or not, all the casters are preparing to fight back, protect or escape, but with a few horrified sounds, they suddenly found that it has become a The chaotic wild magic zone - how is this possible? They can't help but look to the sky. Although it is overcast at this moment, the shining light of the magical star river will still not be completely obscured. They have sufficient magic and clear consciousness, that is, most of the spells cast out. Are wrong and failed<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead quickly discovered this, they no longer smashed their spells and magical instruments, scrolls, etc., for a time, hard to count, evil and The filthy but powerful spells unfold between the dragon and the lich. At this time, the other casters realize that a lich can be dangerous, not to say that no warlock and mage can compare with it, just from elsewhere. The casters, even if they do have awesome power, they are still inevitably imprisoned by the original way of thinking and established cognition, so that they always have some hands<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lichs have long been used to being unscrupulous<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A red dragon bends his neck from the beginning of his birth It was deprived of the wisdom of the original inheritance, but it still has the beast of the beast. It does not rush into the first wave of counterattacks like the other dragons, but circling in the clouds, staring nervously. On the battlefield, when a mage loses control because of the flame that broke out in his hand, when he fell from the air, it folded up the wings and rushed to the ground in a fall, accurately biting the mage - it bite tightly Tightly, the magical magical instrument on the mage is constantly broken in the light. He screams and tries to cast a spell, but the red dragon bites his right hand and the whole lower body. He can’t make a gesture at all. The spells on his body are all invalid, and the Red Dragon has increased its strength, looking forward to the delicious flesh and soul. When the power - an ice flow frozen in its wings and neck<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage looked at the white ice and squeaked up. He didn’t know where the strength and courage came from, and suddenly he was bitten. The arm was pulled out, accompanied by a lucky spell, and he fell out of the dragon's teeth. When he fell, he could see how the ice covered the red dragon's head and was frozen from both wings. At that time, the red dragon lost its ability to fly. At this time, nothing can save its life. It quickly passed over the mage's body and landed on the deserted land earlier. The lucky mage first fell on the red dragon. On the tip of the wing (his butt was almost torn into pieces), and then slipped from the huge membrane wing to the dragon's chest and neck, and finally fell in the head of the red dragon, he was shocked and dizzy. When you stop, it’s the red dragon that is full of resentment and surprised eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon Frost White, like every bone dragon in the past, has no mercy on his own relatives, or even if she does, she will not waste on this group of beasts that are no different from lizards, as a The semi-god lich turned to hold the bone dragon, her strength is far more than any dragon, even before the Greedy, before she failed to inherit the bequest of the dragon god Aio, Frost White also Not worthy of playing with her - her bones are entwined with iron-blue phosphorescence, which is the effect of Edel's protective spells, making her bones harder than steel, without flames, acid With the effect of freezing; her wings are unfolding in the air, although the film and muscles have long ceased to exist, but the light of the magic gem has long been intertwined with a dense fine net, with various magic attached to it, making her lighter than the birds. More agile, sharp wingtips can even be turned into sharp rifles during melee; as for magic, do you still have to say more? In addition to the magic of the dragon, Frost White can also use the Necromancer spell. To be correct, she may be better than any of the lichs present. The smog of her spit is mixed with death. Even white dragons that can immunize most of the frozen spells can't escape death when they are hit so badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of Frost White has eased the pressure on the casters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only that, but there is also an Edel on the frosty back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The casters at the beginning did not recognize Edel, but the cheers of the Lich immediately alerted them to some seniors. I heard about the name of the innocent king of the seventy-seven islands, and they immediately passed it on to the people next to them, lest the little guys who were ignorant of things make a rash thing. But even without them, no one will try to bother... Edelna’s battle, no one can help, interfere or stop a thousand years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Dragon is the first dragon to fall in the dust before Eddie and Frost White. At about the same time, a black dragon has followed its footsteps. It fell from the air, and the huge body was crushed to the two mage who had stopped at a hill and treated each other and waiting for the spell to recover. But before they understood what happened, its body turned into pieces. The dust has fallen on them. Apart from wolverines and coughs, they have not added more scars, and their lives are innocent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human Masters Landing, Edel's fearful light has a stronger impact on them than on the dragon. Where the bone dragons are, the dragons are slow to beat the wings. They want to turn around and escape, but they are facing each other. The ancient bone dragon and the demigod lich can only be a worse idea. Edell madly and arbitrarily pours spells on them. The monsters he summons chase the dragons, attacking their fragile wings and eyes, neck and other positions. , constantly there is a dragon photographed by the gems in his spine The soul, the body is muddy, and more dragons are tempted by his spells and begin to attack their companions - the lichs make a sharp whistling sound, cheering for the innocent kings of the seventy-seven islands, even if they are dead For a long time, but the heart that has already become dust seems to be fiercely provoked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edell's eight gems in the spine are frequently flashing, this is the demon god's liberty to release its power for thousands of years,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s a lich, or a mage, or a warlock, after a moment, he quits the battlefield silently. Edel needs no friends and no subordinates. With Frost White ruled the sky, the sea and the earth, the corpse that he evoked even replaced the wave, the cold horror breath filled every corner, the bodies of the dragons fell, just under the magic of the demon lich. That is to pull up, they do not avoid pain, nor fear of injury, they are even more dangerous and horrible than when they were born, and their souls are swallowed by Edelna and Frost White to supplement the magic of consumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know... our decision is right." Yadel muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if we - ignore it," Kerry said: "We still have to meet them, but at that time, they are our enemies. "At that time, they may have been bruised and bruised against the torrent of beasts and dragons, and they are dying." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead Only a few mortals know that it is not the spellcasters who want to hide, but this time let ordinary people know the existence of the lichs, except for causing unnecessary fear and noise. Kreima has already identified the location of these "elders" - the peak of the arrow, the once dragon's lair, the smoky, deserted, even the most stupid people know that there are rough rocks and There is nothing else outside the empty building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortals on the territory of Kremar are not allowed to know this, but they are still able to detect abnormalities from the increasingly scarce and frantic animals and plants. As time goes by, even the climate and soil become strange. ——The river is exhausted, the land is deserted, and there is no snowfall in winter. People can still argue that it was originally warm, but there is no hot sunshine in summer, no fog, only the chaotic sky, even the wind disappears, the waves are also ups and downs. It became very small, the catch was almost equal to none, and the migratory birds disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trend of crashing is unavoidable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are surprises to Cremaar, Yadel, Kerry Ben, and even the Lich, at the last moment, these ignorant mortals Not as crazy as they thought, they accepted the result almost calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We know that you have done a lot for us," an ordinary blacksmith said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They started the carnival and spent the last time between food and wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peak of the arrow, those For the giant tongue rock that the dragon stayed, now only the dust and the stagnant air, Edelna came over and stood beside Kremar, from which you can see the only green land that has not been swallowed up by gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way," Edell said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astral plane is There is no marginal space, when you stand in it, you can only see the silver sky. And each plane is suspended, like bubbles in the water, some bubbles are connected together, and can be connected to each other, while others cannot. But they don't always have nothing to do with each other. Maybe at some point, they will be connected and even merged for various reasons, and the most peculiar and elusive ones are...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You." Edell said: "You are from another unknown plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can open A huge astral channel," the Semi-God Lich explained: "Then, it is a big wish, pointing your soul to your homeland." He made a gesture: "All the casters will support you. The last moment - until you... find it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then, "Edell shrugged: "We may be able to find a place to live in you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just a place?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If not," Edell said: "That is the world dominated by humans and science, no gods, no devils, There is magic "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; a semi-divine science Lich say the word, really extremely weird. But the soul from the outside world can hardly notice this. Just when it thinks that it is about to end with the world, Edelna tells it, can it go home? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the echo, the visitors from the outside world glanced at each other, except for the boundless silver light, he only saw that all had been removed. Camouflage, showing a "root" shape of Edelna - the semi-god lich before the transformation, we must choose the part of the body that they left, mostly the skull, the soul gem is set in the alveolar, and some choose the arm With the palm of the hand, the soul gem is set in the phalanx joint, and Edell, the wicked lich who chose the spine before the transformation, makes him look like a snake's skeleton, and he did. Shamelessly disguised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry has also fallen asleep." Edell said sloppily. He looked around and flew over Kremar's arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only him who can stay awake in a monotonous, lengthy, unchanging channel, and Kreima and the stranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was, no, he was separated from the body of the lich, even Kremar felt strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the outer world, the foreigner is an ordinary human male, young, but thin, bright dark brown eyes and black short hair, easy to fit clothing The attitude is neither humble nor arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most feared by the caster when traveling in the astral world is the unpredictable storm and the reaper of the Chaos Sea, just mentioned in this incredible way. When they came out, people realized that the most terrible thing was the blind journey of missing the concept of time and space. The casters first let the mortals fall into a long sleep, then each other, the undead and Kerry Ben, Yadell. Strong existence persists for a long time, but they also lose consciousness one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they still wake up again? No one knows, just like a stranger who doesn’t know if he can really find the plane he lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He keeps moving forward, following the cry of the soul, I don’t know when, Edel, no longer speaks, he only talks to the witch, Craymar And later, Kreima was also silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only he is still moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally he thought he would have an illusion, but no, there was no illusion, no storm, no reaper, only silver and boundless silence, he thought I will be crazy, but there is no, he thinks, he will give up in the next moment, no, he is persistent and never stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The millennium from that plane has completely changed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finally saw the blue planet again, his mood was very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your plane." Krimari, who stood next to him, whispered softly: "How beautiful it is."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a bright halo, gray clouds, deep blue ocean, deep Green forest, yellow brown earth...his country, his city, his...home, time to dusk, parents are at home, an older woman, his sister, and her lover The kitchen is busy for dinner, and "he" is sleeping in his own small bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his body, the sudden change did not take it away, just took away the soul, and at this time, he loved and loved it. His family did not even find him different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The time flow rate of the plane is different." Edelna said: "Although I know, it is surprising that the ratio is so large."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How lucky." Crimdale said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, as long as he goes back, go back to the room and go back to his body...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "After all, it is impossible to be like the past." The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but it's hard to say that there will be too many exceptions." The lich said coldly: "Although power ultimately depends on the soul, but this plane For the caster, it is simply a barren desert, your strength will gradually weaken until it disappears, and we are – perhaps a little remaining may not allow us to continue to exist.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edell's soul jewels shimmer like shimmering light, and they seem to be insignificant in the silver light of the astral channel, but seem to be a sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volatility of life came from a burst, even if there was no sound, no vibration, and those who returned to it knew that it was his... his best friend, his His subordinates are waking up, they are loyal to him, believe him, and he has gone through the most difficult journey with him. Now, as long as he takes a step forward, the journey will come to an end, he can go home, and They can get a new place to live, just as Edelhad said, compared to the seven billion people on the planet, they are just a chestnut, and the casters' last spell reserves are enough to make them settle down. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are waiting, but...the soul of the outside world is just standing there, greedily staring at everything in front of us, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For what?" the lich asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot," the soul of the alien world replies: "But the most important thing is that you finally let me go back here."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich, Kremar suddenly showed a smile, his figure was blurred and solid in a moment - it was not an image that would make the soul of the outside world strange - - The god of the dragon, Ai, once appeared in front of him in that form, but this is not the god of the dragon. He is the real Ao, the god of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So why are you stopping?" Aiou asked: "This is not an illusion. You have indeed gone home, close at hand, at your fingertips." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I have been thinking." The soul of the outside world said: "When my friends are asleep, I am alone, in endless time." In addition to walking, I am only thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking is a good thing," Io said. "So what conclusion did you draw?" "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first thing I was just remembering," said the soul of the alien world: "Chaotic Sea, Azores, then Beitenburg, White Pagoda, Grey Ridge, Silver Crown Jungle, then Thunder Fort, Highland Norman... Longji Mountains, Far North Land... Longhuo Island, Grenada, Falun, Jade Forest Island... and none The bottom abyss, and the final gray torrent... When I think about the end, I feel that I am very lucky, no, fortunately this adjective is too understatement, even if I say that I am the son of heaven. Not too "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; he will hands folded together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, I met Crimal. Of course, for him, this is unfortunate. At that time, I was not only stupid, innocent, but also stubborn. Because of my behavior, he was forced to be in a very awkward position - but in any case, without him, I could not stand in a strange and dangerous place, but only a foothold, this is not enough, let alone he It’s a stubborn person, and it’s in danger.” When the name was mentioned, the voice of the soul of the outside world became softer: “So we met Kerry Ben.” He shook his head: “If there is no Kerry, we want to To stay in the Grey Ridge, even if it is temporary, it will be very difficult. After all, our body is filled with the blood of the descendants of the Red Dragon, an evil seed derived from blood and deception, even if it is a relative, Aya When the elf took back her mother's relics, she even wanted to kill me... killing Kremar. If I met an Eya spirit at the time, no, even another keen and sophisticated Singh elf, For example, Perant, It will be very different.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but we are dealing with Kerry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he was silent for a while, and a gentle smile appeared on his lips: "It was a beautiful and short time, Io, until the White Tower riots, Fenway betrayed, Illah died, Yadel was expelled, Ann芮 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德 德At the time, the name was still far away from me, and I was very happy to meet new friends, Baldwin - you know, there is a famous poet in China, and one of his well-known poems is that if only life is seen at first - - I wish he could stay at the moment we first saw it. At that time, he was a good man, Byrdwin, he was not only a mortal, but also a low-ranking soldier who was not even surnamed. Orion-born soldiers, maybe he There are many reasons for being chosen as the successor of Don Clay, but he really does not have a flaw. His surname and responsibilities.” Speaking, the soul of the outside world reveals a stunned color: “If he did not return to the Norman king, it would be fine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Baldwin may be able to sneak in the battlefield, but there is no war in the battlefield, but in Wangdu, he is only a poor loser. People are flattering and secretly despising, even he is regarded as a friend. The king, who is the master, was furious when he heard that he was admired by Princess Leona. Hey, if Birdwin is really a Don Cray, or even a knight with a bloody origin, the king probably won’t be so angry. - After all, the civilians are almost the same as the animals for the nobility. Byrd is at best a big dog, a strong horse, and when it can be driven, the owner doesn't mind giving it. Feed, dress it up, but if the dog and the horse actually climbed into the chair, and he ate on a plate and slept on a bed, it was only the skin that was beheaded. He paused: "Maybe, from that time, Baldwin, who realized this, has changed." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to have forgotten a friend. Io reminded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glan is also a pawn," the soul of the alien world asked: "Not every thief is the son of the thief's god, nor is every thief ever met by me... although he probably doesn't both I want to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all," Io said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the runeboard is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiou smiles slightly: "There is a technique to reapply." It’s not new, it’s useful,” he asked curiously. “Why don’t you be attracted? People always want strength, because that means he can not only dominate his own destiny, but also dominate the fate of others” Like Gredi, her request is very simple, and her descendants. Is Grenada not good? You know very well, you are only a stone's throw from the throne, let alone the king of the red dragon. Is there a way for his sons to stop you and Kremar?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Long Fire Island, it’s already yours, but you gave it to you again. Devin, and the people of Beitburg, afterwards, are as easy as giving a handful of sand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared to Falun "The soul of the opposite world calmly said: "I have also been the master of Fallon, although it has already been torn apart, but if I promised the dragon Io, then I can control the group. For the dragons, even if they have lost their wisdom, even Grenada can't stand their attacks. If they want, I can even become the ruler of the entire main material plane."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He promises to give you more than just the power of a mortal," Io said. "Child, you are only one step away from the throne."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is him, and it is your wish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No way," Io can be said to be kindly : "You are so weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world agrees with the head: "Yes, yes, Io, I really think more than many people think. I have to be much weaker. I don’t think that there is no greed for power. I just fear everything that is unknown, including power. It is not in my cognitive range, and when I really touch it. At the time, I began to fear being distorted and changed by it - because in this world, I didn’t even have a body. Some of them are only 'I'. Just like when I refused Krimaar, as I said, maybe according to his words, I can be a king or a powerful mage, but then what? 'I' has disappeared. As for who it is, how great he is, or evil, has nothing to do with me, even though I don't remember who I am at that time, where it belongs."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You could have belonged to me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world has lowered his eyes. When he did this, he finally had a shadow of the past - he feared change, but also clearly It is impossible to know that it is impossible to change. He spent nearly a thousand years in that world, and he is here, but for decades.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What am I? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Key, index, gene, that's about it." Io said. "In fact, a long time ago - when the gods were still ignorant, our planes were overlapping, and the overlapping parts were minimal. Only a few hundred people came to my plane. They are ignorant and ignorant, but they are such ignorance and ignorance that they have a firm belief. The panic that comes to a strange place makes them more religious. In this way, under the call of faith, their gods I was amazed at the fact that my position was revived - this is the first time I saw the power of 'belief'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not seen the relevant records. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Their arrogance led to their demise, almost for a moment. Io said: "And I almost forgot them - until I suddenly realized that I am not forever." Although at the beginning, I thought that I was like a giant tree, rooted in the earth, leaves the sun to the sun, divided the branches, the branches bloomed with flowers and bear fruit, but as time passed, I found the facts Not so - it is not reproduction, it is division, it is cutting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incomplete is always a need to make up, I can choose - to devour everything, to go back to chaos, or to abandon myself, and the law in the dark Merging, but as you have feared, if I choose to merge with the law, is that still me? No, that is not me. So I found you and chose you. Ai sighed: "I made a mistake, there are many things, and I can see the ending from the earliest details." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
