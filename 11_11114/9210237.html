			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put a chapter of theft...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be doubts about life, in this civilian only two peas per day still have to be To this end, I am grateful to the age of God, how do people get and save ice? In fact, this can only be said that people who have no power and no power can never imagine what kind of enjoyment and privileges the superiors have. As early as Rome in the Claude era (yes, the early childhood of Spero), the Romans learned to transport horses and slaves from the Mount Etna in Sicily to the snow on the top of the mountain, in the hot summer days. Adding a large piece of crystal ice and snow to the wine is undoubtedly a beautiful and extravagant thing like the gods. What's more, it is covered with snow and ice to make a white bed, and the bed is full of fresh and perishable Fish and shells - Seneca's philosopher Seneca once ridiculed that the Romans wanted to put the hot soup on ice and snow. Of course, under the circumstances, the slave was full of sympathy and understanding. The old man will not be liked by people. He was exiled to Corsica by Emperor Claudius. He was recalled to Rome by the infamous Queen Agrippina, the fourth wife of the emperor. As the tutor of Emperor Nero, who was only twelve years old, and then at the age of 69, he was told by the emperor's centurion that he was hoping that you would die because of the tyranny against Nero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julio read Seneca’s work under the guidance of Bishop Bicroi, and it must be said that this is a respectable and respectable Scholars, his peace, tolerance, seriousness and discretion are like gold flowing in the ranks of Greek and Roman letters (Latin). Anyone who reads his article will find it beneficial, but Julio dares to face it. His mother’s grave swears that in these words, what impressed people the most will not be his "Troy Women", nor will he be the "Roman Book of the Romans" dictated by his dying moment. It will only be described in detail. The way the Romans used to clean their buttocks - "In the Greco-Roman era, people used a sponge fixed on the branches to clean their buttocks after defecation. After cleaning, the sponge was soaked in a salt water or vinegar. In the bucket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Medici has always recalled that it has found that his thinking has spread to an incredible point - and this time, installed in a huge Silver The drink in the room has been sent to him. The cup has a thin mist. The silver cup has two cup ears that can be held. There is no decoration on the wall, but there is a rumor: "Humble, be your own servant; It is better to pretend to be noble and to lack food." Means that a person is willing to stay away from the appearance of vanity and frivolity, constantly introspect, review himself, and be a "servant of his own" so that he can complete his work and eat more than he can. Those who are arrogant and ridiculous, and who are disgusted by people, so that their hands are empty and arrogant - just in the cup of luxury drinks, this sentence is full of indescribable irony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Bicroimini saw the weight of the cup, his eyebrows wrinkled, just because it was a flattering for him, and Julio’s obvious Expected, he still held his lips and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julio took a heavy silver spoon and couldn’t wait to take a big sip—and then he froze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Bicroiini put down the bread and looked at his ward with suspicion. This expression is not so much because it tastes sweet and delicious. It’s ecstatic, and, just for a moment, the nose of Little Medici, the eyes are subtly red, and the eyes are more radiant - the bishop is very clear, Julio is not the kind of favorite from the baby The yelling child can make him cry less, and he rarely remembers it. Is it the assassin of the Pach family or Pope Siscott IV who followed them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bishop was preparing to get the herb, Julio finally lifted a hand to stop him, and it would be a funny The wind wave disappeared before the formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it’s too horrible?" the bishop asked strangely, and it is reasonable to say that the church in the small town of Spello should not go to a piccolo Especially this food is still his deliberate. He pulled the cup and took a sip from it and put it in his mouth. Except for a little cold, this food should say that there is nothing to be picky. There are not only the snow and ice of the bishop, goat's milk, almonds and honey, but also ginger, cinnamon, medlar, rosemary and nutmeg – the chef who fills the chef may crush all their spices and put it thick. Thick is like the soil under the snow, the guarantee is full of aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julio watched Bishop Piccoloni pass the cup to other people, and every monk present took a sip, many of whom nodded praise - But, Bishop! Here are the cheeses that are full of locusts, the semi-corrosive dry meat and the stinky fish that can be eaten by the heavy-smelling people. They think that the delicious things may not be suitable for a child who is only six years old and has a sensitive taste... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter’s face is lifeless<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the tough soul from hundreds of years is inevitably stunned by this cup of spice, Bishop Piccolomini took him to the room next door to rest, and at night he only let him eat a soft white bread, drank some beer, and saved his ninth hour of prayer and night. Prayer (Note 1), but there is no exemption from bedtime prayer and night prayerDuring the evening prayer to the pre-sleeping prayer, Julio saw the shadow of the fire on his window. Out of an adult curiosity, he stepped on a Roman-style box and pushed open the small window. Look downHe first smelled the strong smell of oil and turpent, and then saw the shadow of the fire and the candle on the building. If the person who saw this picture was indeed a six-year-old child, he would have a nightmare.But Julio just widened his eyes and looked at the people who were holding the torches, the candlesticks walking on the edge of the street or staying. They used flowers, petals and flowers for the group, the baskets and skirts, even the sweet and sweet atmosphere. Julio can also clearly see the windows on the three-story building. On the light gray streets, some people use white scorpions to outline them. Some people don’t use them. They sprinkle the same color petals in one place and then lie on the ground. Aggregate them into the desired shape by hand<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of work is said to last for three days until the parade of the Eucharistic Church is over, and the clergy and entourage who preside over the ceremony will step on the petals and flowers. Walking on, not contaminated with the filth of the world, like an angel walking on the clouds - the people who lay the blankets work hard and hard like bees, with excitement on their faces, and happiness in their eyes The fascinating, complex, beautiful and realistic pictures were born under their hands. This scene is undoubtedly quite attractive. Julio didn't just sneak out of the box like a snake until he heard the sound of the door being pushed away. Sliding into your bed<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little trick is useless for Bishop Piccolo, who used to be a strict manager in college. He used Giulio. The lighter footsteps went to the bed and touched the child's feet. The soles of the feet were obviously colder than the ankles. This indicates that he was still standing in a place where it was easy to make the feet cold. Not long after the bishop looked around. Around him, his eyes quickly stayed on the Roman box under the window. This Roman-style rectangular box used a lot of iron pieces to avoid wear and can be fixed on the horseback and under the carriage. Of course, the latter also When it comes to the decoration, especially on the lid of the box, the metal part with the pull ring is even more than the color of the wood part.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what surprised Julio was that the bishop did not blame him as much as he used to.What he did not think was that Bishop Bicroimini had been as harsh as it was before, because a smart child was more susceptible to the devil's jealousy and temptation, just as he used to be in his father's court, in a Roman university. Seen in the awkward church, dull people may have the opportunity to reach out and save, but a wise man is more secretive than others when he slips down the abyss. Hey, he has seen no more than twelve Young people who had a bright future had gone astray. They not only destroyed themselves, but also affected their relatives and family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if he is born spiritual, then the bishop does not have to worry that he will be enchanted by the glory and glory of the world, just like the young At that time, he was not only an unruly slut, but also the leader of the children of merchants and officials, like him, who had nothing to do all the time, except for drinking wine, competition, hunting, and squatting in the arms of the shackles; After a serious illness that almost killed him, he joined the army of Assisi against Perugia's aggression and made a 12-month prisoner of war in Perugia until he was redeemed by his father.Even so, he did not wake up in time and repented, but after five years, on the way to another battlefield, he heard the loud voice of God.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the Holy Spirit is watching them, Bishop Piccolo is also in the birthplace of St. Francis, salvation and perceptual death and eternity The land was led into spiritual joy, and he firmly believed that Julio di Giuliano de Medici, even young, was destined to travel farther than he was on the way to see Jesus.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning of the next day, the people of Spello Busy, although in the hundreds of years, now it is only around 4 in the morning, monks, priests, priests and bishops have done morning prayers, and follow-up prayers, singing hymns, Julio saw a few Dressed in monk costumes, but with worldly hair and beards, their bare feet are extraordinarily fair and plump, and they seem to know that they are not often exposed to sunlight and dust, from Santa Maria. In the soft whispers of the priests of the Church of the Maggiore, Little Medici knew that they were all nobles of Spello, just as the parents of Medici could receive the first sacred body, and they were also qualified to wear the linen of the monks. Robe, tied to the rope of the belt, barefoot behind the priest's team<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
