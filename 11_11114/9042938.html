Then she followed: "Don't worry, this is not my stolen or robbed. My father got a slave of a half-elf before. This is the amulet left by her elf mother. Of course, I don't think it has anything." Function, but as long as she is an elf, she can recognize the mystery - I have been serving her for a while, she can't get out of the room, so I gave it to me - maybe she thought I could leave the East Crown, And this led her to the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To welcome us The guest, our lord sent her to the mourning wilderness very generously, oh, maybe no, I don’t know anything about the Master, but the sorcerer around our father is the female caster who likes to wear a red robe. , once showed me a jewel, she was detained according to her soul, and her body After being burned to ash, it is mixed into the coral base and sinks into the sea floor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada gently pinches the string of tassels that feel smooth and silky, no wonder It didn't attract the attention of others. It was almost as thin as a finger, and it was no longer than a middle finger. It was fixed with a thin ebony tube. It was not seen in the black hair. Dada was not a caster. He can't feel the magic fluctuations above, but it shouldn't. Every foreign slave will go through a dozen times of "cleansing". Their thoughts may end up being as plain as their bodies. Drake's Master The Master with the Lord will take away anything that has magical fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold this," Ji Er: "Hold this to find those people, tell them how the people have been tortured, and then..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is dead." Dada, he crouched on the floor, jaw tightened Taking advantage of the cold ground: "My sister gave this to me. I don't know what to do, respected adults, but I think you will want to know the whereabouts of a tribe."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
