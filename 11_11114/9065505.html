			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slaves ringed the bronze bell, and the huge roar blocked everyone’s ears—they shouted, laughed, and even Said to have forgotten everything - the Lord looked at the warlock's incarnation of the giant lizard swaying his head, throwing the wicked thief to the hard ground, the sharp front paws immediately followed, one paw holding the black hair caster The skull, while the other paw pierced his abdomen, the next step was to tear him in half, his face uncontrollably revealing a happy smile, as if in a vast column hall a few months ago. It was not his wife but his enemies that gave him a generous gift to the caster. He felt dry and grabbed a silver cup and had a 12-year-old girl’s skull. The cup made a swallow of honey, and he was too anxious. The cold honey spilled from his lips and flowed into his beard and chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to see it again? My respectable master," his eunuch asked: "Can it be over?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "End," the lord of the East Crown replied loudly, and the person who was pressed under the paw by the giant lizard did save him some trouble and might still give him Bringing nearly 3,000 well-trained soldiers, now he feels that giving him a quick death is not necessarily impossible: "End, tell Naga, tear him apart, throw his bones into the sea, with the slaves. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant was squatting on the ground, waiting for his master to step back on his back on the back, he hit a secret silver Hey, hey is a strange instrument from Serris. The unique thing is that it sounds extraordinarily long and delicate. The huge lizard listens. She knows that she should end her battle with the black hair caster. But she did not immediately crush the people under the claws as the lord hoped, but looked down like a real creature to sniff  stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is she doing?" The lord said uncomfortably: "Do she want to eat him?" The owner of the East Crown exaggeratedly swayed his nose. If this is the case, I can't let her be my wife. I don't want my son's mother to be a person with the same hobbies as slaves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "It shouldn't be," said the eunuch. "Ms. Naga has pure and noble bloodlines and good education. The human flesh is very dirty. Especially men, she won't like that."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha." The lord slammed the chest and grabbed the chest: "Noble bloodline? The gods are on, she is not even a human! Her body is filled with dragon's blood, those evil Four-legged reptile..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If placed before. Even the eunuch will have to risk the danger of being thrown away by the owner and try to cover up this topic, but somehow, he said nothing today, just quietly listening to the lord constantly pouring crazy and stupid. Discourse, his eyes are very gentle. With a bit of pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you will still make her the mother of your son." Finally the eunuch said, and let her son become your heir, this sentence he did not Say it, but he knows that the lord can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord sighed long: "This is nothing to do," he complained. "Since I refused the priest of Gredi in my Lord." On the island, the temple of Gredith was built, and the bottomless abyss was below. They should know that there have been no more temples on the Longhuo Island for hundreds of years, and what can they do when they built the temple? The liberty of the people is poor, and the slaves, they do not even belong to themselves, how can they have faith? And if I allow Gredi to build a temple on my island, then Talos, Rosada? , Tyre, Fro... Wait, Fro may be, okay, don't look at me with this kind of eyes. My brother, I am just joking - I have promised that they can be like the priest of Talos I got a separate island and built the temple of their goddess on the island. I was responsible for all the expenses and manpower. But what? You know, they are so stubborn - so I can only let a belief in Grey The warlock became the mother of my son, God, there was a big headache that was enough for me before, and maybe there will be another one... my head will burst, you think. How big is a son? May inherit his mother's talent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great," said the eunuch, his attitude was very gracious, but what he said was not what the lord wanted to hear. He put the silver cup on the eunuch, but fortunately there is not much alcohol in it: "You old dog," the lord scolded intimately: "You know what to do."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt," said the eunuch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are my most trusted person," the lord lowered his voice: "I love you more than my son, you are going to enter with me." The grave. Brother, I remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second time he mentioned the ironic name of the brother, the sergeant knows that this is because he is You have to do an extremely dangerous thing yourself, for example, let the warlock who is smelling the black hair caster lose the ability to be a mother - no need to speculate, he also knows that this kind of sinister means is discovered by Naga. He may not be able to keep his soul, but he also knows that this is a must for the lord. The owner of the East Crown cherishes the authority of his own hands. For this, he can even hope that those are long. The sons of big adults kill each other and die. How can he endure a woman who has a temple behind her to become his son's mother? Maybe a son will be killed by a poisonous snake when he is born, or inexplicably drowned. In your own bath . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he couldn't kill Naga. Naga was a sharp-cut priest who had pierced the crown of the crown. She made every breath of the lord sore, but once he pulled out the knife. His blood will spew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eunuch thinks this way, ignoring the hatred and contempt of the heart, kissing the lord’s feet with a touch of 120,000 points, and the lord will continue in him. When I kissed, I retracted my foot and frowned. "What happened to you to see Naga?" The lord said, "It has been a long time, but Beavis' disciple seems to be alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant raised his body and looked at the place covered by the meager smog. The body of the giant lizard was too big, and the head of the black stalker was completely covered by a single skull. Below, they can't see anything, but there are already slaves in the drive of the master to investigate, the precious Mithril hourglass is still flowing, not sure if Cremari is really dead, how are their bets? Can it fall into the hands of the last winner? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very optimistic about your new owner." Amos absently touched the jewel on the belt: "If he can hold on for a while, then I will get a lot of money, I think I have to thank you. Dada, if it weren't for you, I probably wouldn't expect him to suffer enough." He grumbled the Dada on the ground. On the finger, "Maybe you have to look at another person. Our lovely little sister Jier? I really want to hear her voice again, guess who she will curse at the last moment? Are you still me? You may not I know, although you lost because of her...the original position," he almost spoke with his throat instead of his tongue: "But she originally found me, she hopes that I can take her away. But I refuse So, she will find you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada’s expression made him feel satisfied, he really liked this expression, he wanted to please The wizard casts a spell and solidifies the expression. He can use it as an ornament and put it on his Hall or bedroom, so he could see it anytime, anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your smell..." The giant lizard said that it/she is using In lingua franca, the syllables that can be made with the tongue of a lizard's tongue hair are quite difficult. It sounds even more chaotic, like a person talking underwater, with a strong voice and echo, but the black hair caster can still understand the meaning: "You," Naga hesitated, I couldn't help but find out the scarlet tongue—the smell was not very clear when Kremar was scratched by it, but now it has a foot that is more than a foot long and pierces the caster's abdomen. The hot blood spurted out from the claws, and the scent suddenly became extremely rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have the blood of the dragon." Naga said, "And..." She lowered her head and slightly moved her paws, and the tongue swept past the wound in the abdomen. But her other paw was still vigilantly pressing the head of the caster, so he couldn't see or hear it very clearly. "It's too strange," she said, with unquestionable confusion in her tone: "Your blood It’s so thick, even more than me – I should have felt it when you set foot on the Dragon Fire Island. But I really don’t realize it – are you a dragon? It’s a mother. Or father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is in your blood?" She asked: "I can taste it," the giant lizard has no eyelids in the huge eyes. The eye sockets are rolling. "Your blood... No, not just elves... there are fewer... human blood, but it is full of life, more than all humans or dragons... powerful What did you do? My people? Say the name of your father or mother, maybe I can spare you not to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster did not answer, witch The demon knows that this is just a fake of Naga, and there is no roll between the Dragon Warlocks, or They are even more cruel to the people with the same blood. It is commonplace for a warlock to kill another warlock or even to bury his soul in a gem. The currency that is common in the bottomless abyss is commonplace. Naga is being hidden in his blood. The power temptation, unfortunately, she is not the strongest, which makes her have to consider whether this delicious food will be taken away by other warlocks, even she will be injured and killed in the battle, so the best way is Grab the most essential part of the swallow before anyone else notices - perhaps her understanding is wrong, perhaps retaining him to get more benefits, but then how, who cares about a dead person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant lizard lowered his head again, and rolled the tongue into a bundle, forming a hollow tube that was inserted into the warm belly of Kremar, with abundant blood and internal organs. It slammed into her throat, too little. For her current body shape, the amount of these liquids was like a drop of dew when she was still human, but the dew was so hot, and Naga stretched comfortably. Tail, she likes this, every warlock with a dragon's blood is like a hot climate and hot food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slave carefully grabbed the rope and hung it down until he was only ten feet from the back of the lizard. What he just wanted to do, the lizard When he jerked back, he bit him into two pieces and swallowed his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evil..." The Lord yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant lizard is like hearing his complaints. The cold and ruthless yellow eyes turn to the human male sitting in the most distinguished position. When it stands upright, the triangular head can already exceed the original hall. On the ground, the mage around the lord suddenly changed his face. He could say that he tried his best to pluck the brooch to the ground, the jewel smashed, and the rune engraved on the pedestal immediately launched for him and the lord and the big neighbor. The eunuch escaped the fatal blow of the giant lizard - the green acid splattered the ground covering nearly 30 feet square, and the alabaster made a squeaking sound in the acid, and it disappeared in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord gave a screaming scream, and he couldn’t even make any orders at any time. His mage rushed over, grabbed him, and ripped a reel. The eunuch has also succumbed to the lord's feet agilely, and stabbed her when a panicked female slave wants to lean over. He knows that some of the transmission spells are weight-restricted, and he does not dare to let the last moment The lord perceives his existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of the Lord has prepared for the transfer, but the scroll just flashed a white light and landed on the ground like an ordinary parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master took out a rune seal and the result was the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sinks his heart and looks at his colleagues and finds that the latter also has an abandoned scroll at the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hall is in chaos, hidden in the dark and towering ridge shadow In the middle, the real black hair caster is taking the bone whistle that is open on the lips. This is Ruiyite. As for why it is in the hands of Kremar, the hand of the Master is a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You go to that...the alien soul doesn’t know how to describe it, because the thing that is being smashed by the giant lizard is that they are pre-emptive from the lord. A peeled deer that was stolen from the kitchen, that thing, he finally had to say that, what was inside the thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Our blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Our blood is not going to make her crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-And there are secret drugs. The Lich said that for the time being, I have no way to lift its negative effects, but it can still be done with a little flexibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
