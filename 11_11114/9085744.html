Hey,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Rosadada, the priests of Ilmot and Sulun are already paying attention to this matter, and followers of Jammu and Gulaba are observing soil and crops, just "<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just that some people don't feel that a plant can create a danger they can't imagine," said the king of the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Perant said that human beings are extremely proud and inferior creatures, as an elf, despite the efforts of Alva Master and others. Help, he still does not get much trust. Some people even joked about the tension of the elves with the "devil finger", thinking that this time is just another fuss of the elves. It is true that this plant is not as toxic as aconite and mandala, and even some pastors and mages have been taking this drug for a long time, believing it can soothe nerves, enhance the senses, and speed up their meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of casters who are willing to be invited by the Archbishop of Bismuth and the Master of Alva, probably only the priest of Ilmot is the most sober. As followers of the gods who voluntarily shoulder the pain and catastrophe of the entire plane, they are more patience and identification than anyone else. Ilmot does not force human beings to live in pain, but to escape by paralysis. Instead of solving and acting, it is the priests of Ilmot who are not in favor of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else" Ingway was keenly aware of Perant’s words and stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant closed his eyes slightly: "The followers of Ilmot may take some drastic measures."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"安芮."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the ruler of the White Tower and the Hill." Perant said: "Even She is not a real power in the true sense, but if only her child is left, Luther’s Grand Duke Luzer will appoint a person as the guardian of the child. The greatest possibility is himself, if the ampoule The child died. Then he can take back the white tower and the hill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grenada's red robe will block all want to be safe "Unfavorable people." King of the jungle said: "So, Perant, tell me. Why don't you frown?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just missing Ann's mother." Perant said that at that time she put Ahn's little hand in his palm. He still remembers that soft, slender, like the claws of a kitten. At that time, the ampoule was still so small, and the small one could be hidden in the flowerbed of the rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Keep your pity and apology," Ingwell said indifferently: "That's not your fault, don't forget that human beings belong to humans. Elf It belongs to the elf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are correct," Perant said. He understands that Anzhen has never received a day when he has the blood of the elf. Education, her soul is human, after so many things, this is the only thing he can be sure of: "And Kerry this book"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "How," King of the jungle walked over to the table and opened a scroll: "He just gave me a letter a few days ago, and the next year's Angris Festival may be in the north. The sea has passed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little bit of a slap in the face of his own king actually buried the letter of Kerry, Perant could not help but really anxious:" I think I should have a short holiday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course you can have a holiday." King of the jungle said: "My friend, I haven’t had a break for three hundred years, but I don’t think you want to go out with Ruiwen. At least not at this time, what do you want to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to Kerry Ben," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of the jungle glanced at him curiously, "persuade him to come back to us"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Perant did not respectfully give his own king a blank eye: "Let him leave his friend, and the little chicken is not easy. I want to go with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a powerful druid," said the King of the jungle. "But that is dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I haven’t danced with the swords and arrows for a long time,” Perant said. “Every night I can still hear the blood that I’m eager to fight in my body.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the jungle looked up at him, and Perant was only born a hundred years later than him, and traveled abroad for nearly three hundred years. After returning to the Silver Crown jungle, he became his bodyguard, the catastrophe a thousand years ago. Ingwi not only lost his wife, but also lost his guards in battle with a Kahu luxury priest. Perant was seriously injured. After nearly 50 years of dormancy, he barely improved. From then on, he had to dismiss the position of chief of guards and became the manager of Gray Ridge, doing some simple and peaceful paperwork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His power may not be comparable to the king of the jungle, Ingwei, but the skills and experience of fighting are not inferior to his king, and he also loves Kerry Ben, the only descendant of the King of the jungle. Almost grown up on his back and shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then go," said the king of the jungle. He pushed the scroll open, stood up, walked over to Perant, and took off his collar. At the same time, it is also a rune seal with powerful guardian magic. Don't be on Perant's neckline. "My friend, telling Kerry Ben, I am waiting for him to come back in the silver crown jungle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How does this child do?" At about the same time, in the hall of the side island, some people have similar troubles with Perant, although this child is not his own, nor is it He is a loyal person, but he has the identity of a heir to the lord. If Anzhen is dead, then he is the heir to the White Tower and the Hill. There are hills, plains, rivers, roads and cities. The soil is fertile and densely populated. It is a good place for any ruler to give up. Think of Luther's Luzer, his Principality is also a good place with a vast area, otherwise he will not be able to support enough highland. Norman’s Pharaoh’s warriors and knights But he still Baita hill partridge brood with a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Luzer knows he is here, he has the right to ask for this child." Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he doesn't know," Liona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we can get the treasure of that one," Birdwin said vaguely: "Then we may not need this help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have given Amway my promise," Leona said softly, and she let the child sit on her knee. Holding his little hand in both hands: "Although I am still only Leona, not the king of Norman in the Highlands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did not let you violate the promise "Bedwin hurriedly said: "I am just worried that we have no way to protect him because we will leave soon. And it is impossible to bring him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have thought of a way," Leona looked down at An Zhen's son. He just raised his head, like a blue sky, clearly reflecting the face of the king: "We can try," she pinched the child's finger: "He will be protected."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope so," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei was very surprised when she saw Leona in her room. The girl dressed herself as a man, her red hair was very much in the Longhuo Islands. Rare, so she imitated the pirates wrapped in dark red silk satin heads, wearing leather, tights and boots. Hanging daggers and short knives, almost no difference from a real man except that it is "sturdy". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An apprentice gave them wine and food. When Leona stared at her, the little girl’s face was a little white and some men were bad. Despicable hobbies, even if they follow the doctrine, they will become the priests of Fro, but if their mentor accepts expensive gifts, they sometimes pray for their grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't stare at her like this." Plum leaned on a low-lying couch filled with goose down pillows and licked a grape into the mouth. Here, the grapes at this time are no longer so full and juicy, but they are sweeter than before: "You don't like this type." She swayed her wrist. The apprentice retired as if he had been stunned and left the room to Mei Mei and her guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want me to do?" Mei Mi said: "My Highness, but I have to declare in advance. No matter what I am, is it?" I can do it, I will not refund your gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room that wants to enter Pastor Froc can of course not be empty, especially the management of plum or temple In theory, the one most favored by Fro, Leona took out an amber amulet, the base of pure gold, surrounded by emeralds and red tourmalines, even if it is not magical equipment, it is enough for "he" to enjoy I enjoyed the hospitality of Pastor Froe all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are many children in your temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our apprentice," Mei Mi Tilting your toes. Let the left and right feet of the big feet rub each other, "What's the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are they from?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei glanced at Leona with a glance: "Some are her mother's children." Like Mei Mei and her mother, Pastor Fro will use herbal contraception. But when there are mistakes, if it is a boy, it will be handed over to the father or abandoned. If it is a girl, it is a born Fro priest. They are both the mother's child and the mother's apprentice. Mei Mi recruits Fro's wild priest. At the time, there were two pastors with their daughters. "There are some that are bought from merchants, which is much better than being a slave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So how about buying one more," Leona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him be your apprentice," Liona said: " Of course, it is temporary, let him be by your side, for this I will"" She looked at the room, "sufficient to cover the gold coins in this room, how do you see"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He" Mei Mi was not stunned by the gold coins that could fill a room, she jumped from the low couch: "He, a boy"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A boy." Leona smiled and said, "But it is very cute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If found," Mei Mi said: I will be accused of being a god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who will accuse you of who will judge you?" Leona said: "After we left, the people who manage here are Yadel and the Cavaliers repaired, and they knew about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let the child go to them, Rosada should be more than Fro Need a boy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp; "No, if someone wants to find his whereabouts first, the first one is the Cavaliers and Yadel." Leona said: "But no one will notice a Fro's pastor apprentice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I may not protect him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will ask the Master to copy the scroll for you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mi shook his head: "He will regard this as a shame for life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I think you still have this right as the chief pastor of this temple," Leona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, if you insist, but if so, I need someone in my room," Gülen is also in the team to the North Sea, he After leaving, Mei Mi’s room may have been empty for a long time, and during this time, there will be more eyes than the little wife watching her, but to be honest, Mei Mi is really not interested in dealing with Ge Men outside Lan, "Yalale, repair, or anyone you think you can trust, let them bring gold and gems, so things will be safer."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
