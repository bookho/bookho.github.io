			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill’s grasping Fenway’s fingers is as cautious as picking up a chick that has been wet with feathers by rain, slowly and resolutely bringing the mage Pull out the closed, suffocating space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master’s sight fell on her body, his eyes were slightly enlarged, and Ilva had replaced the convenient but slightly tough attire. Dressed in an emerald silk robes that are straight to the ankles, the moonlight-like hair is free and brightly draped over the rounded shoulders. Only two strands of braided hair are made of long hair with a finger and a pearl The opal, her feet, with mysterious silver powder on her instep depicting curly tentacles and stretched leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You finally saw me, huh?" Il said, with a bit of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been watching you," Fenway said. "But your beauty will always surprise me." From the first time, like today, She swung from the vines with a light landing, a flower, a leaf, a little starlight, until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your lips are the most exciting place for me," Il said, "maybe you have a busy one under your tongue." The hive, which produces both honey and spit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you get from me is always honey." Fenway guarantees . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So let me at least taste it." Il said, grabbed the front of the robe and pulled the stubborn guy closer, their double The lips touched gently, and the tongue tentatively slid across the other's teeth, danced together, separated, connected together, giving a slight snoring, and I'm satisfied with the inhalation, Fenway lowered his head and licked the water. Passing through the long hairpins dotted with pearls and the skin with the aroma of maple, briefly sucking on the lover's earlobe, then continuing to climb up along the soft and resilient ear, eventually staying at the sensitive tip of the ear, his The tip of the tongue depicts its outline, almost laughing for those soft hairs, it trembles, and quickly becomes hot and even hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Il妲 whispered in his ear the poems about love of the elves, Fenway can understand, but he does not want to understand, because those symbols are eternal The words with forever are just a mockery and ridicule for him, and each time it is like a sharp knife inserted into his abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only love in my life," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Il妲 smiled at his needle, and she licked his throat, biting the raised core with love. Her fingers changed across his shoulders, inserted into his short hair, and licked the rough hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My love." She whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf stepped back, pulling all of Fenway’s attention, her eyes shining in the dark blue sky, she raised her arm and pulled The robes and the body under the robes are perfect, and the skin is as clean as the alabaster. Fenway remembers that when she saw this wonderful scene last time, there was a small wound left in the battle on her waist. Now they have healed. Without leaving a trace, he stretched out his hand in an uncontrollably way, touching the place that had been covered by the red scar of the squid - Fenway was not easy to make when Ill held his collar and untied it. The person perceives and flinches. He knows what his body is like. It is the most intuitive phase of the body that he caressed. It is gray, dark, wrinkled, ribs protruding, and the stomach is hanging under the dry chest. The bones at the knees almost smash through the skin, and it looks like a gray robes that are immersed in negative energy and shackles all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He barely noticed that Ilva’s fingertips were crossing his neck, and he was once again pulled into a sweet and warm whirlpool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissing, honing, caressing, occasionally whispering whispers that they themselves can’t figure out, Fenway’s palm gently lifts up Illu’s smooth Full of double hips, and her hands grasped him like a hip covered with only one layer of skin, and quickly became a more powerful mutual crush, they overlap tightly, like two The tablets are suitable for leaves that have not been worn, breathing lightly over moist skin, while the tip of the tongue is busy pushing tightly sensitive mucous membranes and muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Ilva wanted to go further, Fenway pushed her away, not completely, his fingers still hold her beautiful Dazzling waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't work," he said softly, enduring the pain of **: "Sorry, Ill, I didn't prepare a potion today, we might be able Try something else..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then don't take the potion." Il said, she lifted her body and wanted to kiss Fenway's lips, Fenway immediately Avoiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to have your child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a half-elf." Fenway said, alert and painful: "Our children will only be half-elves." Like my mother, she is an elf, and my father's body is only a quarter of the blood, but I am still only a half-elf - Ilva, this problem we discussed a long time ago - human The blood is long and deeper than any curse. I don't want you to be pregnant, I love, I don't want to have a half-elf offspring!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I think, I love you, Fenway, the person I love is a half-elf," Il said. "This child will be born in our love!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Like me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like you - Fenway, your mother, and father, they are in love, you can't Deny this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love like dewdrops, beautiful and short," Fenway sarcastically said: "Not even Blocked his betrayal and escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not you! You are not him!" Il said with a cry: "And your mother loves you - - She loves you, she gave up her life for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most stupid decision she has ever made," Fenway said. I hate her who made this decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ir’s froze, she stared at Fenway, as if to confirm whether the sentence was true From his mouth - "But I have thanked her for making this decision countless times." She said, tears flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway put on the robes, the room still haunts the belonging to Ilva The scent of the scent, like honey and flowers, he opened the small silver bottle in the robes and poured all the snow honey into his mouth. He needed to break free from the mud of love as soon as possible - although It was a bad love that couldn't be worse - he went back to the closed room and told the invisible servant to restore everything to the state before Ilva arrived, and then put the crushed spices into the fragrant boat and ignite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something he needs in the spell book, which is almost as important as Ilva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this moment, another mage in a black robe is standing in front of the sanctuary in Rosada, from his position Looking at the past, I can see the glorious icon and the huge holy pool, and the human beings who gather like a dove, cat and dog to sip the so-called holy water at the pool, a little girl who is only two or three years old. Walking in the crowd, the little fingers are also clinging to a thick green leaf. Although the water inside has leaked almost, she has nothing to do with it. A pair of pure eyes are always close to her leaflet cup, people They smiled and let her open a path - except for the caster, the girl's mother almost rushed over and hugged her, but the water in the bay leaf was still pouring on the expensive velvet robes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drop of water barely stayed on the surface of the robe, it fell to the ground, leaving two drops of tears on the alabaster - the wizard was cold and contemptuous The mother waved her hand, wearing a gray cloth skirt, and a mother with a loose old black shawl immediately wisely closed her mouth for pleading and gratitude, holding her child and leaving quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young white robes rushed over, the flattering blush of the flattering, brown eyes like the crystal of the tin crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the morning light bless you, brother." He bowed shallowly to the wizard, and when he straightened up, he found that he was staring in the other direction: "Brother ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the morning light bless you," the Master paused, "My dear little brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Yadell always has an illusion, maybe the Master speaks like this? Even blessings sound like irony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am here because there is something to be done for you," Yadel’s brother said straight away: "Fenway Master of Gray Ridge, you help I handed him a casting material to him - and then took back the secret silver he used to exchange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes." Yadel said that he I know Fenway Master, a half-elves who don't like humans, but rarely have a good relationship with his brothers. Hey, the second-ranked brother, they are all wizards, often exchange the various materials they need, strange, what? Yes, because the gray ridge does not welcome the foreign mage, as a pastor who can often travel between the gray ridge and the white tower, Yadell becomes a diligent little nephew, carrying the box with enthusiasm Come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
