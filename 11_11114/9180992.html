			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft prevention section, updated tomorrow at 11:30 am. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— They are a human being, so even if they are casters or cared by God, they have already spent most of their lives. But for elves and dragons, their life rolls are just beginning, or even too late. The most profound and important traces are depicted above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Ingeway was still carefree. His mother was the king of Jade Island. As a king, she would put more energy into it. Time spent on government affairs and her eldest daughter, Engel is her second son, inheriting his father's light blond long hair and iron blue eyes, as well as his unassuming character, with his long black hair With the emerald eyes, the rigorous nature, the stubborn and rigid mother and the elder sister are like the ends of the balance. Ingwi certainly loves them, and they should be the same, but since Ingwi is able to slap a pair of feet on the slate ground and wet moss of Wang Ting, and the roots of the roots, whether it is mother, sister or It’s hard for the attendants to capture the little black shadow that flies away. His curiosity and mobility are not as strong as an elf. In the one hundred years that humans have been long, Ingway has already I took the name for every tree in the island, and when he wanted to find a suitable nickname for each leaf in the island, a waiter found him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hurricane is coming," said the servant. "Please come back with me. Your mother and sister are waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Ingway said: "But have you heard anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The attendant replied so fast that Ying Gewei immediately heard that he was lying, but Ingewei did not reveal him. The older attendant used to be the martial art instructor of him and his elder sister, even though they are now Become a formal warrior, he should still have a respectful attitude towards the elder. In addition, he also needs a little preparation and an accomplice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to yell." Perant was not happy to say that he held his arm on his chest and raised his jaw with a strong grip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be like this," Ingway said as he rummaged through the box: "I really heard the call, someone needs our help, Perant?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The king does not want you to be in contact with humans too much." Perant lowered her arm in disguise. "I don't like them either."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some of the humans are indeed, their eyes and thoughts are disgusting, but not every human being," Ingway said, he looked overly at Perant, the pair The iron-blue eyes that look extraordinarily cool flash in the gloomy light: "I like their stories. I hope that when I finish the tour, I can also become a hero of the poets. Do you think this is possible? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In those legends," Perant thought for a moment, "The last thing that can be a hero is humanity." He hesitated and deleted. The fact that those who would disappoint Ingewei - for example, the elf is always only in the legend Is a hero's friend, lover or comrade, never an elf can become a human hero: "Maybe, an elf can also..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course "His friend said: "I am Ingway, the name should be engraved on the inscription and recorded in the scroll." He said in a proud and calm tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant couldn’t help but smile: "But what are you looking for?" Three boxes have been opened, and the room is full of various things. Something, "West Marie." Ingway said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Promise me, always feel free to me Keep in touch.” Ingway said that West Marie could bring them back to the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to promise me to leave before the hurricane landed," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
