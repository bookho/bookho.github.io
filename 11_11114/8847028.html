They are not allowed to chase the two exaggerated and quirky cats and mice - but they move very fast, like a warm and bright wind, which cannot be caught by ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s rare to see you here also have a wizard who is good at using flames." Birdwin said, he has a steel horse face on his hand, it seems I am coming out of the blacksmith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your embarrassment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Training."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strict training so that he can completely completely from that hopeless love as soon as possible Get rid of it.” Birdwin said that he was watching the black hair caster. He was laughing and being as unscrupulous and unrestrained as the children around him. “I was the first to see such a mage.” He said: "Inherited from his father or mother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry did not answer, but looked at Krimaar and the children with his arms - he Will not be burned by his flames, he can let the flame of the rose open in his palm, but also let the flame bird scorn his fingertips, he will take a shot, is the countless fine golden light red star - as gray The manager of the ridge said that Kerry was aware of that Kremar was both a mage and a warlock. This wonderful situation is even in the thousands of kings of the silver-crowned jungle. Old memories with him as a silver crown-like tree leaves in dense variety of books is never seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang, Perant and Kerry have discussed this issue in a golden afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock and the mage are both casters, this is a gift, but these two talents have a subtle difference - an ordinary mortal can't recognize them - But in a powerful caster that can be said to be unprecedented, that is, the king of the jungle; one is still very young for the elves, but for humans it can be said to be a ranger who has been through generations for several generations; One experience and experience are twice as many as the former Druid's eyes. Their difference is like summer and winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway once accused Krimaar of being a warlock disguised as a wizard - the elves didn't like warlocks very much, because the warlock's talents were almost all from the blood, and the blood flowing through the magic was not a demon or a demon, or a dragon, they They are all enemies of the elves, but ask if there are warlocks between their friends and their loved ones - although they are very rare, they do exist, but the elf warlocks who grew up in the gray ridge have never chosen a flame. The selected elemental creature servant, either from the water element plane, is from the earth element plane, and has a gas element plane selected, which is not a caster that is more suitable than the fire element, but for the gray ridge The love and fear of oneself made them choose elemental creatures of other planes at the expense of their own strength after hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar is not evil, he is full of awe and love, but he is full of doubts and violations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The orcs have established their camps," Birdwin said. "There is only a hundred miles from the mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" is the same as every previous year," Kerry said: "But the number of slaves and livestock is less than the previous year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is very difficult for human beings to survive on the whistling plain," Birdwin said. "And if they are thin or weak, they will be slaughtered as cattle and sheep."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reduction in livestock may be due to this warm winter," Kerry Ben said. "But their look and the atmosphere that lingers them makes me uneasy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans want to get close to the orc army to see the distance of their expressions, only the caster can do it, the elves are effortless, and their eyes are sharp like an eagle, no matter the day or night. Their pace is as light as a gust of wind across the grass, and they can even melt their breath into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of look and atmosphere?" Birdwin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like you’ve seen the mystery hidden in the treasure box,” the Elf Ranger replied: “And it’s the kind that benefits them.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An orc looks at the mage with caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lips are brighter than the blood of any kind of creature the orc has ever seen, his eyes are always hanging slightly, with a hood, his hands in his large sleeves, and he is one of the few allowed to be orcs. Free walking humans in the camp. As he passed by, the hair of the young warriors of the orcs would erect, the shoulders would rise involuntarily, and the fists would be clenched, making them feel ashamed that their tails would also curl into the double uncontrollably. Between the legs - their noses can smell the ashes, blood, fur, oil, and herbs, just as they smell from the tribe's priests, but they can also smell the dryness that the priests can't smell. The smell of rose petals (they know this is because the merchant slaves will use this to wipe the body), silk, agar and myrrh smell, and a smell they have never smelled, but they make them cold, hands and feet numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master has no interest in how the orcs think, his pharmacy has all been sold out, and now he sells goods that were hoarded long ago. His thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newborn orc warriors are sent out to capture those who think they are being protected by a powerful lord who are still immersed in fullness, peace and freedom. The poor worms in the dream, they are so hard to barely establish a weak body in this short, unfertile and warm land. The potatoes and sweet potatoes they planted were harvested once. The grass leaves on the shacks will also be replaced in the future. The captured sheep and goats need to be tightened to the neck before they can escape. The children will often lose in the thorny bushes, and the beasts will not give up. These human beings are vigilant and vigilant...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one of them thinks that such a beautiful fantasy will disappear in a morning, but they did not expect It’s so fast that no one thinks that they are just the sheep that the wizards are raising in the grass nests on behalf of the orcs—they don’t feel the sword hanging over their heads, when the young beasts come to kill them, Others ridiculously hold so-called franchises After claiming that he had the freedom and the land for fifty years, he was immediately cut into two halves. The new orcs who had been half-hunger and full of hunger eagerly jumped from the horse and drank the blood flowing from his body. Both hands picked up the internal organs that he had flowed out of the body and chewed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are not older, experienced, more rational and authoritative orc warriors who drive them with whip and blade, they will probably be one village next to one The village eats all the things that can be eaten – this is likely to cause the rest of the humans to escape – although in the dark grasslands these humans simply cannot compete with horses for physical strength and walking, but... their leader pulls from the neck A large silver chain with a magical timepiece that is said to have come from the hands of the wizard, they will bring these "fresh meat" back to the tribal joint camp on the first day of the siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that no humans have raised stone knives, stone axes, wood flails, spears, plows, and the princes drive horses in a shack like a human child, paying attention to the situation of each new soldier, those fragile weapons even their The fur covered with turpentine could not penetrate. Only a little brown-haired guy was inadvertently stabbed by a burning fossil. He screamed in anger and wanted to throw the human into the golden flame. Going to the swallowed shack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was severely stopped by the sergeant. This waste of food is absolutely impossible for the current tribe, and the little guy is embarrassed because of his intentions. Whip, but on the other hand, human beings are punished by lively bacon – after all the villages have been cleared, women are brought together to take care of the broken limbs and simply deal with them. In order to avoid spoilage, they should be put in a bag and taken away together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can refuse or even resist if they want to watch their father, husband and children being tortured - the mourning man is no better than The warning, but as long as they are willing to work, their relatives and friends and themselves can get temporary protection, even if they are unable to walk because of injury or illness, they can get a crisp death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of the barbecue spreads everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last grand dinner before the war. This vulgar dinner has almost invited everyone who lives and is in Fort Lauderdale - tomorrow's Food is distributed according to the supply system. Some wealthy people may have hidden some food, but at that time they are absolutely impossible to take out and drink. People take the last chance to eat and drink, yelling Dance, sing songs, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or the third day, on the fourth day, they will fight hard and dangerously, and may only eat a piece of dried meat and a loaf of bread every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this regulation that will become very strict elsewhere is still a little loose in Thunderbolt, and Thunderbolt is more special than other castles. Some - it only needs to face the enemy in one direction instead of the four directions, and it is behind its country and people, it can get endless support from Highland Norman - just takes time, after all, nothing Spells can instantly transfer the food needed for a castle from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbolt has no clowns, and the only bard has only sang two poems, because after the battle begins, he may need to use his singing to soothe and motivate People, of course, no one will bother the Masters, although they will not interfere with the subsequent spells after playing a few tricks, but it is not an exaggeration to be cautious in the face of the orcs in the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves also replaced the blue and silver robes or the pure blue robes with Kerry and Kremar. From today to the end of the campaign, they will wear them so as not to cause unnecessary misunderstandings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin introduced them to several knights and mages, mainly for Kremar, and the other elves were not the first to come to Thunderbolt. In addition to the robes outside, the Master of Thunderbolt seems to be no different from the Cavaliers. It is tall and strong, with a long sword and a dagger of fine gold. The fingers are thick and sharp, making people wonder if he can be like a The true caster makes the spellcasting gesture as smartly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they can, one of the oldest mages even uses the flames, and he is willing to talk to Kremar about how to cast the spell correctly. And the creation of magical tools, so that those violent and unpredictable elements of fire are thoroughly dumped under their mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow?" Birdwin asked: "Will it be too hasty? Don't be too anxious, my friend, the orc's stench and hair are all "There hasn’t been blown into the mouth by the wind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have established a camp," said Kerry Ben. "I hope the orcs have the same idea as you." , Sir Alex, so that we might get an unexpected little trophy before the official start of the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin made a face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," he said, "You, who else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"g Rimal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You really like this child," Baldwin said. "Where I go, I will take him." Br...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...He is also a mage," said Kerry Ben. "Fifty squads, one mage per team - I took him only because he was The first time I participated in the war, not the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Bydwin insisted: "But I always think he is different." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny is the first to participate in the Norman Lady of the Highlands Come in the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dressed up with the help of the baroness. Her lips were coated with rouge from the shells and beetles. The face was covered with thick white ** lead powder, and the eyes were painted with indigo The thick line - if Boldwin saw the meeting, he felt that his wife couldn't sleep well for a few days - the black grease on the eyelashes was mixed with gem powder, and it was like a young eye. The heart beats like a human heart. Penny’s faint eyebrows are deliberately drawn thin and long, and the tail ends up high, and the left eyebrow points a little black sable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is gold powder on her fingernails, her chest is hidden under the thick suede, and her face is rubbed with white ** lead powder The baroness provided by the baroness made her waist more than half thin, but it was obviously not created to facilitate walking and breathing - but it doesn't matter, she can still insist - what makes Penny the most difficult is The skirts behind her and the necklaces and bracelets hanging on the neck and wrists, as well as the rings, the former dragged over the entire twelve steps, while the latter was as heavy as a set of beautiful cockroaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Someone will ask you what crimes you have to get such an expensive embarrassment," said the Baroness. "They will rush to commit the law." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this gathering, Penny spent a lot of effort, she gave the baroness a jewel worth 5,000 gold coins, and for the party Everyone in the room has prepared a fine gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another one." A countess who happened to pass, said, and used a fan to block her daughter's curious sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not worthy and suitable for your concern." She said harshly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why," said the daughter, "Isn't it a pretty lady to hold and participate in a party there?"<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," her mother patiently explained: "There are three Baronesses and a Viscountess there... No, it should be three Baronesses and two Viscounts. But in essence, they are just a group... oh (speaking here, she snorted and snorted) - well, the word is not allowed to remember, nor is it allowed to say, otherwise I will use a needle to stab your mouth," The countess threatened to see her daughter immediately hold her mouth, and she looked sideways at the carriage, and the splendid building was left behind: "They greet there. Their noble and wealthy guests, of course, will never be their husbands - so don't tell anyone that you know there, don't get close to it, and even walk in there.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
