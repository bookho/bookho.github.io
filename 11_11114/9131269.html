The slurry had the smell of her familiar honey. The venom mixed into it and flowed into her wound, but it was this strong tingling that made her wake up. She found herself lying in the sand, perhaps because of this position, she did not fall too deep, she heard a cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin also heard that the baby is small, but the taste is sweet, it likes to eat the baby like a human likes to eat berries, it is very close to the quicksand, also Knowing that your weight is in the quicksand, you don’t want to fly if you don’t have a spell, so it doesn’t land, but instead leans over the body, wings, sweeping the baby in the air, but just sticking out his head and trying to hold him At that time, a heavy slap fell from the sky, and gave him a glimpse of Griffin. He almost went out with the barbarians, if not Mittite suspended them in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's mine!" Griffin growled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is my master," like every sleek and sleek sneak peek, Keou has learned to use the chin to look at it. People (see lions and beasts), and with the tone that can hold down all the lions and beasts in the field, "Of course, you probably don't understand this complicated relationship. We all know that the bird's head is thinking... I mean, it's really simple, but I think you can ask your master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin will certainly not be stupid enough to ask Mitt寇特, the IQ of the eagle-faced lion beast may not be as high as the lion-like beast to cast the magic, but in terms of conspiracy, they are not inferior to any human being, it knows its owner against the black hair The dragon has a lot of tolerance for a reason, although it does not know what the reason is, but Griffin absolutely supports all the decisions made by its owner, its owner is the best, top, wonderful, good Very much, especially if he is willing to take out his potion so that it won’t be cold in the neck. He jokes with lion body and the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is even too lazy to give the baby a look, and does not care about the hatred of Jasmine throwing him at him. The screaming and attitude of the weak is even worse for the strong. A glimpse of a spider's silk, a grain of sand, or a breeze, he urged Keou to return to its original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just felt the water, a lot of water," Keou said: "Do you want to create a large amount of quicksand? I think you can continue to let The desert has become an oasis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the lich said in his heart: "You are not going to throw me down?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come?" Keou’s mood suddenly became easier. He vaguely guessed it, but did not go deep. There are thousands of warlocks here, if one of them is Using his skills to peep at his thoughts, he is likely to bring danger to his partner. "You are my dearest master, Kremar," he said. "I listen to you, and I’m really dear." I haven't been able to do this to my wife," he shook his head incredulously. "How lucky you are, Dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lich missed his cohabitation, and the latter would not hesitate to vomit on the head of the bastard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine doesn’t know why the Dragon Knights of Grenada don’t spread their killings to humans, she doesn’t want to know, she just wants to pick up The baby who finally started crying, but when she stood up and wanted to walk, she dumped heavily on the sand. Her leg hurts like a crack. At this time, she discovered that sand is like countless. Just a tooth biting her leg, her body hanging low, all the weight on her knees, she wants to pull up a foot, but found it heavy like welding with the entire desert Together, she stood in the sand while her body sank at a speed visible to the naked eye. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also her family in this desperate situation. They shouted at each other and fell from the spider eater, they fell into In the quicksand, some of their astute people seized the stumps of the spider beast. The ratio of the eater is lighter than that of humans. The sinking speed is slow, but it will still sink, but at least they can regain their lives. Extend a little - someone started cursing, some people began to confess, more people began to plead, they, including jasmine, they dug eggs from the belly of the eater, held in their hands to let the Grenada people see, tell They are still very useful. They are more valuable than an ordinary slave. They vaguely remember that Moussa mentioned that a noble person from Grenada is willing to accept some barbarian slaves, but they don’t remember his name, or, from the beginning, They did not listen carefully to what Moussa was saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not necessarily the case," the Lich said in an understatement: "I have kept some barbarian slaves. If you have the venom, honey or eggs of the eater, you can sell them at the previous price." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really great," Mitt said in amazement. "If I say that I need to...somewhat?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much do you need?" said the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dozens, probably." Mitt said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can always pick it up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you have these slaves already It’s time,” Mitt said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before I have not left Grenada," the Lich said: "Their descendants are still on my contract."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's really good." Mitt said that he seems to be no longer interested. The Lich certainly knows why this is, the Grinada people do not regard the barbarian as a "person", but can be used as a weight that can be used for trading, but the Lich is also a Grenada, he is familiar with this trick. Very, he knows what his cohabitants will do, and naturally there are ways to get rid of the hints of Mitt. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for those who are embarrassed, he not only has cockroaches, but also eggs and honey, venom, these are the little devil Asmodeos hard work For several nights, for this, he had to reward two soul gems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine holds the baby, maybe, the baby’s light weight will make him the last of all the barbarians to be swallowed by the quicksand, but Jasmine is willing to hold him selfishly. Let him sink into the quicksand with himself, at least better than the food that became the lion-faced lion. She saw that his people are struggling, they want to lie on the quicksand, just like someone has succeeded. Finally, get rid of them, but this time the quicksand was created by magic. They only tried carefully and found that they were sinking all over the body. In the end, the best result they got was just to make the quicksand change from above the knee. It became more than the waist, and so was jasmine, but not because she tried to get away, but because she still had a baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine sighed softly, among these people, there are also Musa’s uncles, and those older, who are in their own tribes. They have a position of utterance, and they also assume the responsibility of the elders in their patriarchal tribe. They are as disgusted with Musa’s father as Moussa’s uncle, so after he dies, he can’t wait to find an opportunity. The power of his son was also expelled. But they may not have thought that although Moussa is only a young man, he has a longer-term vision than the older one to give up confrontation. Temporarily surrendering to the foot of the Grenada is what he has always imagined, but he and Jasmine said, not all, but part of them, their warriors will use the spiders and beasts to exchange themselves with the peace of the people, as Jasmine’s uncle said, they are not only eating spiders, but even the goblin They are too lazy to rob them. Maybe Grenada will refuse, they will torture and kill them, but they will provoke them ignorantly. The destruction will never be Grenada, it will be themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be ridiculed, will be ridiculed, will be rebuked, and may even be abandoned by his own people, these Moussa have considered, but he probably I didn't think that everything I guessed would come true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Jasmine can only pray to the god that they have forgotten, praying that the warlock who is willing to accept Musa and the tribe will not be too cruel, Mu The women and children that Sa took away, and he himself could survive and continue their race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby is uneasily motivated, the sand has touched his feet, and Jasmine raises his hands and raises his child like other mothers, Two or more mothers are the most painful. They can only lift the smallest one, and the older one can only helplessly crying beside her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be over." The Lich said that no one would object to his opinion, although most of the Knights and Warlocks of the Dragon Tooth Legion felt that the scene was full. The despicable and fragile nature of human beings will be vividly expressed at the last moment, but if magic or sword is used, it is only a matter of moments, but it is slowly swallowed by quicksand, just like watching oneself uncontrollable step by step. The mourning of the wilderness to the darkness, the enormous torture can almost make a person go crazy immediately, their expression changes constantly with the rising of the sand, the intense emotion is to make the warlocks like a mellow blood wine, even if they Some regret, because they can't see their favorite blood, but these can still satisfy them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
