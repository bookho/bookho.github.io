In any case, the priest of Froc can't just follow them half naked, even if Mei Mi doesn't care to be seen by his body, this time the Highlands Norman is still cold at night - Birdwin and his The companions are surrounded by the burning bonfire, and the sky shrouded in the earth has turned into deep sapphire blue, the stars are lingering, the air is floating in the air, if it is not the eccentric atmosphere of plum and Leona, they should be good. Enjoy such a hard-won, relaxing night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei has never said anything since he was allowed to return to Bywin, except for the gift of Leona, Fro’s The priest was ashamed of being cut off his tongue. She ate two eggs, and with a little berry, she never put her hand out, but held her knees—just like the room where they held the ceremony. Waiting like that, quietly hiding the scarred face in the shadow of the arm; and Leona, perhaps the soul of the outside world is not very proficient in the relationship of female learning, he can not see the king of Norman Similarly, she loves Byrdwin, but she also has no guilty conscience for Mei Mi, nor has she been angry or humiliated because of their intimate past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not because of kindness or cowardice, the soul of the outside world feels vaguely, this is another way to show indifference and Cruelty - In his plane, many times, the more he is in the high position, the more gentle and tolerant he is. Some people who are out of the original class will yell for some small things, but this is not to say The former is more rational and polite than the latter. They just don't want to fall to the same position as you – no matter what, except for the madman, no one will fight with a tiny dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of the king of Norman. Even if she really loves Byrdwin, and is willing to give up his family name and territory for him, away from homeland, as a warrior rather than a princess along with him. But she never thought that a Fro's pastor could shake her emotions. Although she did not call Plum as Fro's instrument as Maunun's uncle, her thoughts put Mei Mei in a near-near. In a transparent position - in her cognition, everything about Plum is based on Birdwin, and she respects her. Thanks her, talks to her, and lends a helping hand to her, just because Mei Mi is a companion to Baldwin and carefully looks after him when he is isolated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she will not marry Mei Mi, because only women who are recognized by the king will arouse her vigilance, just like a noble and young prince will never want to compete with a declining and humble refugee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei was at an absolute disadvantage in this invisible war. She was fully armed, day and night, and her voice was exhausted. And her opponent only needs a timely smile - the thief Gülen pulled some meat from the chicken chest and put it into his mouth, while squinting at the ridiculous and pitiful little idiot, she curled up at the campfire, still It trembles from time to time, as if the heat from the flame is completely inaccessible into her heart and her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the middle of the night is coming to an end, when it is the turn of Gülen to watch the night, he is not surprised to see Mei Mi go to Birdwin again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no tall trees in their place, only sporadic shrubs and dense long grasses, so the elves just use their talents to make some more than the knees. The grass grows taller, almost without the waist of Birdwin. The latter part of the grass fell down to form a warm and dry nest, and the surrounding grass drooped down the tip of the leaf, blocking the breeze of the night and obscuring the enemy's sight. Even if you look at them from a high altitude, it is difficult to find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief sitting in the high hills found the trace of plum honey as easily as eating a candy. She lowered her body and quickly and lightly passed through the thin The grass, with tiny serrated blades of grass, swayed her face. Leaving a wound like a spider's silk, and she has not considered that much, she needs Baldwin, more than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin heard the sound of the fabric and the blades of grass rubbing in a nightmare, this sound made him instantly return to reality, he held it around Wide sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some modifications, the following content is changed after an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first dinner after leaving Doring is still quite rich - the eggs and berries that Leona found, Kerry’s use of the delicious eucalyptus The pine cones that sugar and squirrels exchanged, some wild sweet potatoes dug by Birdwin, and the mothers of the eggs that Gülen got. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona found a brown cotton robes from her bag, and a lambskin lining, a satin-length vest with a satin finish.
