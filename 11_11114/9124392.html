He held the black iron that the Grinada people longed for, but he was not qualified to talk directly to the upper level of Grenada.To be exact, he has tried it, and the result of the attempt is that he has not been able to cross the desert and almost died in the hands of greedy businessmen and thieves - those who are loyal to him and the merchants are dead, whistling In the desert, he didn't even have the time and ability to hold funerals for them... He didn't know how he survived. The sun rose and fell, falling and rising, and thirst and hunger afflicted him. He thought he would eventually Turning into a fine sand in the desert, but many days later he still has the last breath of singularity - another caravan of Grenada discovered him, he was taken away and became a slave, in his hope The black market involved in it was sold, and it was his mentor who bought him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This eccentric grey robes was originally intended to find some material used to make the bones of the bones, but this northern slave has caught her attention, she is dying The body even had a warm sputum because of him, this feeling even before she had not become a gray robes - she knew she was ugly, from the time she was a child With thin hair and high cheekbones, she has always been the object of girls and boys playing and laughing.She also thought that she didn't need this. She had the talent of the caster. For those who are mean and poor, she has the right to kill and kill - but she is still attracted to him, although she still has not thought about making this young. People live too long<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will put him in a room full of silk gems, just like men raising birds, giving him food and water, giving him false I hope that I can get the love and love that he has paid back. For a few days, or a few months, when her heart becomes cold and peaceful again, she may give him a quick death with regret, and keep one of his. Root finger or one eye<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the unexpected thing happened, the slave bought by the woman’s gray robe mage for her own desires also has the talent of the caster, she wants Killed him before he could hurt himself, but he finally decided to leave him - it was dangerous, but she couldn't control her behavior for the first time, completely... no, sometimes she even rejoiced her mentor. Has returned to the seventy-seven islandsShe asked in detail about the past of this young slave—there was no such thing in his pedigree as there were characters who would call and have demons or demons—although his talents were more inclined to warlocks.But who knows, the blood of the devil and the devil can be passed down for hundreds of generations, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and because the blood is so thin, if two people who have no difference, they love each other, Marriage contract, birth generation, this blood will also become thicker in their children<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can control him by spelling, can use the potion to smother him, or let the ghost monitor him, and she does the same, so she is alert and happy There is also some sadness that her slave is not violent because of fear. He calmly accepts everything she has given, gently calms her, obeys her, and acts like she really fell in love with her. It is absolutely impossible, but no one can let the dead heart not jump. She knows that she has made some changes, but that is only a small change. Maybe she will push this human to a short time later. Hungry devil, but before that, she is willing to enjoy this rare warmth<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray robe disciple waited patiently, even though he knew that Larry’s last two guests had an incomparable illustrious identity, perhaps to a dagger... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He looked up," his master, his mentor, let the woman who was afraid and hated suddenly touched him gently. Fingers, "You have to remember their faces," she said, but her lips did not move: "The two children of the ruler of Grenada, the dragon, the warlock, Mitt and Kremar, of course, this It’s two variant names, but if you... if you can get out of my tower one day, they will be your best master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he lifted his gaze slightly, the position of the gray robe was second only to the two distinguished guests, on their left side, he almost never needed to make They can see their faces with too much movement - Mitt is a strong male who looks more like a warrior than a caster. He sits there with his hands on a short, majestic and cold, and He is the younger brother of the former and the youngest son of the new king. He returned to Grenada for no more than 30 days. It is said that he has been studying and playing in the mage tower of his mentor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he saw the person clearly, the disciple of the gray robe couldn’t help but give a surprised gasp, and he could only hear the vague music. In the courtyard where the sound of sound and water flowing in the canal is such a sudden – and we must admit, at this moment, the eyes of the god of destiny must also be watching this unfortunate young man, because almost At the same time, some people issued a surprise cry, except for the gray robes who are next to him, no one noticed his strangeness.dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, the crisp drum sounds recalled their reason, or deprived them of more thoughts - two lines of slender figure coming out of the darkness in a rhythmic and light pace, with a full body "Doves" are different. They are younger. They are between young children and teenagers. They are cute. Only the sharpest slave traders can distinguish their gender. Their ears stick out from the curly light hair. Hands and feet are hairy claws, and a long tail is swaying behind them. Compared with the "pigeons", they have at least a little cover clothing. Although it is harsh, it is just a piece of white linen wrapped around the waist. They hold the drums alone, but they are used to beat the drumheads. The hands and their tails, the furry long tails are like having their own life and thoughts, all of a sudden falling on the side of the drum, suddenly falling on the drums, with incomparable joy and dexterity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a terrible sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since coming here, the soul of the opposite world has seen too much that it can only be seen in another plane in movies and novels, it thinks It can make it fear that something that cannot be moved may be there, but it should be no longer, but it finds itself to be a big mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be said that every dead house is almost obsessed with the angels and cat ears of the two yuan, and the ten ** also imagined that if there is such a reality It’s okay to be cute to destroy the world... but it’s not them, not what they see now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can’t even tell yourself that they are one of the orcs, like the orcs described in many novels, because he already knows the true appearance of the orcs. Fighting with them, seeing the women and children who were abandoned by them, and of course, the babies - as ugly as the adult orcs, can't raise any compassion. And these...the things they see should all be the "works" of the red robes. They are not the same as the merchants. They will also comment when they appreciate these flesh and blood creations, such as the place where they are only twenty steps away. A warlock felt that the wings of the "pigeons" were too weak and weak, so that the movements were somewhat sticky when unfolding and stowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you want your wings to become more powerful," another warlock said: "The muscles on their shoulders are like a warrior." That's too ugly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, they won't be sent to the battlefield," said the third warlock. "It's just a small one." "It’s gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those children," the former warlock apparently did not want to continue this controversial question: "I like that tail." dudu2( );<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The leopard's tail." A warlock said: "It's very sensitive, the nerves and muscle connections are doing well, but it may be because the time is too short. There are a few drums that are light..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because they feel the pain relationship." The warlock who successfully converted the topic said: "They are very lucky. Have a kindhearted master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world is like hearing another ridiculous Joke. The "pigeons" are still dancing, they can't see the water on their bodies, but the red faces and the shimmering eyes indicate that they are really exhausted. The pair does not know that the wings of that kind of bird are Ordinary people's arms are two to three times longer, and the widest part is more than three feet. The bones of birds are hollow, but the weight of muscles and heavy feathers is still not to be underestimated, especially if they are not waving the original arm. But through the magical and potion cutting the deformed limbs transplanted to them... And those children, although they all have sweet smiles, still can see a bit of unnatural stiffness, not only the tail, even their The claws tremble slightly when they land on the drumhead and the ground. The soul of the outside world wants to stop this cruel torture, but then, even in that peaceful and peaceful plane, it makes guests at the banquet. Dissatisfied service personnel will also be punished, let alone here? In the most evil and dark red dragon city, they are the creation of spells. The meaning of existence is to get the joy of the master and the guests. If not, maybe death can be regarded as a warm ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inadvertently helping it is the eldest son of the new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to see them?" Mitt said that this creation is not a lot in Grenada, after all, if it is just for fun. The warlocks will only take the task if they are bored, but it does mean that outside the Grenada, even the seventy-seven islands, you can hardly see this strange. The gadgets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
