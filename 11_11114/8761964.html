			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to complete this scam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They need to fool almost everyone, including Antonio’s apprenticeship – his older apprentice has a father who is the leader of the slaughter guild, that is, He is one of the 12 members of the White Tower; the other is a big kid. Although his father is only a liquor merchant, he has produced two-thirds of his property to Dazer Luzer. I bought a knight title without a land seal, and paid the honey and gold coins that replaced the vassal duty every year. Therefore, in Baita, he is not an unidentified civilian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the riots caused by this madness, their families were not spared, one lost two sisters and mothers, and the other lost Newborn brother, nurse, and cousin. Therefore, it is impossible to want to swear by the scam of this intention to clear the culprit. Antonio Master has never been. (More correctly, he did not think of it) sign a vicious as the Demon’s mentor The harsh magic contract, in addition to emotion, authority and conscience, does not have any means and means to restrict them - they must be completely excluded to be the safest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this means that all the materials and the previous work need to be completed by Kerry Ben, Antonio and Kremar, to summon a demonic The material is more complicated and more complicated than the material used to summon the soul before, and some of the Antonio Masters are not prepared, so the Lich asks Kerry to "get it" from the "Cyclops" - he is wonderfully When he found himself doing something evil in theory but he was not punished for it, Antonio Master swayed his head around, sighed, and whispered the name of Beavis. Apparently he thought it was the dwarf temperament. The fierce short wizard had taught the child to some extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The material you need can be taken from me." Master Antonio said that he turned his beard towards the young caster: "I will turn my back." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lich doesn't matter, but he really has to choose the spell very carefully, because he will experience two hard battles today - one It is against the devil, the other is against humans, and the same is true of Antonio Master. His burden is even heavier. After all, the two summoned casters are not Kremar but him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is that we should summon the devil." The Ranger pretend easily asked: "I don't want to see a demon prince or an abyss lord suddenly appearing in magic." In the circle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little devil," said Master Antonio, looking through an old man's paper book: "The weaker the better, the key to the whole spell is not the power of the demon to summon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Niki." The Lich said that he put a snake's tongue in his pocket and then a small bottle of honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Niki?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little devil," said the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that it is not a good time to get to the bottom of it," said Master Antonio. "But please tell me, has Vivius repeated this spell?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich nodded calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Galaxy is on," Antonio Master said angrily: "He should know how dangerous this is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s as dangerous as we are now." The Lich said, so the Master of Antonio downturned the book, and let the invisible servant return it to its original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The same main material is needed," said Kerry Ben, "part of the body of the dead person."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Master caught the beard with trouble, he did not expect that they had to steal this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This should be fine." The Lich said that he took out a black thread and the longest line of gold-brown long lines - Kerryburn Pulling a paragraph: "Is her hair?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I picked it up from her clothes," said the undead who once - professional habits: "There is also a comb. The color and texture are quite consistent, unless the thing in that box belongs to another person, otherwise it is her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Krima's description," said Master Antonio: "We can try to change it once after summoning the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry I agree that he has already done a thief, and he does not want to do it for the second time, especially to disturb the sleep of the deceased. This is a torture for the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon tried his clothes before waiting for the silver mirror, which was a new robes, black double-sided silk, inside The layer depicts the protective runes, and the robes are dotted with gems, one of which triggers a sharp ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think Antonio invited me to go to?" he asked himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A plucked phalanx was thrown out of the shadow above the silver mirror, almost smashing the nose of Demon, if not for him to dodge fast enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What evidence did he find? Asmodeos?" Demon asked harshly: "Have you heard anything? Look What's up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the little devil that looks unusual and harmless when he puts his wings and tail out, reveals his teeth in the dark, sharply at him. Taunting shouting: "I am not your servant, Demon!" It screamed: "You want me to tell you something, you have to pay... No, no, don't mention your magic, with my former master. In contrast, it is like a stinking water that is not wet on the bottom of the beach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you have to rely on this stinking water Living," Demon retorted: "Like those squirrels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You make me weak," Asmodeos hates Say: "Becoming incompetent - I can't give you any news, unless you can give me more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon touched the soul in the pocket Stone, imprisoned The gems of the soul are the mentor of Demon who gave him before leaving. This is the only thing that can drive this little devil. He has to use Demon to use it only at the necessary moments to avoid Asmody. Oss has the power to leave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It despise you," Demon's mentor said: "And hate you, because you are not strong enough, at least not at all with its last owner. Than, so once you let it have a chance to get out of you, it will be the first to rush to tear you into pieces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon touched again The stones, the stones used to imprison the soul, are always cold, and the cold makes his fingers stiff: "One piece."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three," Asmodeos said: "Otherwise it will roll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two." Demon insisted, "Otherwise I will go by myself." Trying to figure out their intentions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two pieces," Asmodeus gave back a step, and Demon gave it a piece, it immediately picked it up. In the past, I was hiding in the cheek pouch: "They are trying to summon the soul of the Froor Pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie," Demon said coldly: "Monroe And the soul of the Froor Pastor will not appear in the mourning of the wasteland - the mentor will not make such a ridiculous mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trying," Asmod Oss said: "They are trying - they invite you to the past, just to witness, anyway, Xiao Demeng, you are now the White Tower's governor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't call me Xiaodemeng," Demon corrected in annoyance, but the next moment he became hesitant: "But you said they want to ask me to be a witness, do they really summon to Pastor Fro or the soul of Monroe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢噢噢噢..." Asmodeos slaps four small pieces Paws: "You just have a trust in your mentor - well!" It raises the voice: "Please feel at ease, my stupid master, they can't succeed unless they can lick from the belly of Anemos. Out of the pieces of the soul and put them together - understand? They have been swallowed, completely disappeared into the world, even if Rosada or Cranmo can not be saved, they are not only ashes Nothing can be found outside the wind! So, now, give me the rest of the reward! Immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil’s howling and contempt for Demon’s His face was white, but he could see that he was really relieved. He took the soul stone from his pocket and threw it to Asmodeos. After he stepped back two steps, he tried not to let himself leave in such a hurry. basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nasty master, disgusting master, cowardly master, may you rest in peace soon... After I am free," Asmodeos will Two gems were stuffed into their cheek pouches, and after the cheek pouches on both sides finally got balanced, they kept groaning: "I need a stronger master, smarter, even if only half of my original owner is good. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It thinks of Antonio Master, but the stubborn and honest old man will never take a little devil as a magical pet, but it is hard to say, look He summoned the devil and let the devil do something for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
