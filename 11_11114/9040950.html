			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich turns and looks at the far side, the huge flying ship is moving out of the landing area, slowly and steadily rising up, it looks a lot like The airship he searched for in the soul of the world has a similar similarity to the streamlined hull of the size of the adult blue whale, which is used to stabilize the tail of the hull, the delicate four-group propulsion device, the steering wheel, and The most important pod, the structure of the pod can refer to a giant three-masted boat. The manufacturer uses the ash-brown walnut wood with tobacco aroma to make the deck and guardrail. The cabin is covered with mahogany, tulip and purple heart. Wood, the outer surface of the cabin is covered with gold foil, inlaid with sea pearls, and the white-like hull of the cabin is painted with the coat of arms and characters of the East Crown with Mithril, shining in the deep purple-blue twilight. ~,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is safer and longer than the dangerous gas used in another plane. The combination of magic and mechanical runes can keep the airship flying more than 10,000 miles. And it can be replaced as easily as changing the battery of the mobile phone, the soul of the outside world said so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who had been unfortunate had to be thankful that the old lords simply couldn’t wait to see them, and today’s rotation is not the idiot who likes to surprise Otherwise, it is difficult for him to convince others that Beavis has not become mad because he has lost his wife. Why should he charge such a disciple who can even be said to be...no cure? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can't blame me, the soul of the outside world squinting at the edge of the sea and watching all the external gnomes' products so that he can't help but think of him. The world, the pieces that float in his memory, they even have electric lights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a light, the Lich says, do you forget that there is a primary spell that can make an object shine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe not, the soul of the opposite world says, but that is obviously not a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body they use is very good, even if you need to see through the lich, the soul of the outside world can discover the mystery, although it looks really like The fishing line chandelier suspended from the dark black bracket, but it is not the current but the cetyl wax, which is filled with cetyl wax in the small bowl of waxed gold. A thin wick protrudes from the liquid surface. Above them is a device like a lighter that is actually a lighter. The line that controls it hangs from the center of the dendrite to the ground. The crystal pendant at the end is hung from the ground. Seven feet position. As the sea breeze sways gently, the sun shines through them, and the ground of the alabaster is sprinkled with jewel-like spots of different sizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They extend from the platform for the airship to the huge hall supported by hundreds of giant pillars, and the alabaster road becomes colorful. When the whale wax with myrrh is ignited, it will emit a strong specific aroma. They are scattered with a salty sea breeze, leaving only the shadows that flicker like birds in the jungle. On both sides of the road leading to the pillar hall, in addition to the brackets hanging on the chandeliers, they are beautiful female slaves. They are between the ages of fifteen and twenty, and they are fresh and juicy, not wearing them. Clothing or shoes, white skin allows them to be almost integrated with the ground. They squat gently, using their bodies to lay a long blanket of hot and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was the first to stop, and the Elf Ranger was the first to go deep into the Dragonfire Islands. It’s only heard about this, but no matter what. . An elf does not walk on the backs of humans or other intelligent creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a father’s love for his son, and he loves the house and the black,” said the eunuch who came to greet them. “He ordered me to receive you with the highest etiquette.” He glanced at everyone in a vague way: "Please don't worry, the bones of these birds are not as fragile as you think. They are very strong and can fully bear your weight... Come on, distinguished guests, yours The feet should not be contaminated with sand and dust here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Listen to his advice," said the ninth lord: "Excessive compassion These little birds are not a good thing. Their value is here. If you don't want to walk on their backs, maybe the next moment they will throw huge stone sarcophagus and crush it for food."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich’s fingers in the sleeves moved slightly, and the fluctuations in the magic caused the attention of the eagle hook nose mage. When he was trying to say something, he used to The undead person smiled at him. The beast that hides in the dark eyes immediately makes the former wisely close his mouth, and Kerry Ben and others only feel that the body is gently lifted up by an invisible hand, and put down, the young black caster takes the lead. On this beautiful and shocking long blanket, Birdwin walked to his left and the elf was on the right. Every step he took out was on the knee, which made the elf feel better, even though he knew that Cremari's spells had worked, and the weight of one hundred pounds couldn't even make the soft skin deform. But this behavior still makes him want to vomit, Mei Mi and Leona are close behind, Gülen is at the last side, he believes that the Master of the Lord and the ninth son have already noticed their difference, but what about it? ? They obviously have a request for Crimare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pillars of the lord of the East Crown are as empty and bright as the caves of the dragons. In addition to the inexhaustible cetyl wax lamps, precious fluorspars are set on each alabaster pillar. The surface of the pillars is full of graceful young girls. Floating statues, they don’t have a piece of scorpion, they stick their arms out of the column, holding fragrant flowers and fresh berries, about one-tenth of which is the magic image for defense and attack. The lich is stepping into the hall. The number of silent places has been counted, but they are not yet accurately pointed out. In addition, the floor of the column hall is inlaid with precious Mithril lines. The jewels and leather covered with purple heart and Sumu hangs a sea pearl with a soft luster. There are mixed fluorites of different sizes. Intensive and some places are only a few scattered, and Gülen looked up for a while before discovering that it was simply a man-made miniature river. The thieves licked their mouths in the heart. This is really an extravagant and arrogant move, ordinary stars. It is impossible to condense into a galaxy. Only the magical star river can traverse the entire sky like a light river. Because the magical star river can only be seen by the caster, it almost becomes a ban on all casters. If you see it outside, it is decorated. The first thought of the magical Galaxy's apparatus and clothing is that it belongs to the caster. All the idiots who don't learn or do not learn to do so have done this, but they all died later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief glanced at the mage with a big nose, and he seemed completely indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is the first time to discover the weird decoration of the ground and the dome just to mask the truth of a large rune, which effectively suppresses the power that does not belong here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pillar hall, the sex of slaves has changed from pure women to half and half, but it is hard to say whether the half should still be discounted, because that half It is a boy who has been castrated. On their necks, there is a collar of lizard skin, a thin black iron chain hanging from the center of the collar, connected to the chain of their waist, the chain and the collar are very delicate. So that they don't look like a shackle, it looks like an individual decoration. From here on, let the people of Kreima and his team feel a little peace of mind that the things they stepped on were finally replaced with bicolor jade with numerous fine lines, and hollow copper pipes buried under the jade. When they pass into the hot springs, the air on the ground and above will be warmed, and when they pass into the sea, they will become cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord’s Master and the Ninth Son stopped at the edge of the Column Hall, and the next place would be considered a rebellious spot kill without the permission of the Lord. Death, even the lord's son is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ninth son of the Eastern Crown lord went from the outer corridor of the pillar hall to his residence. The birth of his father and his master was this month. He and his brothers only had access to the East Codon Island for a few days. A heavily guarded bastion, they will hold a few or more grand banquets that rival the shrine's celebrations, present their gifts to the only rulers and rulers of the East Crown, although they are no longer so convinced. Fear of this man, but the lords of the East Crown have the fact that they can't match the power. What they are worried about now is whether he will give him extra power because he prefers a child, causing them to lose their current balance. Of course he knows that this gift may be malicious, just to provoke a fight between them, but what about it? No one will leave the barbecue in front of him without opening his mouth, and if you don't want it, others will want it, and this small tilt may eventually lead to his own death, no one wants to end this end, No one wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lord’s ninth son entered his home, everything was well taken care of. Dada is indeed a capable brother. In fact, this time he should not follow, because the punishment he received will not heal overnight. The odor and slow action emanating from him would make him unable to serve his master well, but in the end he appeared in front of the ninth child, Dada, who said that the slave who should have followed the owner to the East crown was actually It was hanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slaves are not allowed to kill each other. After all, they are the property of the master, but Dada’s identity is indeed special, and according to the ninth. The slave would be stupid enough to believe that Dada would give him some help. He was walking around to reach him. Otherwise, Dada was not so easy to use his wrap cloth to abruptly kill him as the master. The ninth son should probably Thanks to Dada, his former brother, the stupid guy should have been sent to make food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes the ninth more interesting is where Dada got the ointment. These earthy ointments are certainly not as good as the healing potion, but also let Dada Standing up in the shortest time but he did not think that this would make his only remaining wrists exposed to the owner? No, Dada should have thought about it, but he still did it. The ninth son knows why he did this for a slave, a slave who served their master and father, a girl, in the sense of the outside world. It is the father's daughter, their sister, but on the Longhuo Island, she can only be a slave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has the same mother as the ninth son, and Dada, maybe the woman told her that she still has two brothers, surprisingly, She managed to find them. Dada’s ranking was in the 14th place, and now the ninth is fifteen. Their sister has the beauty that other slaves can’t match, even though she was still very young. But it has already come in handy. With her help, Dada killed three brothers all the way and climbed to tenth place. What needs to be explained here is that at this time he discovered that Dada is a weak guy. He fell in love with their sister. He no longer allowed her to join dangerous tricks and conspiracy, and even tried to find ways. The savage move she sent to their father and the owner almost made their previous efforts vanish, and he also found Dada's most deadly weakness since then. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
