			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is all the people?" The fourth detachment of Grenada said that people in Tilan stood on both sides of the main road, leaving Let the three people walk side by side in the blank area, but even so, when the eagle-headed lion swarms and walks, the hanging wings will sweep to the body of the Tilan, and an eagle-headed lion beast is only about five or six. I don’t know why I suddenly ran out of the queue when I was curious, or full of appetite, and the sullen and deformed head made the child cry, but his mother still hugged his brother. Pulling his sister, being separated by a few people, it is impossible to catch his own child, only to scream and try to stop him. The knight on the lion's lion body frowned impatiently, and he placed his hand on the spear. Although he still had a large debt to return, the desire to kill was not satisfied or he was extremely violent— - People see that in the next moment he will pull out a spear to stab the child, but no one dares to do anything - but before the terrible predictions become a reality, the crying stops, people are light They breathed a sigh of relief, and then they were surprised to see that it was a cockroach. She was gray, ragged, and her back was arched like a mountain, but she was braver than everyone else. She was holding the boy. One hand wraps around his body while the other holds his mouth tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the dragon's spear has been pulled out, and the steel shines in the dim skylight, the child's mother screams and cries, and neighbors The people are not closing their eyes, turning their heads, they are clenching their fists, if not worried about the parents, wives, children behind them... But is it worth it? The Tiran people are confused. They give up resistance in order to survive. If they can't survive after giving up their dignity and identity, then they will not be afraid to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, at this time, the companion who followed the knight shouted impatiently, and the Tiran did not understand what he was saying. But in fact, he is only reminding his colleagues in front not to cause traffic jams at this time. There are hundreds of dragon claws cavalry behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want even your child?" The knight took back the spear and asked in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s more than a child," his companion said, then he twisted his finger and replied in silence: "For the warlock, the child and the baby are better than Adults are much more precious. Do you know how the little goblins used to clean the streets in Wangdu are coming? It is said that their main material is babies, and it is said that many potions use their blood, organs and flesh. For the devil and the devil, the tender baby is a very satisfying dessert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, as a caravan that receives and manages these new slaves, When they arrived, they were following the back of the Grenada corps, so that the trophies that the knights had plucked could be sorted and evaluated in a day or two, and the souls of the outside world were surprised. The businessman actually started using a check-like thing very early—or, it’s more reliable than another world’s check, because it’s basically a contract, and the parchment battered by the spell won’t be burned, smeared and also Because of damp into the water and fester, it is difficult to hurt even the sword to them. Something like this, the black-haired dragon has already had a handful of scorpions, and this is only the personal part he got as the leader of the legion. Most of the possessions belonging to the legion were sent to the kingdom, or directly turned by the businessman. Everything that is not known is in exchange for what Grenada needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants supervised the Tilans putting the loops one after the other, the loops were a slip knot and the other end was placed on a longitudinal rope. So if someone wants to escape, then he will find that not only will his neck be tightened, but other people will become his burden. Relatively, once you start walking, you can't stop or speed up. Everyone must be careful. It is a difficult process to ensure that they are in line with the people on the same rope, but because Kremar asks the slaves to retain the relationship as much as possible, they have not yet had desperate casualties. The Lan people help each other, and the children are scattered on the back of every strong woman, whether she is related to him/her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the team began to wriggle, the men looked worriedly at their mother, wife and children, but they were to be closely controlled, and the casters in the caravan The monsters summoned by them are squatting beside them, flowing from their teeth with corrosive saliva. If they are bitten by them, they can basically be said to be dead, and the Greinada people will not waste. The precious spells and herbs are on the slaves, and they endure to turn around. The leader of the Grenada Legion is said to be a Highness, who wants to build a city from the sea – he needs a lot of slaves, men, Women need to wait until they arrive in Grenada, they can still meet again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many dragons are not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every Tiran person will stand on both sides of the street smoothly, still someone wants to resist, or hide, but the dragon tooth and the dragon claw knight They quickly left their mounts and entered the squad into each mansion and alley. The spells cast by the squad in the squad could not even escape a bird, let alone a human. These people are acquiesced as extra rewards. They belong to the knights who searched for them. This is also an invisible law. Even the leaders of the legions have no choice. Some knights consider their empty money bags, just these people. After being driven out, they are handed over to the merchant for a bill, and some knights will kill, or worse, torture them after they have tortured them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keou did not accidentally hear the screams from a mansion, he did not follow Cremari - although some people Quite a word, but who is Keou? He almost did not hesitate to lift his wings, only a few breaths flew into the atrium of the mansion - no way, the door and corridor of the mansion are not for such a huge even in the lion beast The guy prepared, the screams have disappeared, but Keo still remembers the direction it came from. He did not hesitate to make a big stride and jumped on a large terrace, terrace and room. There are stone-brick walls and beautifully carved wooden sills. The lion beast looks around and sticks out his claws. It is like simply digging a piece of grease and simply opening a hole in the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More correctly, it is simply destroying a wall, the threshold is embarrassingly suspended on the remaining bracket, and Keou smoked his nose - nothing It's just that the smell in the room is too bad, especially the smell of blood, and the thick ones can almost be touched - in this room, the people mentioned before, who are lucky and hiding. They ridiculously hid in the mezzanine between the room and the room, but it didn't work. The Tirans were immediately discovered. A father, a mother and their daughter were arrested, and grandparents were killed on the spot. Sun daughter became the object of abuse and insult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a shame," Keou fiddled with two bodies that have lost their vitality: "At least two gold coins."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," one of the knights said with a good voice: "It's a nail cover medicine, I don't care." If Keo is a personal class, it may have long been It was pierced into the chest by the dagger in the dark, but he was not only the lion-like beast that could only cast the magic, but also the mount they commanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope your bird doesn't care," said Keou. "You know, that powder is very precious, I am planning to raise the price..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, or your master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the relationship?" Inadvertently said, "I am his. Anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers moved their lips in a sinful manner, perhaps in cursing the endless abyss The lion beast may have to add his master, but he also knows that he can't do it now: "Maybe you misunderstood me," he said hard. "I am not complaining, just... ...a little...ah, you know...in fact we are not warlocks, the life of the knights is still very hard...you have really put a lot of pressure on us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I not feel it at all?" Keou said shamelessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s companion cast a look at him, “One million please forgive.” The former said humbly: “My friend has always been a bad word. Man," he said. "But we did get attacked." When he said this, the girl who covered her body cast a hateful look, but she was very smart, not only hiding her eyes in her hair. Behind, the line of sight only stayed on the Cavaliers for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have no help, respected adults," the Knight of Dragons continued: "But fortunately, we still got something," he started Hand, let Keo see the gems in his hand, he dumped the gems on the ground: "There is this human," said the Cavaliers. "Similarly, we are willing to give you free of charge, although she is dangerous," he lowered his voice. "I suggest you better kill her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said Keou: "I like this girl."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are even the first knights who have spoken first, and their eyes are unstoppable between the hind legs of Keou's thick fur. If this beast does something, then this human female will inevitably escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
