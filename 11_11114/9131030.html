			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine’s uncle is sitting on the sand dune. Although he thinks that Jasmine’s worries are very ridiculous, he still can’t help but observe the sky, the desert and the parts between them. Perhaps because of the depths of his heart, there is also the fear of the casters of Grenada - he saw those warlocks who attracted lightning, blew the wind, turned the steel into lava, or silently took it. Going to a lot of lives... Although he still doesn't think they can control the sandstorm, these guys are cruel and powerful, and this must be admitted. When they encounter the caster, they only run as fast as possible. There is no courage to dare to fight against it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the wind blew over his cheeks, and Jasmine’s cheeks touched like sandstone, and as an old barbarian male, Uncle Jasmine The cheeks are as thick and rough as the skin of the Deinonychus. Every inch of the exposed place is left with deep traces of the wind, the sun and the sand. Even so, he can still feel the power of the wind is rapidly increasing. He slammed into the sand, his eyes fixed on the sand, and the surface of the sand seemed to be pushed by what, every sand was rolling at a uniform speed, not the kind of life that lived in the desert all the year round. People can't find it at all - after all, sand is still sandBut Jasmine's uncle would not ignore the danger. He put his finger into his mouth, covered it with saliva, and then reached into the air, looking for the direction of the wind, and at the same time, he started shaking, not because of fear. But because of the cold, the sun is still dazzling, but the temperature of the desert is rapidly falling, and the strong wind penetrates his gerbil leather and tights, stimulating layers of small particles on the hidden skin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood there, counting numbers, from one to one hundred, the wind did not change direction, nor did it become weak. On the contrary, it was becoming More violentJasmine’s uncle paused and slid out of the sand dunes like a hurricane. As he ran, he shouted: “Sandstorm!” He shouted: “The sandstorm is coming."The people in the tribe acted immediately. They were not the first to encounter a sandstorm, so no one was too alarmed. The women quickly put away the tents. These simple tents are just a few wooden poles and cloths. They will The cloth is pulled down from the pole, then the wooden pole is lowered, and the spear tip is screwed on the wooden pole. This is their only long weapon, and then the woman wraps the child with a few utensils and carries it on her back. Everyone's eater is summoned over - they are constantly rubbing the licking needles and claws, seemingly restlessWhen an elder wants to order them to spit out the glue to condense the sand to create a shelter, his spider beast violently cheated him, although with the help of everyone he was lucky not to die on the spot, but he is likely to be thrown by people. Next - when all the spiders are not willing to stay here<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is making them fear?" Jasmine's uncle askedAnd Moussa’s uncle turned his head, and the elders, they looked at each other, looked dark, and looked at everyone who dared to question them with a fierce look. “The spider beast also has enemies in this desert."An elder reluctantly said that he did not lie. The eater was always a small dessert of the winged snake and the lion beast. It is precisely because of this that the eater will eventually evolve this surprising speed - - Although more people think that Moussa's words may be true, but now no one cares about this, Jasmine's uncle did not wait to answer, he ran to Jasmine, took her parcel and threw it on the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Jasmine shouted, the parcel had a mirror she had recently obtained, the mirror was copper, only the palm of her hand, and the surface was blurred. Clear, countless scratches make it only show the mottled shadow, but Jasmine is grinding it with the cilia on the spider's beast every day, hoping to polish it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care for this," Jasmine's uncle shouted: "We can't have more weight."He pushed Jasmine onto her eater, then his own, accompanied by a sharp squeak, their spiders could not wait to vibrate their wings, flew up, they didn't even fly very high, just tight Flying against the sand, looking down from them, you can see that the sand is moving in layers like waves, and they are still moving fast, Jasmine turned his head to find his own package and found only a few breaths. Between, it has been drowned by the sand, she nervously turned back, staring at the front, the wind is pushing them, her spider beast has never flown so fast, so fast she can not breathe<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just after they left the original camp, there was a white line in the sky. This white line went from the head of the desert to the head of the desert. Not at the margin, and it is still widening and widening, from a line to a strip, then from a strip to a block, and finally from a block to a face, it is like hanging from the highest point of the sky a heavy yarn that connects the desertFrom a distance, it is so uncomfortable, elegant and calm, but only those who are behind them can know that their speed is so terrible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of warlocks each bear the task of a front, their faces with an excited look, a cruel smile and the kind of lion beast They eat more of the "catnip" of this plane to reveal the color of the lameness. This is the peculiar pleasant feeling of each spellcaster who feels powerful magical energy flowing through the body. Some people say that it even surpasses appetite and Another ancient desire, and even for the warlocks who played for the Rinda Legion of Grenada, this feeling is not often felt - the caster has most of the power when casting spells. It's taken from the magical Milk River, but there is still some power from itself, but if you just use scrolls, runes, and wands, the power they need to pay will be minimal – tiny can hardly feel, but that kind of magic The energy wave rushes across the body, and the feeling of gushing from your fingertips is absolutely unchanging. This kind of enjoyment is in the reel of the spellcaster who is stronger than himself. For the wand with runes especially when the disk<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warlock glanced at the guarding lion beast around him, and the knight on the lion body took out a magical tool, immersing it in a frenzied storm, lifting it after a few breaths and watching the numbers above - this shows them The speed, according to this speed, they may need a few small grids to meet with their peers - the Cavaliers patted the lion's lion, and told him to go back to prepare a live calf with a gesture to This encourages it to work harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlocks also bear this heavy pressure, although the power of the wind in the debris allows them to cast spells without hesitation, but the spiritual power required to cast the spell is still They extract themselves and they must be replaced every three small cells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new warlock replaces the position of the previous warlock. He holds the rune seal in his hand. This secret silver rune seal has a warlock for each spell. One, they are connected with the precious treasures given by the "mother" Gredi, and the magic of manipulating the sandstorm comes from it - but the person who proposed this idea and turned it into reality is not the new king, nor his eldest son. Mitt, not the children of the Red Dragon, Kelmen and Kelsey, but the new master who can't be trusted by them, the new master of the new tooth, the youngest son of the new king, the black dragon mixed with the blood of the elf Descent. Thinking of this, the sorcerer's feelings are very complicated, they can't be sure for a while, the dragon's blood is finally better than the blood of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" The knight behind him noticed the strangeness of the warlock, that is, reminding him and warning him a question - after all, every knight also has The warlock who works with him all the year round, he does not want to change his partner during the entire chaotic period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very sorry." The warlock said: "I was almost fascinated by it." After that, he immediately entered the state of disappointment, originally with magic. The hurricane that has gone far and is getting better is once again snarling wildly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————————————————————<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich led the first team to stay at the center of the desert, along with their fourth and sixth teams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity," said a warlock. "The barbarians didn't stay in their bugs. They seemed to choose to run away when they saw the sandstorm." He came from the sixth squad, with scales on his forehead and a tail behind him, demonstrating his identity as a dragon. He sat sideways. After all, neither he nor his knight could talk to the new owner of Dragon's tooth in a rude manner: "Our column didn't search for their traces."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have nowhere to go." The captain of the fourth detachment said that he was not a Mittite person. It seems that there is nothing wrong with speaking on the position of Kremar. "I think our commander is ready to give them a big surprise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can," the sixth squad's dragon warlock smashed A glimpse, he asked humbly: "Can we get a hint in advance? I am really curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, the endless abyss is down, "The fourth team captain smiled when the lich came over. Yes, the black-haired dragon's mount has defeated all the lions and lions, but their new owners have not yet made a copy to make them convinced. The answer sheet, although he seems to have a very far-reaching study of Rune, but here is Greiner. They sometimes quite rude, and has been difficult to count the fun from the inside. "I hate you," he said to the squadron of the fourth squad: "But I must admit that you have spoken my heart - Dear His Highness, should we treat the poor worms the same way - maybe you should Need our help, tell us, it is the need for the knight's spear, or the magician's magic, we are waiting for your order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich calms The ground refers to them under their body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadron of the sixth squad looked down with the captain of the fourth squad. They could only see the slight waves of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I don't need anyone's help for the time being," said the undead who said: "I will let you see, it will be a Very beautiful sight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the fourth squad showed a smile: "That's great," he said. "I believe you are not." It will disappoint us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bright sky suddenly becomes dim, at the request of the black-haired dragon, each eagle lion They all took off, they hovered in the air in an orderly manner, and a small point in the whirlpool was Kremar and his mount, the wicked male face lion beast, and everyone’s eyes converge on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
