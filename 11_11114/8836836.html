			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone who is brought here will say that." The guard who apparently has a lot of experience on how to use the whip does not matter if the new one If he still wants to say something, he will also beat him to the fainting past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this guy is at least smarter than the last idiot. After discovering that he can't get more help, he closes his mouth tightly, respectfully And cringed down his eyes - the guard shrugged and pulled his self-hearted companion away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoner who tried to bite the guard lost consciousness, the whole body was softened, the chain linked to the collar was not long, and the iron collar was tightly Struck his jaw, he struggled painfully between half-small and half-awake, and his legs instinctively slammed on the gray rocks, fingers scratching anything that could be touched, two beside him The guy stood indifferently, his head and neck bent forward, and nine other people licking the piece of wood with a little anxiety and intolerance on the face - they were waiting for him to be hanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinners who are weak, injured, and sick are not treated here. If they are alive, they can not only pick up the piece of wood belonging to him, the other ten A person will add the weight of an adult male when he finally can't support it - but if he dies, he will be solved and replaced with a more powerful newcomer - in this gloomy, In a poor cave prison, reducing or adding even a pound, no, half a pound, and a quarter pound of weight may represent a person who can live or die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even if this unlucky madman is not hanged by himself, he will be killed by the people around him in the shortest possible time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards of white hair turned and looked at their last look today: "Why did the king send so many prisoners?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For our war with the orcs," his companion said: "Since the mixed-ball merchants sold the slingers and the drawings of the smashing to the orcs, they also learned to use the equipment to attack the city. - In order to destroy these things, our soldiers must go out of the city to fight, you know, basically they can't come back, it's a pity, it's all good guys... the first year for this We almost emptied the entire Thunderbolt, and the old lord wrote a letter to His Majesty the King, asking for more soldiers, but the last ones were sent to the sinners who were on the gallows and the guillotine - well. I mean, there is nothing wrong with this. At least we don't have to be too guilty when we push them out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't they run away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are the orcs outside? Strong civilians may still be slaves to the orcs, and these faces The imprint of the imprinted slam... Oh, sorry." He apologized to the white hair and raised his hat. When the white hair just arrived, they also distrusted and hosted him, and even drove him constantly. Until the white hair adopts his attitude, good conduct, diligent labor and amazing knowledge - he will write, read, and know the herbs very deeply - won a little bit of people in the outer city of Thunderbolt tolerate. He was allowed to stay here for a while, using his own herbs and herbs collected, writing letters and reading letters, writing contracts, etc. in exchange for food, and occasionally he would help them with dangerous and dirty little labor. One of the examples of temporary guards on death row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am not talking about you," his companion hurriedly explained in a hurry, white hair gave him a smile, what a pity, the former is I thought, if it wasn’t the brand with the dry white hair like the old man of seventy or eighty years old, he should be a handsome boy, and he had a good birth - he said this because the white hair is very neat, not so Black and yellow, slaves and civilians do not have such teeth. They can't afford the spices to clean their teeth. The food they eat is also very rough. He shook his head in his heart and put his thoughts back on the original topic: "In short, the orcs also know how those brandings come. If they are caught by the orcs, they will only become food." He recalled: "But what you said did happen. Some people want to betray humans and invest in the orc camp, but they are quickly disappointed. (Speaking of this, he smiled happily), the hybrid between humans and beasts, That is, the half-orcs will be driven by the orcs to the wall, using their flesh and bloody bodies to set up a ladder of attacks for the orc soldiers. How do they think that the orcs will be willing to treat a human being? Human beings are like them. For cattle, cattle are not used for slavery or for consumption. There is no second use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," he continued: "They are fighting for a fight." It’s not without reward. If they do their own tasks and they can live back to life, their crimes will be written off. It’s a free man, if he wants If you become a Thunderbolt soldier and you can fight bravely, you will get the last time like other soldiers - although this kind of person is rare, very few, very few," he said firmly. "But there is still Although as a former death row, they can only be a soldier forever - even if he cut the head of the leader."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered to the white hair Toot lips: "Fortunately, think about it, just the people we just saw," he said with an exaggerated gesture: "It will become a knight of the knight, what a terrible thing!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-haired guard smiled slightly: the smile touched the black mark on his face, and the words "渎神" and "弑亲" were clearly visible. "Destiny is always fickle," he said. "No one can guess his own. One step will go there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbolt’s hunting activities lasted for five Days, prey piled up into mountains, argali, horn deer, bison and wild boar, as well as countless rabbits. Nearly every household in Thunderbolt was dispatched to pick up their meat, blood, internal organs and fur, and the fur should be smashed as soon as possible. The cold current that can make the big river freeze instantly is coming; the blood and intestines, together with the oatmeal, can be made into a blood sausage, the liver is made into a sauce, the meat is dried, smoked or directly deposited into the hail - the hail is the advantage of Thunder Castle. First, as long as the cave you excavate can be more than fifteen feet deep, you can see the permafrost that will not melt even in summer. Animal meat and some perishable food can be stored for a year or more. More time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also the harvests of the serfs who have worked hard for a year, beans, wheat, rye and oats, some of which are just threshing, and some are ground into flour, There are also radishes, carrots, turnips, cabbage, leeks, lettuce, onions, spinach - grilled, sun-dried, pickled and pickled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Thunderbolt is busy, the elves are no exception, they often go out for a tour, that is to monitor the movement of the orcs, but also to find There are also berries and nuts that have been missed by squirrels and birds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have met the orcs for three consecutive days. They are scouts of the army, more flexible and intelligent than ordinary orcs, good at climbing and hiding, if the orcs are not ready to change Their strategy, this kind of exploration will only last for the first ten or half a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin picked up a black and white striped staggered feather, and he caught a purple-eyed pheasant on the third day of the hunting event. Every feather on the poultry can be sold for a good price - the purple crown can be made into a brooch or hair accessory, the emerald green on the top, back and chest, and the metallic luster feathers are woven with the spider silk. It will be a dazzling and fascinating fabric. The deep red waist feather is very suitable for decorating a lady's white and full breast. The silvery white and dark brown tail feathers can be made into a soft and small hand. Can be wrapped around a slender waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
