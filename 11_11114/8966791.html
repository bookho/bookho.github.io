			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest is not talking about it. He knows that there are many priests dressed in white robes in this great church of the Norman in Highland Norman. The knights think that Birdwin Don Clermont has suffered a great grievance. Although his balance has been overturned, they still believe that he will soon redeem his sins and return to the ranks of the followers of God of justice and justice. Even planning an action, trying to prove that the terrible crime of the crown on Bird's head is a vicious scam, the first of which is Norman's princess, Leona, who is pure and full of enthusiasm and hope. The child, if not the Crown Prince, was likely to be a pastor or knight of Tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he thought so, he saw Leona, the princess dressed in black mourning, no ring on her hand, no necklace on her neck, The small clips that were made in a row were also silver. There were no inlaid pearls and no gemstones. Her face was paler than before the tragedy occurred. The eyes were smudged with charcoal black, because she was not alone in these days and nights. Pray for your father to the god of death, Kravo, to deal with the aristocrats who are speculative, to escape from the new king, Fukai and Princess Chang’an as omnipresent surveillance, and to contact those who are willing to speak for Birdwin. People, superficial, or from the heart - the former is mostly the admirer of Princess Leona, they are noble and have a superior family. For them, Birdwin is just a lucky coward, now the fate God has taken away the few scorpions from his palm, then, overnight, the poor gambler lost everything and it was not too surprising; they offered them to the princess. Loyalty, only It’s for her blood, and, in any case, the new king must give her a dowry, perhaps not as good as a rich wife, but it won’t be difficult to see, and who doesn’t want to embroider the king’s last name on the family’s pedigree tapestry. Well - maybe in dozens, hundreds of years later, because of this name. Their descendants can also become kings or princes - and the latter, they are sincere and sincere, the young people have little so-called bloodlines compared to the children of the nobles. They have a similar past with Birdwin, and some people don't even have their names before being taken up by Tyre's pastors or knights, and are at risk of being killed or eaten at any time. Although the former is as harsh and hard as the training and teaching they receive in the church in Tell, their bodies and experiences are far behind those people, and those non-standard equipment and books also require them. Prepare yourself. Therefore, among them, there are very few white robes, but as long as they can become the priests or knights of Tell, they are often the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin was their target, and their yearnings, the most difficult to accept him all night is also the group of young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a person who is still a noble person, but still biased towards Baldwin - like the young pastor, he is the nephew of the family, because there are too many brothers, he was sent when he was a child. The temple of Tyre - so he does not know that the world has gray in addition to black and white, and the followers of Tell are most vigilant that it is like a haze and a vortex. Although it looks so harmless and innocent compared to temptation, deception and atrocities, it is the most elusive, inescapable and inaccessible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest stood on the way to Princess Liona’s imperative, he saluted the princess and held it into a fist, and the boxing was the silver of Tyre Hammer and the balance, Leona stared at the mark and suddenly moved away from sight. Her eyes were sore and sore, like a silky thread that hurt her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please let go," Liona said: "I came to worship Tell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell's Church is open to everyone who is willing to uphold justice and justice, my Highness." The priest said gently, as if he had never noticed the princess's rudeness: "But I want to remind you. , "Mididique may not be able to come to the appointment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona looked up, her eyes burning with angry flames, when you reflected in her In your eyes, you will be burned by raging fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Ann, German..." The priest calmly and quietly reported the young people who had originally agreed with Leona to meet in the church. name. "They can't come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are they?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the confession room "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have nothing to confess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are guiding them to go astray "The priest said, "Their balance is leaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they are not guilty!" Liona grabbed her hands, Tyre's The sacred hall is vast and empty, and her voice reverberates repeatedly...no sin, no sin, no sin, how much she hopes her prayers can be conveyed to the fair Tyre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Princess Leona," said Tyre’s priest, “What do you think is Tyre’s justice?—I can’t say that I’ve already understood When I arrived at the will of my god, I can only say that Princess Leona, the most two kinds of crimes I have seen in my life for hundreds of years - the first one is the evil deeds from good intentions, the second , is a good deed from the malicious, they are the chips at both ends of the balance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand..." Norman's princess muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Take a small example, Your Highness, there was a knight, and the army he led led through a village and found that there was a kind of incurable incurable, several days. Or a plague that can be killed in a day and can be quickly transmitted through air and water, and the villagers do not believe that the plague is irreparable. They insist on fleeing to the city, and there are nearly 30,000 people in the city. It's you, what do you do... you can think about it, don't rush to answer, I can tell the knight what he did - he killed all the people in the village and burned the village - this is In a good faith, his balance was completely overturned within a few days.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the good deeds, I see a lot of things like this, but This reminds me of something I have seen in this broken book - about how the lich gets salvation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona is obviously frightened "How can the lich be redeemed?" I want to continue to listen to them, if a called evil Lich evil of salvation can be obtained, then the temperature Byrd wants to return to the Gentile church will not be a very difficult thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If a lich saves a person's life," the priest smiled and said: "But it must be completely selfless, he can't In order to save yourself, to save people, you can't use it, you can use it, or wait, and so on. In short, he can't help others for his own desires... even if it's just a flash of thought. It's not allowed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is simply impossible." The princess said that even a mortal can't do it, let alone a lich: "But if it's just a flash It will also be judged as malicious..." She finally remembered that she was standing in front of Tell's priest. Then I will gently throw the words behind in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of human behavior," one of Tell's most loyal followers said: "The gods are more interested in their thoughts. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly became dim and chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The genie is used to seeing bats fly out in groups in the low light moments. He once waited outside a large cave, just for a glimpse The local residents described the wonders he had – the wings of the bat covered the last rays of the sun. Now he saw it again, more shocking than he had seen before. When the gray-white fruit bats spread their wings, they were able to cover a seven- or eight-year-old child, and their number reached hundreds of times - people panicked into their own house, but the bats immediately took their Climb in the chimney or grab the wooden window embedded in the earth wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Bydwin, Kerry and Kreima are not enough, and the subsequent Glan can only be said to be a glass of water, a spell-like spell of the caster burned several bats, but then they It was cleverly dispersed, and four people could not take care of the entire village. And if the dead bats are sucking blood before, the parts that connect them to the human body are difficult to remove. The bat uses the teeth with corrosive saliva to bite the skin, find the blood vessels with the sensitive tongue, and then roll up the tongue to make it change. Into a hollow straw - once it dies, its tongue will become extremely hard, and the priest of Ilmot will forcibly pull out one, and the wound immediately swells a lot of thick blood, he rushes to Il Mott prayed, hoping to get a healing spell, while sprinkling the ash of wood into the wound. Usually they always play a role, but this time I don't know what it is because the blood will clean the wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are things in the saliva of these bats that prohibit blood clotting." The thief came over and glanced and said that Kerry had given him a dagger of fine gold. It was the one that Kremar saw in that room, and the thief’s favorite with his sinister sharpness. He threw a bat into the wooden window and then smothered it. In the past, holding the ugly pig's mouth. Look at the tongue and teeth inside: "But before I was only..." he said vaguely, because he saw a potion, a red robe configuration, used to spread on their weapons to enhance their power, “It’s the first time I’ve seen it here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They are not natural products.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Perhaps." The thief said: "And..." He closed the wooden window tightly and had the door. The room suddenly became unable to reach out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think Baldwin just wanted to ask - this situation is already serious," the thief asked: "Why didn't you ask your partner for help? Although those powerful pastors are in the city, or in the castles of the nobility, I think, as followers of Ilmot, they will not refuse to save a village? What makes you not do that?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence in the darkness is like a silent silence, and then the priest screams with pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be nervous," said Gülen. "Don't be nervous, I just want to ask you, I am a very curious person, if you can't get it. I will be very upset, really, very sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can you not be now?” said the priest of Ilmot. “The outside person needs my treatment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The best time to talk is Now, I think so," the thief said, as if throwing a silver coin and throwing the iron-cut gold dagger: "As for the outside, you can wait for a while to heal." They, or Xiaomei honey handed over to us, ah, she is a pastor of Fro, but her treatment is still good, especially recently, Fro seems to be full of her."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing, heavy breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the beginning...the situation is not that bad," said the priest of Ilmot. "I don't know if the bat is harassing the villagers. They also think It’s because the children are disturbed by the bats and they are attacked. Later, there are more and more such things. When they come to attack us again, I follow them and follow their caves. You can’t think of me. What did you see..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing the bat," Gülen said impatiently: "I don't always see a dragon or a devil. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw a whole cave of bats," said the priest: "10,000, 20,000, or 30,000? Qing, I was alarmed, and I almost couldn’t escape.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief pouted in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if it’s 100,000, you can’t fight the caster, you can’t, but the priest’s pastor and mages can... oh!” the thief shouted. The rude words are worse than what he said before Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you have already thought of it, distinguished guest," the priest of Ilmot sighed and said, "Yes, I, there are others, I can't leave this village."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking at?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹲On the window sill, staring at a dark purple devil posing at the tail: "Look at the sky. The sky in the main material world is very interesting - you can See the Magic Star River?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
