			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of Kremar and others is a fortress that has been abandoned for a long time. The tower has collapsed, the wall is broken, and the stone bricks are full of spikes. The thorns, under the holes of shooting and observation, have a black trace. The top of the wall is in disrepair. The rainwater overflows into the wall, the rain overflows the hole, and then flows down from the edge of the hole. Moss once sprang in this wet place. But I don't know why, maybe because of the cold climate, they decayed, but they still stubbornly left their mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something creeping beside the vision of the Grinada, and the Cavaliers turned his head and found that it was a mud monster, and he sighed: “Can someone really live in this place?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Think about how fresh the meat is.” His companions said that they are all evil. The generations, but this dead silence still makes them feel very uncomfortable. Except for the monsters, they have not even seen a hamster here, a flying bird or even an insect other than a spider. Someone will come out and drive the living humans into the community of monsters, let them be big and fast - the knight looks at his companions, although in legend, the dragon tooth knight of Grenada is using captives and The slaves came to raise their mounts, but this is a rumor. The slaves are cheaper and cannot be lower than the cows or pigs, but the grumpy eagle lions attack humans when they are hungry and angry. Nothing - can only say those who are eagle lions Beast pecked out visceral or Jiaoduan head who is so unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Da Gong really doesn't know?" asked another knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I checked his memory," the warlock said. "Perhaps you are questioning my spell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavalier made a face, raised his hands and apologized. "So is that other people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to know?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to know more." The Cavaliers said: "There is a master about here..." If there is a sentimental sorcerer The caravans or mercenaries who come to "give" can get a lot of "things" from them, and maybe they can complete this weird task safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe not." Their Highness suddenly said, "The people who have greeted us have come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Shadow shadows appeared behind the city gate, the action was slow, the knights made a guardful posture, the warlock put his hands in the sleeves, a spell ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfamiliar...Guest," said the headed person: "I haven't seen it for a long time... I saw this... such a guest..." He said When the words come, it is even more strange - like a clock with a slack, if it is a sequel left after talking to people for a long time, but the meat they found from the belly of the wing snake is Is it fresh, or is the guest different from the "feed"? He has a cetyl wax candle in his hand that doesn't know how long it has been stored. It not only carries black smoke, but also emits a disgusting smell, but the light is quite dazzling, making people want to divert their attention. Only the dark-haired dragons can look directly at them without any hindrance - it is a servant, the style of clothing is old but can be called luxury, the complexion is white, his eyes are a kind of transparent gray, black hair Neatly combing back, I can see that he was the leader of the servants. When he saw Kremar, he actually smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are very few...someone will come," he said, and the words became smoother: "Are you lost? Or come here to find something No matter what, if you are willing to come in and rest, there are still some...the rooms for the Sir Alex and the Knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have not lost our way, But if it is to find something," the soul of the opposite world replied: "Yes, let us find a mage who lives in the spirit of dying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There is only one mage in the spirit of dying," said the servant leader. "It is our master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed to Kremar, "Please Come with me, go to the hall, our master is there, with the lady."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos looked at their temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They followed the leader of the servant and walked slowly. Through the broken martyrdom, a warlock looked up and thought that there should be one or two iron gates. The place, leaving only the deep black wide gap, is like a small open mouthless mouth, I don’t know if it was stolen after the fortress was broken, or because it was excessively rusted, dropped or dismantled - through the ramp It is the fort, which was originally a place where blacksmiths, horses and knights trained, but now it can only be estimated from the wreckage, but there is no sign of life. The two followers following the servant leader always say nothing. Hair, hoods cover their faces, and a rough gasping in their throats, with a creepy rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," said the servant's leader. "We are going to get oil every day. It's too wet here, look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He points to a place, but even if The dragons who looked at the darkness couldn't see the scene, just as someone cast a spell there, but there was indeed water that reflected the light scattered around the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also feel that their feet are getting thicker and thicker. This kind of dragon-riding knight is no stranger to the warlocks. Every time they stand heavy and become quiet again. On the battlefield, you can feel that humans, or non-human blood, internal organs, sweat and tears, and unclassified secretions and body fluids are mixed together and trampled on countless times. This is probably the case, but they bow their heads. When you look at the ground, you only see stone bricks, just a little damp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are here." The servant's leader said, and then extremely abruptly, lit up from the darkness, they were in front of the main tower like a tower. Stopped, the door opened, and the warm light suddenly enveloped them. And a delicate and gorgeous folding iron ladder flipped down from the height of the knight's shoulder. In order to guard against enemy attacks, the main castle's door is never placed on the ground or the height that the enemy can easily cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lobby of the main fort is as bright as white, the flames in the hearth are flaming, the iron pot on top is stewed with meat, rich in spices, tempting The smell is full of people's noses, and the heat from the fire is driving out the irritating dampness and coldness. Close to the hearth, two long tables are placed vertically, and there are twelve chairs behind the long table. There is also a long table in the position where the owner should be, but there are only two chairs behind the long table. This is a bit different. Tradition, because by convention, the owner should invite important guests to sit with him, but since it is not a lord but a mage here, then people do not have to be too nitpicking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, the chairs are covered with brocade, and the cushions filled with down, even if a lord sits on it, there is nothing to be discerning. And the iron pan with the width of the adult male's arms widened, I don't know what spice to put, or what animal meat, its fragrance makes the Greinada people gastrointestinal motility, even if they I also had a delicious meal before leaving the shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s weird, the soul of the outside world said, how do I feel the smell of spicy crayfish and cherry clams? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Because it’s a spell rather than a real smell, the Lich has nothing to say, in the scattered chaos of memory, he gets the most It’s about food. He deeply suspects that if the soul is an aboriginal person in the plane and becomes a wizard or a warlock as a talent, then will his spell book be recorded... Kaliga Deli Claws (for thin cut fish fillets), flame shields (for roast ducks), frozen fog (suitable for making shaved ice and ice cream, or frozen pears and frozen persimmons), etc., etc., anyway, in That plane, even a book that records a monster that can destroy a million times in the world, will indicate whether a certain monster is edible, how it tastes, how to eat it, what effect it can produce after eating... Sometimes The undead who once felt that they also understand the cosmopolitan's optimism that is similar to stupidity - if the dragon is also in that plane, perhaps their migration is only to avoid being eaten by those human beings... Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——So what we smell may not be an smell? The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the black-haired dragon turned his head and looked at his warlocks and knights: "It’s so good," he said. "I seem to smell it." The taste of fish soup, that is my favorite soup."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warlock strangely smoked his nose: "I feel like a mutton soup ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or sweet soup..." Danos said, and then he immediately stopped, revealing a smiley smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a mutton soup." The servant's leader rushed to remedy: "But squid, yes, squid may have a little, or some honey, we always This is the case, honey can adjust the spicy taste of pepper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it fermented squid?" The soul of the outside world seriously asked: "My favorite Fermented for more than three years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three years, many days, not more than one day, distinguished guests." The servant's leader said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
