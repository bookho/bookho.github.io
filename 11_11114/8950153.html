			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knife noodles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, the souls of the outside world know that now is not the time to think about this, but the enemy they are facing is true and this is far outside the crystal wall. The pasta has a fairly large similar composition - it is white, if you don't look at the arms and feet, it can be said to be smooth, round, elastic, Kerry's "Silver Crown" and "Starlight" in it They have deep cuts, but they don't bleed, and they close together in the blink of an eye. It's like a kneaded dough – it's drawn from the body like human bones and internal organs. The weapon was confronted with Kerry, and more than a dozen arms were waving in the air. Five of the arms were broken, and the sharp bones of the mouth were used as daggers and short swords. The bone marrow and blood were still seeping; the other two hands Grabbing the intestines, trying to entangle the elf's legs or clinging to his neck, the feces and undigested food are squeezed and pulled out from where the intestines ruptured, and the smell is unforgettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar casts a spell, the flame is not useless to this monster, but its volume is too large, the ordinary flame can only burn through the layer The thin flesh will have to die, and the new flesh will soon be drilled out of the surface of the blackened cock; the lightning is even less effective, the blue-white current floats on the surface, can't penetrate, and attacks the head position. It lifts up the arm to block, and the dense arm can cover the thin, dry head very tightly; then, what about the sound? Kremar tried it and found that the guy might have no ears, or had a pair of strong tympanic membranes. As for the other kinds of injuries that may be caused by low or high sound waves, it is not possible to achieve a more pleasing effect on this meat mass. Satisfactory effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, they are in a confined space, and many spellcasters must be used with caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar makes a gesture, throwing an energy pike, the glare of light shines in this small space, close your eyes to avoid being The spoiled elf counted three times while the appendage screamed, and then swiftly swung around the monster's huge body, turning from behind him to the side. That is, the place that was hit by the wizard's spells. The place is squirming and trying to close. The position of the bones and internal organs of the appendages is not fixed, so the Ranger only saw a large group of creeps. The powder is like frozen fat and boiled meat. He does not hesitate to stab the "starlight" - the meat is called, with a dry voice of the old man, The elf found it too late to lose balance, and his knife and the hand he got were bitten by the teeth that grew out of the flesh. If it wasn't for him to quickly nail the "silver crown" to the wall, he might be dragged into the body of the appendage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster had to rush to throw out the second magical rifle. The rifle tore the body of the appendage, the piece of the long tooth fell, and it fell to the ground and quickly dissolved and rotted. Kerry ran back to his arm. The Mithril chain arm on the arm has been bitten and broken by the devil's teeth used by the appendages. Fortunately, the bones have not been injured yet. The Elf Ranger retreats and fills a bottle from Kremar. The potion coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Someone wants to come down. The lich reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul from the outside world waved with distress. A flame wall formed in front of the ladder, and he heard someone yelling, and then more and more chaotic footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendage konjac crying, it sounds like a little girl of five or six years old, more and more creepy - its eight feet are Stepping on the ground, the adjacent flesh begins to melt when it comes to the guards that are not dead, dripping onto the person's face, or any skin that has not been covered by the armor of the clothes - once it hits The place began to merge as literally—a selected unfortunate victim waking up because of the pain, screaming when he saw this horrible scene. Exhausted all the strength to want to climb, his body is like a broken, violent back, fusion place... Please forgive, the soul of the outside world can only think of this. It’s like the cheese is cut and the cheese is pulled and picked up. It’s pulled out a foot long enough... but this weird situation hasn’t been deadlocked for a long time before Kerry wanted to break them. The whole body of the demon slammed into the human body, interrupting all struggles and screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thecaster and the Ranger then saw this originally fat enough monster to expand again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't let him take other people." Kerry Ben said: "Otherwise we will not even have a place to stand."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world sighed, and the big cough that swallowed an entire elf had disappeared. He made a new gesture and cast a spell - the gravity in the room suddenly changed, everything lost its weight - even the iron chair had a subtle tilt, not to mention the wood Products and pieces, as well as the elves that were originally light as cats and birds, Kerry is floating, the back is almost close to the top of the cave, only a few feet away from him is the small appendage Head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stares at the elf, Zhang Daman is the fangs of the mouth, the intestines are pulled out of the throat, but the caster casts another spell in the shortest amount of time, The gravity of the room suddenly slid to the other side of the balance. The arm of the appendage demon and the intestines fell uncontrollably, and the elf had fallen to its shoulder. More precisely, the neck and the arm were small. To accommodate one of his feet, but this did not prevent the elf from showing his exquisite knife - he cut the head of the appendage demon with a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the broken neck, there were stinking mud, pus and blood, and dozens of arms and legs were kicking like a dead cockroach. Kerry sighed softly and jumped off the ground. Walking to his companion, but slightly surprised to notice that the black hair caster is still in a state of ecstasy when casting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated for a moment, stopped the action of closing the knife and turned around with caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiny snoring came from the gray dough - first a little bit, the kind of blister that people often see on their faces, and then It is a mushroom-like white round head after the rain. The lower end is very thin and elongated. The upper part gradually highlights the facial features, the ears open, and then ten eyes and nostrils, mouth, brown hair wet, covered on the cheeks Around the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a woman’s face, a new head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has cursed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need your help, dear Xiaomei honey." The thief said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Plum is trying to shake the corroded iron bars. She forgot the pain and forgot the fear. She picked up the flesh of the black lizard with larger pieces of clay pots and applied them to the iron bars with smaller pieces. Fro's priests were pleasantly surprised to find them as the strongest acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the creaking crackle, Plum finally opened a gap that allowed her to climb out, and she climbed the iron with her hands and feet. The cage, erected around the body of Birdwin's lizard, and looked over at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are not attacked. Although they are also very strange why this prey can still act - Mei Miqiang stood up, now she is closer to those terrible little devils - several lizards are trying to climb over her, she is in her heart Praying and yelling madly, shaking a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bit of light on her fingers, and the lizards stopped suddenly, and they remembered that their kind was shattered by this light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey bites her tongue, she is dizzy, her hands and feet are weak, she still remembers one of her lovers and she said that the lizard is actually a lazy And awkward creatures. Even if some lizards are big like long-striped dogs, sometimes you can scare them off by yelling, especially if they already have food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plum moved forward and the lizards retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mei honey dear," said the thief. "Good girl, you don't want to go alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it doesn't make a sound, it's surrounded by a group of lizards who want to wait for her to rot. Maybe Mei Mi will stop and ridicule and ridicule her - she is the priest of Fro Not a priest of Rosada or Ilmot, how could he think she would be willing to stay in this dangerous place just to save him a little life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She continues to move forward. Deliberately aggravating the footsteps, or not deliberately, because one of her feet is completely out of use, she is completely dragging it away. In contrast, her other foot bears the weight of the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear," the thief said without hesitation, "Have you forgotten where this is?" He waited for Mei Mi to answer, he gave it. Your own answer: "This is the prison, and the prison of Wang Ting - what do you think is waiting for you outside? The monster? Is the guard or the fully armed knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei is screaming - she really forgot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The outside is in chaos. But it is not a peaceful place where the priest Fro, who has abolished one foot, can easily enter and exit," he said. I am a thief, maybe you have heard of me, I am the leader of the 'Silver Fingers' Guild of the Port of Azores in the Azores..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You It’s Gülen!” Mei Mi was really taken aback. She certainly knew something about this young club leader. She also wanted to meet him and get a room from him. Anyway, always It's much better than being mixed with a half-orc and a halfling, if not the damn caster... "How come you are here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like you Why is it here," said the thief. "But I don't think it's time to discuss this. I'm glad I don't have to introduce myself again. Mei Mi, I am a good thief, strong and intelligent. I have been in and out more than once. The house of the lord and the fortress of the king, I am familiar with this place, good girl, I can take you away . Children, safe and sound "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" You can not even out of the iron box "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"I can." The thief said, the tone is firm: "As long as you help a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What busy?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Turn over the box, but don't let it completely cover the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a small busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, dear, as long as you feel able to escape the entire guardian's eyes or squat back into the cage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei hesitated for a while, the thief was in the box, his heart was like a beetle being scratched by an innumerable beetle, but he knew he had to stay calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of torture until he heard the strange footsteps dragged by Pastor Froo, and Mei Mei got the flesh of the ghost lizard - she did This is quite skilled. She drilled in from the open gap. According to the instructions of the thief, she placed a large piece of clay pot on the ground, then slowly turned the iron box over, top down, still When the iron box slipped down from her arm, the thief’s curse was fortunate that the piece was at the junction of the body and the handle, so it was exceptionally strong and the iron box was as envisioned by the thief. Hanging in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do next?" Mei Mi asked: "Do you open the iron box? It has no lock!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you still use it? The thief can see it - thanks again to the faculty who taught him the skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An An heart sat down," the thief said. "But don't yell at you, dear good girl, won't wait too long." Br /> /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his arm and groped for the ground, satisfied with its flatness, and then the thief retracted the box - the curse cast by the priest of death, Klanwo, perhaps It can also be said to be an extra gift - this is the reminder given by the knight who is said to have come from the king, the cockroach, the thief has tried once, in this iron box that can almost drive everyone crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse of the god of death is very simple, the thief has already discovered that whenever he falls into despair, whether it is physical or spiritual, he will turn into a dark red Dust - just like the mourning of the day after the ravage of the wasteland, and then condense from the dust into a living person - in this process, he died once and lived again - whether it is dissipated or wakes up again He is weak and painful... What surprised him is that those serious wounds will not heal, but at least not so deadly - he can live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
