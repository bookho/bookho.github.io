			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!" The middle-aged mercenary jumped up and waved his fist toward the group: "Come on, come on, eat them all." Light!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the tension is sharp and the squeaking sounds like a shoemaker's iron awl madly from the eardrum into the head of Cremari, with The pain and the more unbearable bloation are supported by the positive energy of the body. He is still full of strength and sensitivity. All kinds of sounds, smells and images come to him. They are pouring into his thoughts, noisy and colorful. , fragmented and complete, fuzzy and clear, too much, too much, lack of weak spirit can not distinguish and deal with them, he wants to block them, but found that this is completely unfeasible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you really want to find a familiar adjective, the soul of the opposite world is very reluctant to think that the pain of insomnia has been amplified ten times, or one hundred Times, a thousand times - when the moment of alternating in the table finally came, he thanked all the gods of the two worlds with a sincere attitude that had never been seen before, and planted it into the sea of ​​faint consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired caster of others seems to have blinked his eyes in a hurry, but the eyes are closed and then opened, this body controller Already changed one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the period of Druid's change and calling his companions, Ranger Kerry has not moved his position, he has always stood in Kremar Behind him, he knows how vulnerable a wizard will be. The elf's longbow has been put away, replaced by a bright, white blade like the new snow, which makes the undead unconsciously unconsciously remove the line of sight - although he knows that the blessed water of the blessed water will not He hurts him now, but he can still feel the sting of ruthlessness. He deeply hates the weakness left by another settler, and an impulse drives him to take out the spells in the pocket. Book, remember the magic, protect yourself and kill the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last reason is that the sensible control of his soft hands, he reminded himself that he is no longer strong, and that the shackles are entangled, and the blade is the head, even if it belongs to a certain The idiot wizard's spell book has the horrible spells he needs, and he can't display it to the elf or the druid. In any case, they have a ship with a dirty toe. The cook is more worthy of being recognized by the "good" rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, he still needs this elf, he needs to recuperate in the Grey Ridge and restore strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to sit down and take a break?" Kerry Ben asked, the elves' keen sense of sensibility brought him a sigh of uneasiness, and he blamed it as a concern and concern for young friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich returned with a proper tired smile, the vines extended to him and gently lifted his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo has stopped casting, the black-eared scorpion dispels the rabbit outside the cedar forest, and the rabbit in the cedar forest is chased by the white strip, the crisis is lifted The rabbits did not get into the grass or returned to their caves. A black earedle landed in front of the druid, and the druid's hands were still immersed in the belly of a gray rabbit. The rabbit was one of the thousands of rabbits killed by the sound waves. Barrow had not found anything unusual about it. Only the black-eared eyes with bright red eyes and bright belly called a few sounds. Ruy listened, then frowned and reported that the ordinary people sounded almost no difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black ear squats on the branches while waiting for an answer, as if impatient, the druid’s response seems to further irritate him. It flew up, landed on Barrow’s head, slammed him, and even licked a few soft hairs. For this reason, Druid had to hide his head under his hands, he made a few sounds. The more screaming, the voice is very determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black ear screamed in a very humanistic gesture, flapping his wings and flying away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Kerry asked with a smile: "What did you promise? Barro, it is not a good habit to deceive friends." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't violate my promise," Barro grinned. "I promised them fifty pigs, but they still want rabbits. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the rabbit expensive?" one of the businessmen asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has nothing to do with money," the druid’s subsequent answer changed the face of all but the elves and the wizard: "I am worried that this will be a The new plague."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The plague!" Fout exclaimed, he grabbed his throat, like the rabbit meat he wanted to eat last night. Spit it out, and no one else can go anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not sure yet," Druid said. "Except for those big rabbits that are discolored, other rabbits don't seem to have changed. They have no meat in their stomachs, only grass, and they still retain their original instinct and nature. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then you better find out the real reason," Kerry said: "If the lord knows, he will definitely release the task. Kill all the rabbits in the hills."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They returned to the camp after confirming that they would no longer run a rabbit who dared to gnash at humans. The horses were all killed, the caravan was bitten, and the dye buckets were not protected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants had a slight commotion when they learned that they were asked to return to Bituminburg together, but this was not a request but a request, especially After the one-eyed mercenary who wanted to leave quietly was forced back to the camp by a group of raging white strips, even the whispering complaints and doubts disappeared—they sorted out their belongings, and several merchants were never completely A half gallon was recovered from the leaking dye bucket, and a gallon of dye was taken in the unowned water bladder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A businessman found his own In the pot and the cup, Barrow made two gallons of water. Kerry had added a drop of winter honey to the pot, and gave it to the hungry, thirsty, flustered human, and then poured the remaining half of the bottle into the black hair. In the mage's cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer took it over without a drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about them?" asked the one-eyed mercenary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever eaten a rabbit?" Barro asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course no, Kerry and Cremari will continue their journey, but the hills have become a less secure place. Leo conveyed the advice of his mentor. They were suggested to go southwest. It seemed to run counter to the White Tower, but as long as they walked for about ten miles, they could enter a nameless dark river. This dark river is slender and secret, with The inland rivers of the White Tower are connected and often used by some smugglers to transport goods or people. One of them just owes the Alva Master a small man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the promised voucher." Leo said, handing Kerry's square bronze medal with a number of letters with tails and tails . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the Dark River is hidden in a pocket-like cave. The cave is dark and empty, damp and cold, and there are a few glowing moss on the rock wall and the top. There is a small boat in the dark river, no masts and no paddles. They were greeted by a pair of eccentric, glamorous pygmy brothers who carefully examined the bronze medals, not so politely exchanged in their own language for a long time - the same people who did not expect to stand in front of them Familiar with and good at gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf and the wizard were finally allowed to board the ship. It was an hour later. The boat was not too big, but it was wide and flat, and a gnome gave them a hug. Two soft and warm rabbit skin blankets came. "You... can sleep on it," he said in a blunt idiom: "But not allowed... go below."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer was satisfactory. He quickly drilled back under the deck. After several breaths, the boat started, and the mechanically driven metal wheel plunged the water out, giving a gentle and regular squeak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich wraps himself in a warm rabbit skin blanket, closes his eyes and looks like he is asleep, but his ears are close to the deck , eavesdropping on the following moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first he didn’t get anything, the communication between the gnomes could never be separated from the tools, machinery and food. The former undead remained patient. After a boring dispute about lettuce-baked bacon or bacon-boiled lettuce, the gnomes finally talked about topics that would be of interest to the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talked about the rune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the rewards of the adults! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crazy Luther Meng...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting currency rewards 100 starting currency rewards<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crazy Luther Meng...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting currency rewards 100 starting point rewards<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;莱德历克<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting currency rewards 588 starting point rewards<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
