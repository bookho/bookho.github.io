			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What is the problem with this name? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This is a variant name, the Lich says, the devil, the demon, the dragon, the elf, and the powerful caster, their names have power, know it People are likely to use it to summon, control and control them, so when they have to let others know their names, they will change and extend another name for their original name, but the name must be the same as the original name. There is a close relationship, that is, you can't tell others that you are called Tom or Jerry, unless you originally called the name; otherwise, the vows made under this name, the agreement made, the deeds signed or given The curse and blessings will be judged as invalid - you can refer to Kerry Ben, his original name should be Keller, which is the meaning of "tall silver tree" in the Elvish language. This name was once noble and powerful. The king of the elves used it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Why isn’t Kerry really dangerous? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Don’t be stupid, the Lich said that both Kerry and Keller are pronounced in lingua franca, Elven is... He sends out a few It sounds similar to Kerry, but it has more syllables, but it is a few words, but the souls of the outside world are almost the same - this is my reverse, but there is no way to determine Which one, the undead who used to say with a little disappointment - even so, only a few people can go this step, to do this, you must be smart enough and have a lingua franca and elf language Extremely profound understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The teacher of Yadel Brother is not an elf, right? The soul of the alien world thinks for a while, otherwise you will not be so nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I was not nervous, the lich immediately retorted, just a little... bored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What is the name of his variant? demon? devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-No, the Lich said, it is a dragon, his name is a variant of the dragon language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the soul of the opposite world thinks that his unwilling companion is really a master. He is not only proficient in Elvish but also knows the dragon language, and he Xue Shou is still dying in the hustle and bustle of the lingua franca. He is ashamed and considers more points that the words want to know, especially the dragon language. How does the human vocal cords make the sound of the dragons? When there is a world of difference? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- So the variant names are pronounced in the lingua franca, the Lich says, and as long as it is a humanoid, you can speak the lingua franca. This can be discussed later, to wake up the white robe, Fenway is coming. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar just opened the door, Fenway rushed into the room with his dark green robes, his attention was almost entirely On the box, the slightly rude action can be said to be "take" rather than "take". Yadel looked at him unhappyly and checked the locks and seals of the box over and over again - and Fenway did not notice. The mood of the white robe, he considered whether he should set up a secret and stable bridge between them as proposed by the White Tower Archon to avoid this happening again - when he heard Rosada When the priest brought his material into the room of another mage, he forgot everything with horror. He slammed Illy, although he knew he should not be angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funway left a sigh of relief, but when he left, he forgot to close the door and forgot to thank him, or, from beginning to end, He didn't mean anything to say something with the living things in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have he been like this before?" Kremar asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not before," said Yadell. "But recently he has become more and more violent." He yawned a big yawn, "You can lend me." "Will a blanket?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You sleep," said Kremar, "I will meditate in the next few hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," said Yadel: "May the god of morning light bless you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the god of morning light bless You," Krimari responded, not listening to the lich's embarrassment, like "cheap to Rosada, which is worth only a blanket"... He walked into the closed room and lit the incense, Sitting on the silk blanket with his knees on his knees, his thoughts were as erratic as the silk spit from the silver-bellied spiders, but he had just learned how to organize them and weave them into a frame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale can’t stay in Gray Ridge for too long, he’s just a guest and collaborator’s representative, and he has his own in the sanctuary in Rosada. In matters of business and homework, he did not rush to ask the Klima to give up the Gray Ridge and settle in the White Tower as he did last time. He only observed and released his goodwill to the greatest extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have a need, but you can't find the spell material here," he said as he moved forward the next day. "You can tell me, my brother is also a mage, you can Take the scroll you copied to exchange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the Fenway Master also trading with the scroll he copied?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Occasionally, part," said Yadell: "But more is Mithril." He licked the big brown eyes, like a deer who was learning from the fox: "Silver The biggest specialty of the crown jungle is not maple sugar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this I know," the lich smiled and said: "Jingjin, Mithril, Fang Lead red, they are the most dazzling gem on this crown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am leaving, Kremar," said Kerry Ben. "But before that, I want you to look at the silver crown jungle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They follow the Starlight River all the way In the north, the first thing to see is crack maple, a little birch and aspen. After thousands of feet, maples become scarce. Beech, chestnut, red pine and oak occupy most of the places they see. In the forward direction, a strange tree gradually increases and quickly replaces other similar types. In the end, you can only see this cracked epidermis with dark white, dark gray bast and huge gray xylem. Almost every tree is as high as two hundred feet, its leaves are similar to spruce, but not green, but a deep black tan that resembles black, with smoky vines or leaves hanging from branches. A large parasitic plant, it can't see even a small tree around it. Only the deep grass and the low and thick shrubs, the berries and the beautiful flowers are dotted among them. From time to time, there will be a pair and many eyes and ears sticking out from the inside. And listening, some belong to the rabbit, some belong to the squirrel, and some are the birds, and Cremari almost stepped on a black-crowned nest, black and black, but with a pair of blue eyes. Big Bird and red beak under warts anger towards him growling, nest full of eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look carefully," said the Lich. "You are also quite fat. Do you know what is a parent-child meal?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black crown screamed violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough," Kerry said with a smile: "Don’t bully it, the black crown is a very vengeful animal. In the next few years, It sees you will chase you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
