			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s different from the thoughts and the tangled elves. Since the day of the game, the white-faced mixed-water otter and its wife have become the long-distance guests of Cremari. When Cremari appeared on the river bank, holding a fish or honey-smelling fruit in his hand, the brazen, wide-tailed rogue would come with his wife to ask for food, sometimes It is necessary to listen to it and climb to the tree to pick up the pine cones or to open the pebbles to find small fish and dragonflies. In return, the souls from the outside world are fortunate enough to be allowed to comb and massage the neck of the respected otter king and the queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich has only seen it once, the dark brown, fur-sleek guy looks steadily standing still more than twenty feet away from him. The place, watching it for a while, determined that he would not suddenly become another idiot who could be oppressed at random and then turned and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another helper for Minamata is Kerry Ben, who also has his own tree house in Gray Ridge, and he has courses to teach - if we don't have Forget it, Cremari is still his student. After the end of the course, they occasionally walk along the Starlight River, and every time they encounter a hateful guy who is not robbed by the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's appetizing is not small." Kerry's eyes are sent to the otter to leave, it is full of food, carrying a delicious raspberry - Raspberry is only in May, it is the fruit period. This bunch of premature raspberries was originally Kerry's breakfast - Kreima brought it a nut, and sent it to him for this otter. A temper, but it did not prevent it from eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It has a wife too." Kremar said: "It’s weird, they’re still alive, and they’re inseparable.” To say that animals like and excel in show love, the souls from the outside world feel that they are not water, they always appear in pairs, screw them together, bite their ears, curl up on the river beach, lie in the sun, lie on hand Floating on the river, sharing food - the white-faced male otter will use his belly as a plate and float on the water for the spouse to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar likes the female otter, it is a lovely girl, she is very gentle, and she is willing to sit in Cray In the hands of Marr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably because they have children." Kerry has guessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he invited Perant again when he came to the river beach, and the druid was warmly welcomed by the otter as soon as it appeared, it and its wife from the cave After drilling in the middle, after a moment of whispering, the white face smashed back into the cave and bit a small otter - the eyes were still not open, a white fluff, the nose and the four claws were still pink, round It’s fat. Its father proudly put it in his arms. Really, like humans, the claws hold the child's shoulders and arms, and they are steady and lifted up to show it to the two elves and a half elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! This is too unfair," said Kreima, indignantly saying: "This bastard has eaten my fish for three months! But I still saw it for the first time!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny laughed loudly, and as soon as she stepped into the door of the room, she was picked up by the lover, and then Rotating, from the front door to the bed, the zenith decorated with gold foil and silk ball knots, the twelve colors of glass and the vivid alabaster statues form a beautiful and bright light band in her eyes - she was Placed between the elastic goose down pillows, a warm and sturdy body immediately covers it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you like it?" The count gasped and asked, biting his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like, I really like it!" Penny said loudly, who can not like it? The whole room is warm and mellow, the black wainscot is engraved with grapes and birds, and the silk is embroidered with ivy, the small tables and chairs are inlaid with gold thread, and the rose fluorspar is not like other rooms. Fixed on the ceiling or on the wall, but placed in a large crystal cup on the floor, the cup is filled with clear spring water, which makes the fluorite light soft and unpredictable - most importantly, It belongs to the Earl and belongs to Penny's lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than that." Earl said that he might have made a gesture - anyway, Penny didn't notice what he did, her attention. All the force hit the lip that kissed her chest. It was hot and rosy, swollen and painful, so when countless butterfly-like sweet peas fell from the canopy, she was shocked, but she immediately understood - in the past few months she experienced There are many small surprises like this. Accompanied by the flowers is a rich and fragrant scent, it even over the sweet scent of the sweet peas itself, and then a few unspeakable but tune-sounding music - it seems to be from the white bear leather bed For example, there is an invisible leprechaun who plays with Piccolo and the lyre, which makes Penny a little embarrassed and even more excited, she can feel the slight and awkward shaking of the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A mage friend gave me some help," the young count said softly and shyly, picking up a vermilion that fell in the eyes of Penny. Xiaohua: "I want you to be happy, Penny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will be happy when you are there." Penny said, but she immediately saw the one. The face of Junmei passed a trace of uneasiness and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More happy," said the count. "Happy again, happy to be crazy, Penny, my lover, my goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said so And doing the same, he used his tongue to worship Penny's earlobe, arms, fingers, chest, abdomen, legs and toes - throughout the process, his eyes stared at Penny's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing Penny remembers is not so clear, she only remembers that she was thrown to the top of the wave hundreds of times, and suddenly fell from the top to the sly In the abyss, she was not afraid of destroying the whirlpool, because there were always two solid arms that hugged her firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she woke up, someone was wiping her body with hot cotton cloth, and Penny snorted comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;朦胧 She remembered Bydwin, which is one of the things Baldwin never did for her – she must admit that Baldwin is Love her, but Baldwin is a rude, stubborn and old-fashioned man. He has always been in a hurry, rarely talks to Penny, never said anything in love; of course, he will not play with some fun. In the trick, the way he expresses love is to give gold and gifts. The gifts may be expensive, but the people who buy them don’t have much thought. He probably calls the merchants, gives them money and lets them leave the goods. Baldwin was not good at thinking, but he was brave and fearless. This style continued until the bed. Before meeting the Baroness, Penny thought that there was only such a posture in this world, although she later learned from the priests of Fro. There was a lot of things, but when she thought of Baldwin, she couldn't help herself. She tried to search for memories, but she couldn't find the memory that Birdwin once praised her face or body. She didn't know if Bedwin was Recognize ** She is more likely he will laugh at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loves Baldwin, but she is just a rough village woman in front of Bedwin, and in front of her lover, she is a noble queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? My love?" asked the count: "Where are you uncomfortable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Panni shook her head and left everything about Baldwin behind her. She stood up under the support of her lover, put on her silk gown and stood on the ground of the alabaster. The ground of the stone was like Human skin is as warm and smooth as the Earl said, because the entire piece of pyroxene is laid under the alabaster, and the pyroxene powder will become hot like lava, and the whole piece of pyroxene will meet the water. There will be some reaction, but not strong - the only less satisfactory thing is that this piece of pyroxene can only be repeatedly heated 50 times, and after 50 times it is a useless residue. Penny forced herself not to calculate how many whole pieces of pyroxene were laid in this room. She knew that pyroxene was an expensive fuel. In her house with Bedwin, the fireplace was big enough for one person to walk. Going in, just to be able to hold enough firewood, she only has a small stove filled with pyroxene powder, so it is better not to freeze hands when going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a stream of heat ran down between her legs. Penny screamed in a panic and stepped back. She saw a bloody semi-circle mark on the warm white ground, her heel. . Penny was ashamed and almost wanted to escape, but the count calmed her and insisted on giving her a pastor after she felt pain, a Greedy Pastor, she is a full-bodied woman, dressed in a red robe like blood, "praising the sacred and powerful Gredi," she said briskly. "You got her blessing," she paused for a while and found Penny gave her a straightforward explanation after only a confused color: "You have children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona tightened the wolf-skin cloak, hoping that it would withstand the evening breeze still with a hint of chill, she and her maid hurried through the empty courtyard. In accordance with ancient laws, tall trees are not allowed inside and outside the city of this sturdy fortress, and each courtyard is filled with a military field at any time, so even if it is essentially a royal palace in Norman, you are inside. I can only find some low shrubs that are better than nothing - one of Leona's favorite lilacs - the holy flower of Sinn Nos, which is more rejoicing in the warmth and warmth of the South, but can also endure the cold of years. Flowering in April and May, the flowers are purple, white or purple, with a rich aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April, the ice and snow had already melted, and the cloves couldn’t wait to take out the new clusters of small flower buds. When Leona passed them, they picked them up. Put it under the nose, although the cloves have not yet been fully open, but have been able to smell the unique fragrance, it is said that this breath can make people feel calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona’s personal maids exchanged their eyes cautiously in the shadow cast by the princess, and each time the king’s majesty and her princess talked about her marriage, their masters would Into an unspeakable state of uneasiness, although she is a good master, she does not like to use a whip on the maid's body and will not drive them away for no reason, but she is ultimately called the Highness of the Lord - staying It is not an easy task for a noble owner to be in a state of frustration and temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness," before Leona’s maid gave her a hair, she seemed to inadvertently mention that her husband was being a little in the triumphal The details are distressed: "He doesn't know what kind of flowers Mr. Birdwin likes - although in general, we will let the people throw a laurel to him, but now there is no laurel, he tried to ask for a druid to launch the laurel, but was Refused - he told me that he is going to use 蔷..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
