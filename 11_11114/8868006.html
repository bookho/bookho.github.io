			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the darkest moment before dawn, the walls of the clouds are pressed against, the orcs attack like a frenzy like lava, covered with fur Accumulated solidification under the wall, becoming the ladder of a new batch of orc soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wizard wizard waved a large pot that could cook a whole buffalo, and the sticky black oil that had melted but had not yet become hot was out of the pot. On the edge, the orcs underneath are poured all over. When the human soldier in the guard pot yelled "Not yet hot," he took off a small branch protruding from the torch, ignited it and threw it at the orc who was still licking the fat of his mouth - these Grease is an abandoned whale oil collected from merchants and territories in the sea. The whale oil that is used to fry food is inherently cheap. After repeated use, it will be polluted into sticky, dirty black even if it is put into a piece of ice. This useless grease cannot Pour directly into the muddy river or the sewer, otherwise the land will not grow, the fish in the river will be suffocated and the sewer will be blocked - the lord and the king allow the merchants in the North to acquire them at a price that is similar to the free price. Just ask them to be shipped away as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So most of them still have bitter sweetness, strange spicy and miscellaneous scent, even for the simple-headed orc soldiers. A little temptation, when it is not so hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning twigs ignited the fat-filled orcs, who in the process of slap and fall again smashed more orcs clinging to the stone bricks Then there was a narrow and long orc torch on the wall, they screamed, fell, and ran wildly around - the orc warriors had to go out and kill them first, so that the formation was I couldn’t touch the stone bricks of the Thunder Castle wall before it collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human soldiers cleverly emulate the practice of the Elf Master, which not only kills more enemies, but also saves fuel and saves fuel. Melting and boiling the oil to boiling is two different things - the ice and snow in the eighteen ** nine large pots have been changed into oil, the entire wall of Thunderbolt has burned up, the new spare gun and small stone The device was also transported to the mouth. Twelve feet of smashing arrows and squatting stones slanted like storms and hail. The clouds of death were shrouded in the heads of orc soldiers, forcing them to give up their attacks and turn and flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard?" In the gap between people cheering, the oldest elf mage asked: "Drums."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shouldn't be the present," said with anxiety. "This is the first day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are more unusual things in this war." The wizard wizard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the orcs showed a declining trend, the leader of the "Blizzard" tribe watched the priest's brothers move a leather drum from his tent. The skin of the face is peeled off from the body of an elf. It is very intact. There is no trace of scars, no black eyes and stains, and it is stained with the blood of the same elf. The body of the body is cut from a dragon and cut open. The cheekbones, round nails and hoops are all fine gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you want to do this?" said Gersh. "You have lost the favor of Kawu, you can't even heal your wounds." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have given my flesh and blood sacrifice to the great Kaussian, he will listen to my wishes." Denver said that his face is even the orcs. It’s hard to look straight--the explosions erupted by the elves killed the parasites of the Kawu luxury waiter, killed the warriors and countless soldiers who had received the grace of the priests, and Denver was smashed to the wall, and he miraculously did not die. But the stones and wooden pieces that flew out of the explosion flattened his face. He lost an arm, a hand, and a foot, but he still maintained the majesty of the strongest priest, sitting on the four orcs. Carrying his leather pocket, commanding his brother to carry out his leather drum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every orc has been drinking the so-called "warrior's wine" before going out, Gersh is not very clear, but he knows that this wine has a very Small insects, when the priests beat this elf drum, these insects will get into their minds and manipulate their thoughts and actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just want to kill them." Gersh smiled uglyly: "Because your child is dead."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it’s not too embarrassing," Denver said: "My child will be alive and win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then he I can replace me with greatness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great Kausu will give him the harshest punishment he can give because he indulges human beings to kill a warrior. "Denver said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am looking forward to, Gersh said in his heart, but he did not resort to the mouth, Kawu luxury is not a tolerant god, so he changed one Say: "Is it heavier than you? Denver?" He rudely called the name of the priest: "You sent our warriors and soldiers under the arrows and stones of humanity."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have more soldiers, and the great Kawu will be happy to receive this grand sacrifice." Denver said that he and Geshe coincided here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesh no longer said anything, he picked up his arm and watched the priest and his skin drums move forward slowly, and Denver had lifted the nakedness. On the outside of the ulna and the tibia, rhythmically beat the drumhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small wars that humans have achieved before seem to have never existed, and the orcs once again launched a crazy and vast attack on the walls of Thunderbolt, unlike before. They seem to no longer feel pain and fear. Their eyes become red, their muscles bulge, their movements are fast, even if they are swallowed by flames, they are pierced by smashing arrows, and they are smashed by stones. As long as the limbs still move, they are taken away. The self-beasts can continue to climb without hesitation - the claws all over the hair climbed to the mouth one after another, the soldiers shouted and cut them with a knife and a sword, but they had to face There are so many enemies in the right, and the people of Birdwin are struggling to lose their lives. One, or more, erected bears and wolves are throwing at them, using the bones of the sword and the weight of the body or burning. The flames kill every living thing that can be caught - the only thing that can delay their footsteps is the appetite. A chest and abdomen is torn by the spell cast by the wizard, walking hard on the viscera that falls on it. Orc bit off a soldier's face, the meat down his throat, then slid off his vitro directly from the rupture of the esophagus, but he was still eating, full of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the Cavaliers and Masters can organize an effective counterattack, the wizard throws flames and lightning to distant orcs, and can cast protection and healing spells for the knights. But the wizards need the protection of the knights, and they must consider the use of precious spells - when the orcs seem endless, they will not stop in time for the caster to rest and view their spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Badwin’s little sister is one of the knights who can’t get the help of the Master. He has tried to fight for nearly half a night, even with Tyre’s care. His spirit and ** have also reached the limit. Birdwin noticed that he ordered the young man and several other exhausted knights to enter the Arrow House, where there was a wizard wizard and the water of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizards around Baldwin cast a spell, and the missiles flew over a few orcs that they must pass, and Xiao Yan walked with his companions. Going to the Arrow House, the soldiers on the arrow tower arched down to ensure their safety. While shouting and urging, Xiao Yan was the last one to step on the ladder. The shouting suddenly became big and fierce. He was given a piece before he understood the meaning. Huge shadows shrouded - a nine-foot-high orc warrior climbed the wall, human arrows penetrated his nose and arms, burned by blood and fur-covered backs, exuding coke and smell. But he was unaware of it, only grasping the ankles of Xiao Yan from one heart and one mind, the young knight was lifted up, and the orcs tore him in half in the scream of human panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
