			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is calm and elegant, this room full of ten giants dancing in it is still more luxurious than people’s imagination - it is all-in-one They are all wrapped in dark brown and dark-striped ebony wood. This wood is second only to mahogany and purple heartwood, but it is used in cabinets, doors and a few wall decorations. The amount of wood and ebony in this room can make a count of the Norman Count of the Highlands go bankrupt. To put it bluntly, even if the gold coins are stacked into three layers, the six faces of the room can only be said to be like them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea breeze blows through the dark black window, raising the sleek gauze that flows like a mist in the room, they cover the soldiers and the mage well, though People don't want to become a scorpion because one or two layers of translucent curtains, but at least they should be placed between each other to ease the tension. A woman with bare belly and shoulders stands next to the lord. She is very beautiful, and her facial features are not to be overwhelmed by her aggressiveness. The strange robes that we cover on our bodies (we let me say that) are made of red silk that is as bright and smooth as a sleek, silky silk. In her sleeve, her belt is adorned with small jewels, and a cute and cute Mithril scimitar. Its shank and scabbard are shaped like a sea snake - mortals may mistake this The beauty is treated as another slave or a pastor of Fro, but the lich only knows that she is also a caster, and not a mage, a warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not surprising that the lord keeps this dangerous weapon around. After all, Cremaar is a caster, and his friends, especially the Elf Ranger Kerry. His heroic record can already fill a whole book of more than 500 pages of poetry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome," the lord said cautiously: "Welcome. My dear child." He sat on a chair with ivory feet and frowned slightly. A young caster who carefully looks at the brunette with an indescribable look. His messenger has already reported to him, and he has a certain understanding of this young man. Of course, it is not deep, but it is a young man. Whether it is a caster or not, a young man is always reckless and ambitious. With a little guidance, he will embark on the path you want him to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally sighed long. Then he lowered his head a little, and he knew that it would make him look weak and helpless. He would never pose in front of other sons, but now he is standing in front of him, Beavis’s disciple, a half-elf The mage, who is also mixed with the silver crown jungle elf, Su Lun’s followers, does not have to worry about being an evil person: "Child," he said naively: "Maybe you will be surprised." - But, yes. I thought I could see a part of Beavis in you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just a disciple of Beavis," said the Lich. "Not his son." From the outside, Kremar can be said to be the opposite of Beavis, a dark one. A white, a chunky and strong, a long and slender, even the color of the hair and eyes is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I think I’m really rude," said the owner of the East Crown, confused. "I thought about it..." He squeezed his hand. On the ring, "I thought that Beavis might bring his son back to me," he said. The complexion was grayed out and the tone was accompanied by a near-real sadness. "He refused to seal the land. I thought about it. Maybe he would want his son to accept my reward. But who can think of it? I lost my grandson first and lost my son... Hey, I I know that he is brewing a glass of wine called revenge, but the road is really difficult, I tried to give him some help, but he was rejected by him - I thought he would give up, or come back here, Holding my knees and praying for my mercy, the gods are on, I never thought that in the end I was told that he had been dead for many years from the Alvara Master of Bibi Tibao."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said this, the female warlock gracefully moved her body and gently stroked her slender and soft hand on the neck of the Lord’s fat, like a silent comfort. If it’s not too sloppy... it’s still very moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich knows that some female warlocks’ bottom lines are almost flush with the bottomless abyss. They don’t mind and murder their opponents, steal intelligence or anything else. Any kind of creature is related, demons can, devils are fine, if necessary, slime creatures are also in their hunting range...so, although they despise mortals, if that mortal can give her the materials and gold coins she needs They can also easily get their favor – but beware that if they become bored or lose your value, they will not only kill you, but also take your body and soul, and then make The currency (the soul gems) that traded with the abyss creatures or the magic pets that directly fed them all depended on how they felt at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this guy is really big enough, once the undead thinks, he has never found anything in the memory of Beavis... if East If the ruler of the crown is really willing to lend a helping hand to Beavis, the shame of the lich may have been found by Beavis a few years ago, and he does not have to do that tricky job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The lord sank for a while until he felt almost enough, and then looked up and clicked on the corner of his finger with a gemstone ring. "I think you can still understand an old father. I thought I didn't miss him so much, but when I saw you, the young caster, the hidden snake came to bite my heart again." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the warlocks around him like a grief, and the broad-minded lady nodded to Kremar. For a moment, the lich wanted to pretend that he didn't see it or didn't understand it. The scene had reached a place where a turning point was needed. Obviously, this turning point required him to complete... although he wanted a little prank. Some, but in the end this idea was forcibly suppressed by himself. No, he is not the idiot. The average level of the undead is not the job he should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," the former undead stepped forward and asked softly and softly, "What do you need me to do for you?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a disciple of Beavis, and can be said to be his son," said the lord. "Leave here. What he can't get will be you." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord decides to hold a grand banquet, more grand than any celebration The kind is to celebrate his 50th birthday. Also to meet the heirs of Beavis, he will be clear at this banquet the status of the black hair caster. Although the latter is a disciple of Beavis, he will have the same rights and prestige as his uncles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet was held in a closed hall supported by a huge pillar hall. The slaves lit up the cetyl candle and picked up the brass covered on the fluorite. The hollow mask, inlaid between the walls and the turbine above the dome, rolled and rolled, with the chilly wind blowing through the caster's black hair, the Lich's cohabitants eagerly extended their heads from the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——They actually invented the air conditioner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Air conditioning. The soul of the alien world said that it is the thing used to regulate the temperature. I don't know if it is cold or warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--cold and warm. The lich answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——How do you know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The fluctuation of magical energy--heat and light, and the magical fluctuations that produce freezing are almost fixed, only the strength and weakness, once The undead unscrupulously wiped the rune of the cylinder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- That...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I seem to see the elevator...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Tan Sen floating disc. The Lich said, don't you think that box is stupid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the traces left by the gnomes in this hall are quite a lot. The soul of the outside world feels like he is already home, he even I saw a microphone that was raised by a sergeant who had a white linen around his waist. Well, the golden microphone is decorated with gems, but that is also a microphone. He and the other person said a few words, then put down the microphone, and then lifted it again, and it was quite familiar to dial the turntable again and again, and then talked to another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--More avant-garde, the soul of the outside world muttered, actually no need for an operator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich does not feel that there is anything worthy of praise. They have more or less imprints of magic, but in the hands of these odious gnomes, he The most beloved magic has long been distorted. Become so vulgar and ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor and walls of this hall are alabaster, each of which is engraved with flowers and birds and a beautiful young girl. They have silver powder on their cheeks and their hair is real gold. The lips are dark red garnets, where the place where the couch is placed is covered with thick soft whale skin, probably only the gods (excluding those who admire suffering and poverty), the palace of Cremari's father and its mentor The tower of (the real one) can be compared to it, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people on Longhuo Island are used to using the couch, especially when dining, they are skewed On the low sandalwood table, the gentle body of the slave is placed under the elbow, and there are people on the side who serve them to eat and drink. In the gap between eating and drinking is endless dance and juggling, they will let the slaves carry the sword to fight, let Blood and mourning enhance their appetite. Sometimes the wizard and the warlock will participate. If they can propose or invent some kind of interesting torture, they will get a big reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put his seat next to me," said the lord, "my right hand side."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eldest son immediately showed a look of anger, he was a chunky and ferocious bastard, at least in performance is a violent and knowledgeable short stupid, his sight is like a burning arrow Ya had penetrated the sandalwood chair, which was originally his position, but he did not dare to resist more under the arrogance of his father and his master. He had to pour all his anger to the newcomers. On the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A caster, but what about it? He didn't kill the caster, but what frightened him was that it might be a caster with an entire island. Maybe no one knows that a caster has a piece. To what extent will the vast and rich territory develop? That means that his supply will be endless and free from any constraints. He can change all the output of the territory into his own spellbooks and runes. , wand and staff, and his tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the East Crown and the eldest son of the ruler did not read the habit of reading books, but he liked the bard, he heard a castle and soldiers How the caster becomes a king's story step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not feel that his father will give up his rights in his hands, public opinion will give it to a person who has no blood relationship with him, but he knows his The father is leading the wolf into the room, in order to suppress and hinder the threat that these puppies may pose to him, but his poor old father has become too dull, and he seems to have forgotten that a caster who has everything should be terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slaves had rose water, and all the guests washed their hands and feet in the silver basin. After they sat down, they had a full-bodied slave. Keep their feet warm in their arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Longhuo Island rarely use their own food. If necessary, they will use their fingers - but before the meal, the lord needs to go to the gods first. Salute, with honey, olives and sea fish, and pastries decorated with gold foil, is a kind of ritual, but more is used to boast of human power and wealth, rather than highlighting the majesty and power of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obvious, because the main sacrifice is supposed to be a pastor rather than a mortal, but when the lord stands up and prays, no one stops, even if it is a little bit There is no disappointing look. For them, this seems to be a common occurrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A banquet will last for a long time, starting with a light starter, honey and eucalyptus, broad beans, chickpeas, peas and lupines, kale Cook with salt and season with strong spices, some of which can also be considered a drug such as mallow, fenugreek, ramie and sorrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used for appetizing are some marinated olives, beets from Longhuo Islands, fresh clams, oysters, golden sea urchins, huge lobsters, There is also an exquisite dish - a fluffy sugar silk decorated with deep red roses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
