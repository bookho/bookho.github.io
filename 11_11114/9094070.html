( . .)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ———<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bismuth Citizens’ Citizens’ Congress will use a very simple device if it wants to vote on an issue, not fancy, Not complicated, it is a hollow silver box, a spell that is said to be attached by the most superb wizard so that it is not fooled by skill and magic, from the shape of an upright fish, the tail fins are separated as a support, and the fish mouth is high The highland is heading into the air, the fish body is about three feet tall, and the fish mouth is enough to hold an obese adult man to put the whole fist into it - everyone who has the right to vote here can get two small balls, one is red Coral, one is black pearl, both of them are only small fingers, and they are pinched in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that Harvey will continue to be a consul to throw a red coral bead into it, and support the Yaris old goat to throw a Black pearl beads, all the procedures - from the wooden raft that carries the silver box, to the open raft, take out the silver box, turn it upside down, shake it, and let everyone hear that it was really empty in the original. Then, a blind person puts it on the pedestal by hand. The members of the parliament will throw small balls in order according to their height, qualifications, and temperament. No one knows what they have hidden in their hands. It also avoids the decisions made by people and hurts and isolates them - Master Alva puts his hands in his sleeves. He is the last one to put in a small ball. It is not that he does not have the qualification to stand in the top ten, but Things have become less important, since his friends have made his choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone dropped the ball, a person who couldn’t speak took a huge silver plate and then turned the silver box upside down, fifty The ball slid in the drums inside, and the locals fell on the plate, almost no need to count, as long as there are eyes, the black ball can greatly exceed the red ball, surrounded by the silver plate. Members of Parliament, most of them have a look of joy, some people are exposed, and Aubrey and the people around him show a hateful look, but Yaris can not care about this painless The little thing, he has got the results he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He triumphantly straightened his body, "Thirty-two to nineteen, obviously," he forced Aubrey, and Harvey, but when he was in Elva, he licked his lips with guilty conscience: "Now I am Bi "The ruling officer of the dynasty," he looked around. "Who has any objections?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one, this result is more than what Aubrey and others expected Seriously, those people whom he once personally met and persuaded him to hang his eyes when he was an old man. He has been doing spice trading for nearly 50 years. I don’t know how many changes and disasters have passed, but today it makes him feel One of the most powerless weaknesses. But it doesn't matter, Bibi Dibao is not a consul who has not had hypocrisy and viciousness. Even if it is Yaris, even if Yaris has deceived so many people with the illusion of Li Huagui, they are not without counterattack. - Aubrey knows why Yaris must marry his granddaughter. Of course, part of the reason is to humiliate and torture him, but more importantly, because he only has two grandchildren, in Bibi Dibao, Women have inheritance rights, and the leader of the Spice Guild does not doubt that as long as their marriage contract is concluded, he will die the next day, so that Yaris can take control of his caravan and business road with ease. The lords of the king, even the temple and the sanctuary, may not regard the fur as a must, but the spices are different. After all, many of them are used as medicines. With his caravan, That kind of herb can spread out at a faster rate and in a larger range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aubrey’s eyes fell on a businessman who was holding him. The latter was not very young, but his wife went there a few months ago. Mourning the wasteland, and he has no children - if there is no way, Aubrey can give his great granddaughter to this person... He also supports Harvey, doing sugar business, regardless of his conduct and means. That's right - Aubrey didn't notice that after he turned around, the businessman blinked in secret with the old goat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Aubrey, Yaris said in his heart, you are old, too old, too stubborn, you can’t figure it out, things The development has completely divorced from what you can understand. If Aubrey is willing to hand over his granddaughter to Yaris, perhaps she is a blessing, but if he is determined to fight against Alex, then he is the most beloved. The granddaughter may fall to a more unbearable level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s head is spinning fast, his ears are ringing, like a spinning wheel hidden in the ear canal, so when he is awakened by a noise, Very unhappy: "What are you doing?" He said, glaring at the people gathered in front of the gate: "Why don't you leave, tell the people of Bibi Dyke, their governor has changed someone? "He is quite a chest-high: "The good Yaris will be an unprecedented consul, I will bring them gold and silver coins, more fine goods, and plenty of seafood. Beef and cheese..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alice," a member of Parliament turned his head in a panic and didn't find that he actually interrupted the words of Yaris, but before Arles roared, his words were tied to the fur businessman's neck like a noose. Top: "We can't get out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is in a mischief?" Yaris pushed the chair away: "Soldier, open the door." He ordered But what scared him was that the soldier did not move. He grabbed the soldier's spear as soon as he raised his hand, preparing to give the soldier who dared to ignore the commander's command a heavy slap, but he stopped the next moment. All the movements - in addition to the cold eyes of the soldiers, and his face, Alex remembered that he often opened his face outside Harvey's study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biyindi has its own army, but Harvey was the leader of a mercenary group before he became the governor of Bituminburg. These people did not leave after he became the governor of Bitumil, but became his guard. The consuls’ salary was considerable, and these people were only about 100 people, giving them a rich and peaceful life. There is no need to use the inner bank of Bituminburg, and Harvey has never levied new blood into this Guard, so many people think that Harvey built this Guard, but he did not want his former partners to become sluts. Or thieves only, but now, these people silently replaced the soldiers in the Chamber of Justice overnight, becoming the most powerful killer in the hands of the former governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they are all weather-beaten, and they don’t seem to match the chain and the weapons, but they are not the ones who have never seen blood and death before. Young people, and they are absolutely loyal to Harvey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do first!" Yaris screamed sternly: "Do you want to violate the laws of Beitburg, let us change the result of the vote?" No, this is impossible, Harvey, you don't think about it! You are no longer a consul..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvey is still sitting in his chair On the top, he squinted slightly, very tired and bored, but he still has to do the following things: "There is no vote," he said. "There are no members, no consuls."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about? Harvey?" What surprised people was that this time they asked Harvey whether it was Yaris, but Aubrey. "What is called no voting, no parliament, no consul?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvey slightly silent for a while: "Bibi Dibao will become a duchy. He said: "It is no longer a free city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha, the Principality?" Yaris shook his head in disbelief: "Who is the grandfather, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I." Harvey He said, he looked up, hard and slow, like the crown full of thorns has been worn on his head: "I will be the first Grand Duke of the Principality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the anti-theft section, updated before 10 am tomorrow. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bismuth Citizens’ Congress will use a very simple device if it is to vote for an issue, not fancy, nor complicated. It's a hollow silver box, a spell that is said to be attached by the most superb wizards so that it won't be fooled by skill and magic. It looks like an upright fish, with the tail fins as a support, and the fish mouth facing high. In the air, the fish is about three feet tall, and the fish mouth is enough to hold an obese adult man to put the whole fist into it - everyone who has the right to vote here can get two small balls, one is red coral, One is a black pearl, and both are only small as small fingers, and they are pinched in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that Harvey will continue to be a consul to throw a red coral bead into it, and support the Yaris old goat to throw a Black pearl beads, all the procedures - from the wooden raft that carries the silver box, to the open raft, take out the silver box, turn it upside down, shake it, and let everyone hear that it was really empty in the original. Then, a blind person puts it on the pedestal by hand. The members of the parliament will throw small balls in order according to their height, qualifications, and temperament. No one knows what they have hidden in their hands. It also avoids the decisions made by people and hurts and isolates them - Master Alva puts his hands in his sleeves. He is the last one to put in a small ball. It is not that he does not have the qualification to stand in the top ten, but Things have become less important, since his friends have made his choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone dropped the ball, a person who couldn’t speak took a huge silver plate and then turned the silver box upside down, fifty The ball slid in the drums inside, and the locals fell on the plate, almost no need to count, as long as there are eyes, the black ball far exceeds the red ball, surrounded by the silver plate. Most of the lawmakers showed an unhappy look. Some people were exposed, and Aubrey and the people around him showed abhorrent eyes, but Alex could not care about this painlessness. Itching little things, he has got the results he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
