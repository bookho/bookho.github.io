			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the giants discovered that the things that descended from the sky were neither stones nor feces, but the glittering gold, they all went mad, their huge bodies were It’s fairly broad for humans, but it’s a little rocky platform for the giants to run around and grab those squeaky gadgets. Even if humans shout and promise to give them more gold, they can’t take care of them. Yes, the leader of the city has promised that they will get the reward in the box after the end of the battle, but now these things do not exist, right? At least they couldn’t see it and they couldn’t get it. In a few giants, they even overturned the trebuchet in search of gold coins that fell under the trebuchet. At this time, the lion’s lion and beast of the Greinada people had already plundered. At high altitudes, warlocks and wizards throw spells and destroy fortresses and walls - this is the requirement of the black-haired dragons and the choice of the dragon tooth knights - when they see giants and orcs, giants and giants, and giants When humans have been beaten up because of too intense emotions, they did not disturb the enemy, reminding these poor idiots that they are still in a battle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one belongs to the walled city. The mage who is unbearable to the giants has broken his wand. The two are taller, stronger, harder than the giant. The elemental magical doll rises from the ground, pushes the obstacle open, lifts the trebuchet, forces the giants to return to their position with the fists that are constantly falling down the dirt, and the other clumsly climbs down the platform, trying to pull the vines away. It almost succeeded, but the fourth squad's eagle-headed lion roared past its forehead, and a spell that shimmered with deep purple ray hit the center of the magical actor, destroying the key character. Wen, it pauses there, and as the magic goes by, the light in the eyes of its dark yellow gemstones fades.It destroyed a part of the vines, but these were replaced by its large and heavy body. A deinonychus showed its head from the shoulder of the magical couple, escaped two or three round stones and sank again.But if you think that you can stop the attack of the Grenada people, it is a big mistake. When the giants get into chaos, the knights of the dragon tooth have occupied a part of the city wall, and the walls surrounding the tower are just right. Behind the platform, according to the original plan, the trebuchet on the platform was set up to enhance the defense of the city wall, but now, because of the distance that is too close, the giants, orcs and humans on the platform are paralyzed because of this. The short distance does not allow the trebuchet to function, and when they are maneuvering the trebuchet, their backs are all exposed to the enemy’s line of sight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Greinada's red robe warlock casts a spell to make the metal close to him hot - the blunt head of the alien soul in the port of Point Similar tactics have been used in the pub. The burning metal not only makes the enemy lose their weapons, but also exposes their position, but he encounters a sly thief who does not have pain because of the burned hand. Shouting, or breathing, he clenched his teeth and sneaked into the darkness silently - he thought he could wait for the next opportunity in the shadows, but he was not facing a mortal or ordinary mage, the descendants of the red dragon It’s not easy to let go of someone who is trying to assassinate himself. Even if he has hidden himself, the thief will soon feel like a small thorn on his shoulder, which is more than the thorns brought by the wasp. To be gentle, but the venom immediately entered his blood vessels, the little devil Asmodeos lazily pushed, and a prey that had been paralyzed all over the body was sent to the warlock as a special little gift. In front of<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock's pupil was slightly shrunk. He didn't notice the existence of the little devil before, but he immediately recognized Asmodeos. - In order to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings, the dark-haired dragons allowed the little devil to stay with him for a while, so that the known person knew that the little devil was his servant... the warlock to Asmo Deos thanked him and then pushed the thief to a burning ordnance, looking at the shape it was originally designed to cover the soldiers who shot after the battlements, but now its only role is to ignite This human being, the thief is lying on the ground, his back is cold, but he can't even close his eyes. Even the breathing is very difficult, but he is not so hard to let him suffocate and die - he is willing to die like this, but no matter how small The devil or the sorcerer of Grenada is not willing, the flame climbs from his arm to his body, the human body is not as flammable as dry wood, but it does not burn like a stone, he is so blind Watching yourself being slow Scorched to death<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They should wait for us to put it down again"Grenada's warlock complained that although he does not think that these mortals have the opportunity to hurt themselves, the spirit of the warlock and the magician's spells are limited. Cleaning the road is not what they should do, but he also I know this is because only magic can drive out the distracting mice and bugs. He chanting a spell and pinching some blood on his fingertips. The gray-black cloud of Mars splashes quickly from the ground only three inches. The place is wide open, sweeping through the stone-built corridors. When they encounter moisture, they quickly condense and change into a colorless stream that flows down, and the smallest gaps can't stop them from moving forward, but In dry places, they become unpredictable smoke. When these smokes are inhaled, the plague plants will sprout out of human blood vessels and skin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock gave the little devil a soul jewel as a reward. These two are the casters, but their order is obviously low, or they are mixed with the soldiers in order to conceal their identity, but they did not think that this is still not escaped. The Grenada people gave them a good fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil Asmodeos puts the soul jewel into the sac, just like an ordinary hamster with a nut, it flaps its wings I left the warlock. Anyway, there is mourning and death everywhere. The desperate atmosphere of human beings makes it feel like a girl smelling roses, and its small body makes it not attract the attention of many people. Flying along the city wall, seeing the warlocks and mages of Grenada have a rhythm, regularly cleaning every wall - between the city wall and the tower is an empty square, but driven by magic, a rough The bridge is connecting them, and the little devil glances inadvertently, finding a slightly lower place with black smoke and flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trebuchet on the platform is burning. Although the giants are as high as fifteen feet tall, they are cruel and human, but they are facing The knights of the clawed dragon and the clawed dragon are like a group of children who have encountered rabies, but they find that their arrogant power is useless in the agile dragon-claw knight and the high-lying dragon tooth knight. When the swords of the knees and the spears against the spine and the head were carefully watched, the giants decided to escape without much thought. They pushed the trebuchet (some of which are still burning, the source of the fireworks seen by Asmodeas) to the Deinonychus and humans, and then hurriedly climbed down the platform, but this time, by the flame The entangled vines that came from the heat entangled them. The giant's skin was very hard, but they still had eyes, ears and nose, and other soft places. The vines climbed inside and climbed out from the other exit. In the process, the giant's internal organs and blood are swept away by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do we need to keep some orc slaves?" The fourth squad leader asked, in fact, he also vaguely knew the priests and kar The extravagant messengers are quite embarrassed. It is possible that the beast god has formed an alliance with Red Dragon Gree, but the black-haired dragon shook his head: "I want a slave who can serve me hard, but the orc... ..." He pointed to the orcs who became more and more crazy after seeing the giants' bottoms - they couldn't fight against the Deinonychus and the Dragonclaw Knights, but they could deal with humans, even though they were companions before breathing, they were cleverly The soldiers of the Walled City were arrested and thrown at the vines. When the vines were busy cooking humans, they fled four feet: "I don't think these animals have the value of providing cockroaches, whip and guards." The soul of the outside world said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth detachment leader did not mean to be stubborn in this respect - he is not the father of the orcs, he made a gesture, several dragon tooth knights Slightly leaned over and flew out with the warlock behind him. It is not easy to capture these orcs, but it is much easier to kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the spells of the dialogue were revoked, the wind around them became sharp and sharp. They landed on a long rock that stretched out like a cliff. There was a police whistle in the city. They were stationed with thieves and mages all the year round, but now the gaps that have been given to these people have disappeared. From here, you can overlook most of the cornices, including the two towers and the attached fortress. The fortress on the left is the one that was captured after the cliff collapsed. It is also the breakthrough of the Grenada army. You can see the purple. The vegetation covers most of the gray-white rocks, like the cognac insects on the spider web, hanging from the giants, the orcs and the human body—the top of the vegetation is a curved platform, and the dumping slings are about to burn out. The soldiers of the Walled City are being pursued and killed by the Dragon Claw Knights mercilessly. The only thing that can be said to be called the battle may be the swordsman of the Walled City and the wizards and warlocks of the Grenada. The casters of the Grenada are focused on quality and quantity. The casters of the Walled City can rely on the shelter of the towers and the rich reserves of the past. It’s just that the soul of the opposite world sees that the three warlocks are preparing a spell around a small circle, which is a summoning circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keou made a sneeze, "I smell the smell of sulfur."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They To summon the devil, maybe the devil." The soul of the alien world said that he saw such runes and patterns in the lich's cramming education and knew what they would bring. As far as they can see, the first thing that appears in that array is the light. In many times, many places are only gratifying, but this kind of light is not, it has the most evil cobalt blue seen by the human face lion, then the pale flame, and then turned into The glare of the purple-brown, not the next bad guy is drilling out from inside, they are with Mars, spit acid, thin body, curved back, burr with mucus, they are rarely normal Humans have four limbs, not as many arms as they do, but with a worm-like leg or tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
