			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A female soul wanders aimlessly on the plain of mourning, the numb and horrified gesture is the devil and the devil most Familiar – in general, this situation often occurs in unbelievers, false believers, or weakly humans and humanoids. Only a few priests, paladins, or devout believers can hear the gods. The message left, and the latter is surprisingly low compared to the former, otherwise the bottomless abyss demon and the devil will face the lack of population and food shortages tens of thousands of years ago - the problem is that this soul is full of The magical energy that makes the abyss creature covet, this is not a mortal can, she is a caster, a caster who is unfortunately deprived of memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some warlocks and mages often do this to ensure that their intelligence is not leaked, and that they will not retaliate against the deceased’s relatives and friends, like this kind of beauty and fragility The soul is the devil and the devils' favorite. After a while, a devil took the lead and rushed to the past, but then roared and walked away with a heavy foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Another devil said that he was carrying a string of mortal souls. These souls should belong to unbelievers or false believers, because they can't find the way to the kingdom of God. They are ridiculed by the wind and sand on the plains, and they are worn out of the five senses and limbs. They look like a bunch of round gray white balls. The energy that the soul can squeeze out can only be said to be minimal, but because there is neither the protection of the gods nor the firm will, they are also the best to capture. When there is no suitable prey, the devil and the devil It’s not too particular, although their favorite is the human and humanoid souls that can see the magical galaxy. Their souls are not only solid, delicious, and nutritious – even after dozens of repeated extractions. It’s a good demon, but it’s too rare to be able to let them go. The pastor and the Paladin, and the priests will follow the call of the god without hesitation, and the caster of the old way. It is always possible to find another way. Even if they are not accepted by the gods of benevolence because of sinful things, their worst is to turn directly into a bad demon. Some casters who have already signed a contract with a high-level devil may even have the opportunity to retain the original magical energy according to the content of the contract, thus turning into a small devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the son of the night." The devil said that the devil and the devil rarely call the name of a devil lord or a demon master because they are with God. The same. With the habit and ability to listen to his name, Graz is a demon, and his mother is the 427-story lord night, sometimes the devils use this alias when they want to mention him, and the devil calls him For the end of Wuhuan or the left hand of the Witch King (because he is the lover of the Witch King. The devils are used to let their lover sit on the left side), more often they put up six fingers or tentacles to indicate this often It was mistaken for a demon master of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another devil glanced at the soul, which was like a delicious big candy for them. Unfortunately, the above has been marked with a mark of ownership. If it is only a powerful demon, they may still Try to snatch it, they haven’t done it anyway, but if it’s left by a certain demon’s lord... they don’t want to kiss the widow’s messenger at all, even though the strong and bad saliva of the black servant can’t cause the devil. Deadly damage, but even the devil will not be happy to kiss a slimy fly - not to mention the subordinates of Wuhuan are not slow-moving generations. , <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A handsome male succubus appears in the soul of a female warlock. He has pale skin and amber eyes, his hair is like a lava that is cooled, and there is a hint of red in the black. His hands and feet are claws with hooks at the front, and the center of the back stretches like a huge black like a bat. Membrane, but this can't affect his charm. The soul of the female warlock seems to be solidified when she sees him. She only makes a desperate moment when the succubus is holding her. The sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male succubus, one of Graz's lovers, gripped it tightly, and black smoke rose from his feet. When the smoke rises and disappears, the succubus and his master's designated soul have disappeared. The two devils who have hidden themselves have shrugged their shoulders and continued their boring work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the female warlock was soberly awake for a while after being caught by the succubus's claws. Her memory was deprived by Grazt, but her instinct is still there. The core magic energy hit the male succubus. He gave a shrill scream and gave it without hesitation. Ten times the counterattack, the soul of the wounded warlock mourned in the sky above the mourning for the wasteland. But without waiting for the soul that wandered in the wilderness to look up, it has been brought into the bottomless abyss that makes all souls shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The succubus has the right to reach the Wuhuan territory directly. After he fell, he was ridiculed by two female succubuses, because his wounds healed but still Inevitably left a trace of <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It used to be a Dragon Warlock." The male succubus said: "It is not surprising to be able to give such feedback."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So it’s really worth taking a bite," the female succubus swayed with the tail of a snake scale, greedily looking at the soul of the female warlock, this soul is still very fresh, And powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the prey of the Lord." The male succubus said sarcastically: "Maybe he will be willing to share with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female sorcerer instinctively took a step back Of course, she knows what the opponent means. No demon will be willing to share her prey unless he can get more from it - she does not want to be the night of the Umbrella: "But she seems to have lost a part." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the male succubus has been reluctant to spend time on her, and he follows Graz’s order to embed this soul in a tower of the Umbrella This tower is built with tens of millions of souls. Each soul has the feelings and thoughts of the living, and it is endlessly tortured every moment. The wind is like a blunt axe or a rusted saw. The water is a flowing lava or a melted salt brine. The food has only rocks and poisonous mud, except for the soul. They push and devour each other on the tower. Fusion, constantly crying, barking or cursing, no The statistical white head and the limbs are never waved. Their voices and movements are like a kind of sound dance. In addition to the strange horror, they also have strong and strange charms. It is said that there are some unprepared The devil will even approach the consciously. Then they are caught by them and become part of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock’s soul is immediately surrounded by evil spirits as soon as it is embedded, but her soul has the imprint of Grazite, indicating that she is black The possession of the king. When it touches it, the "limbs" of evil spirits will turn into gray fog. After several consecutive attempts, they can be said to be extremely angry and return to their original position, leaving a position for the soul of the female warlock. This position is not uncommon on the tower of the Emperor Wuhuan, like the jewels dotted on the thimble of the gold pedestal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did my father go to the main plane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male succubus does not need Turning around, he knew who was behind him. He turned and politely bowed to the daughter of Wujunjun, but he did not answer her question. The king of Wuhuan did not like the rapper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Dragon Warlock..." The man said, taking a deep breath: "It's good - where did my father get her?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question can be answered by Graz's subordinates. After all, the other party can also find the clues from the brand of the soul that can lead her to the answer: "This soul has signed a contract with twelve casters. The contract states that they must not violate each other under limited conditions, and your father. The mighty Ukrainian prince is their witness, but this soul violates Contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a clever misleading." Graz's daughter said, no wonder there are always demons or devils complaining that Graz is more like a devil than a demon. As Graz's daughter, she has some privileges. For example, if she is concentrated, she can know some details that the male succubus does not know. It is a matter of caution and caution when signing a contract with the demon master. The warlock was negligent for some reason - the black hair caster was also one of the contract signers, and the contract was completed after they left the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired caster did not leave the island in the contract, but the female warlock was the first to attack him, but the place where the descendants of the demon Lord were interesting was . Her father did not interfere with their fighting, but after the end of the battle, she took away the memory of the female warlock and imprisoned her - perhaps the wizard was more willing to let it die in the devil's belly, but Grazt apparently decided Keep a hole card - the black hair caster...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to see more. But a force violently pushed her out, she closed her eyes tightly, and black blood flowed from her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hand gently placed on her shoulder. "The next thing is not what you can see." Grazt said, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughter turned back and opened her eyes when the eyes had healed. Glittering with evil and naughty light as before: "It seems that your prey is more than this one," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I admit that I do have some greed." Grazt said that he kept the appearance of the main plane, but the size of the body was to match his daughter. And narrowed down a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The little black guy." Graz's daughter said, "Do you want him to be right?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little thing that surprised me," Graz said. "So I just give him a little help, not a contract, or a conspiracy," the end of the last syllable. The dangerous and evil father and daughter have already returned to the fortress of Grazite, and the king of Uganda sat back with satisfaction to his obsidian throne: "Just want to make the story more interesting to develop." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to admit," Grazt continued. "I am a devil rather than a devil. It is a lucky thing."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
