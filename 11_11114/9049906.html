			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous chapter has the wrong name...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is silent, Meimi lifts the silver cup to her lips, but forgets to sip the sweet juice. Gülen licks his lips, bows his head and looks at it. The coin between the fingers, Birdwin put the only hand on Kerry's shoulder, and Leona gently put down the "tobacco" sample in his hand, even if the flower is already a bit Withered, the bright colors are still almost radiant with her hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are waiting for Krimar’s response, especially Kerry Ben, at that time, according to the way the wizard calculated, he probably and now Like Marr, the little chick that had just emerged from the shell, Longhuo Island did not give him physical trauma, but left a deep imprint on his spirit. In the decades that followed, he was always guilty of his own arrogance, contempt for self-blame, and the confession of two innocent lives that he had personally ruined. I am still worried about it so far. Today, Kreima’s pressure is tens of thousands of times he had to face – there are 100,000 slaves on the side, and most of them are “bovine horses” and “smart hands”. The abominable pharmacy is controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Ranger is more worried about the other half of the blood flowing in the body of the black hair caster, from the words that Kremar unintentionally leaked, At first he thought that the husband of Aya Elf was a personal class. It might be a lord on the island of Longhuo. After all, Longhuo Island is not so far away from Jade Island, and the lord has almost a moving good appearance, but this speculation is very It was quickly overthrown by himself, because Kremar mentioned that he was served in the palace by his father's servant until he was fourteen years old, and also mentioned his "mother", while the dragon fire island only had slaves and no servants and wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master once half-smiling and half-heartedly thought that the other half of Crimare’s blood comes from the dragon, maybe the dragon is evil and gorgeous, they can The use of the dragon's body and the same family can also be transformed into human, humanoid bodies and other creatures, and they are never subject to gold coins and coats of arms. The knowledge is broad, talented, strong and beautiful. There is also a huge magical power, even if they know that they are insatiable, no evil dragons, it is difficult for someone to break free from the sweet net they set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the elf, the other half of the lineage became something that was irrelevant. The bloodline is an important key, but it can open more than one door. This is why the Singer is willing to accommodate other humanoid creatures and humans and elves. For them, there are half elves in the body. The bloody cubs are precious Mithrils, and then want to make them a dagger or a pin is a post-education work - they believe in the evils of evil except demons, devils, dragons and orcs. In addition to the creatures born in the middle, all humans and human beings are intrinsic, even if their other half of the lineage may belong to the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Kerry is worried about is that the patriarch of Kremar may be a human being. Kreima is likely to inherit the impulse and fragility of human beings from him - he thinks, the heart of the black half-elf Worth winning. But as a child for the elf, it can only be said that a young man’s mage can hardly produce some thoughts of depression and irritability after suffering such a direct and cold attack, just like those with dragons. People who have been on the island of Fire Island have wanted to help these slaves for various reasons, but when they are not depressed, they find that their actions not only help the weak they think, but make themselves In a dilemma of a dilemma - they may not want to get any return, but the result is desperate - the people they want to help are still the "bovine horses" or the dead "bovine horses", they There is no thought. There is no emotion, only obeying orders and instinctively calling, and do not understand how much the cost and effort their masters have paid for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last of these people will only go in two directions - one feels that they have been fooled, they do not hesitate to contempt with themselves and have been hostile People are angry. Think of Longhuo Island as an unscrupulous place. Even the lowest level of scorpion or sailor can spend a few silver coins to buy a slave. Even if you can't leave the island, you can enjoy the happiness of killing and killing in a short time. The other person became indifferent and rigid. He didn't want to see any slaves or hear anything about them. They didn't want to leave their own boats. They only talk to the eunuchs or the soldiers hired by the lords or the mages. They are more biased than the former, because they are the ones who really regard the slaves as cattle and horses. Which one would want to see the cows and horses and talk to the cows and horses. Or, what are you talking about with the cattle and horses? No, they think so, and they do the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter kind of people are not all wicked, some of them are just timid, so that they can’t face too much darkness and evil at all, and find that they really can’t do anything about it. Afterwards, they can only close their eyes, put their ears on their ears, and deceive themselves to exclude the slaves on the Longhuo Islands from the ranks of human beings, so that they can safely ignore and listen, or let their hearts be tragic in their conscience. Trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar may not belong to any of the above two types of people, Kerry is worried that he will go to the third is not wrong, but maybe The road to a more bitter ending - Kremar is a soft, cute child like a rabbit fur group. The gray elves think so, but Kerry knows that there is also in his body. Steel and lava are rarely revealed – these are covered by his good-tempered and soft-eyed eyes, but the Elf Ranger has been fighting with him more than once, knowing that the child will become necessary when necessary. Abnormally cold and cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
