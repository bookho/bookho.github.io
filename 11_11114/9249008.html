The sun shining like gold covered his face and body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down from the top of the tallest silver crest, you can see the elves’ royal courts, the starlight rivers passing through the entire white stone building and the jungle, flowing into the valley. The cracked maple and eucalyptus trees in the gray ridge have accumulated for a long time in the spring and summer. The torso has already contained honey in the trunk. The fish that feed on the leaves in the river also have a sweet smell. In order to meet the winter, new The Minamata group is busy all day on the banks of the river. Their parents, wonderfully have the same white face as a otter thousands of years ago, and have a fat belly and a happy family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the same shamelessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves have long learned how to cook fish soup without astringency, grilled dried fish, but as long as the fish soup rolls, the dried fish is aroma, a group Large and small otters will come unexpectedly, they will erect their bodies, their claws will be held on their chests, and the black peas will be filled with cravings, but... "Don't feed!" Il said with a shout: "They are so fat that they can't see their feet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it, how many elves and half-elves are in Grey Ridge, and there are no more than ten The number of fingers, perhaps an elf only gave a few spoonfuls of fish soup, one elf gave two or three small fish, but accumulated...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry Ben Haha Laughing, Il is glaring at him, who doesn't know that the first to start is the king of the jungle, and his friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more she is angry, the more she laughs at Kerry, the first elf that they were born after they returned to the silver crown jungle. He clearly remembers that when the invited Creemar gently picked up this young life and gave the name, they almost uncontrollably let the tears fill their eyes, they never forgot... Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn’t be on the forest today?" Kerry Ben asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn’t be dealing with official business?" Il said with both hands: "You handed over the official duties to Kellebriel!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s my official business to let everyone do what they like and be good at." Kerry said with a brazen face that is almost indistinguishable from the otter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't always do this," Il said, complaining: "You have brought Uncle Kremar to the broken, look, he is now Throw all things to Saler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have high hopes for them." Kerry said seriously, in exchange for one of Ilva Pouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time, in the beautiful morning light, in the squeak of the otter, a silver flying wing ship rises from the far side, from The wind from the whistling plain holds its wings. With the help of the magic runes, this 120-foot-long ship falls as lightly as a giant white swan on the Star River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slender figure fell from the flying wing boat. Kerry Ben embraced him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the birth day of Ilva and her adult day, just like every elf has to experience, she is the most carefree today. Desperately, Kreima has not left his Cree for nearly a hundred years, but she has also accepted her invitation - he even brought a gift, is an arc of the elf often playing, five hundred and seventy Six sons, very simple, the rose compass is only brass material, no secret silver, no gems, but Illu still loves to put it down, she keeps opening it, folding, opening, taking out the pieces inside, "Look!" She is pleasantly surprised Say: "Is there a name in it? But...who is Fenway?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world is amazed, this is another Iraq Ershi’s relics, he often took it out to play, but the small organs were the elves to realize, so I’m just opening one of the pieces, and the two pieces are engraved in the base of the piece. The name together - Ilva, Fenway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are they a pair of lovers?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...Yes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must be very in love." Ilva said, "Fenway, the name once belonged to a respectable king." She held the chess piece and thought for a while, as if she had inadvertently asked: "Salier "Don't he give me a gift?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, he is very busy." The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ir's emerald green eyes dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Salier Didn't forget, right?” Kerry asked, looking at the back of Il-Don. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The soul of the opposite world said, "But we are all very clear - Salil is not just a half-devil, his father is still a blackbird. King Grazt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is impossible, but Kerry couldn’t help but complain: "God of God, Ao, resets this plane. When, why not forget the bottomless abyss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world said dryly, "That is also his creation, we hate the devil, The devil, but for the original Creator, they are the same as us, maybe even better than us." Anyway, the one who finally betrayed this is not a demon or a devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was followed by a weird expression. After a moment, he said in a low voice: "I didn't expect him to end up doing this." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world has been silent for a long time: "He is a respectable existence." Although Io was angry, disappointed, struggling, but in the end, he Still chose to give up the self and integrate with the law, instead of really letting everything go with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ones that have been abandoned by him have been saved, the resurrection of the Kingdom of God, the abyss reappear, the flames of the dwarfs are again jumping in the Longji Mountains, and the hammering of the hammer is sounded. People in Longhuo Island and coastal countries can often see small figures of the gnomes. The silver-crowned jungle and the jade island are still belong to the elves (although they are no longer divided), of course, there are hateous goblins, orcs, giants... ...various monsters and beasts, and even dragons - fortunately, they are still only beasts that lack reason and wisdom. The ancient dragons have only a thin blood stream that can be spread among warlocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And human beings, in the time of an elf from a baby to adulthood, is enough for them to occupy this land again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As their footprints slowly conquered the ice, the desert, the mountains in the slow-moving time...the gods gradually regained control of their hands, but They soon discovered that although Io had been assimilated with the law, they could not do anything about it. In addition to still requiring countless beliefs to stabilize themselves, they also had an abominable supervisor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to say whether this is a gift or a revenge, Kerry thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, their old friend, the thief god Gülen came to "visit" this old friend, the look is indeed indescribable, according to him, other The gods, including the god of conspiracy who fears nothing in the world, are not wanting to face Cremal for the time being... Afra is very happy, and humans have endured many favors from this new god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I may go out at some point in time." The soul of the outside world said: "Not just leaving Crayfa."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to go home." Kerry said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said the soul of the alien world: "It used to be so close to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "That will be a very long journey," said Kerry Ben. When the soul of the outside world made that difficult choice, his last bit of the original plane was doomed to destruction in the anger of Io. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he will do is to let a mortal fish in the vast ocean to find a sand without any special features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
