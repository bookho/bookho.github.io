			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are adults saying: Dada has become big, the problem is that I have read the manuscript, it seems that there is no, Dada is a special term I have stored... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he also knows that a weak body can only become cumbersome. He absent-mindedly ate a late but hearty dinner, simply cleaned himself and took a good rest in the tent of Kremar (fact He couldn't sleep at all, and finally asked the black hair's caster to cast a sleep.) The next morning, Rosada's morning light just passed through the sparkling sea, and he woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have him a smile from Kerry Ben, "What about Kreima?" asked Yadel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is remembering spells." Kerry Ben said, "We will use breakfast first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Breakfast at the request of Kerry Ben and Kremar is very simple, sifted wheat bread twelve times, honey, seagull eggs, salt-cooked oysters, vinegar marinated snail meat, deer fried Venison sausage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich who regained control of the body did not eat anything. In general, the Master would not eat before the memory of the spell, lest the blood supply too much to the stomach. Not the brain, causing spell memory failure or error, although the current lich does not need to eat, if eating does not affect his memory, he does not know what is inside his body, but he knows that positive energy will Deposited in the bone marrow, running through the blood and body fluids, everything that the greedy guy swallows will be melted away by it, leaving no residue and not thinking that positive energy will be a good thing, too pure positive energy and negative energy only It can be said that it is half a catty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the spell book that Alva Master had exchanged for his disciples for another soul, and the spell inside was more than he returned to this plane. The first spell book that Lanner got was more comprehensive and powerful, and it was in line with his current needs. Yesterday, he came to the side of the island and hoped that the merchant who could directly negotiate with the new owner of the side island also brought some casting materials and utensils. It was prepared for the mages of the main island, but now they already know that the new owner is just a mage. Without the reminder of Dada, they will sort out all the goods related to the caster, and ask Dada to present it to his master. . Merchants are always sloppy and careless, and the specific performance shows the materials they have searched from elsewhere. Although none of them are casters, they are better than most of the casters themselves. The rose petals required for sleep are dry and complete, and the color is dark red. The brilliance and illusion of the wool is white and free of impurities; the pearl powder used in the identification is not only pure and fine, but cleverly wrapped in small paper, and a small bottle of winter wine and an owl with other materials needed for the spell. The feathers are packed in a small skin; the diamond dust and amber dust required for the detection and the ink snake emblem are better. The snake scales are properly treated, and the mushroom spores are sealed in a wax ball; Feathers are prepared several times. It is also marked according to the different parts of different birds...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Lich's critical eye is concerned, there are still some unsatisfactory places, but for the time being, these materials can save him a lot of time, and he estimates that they will be used soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is impossible to have no ships. Even if Crimmar is willing to turn him into a seabird, he should consider the time when the spell expires. Yadel did not die in the White Tower, and he did not die under the wolf kiss. The orcs and the wilderness have regained their lives. The result was drowned in the sea because of the friend's spell failure. In any case, the lich does not want this joke to appear on himself, even if no one knows the true identity of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchant’s boats will not return empty-handed, although they trust and respect Yadel, his herbs are better at treating some chronic diseases than some pastors. Therapies are more effective and extremely cheap, so they don't care that he is a sinner with a brand on his face, but it is impossible for them to violate Woking's teachings and empty their own pockets for others. They are still waiting for beet sugar and cane sugar, in addition to these two sugars, there are also fresh beets they want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beet roots can treat constipation and fever if traumatic. It can be wrapped with the leaves of beets to reduce inflammation and detoxification. Beet juice is also a kind of drink that we often serve for their guests. In addition to its bright color and sweet taste, it also has a refreshing effect, perhaps the effect is not so obvious, but it is still more than other shapes. The taste is full of bizarre drugs like ginger, pepper, cinnamon and other spices to synthesize the soup, soak the sparrow brain wine. Wit the boar bile on the belly, swallow the pheasant feces, the male deer testicles, or a mixture of two pounds of lizards, pine nuts, calamus and honey, and the men of Longhuo Island who often drink mixed cobras. Blood wine, beet juice can be said to be a very good drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with Dada, the goods required by the integrated merchants took nearly a day, after all, it was hundreds of pounds of sugar and thousands of pounds The beets, in addition to the original time spent on bargaining, after all, the merchants brought the casting materials, scrolls and inks that the new owners of Yadel and the side of the island need, so the souls of the outside world do not mind reciprocating. The lich does not care about this little thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My 鸮 鸮 舒 Shu Shu has brought my letter," said Kerry Ben, putting his hand on Yadel’s shoulder, "Maybe They will arrive at the Principality of Luzer faster than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is entirely possible," said Yadell. "Are you building a dam on the Starlight River?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Kerry said: "You may be able to see two new cities in a few years so you don't have to worry about the Grand Duke of Luzer, if there are elves, they will not act rashly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your heart is as pure and pure as the light after dawn." Yadel stared at the elf's eyes, and the elf's eyes were so similar to the blue sea under the bright sunlight. It was full of life and warmth. It is vast but full of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you still read the name of the god of morning light?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Yadel said calmly that if he put it a few years ago, he would feel uncomfortable for this, and now he can face the ugly scars, just like the face on the water and the front of the mirror. He was punished for doing good, but never thought about redemption or praying for Rosah's forgiveness; he was lying in the grass of the wilderness, but it was like falling in the arms of his mother; drinking dirty muddy water, It is like drinking alcohol; wearing an old and dirty cloak, but like a robe wrapped in a king, he is pleased and helpless, because it is helping himself so he never demands results and returns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you come back," Kerry Ben said: "If possible, I hope you can talk to Birdwin."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel cast a questioning look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He fell into confusion," the elf whispered, "although he himself did not know anything about it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale might have to say something, but he stood up and Kerry turned and found that the black-haired caster was coming towards them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning." The Lich said that if Yadel is a pastor of Rosada, they may come to a set of morning light that will always shine on you. You came to me, but fortunately, now Yadel is no longer allowed to call his holy name and priesthood, but it makes the lich feel better, even now he can jump in the complete set of queue dance in the sanctuary of Rosada. He also does not want to praise the enemy of himself, his own teacher, his own colleagues (although their relationship is not only). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
