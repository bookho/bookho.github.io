			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blunt-headed pub ushered in a rare good weather, no gusts of wind, no heavy rain, only bright and warm sunshine. A book w?ww·1·cc<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but at this time, good weather does not mean a good day, no wind means that the muddy air piled up in the hall is not The law is blown out by the wind. Without heavy rain, it means that the street is full of mud, blood, feces and other things that you can't imagine and don't want to know. What is the rising heat is fumigation of humans in the pub. The water in the halflings, orcs, or half-orcs, the smell of oil and secretions. If a shark meat buried in the ground for three years with salt can grow into the feet, it will feel I am so fragrant and fragrant - the only thing to be happy about is that the goblins and the mice hate the glare. They hide in the ditch under the corner of the wall, and the head is buried in the mud, so that people don't have to worry about walking on the street. * The toes will be suddenly bitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub owner feels that he is such a stinky shark meat, he is still sighing when he is holding a honey wine and rum climbing a steep staircase, anyway, He only took a shower in his soup pot a month ago. Although it was brushing the greasy water left in the cured meat, it was also hot water, and there was spice falling from the cured meat. He felt that he never So clean and sweet, but now they are all ruined by the disgusting bastards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow passages are occupied by a group of half-orcs and thieves. A half-length man picks up the gap between their legs and wants to take over the owner of the pub. The tray, but the pub owner grasped it firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Money," said the owner of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-orc thrown over a round pin, the pin fell on the tray, and the dull sound, the old dark gold was inlaid with green pine The new moon, at a glance, knows that it is not a pirate and a thief's accessories, because the new moon is a symbol of the goddess Su Lun, and the Rangers who believe in Su Lun are the enemy of thieves and pirates, and no one who is unscrupulous will be willing to The shape of the brooch is not on the body, unless he wants to be hanged by his companion or hanged under the keel, and is cut into blood by the sharp barnacles, chiseling shells and oysters. The pub owner relaxed his fingers and grabbed the brooch agilely as the tray left his line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy weight in his hand, the pub owner opened his mouth and made his face wider. Look at the book? 1?k?a?n?s?h?u·cc He flipped through the brooch while walking down the stairs, not so unexpectedly found brown blood in the gap between the brooch, he thought Among the few thieves who know each other, they are best at polishing and polishing. While imagining the look of Drake at this time, they spurred the favorite minor tune of the Hong Kong people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A three-masted sailing boat. Light as a seagull at the wave, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shangfan, my dear friend,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick as lightning, sharp with the sword,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be a pirate, really happy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The waves are high, the wind is rushing,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail, my dear friend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , fearless, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do pirates, how happy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are far from home, away from beloved Girl,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannon Rumble,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coward are shaking their knees,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗄!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t hesitate, don’t hesitate,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be a pirate. How crazy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shangfan, my dear friend,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the way to Golden Island,<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold coins on the island are like the mountains..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s so touching.?壹?? Read the book·1?k want an?s to see h?u?·c?c" The owner of the Sea Devil, a strong half-orc female listened for a while, then said falsely, It is a pity that there is only a sword and a sword in her arms. Maybe one or two magic runes are added, and there is no silk handcuffs. So she can only wipe her rough face like a shark skin with fluffy sleeves embroidered with flowers: "This is my favorite song, my dear Drake, whenever I hear this I think You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung Hom turned his face because he knew that he was about to laugh, but the power of the person sitting in it was the smallest. He could not offend the owner of the strongest pirate ship in Port Sheung, and he also offended. Drake, who was deeply loved by the Duke of Yal, this time the female duke not only took out a considerable amount of ransom (of course, in the consul of Bibi Dyke, this fee was recorded as room and board expenses, indeed It is a bit expensive as a board and lodging fee, but we all know that the nobility has always had no limit.) He also bought a new three-masted boat and gave Drake a sum of money to let him Recruit new sailors to replace those that were hung on the walls of Bibi Dibao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground casino in Mindanao, he made a bet on Drake’s relationship with the Duke, and he bet that Drake should be the Duke The lover, not the son, not the woman will be so generous to her son, if Derek is her illegitimate child, then she can completely detain him in her estate, instead of letting him squander her again and again Money and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the incident of the owner of the Sea Monster, Hung Hom was a little bit uncertain. It is reasonable to say that Drake is regarded as the female Duke of the imprisonment. After learning that her little lover was being smothered by a female half-orc, she must be patient, even if she had to endure before redempting Drake, then Drake was safe (to some extent) back to her. After she was around, she should at least do something, but nothing, the Sea Monster can appear on any sea area of ​​Yar Island as it pleases, or can dock at any port, asylum documents from the Duke of the Duke. It has never expired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing is that until today, the owner of the Sea Devil can still be brazenly provocative against Drake - perhaps the narcissistic woman The Orcs thought it was a temptation, but no matter who they were, except for some special-loving people, no one would have twice as high as their own, three times as wide, muscles, and the skin was green, except for one less. There are two more parts that are of interest to a "female" who is indistinguishable from a tall, strong man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget it, the circle is too chaotic, the red dragonfly can’t understand it completely, anyway, he’s got a note on Drake’s relationship with the Duke’s mother and son, and if Today's business can be negotiated, he can make up for possible losses in a hundredfold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreke’s faceless expression, sitting straight, like a nail on the back of the chair and a glue on the seat, “I thought We have already cleared up, the sea devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the Sea Monster giggled, she blocked her lips with a thick arm, and when the eyes were still moving charmingly, the red eyes felt the pain of the eyes, even in the pirates, the sea magic is considered to be a strain. Wonderful - no one knows her origins, she seems to suddenly appear in Yar, first easily becomes a powerful thief, and then a small collar of the street, a small thief guild not long eyes She, and then, after three years, she broke the neck of all those who dared to order and call her. When everyone thought she would become a guild brain, she sold it, yes, it was sold. The entire guild, with the box of gold coins, ordered a ship to the gnomes, which is the Sea Devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, she doesn’t have a formal name, people call her the half-orc or other miscellaneous nickname, and when she gets the Sea Devil, people call her Sea Devil, and she seems to like this name too. "Oh, no," she said. "Our fate is still very long."<br &nbsp; "Do you want to do this sale?" Drake's face is like a sky that is a sign of a hundred-day storm: "I admit that the Sea Devil is the strongest, but Yar has more than the Sea Devil. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea devil licked his mouth and made a terrible grimace. She shrugged her shoulders like a hill: "Okay, dear, if you like We can talk about trading first... then talk about... love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung Hom lowered his head and praised every god for the first time, including sincerely, including Su Lun, look at the scars left by her follower's elf Kerry Ben on his face - from the forehead through the bridge of the nose to the lower jaw, the widest place can put three fingers, and the bridge of the nose is like a child pinching The slime monster, the wizard's treatment ensures that he can breathe and smell, but it is almost impossible to get the favor of women, even though he originally How handsome, but he can not underestimate the aesthetic bottom line of the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact," Drake said dryly: "We are all seeing old friends."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves Kerry Ben, Master Krimaar, former paladin and Thunderbolt lord Bydwin, Highland Norman's prince Liona, thief Gülen, and Fro's priest Mei Mi.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung Hom saw the face of the Sea Devil’s face uncontrollably revealing some greed, and he wanted to come to him with the same expression, Highland Norman The reward for Bedwin, Gülen and Plum was never lifted. They were not humans, but piles of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
