Come on, you can touch his head when I feed him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Then they came to the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is illogical! Fro's priest said with horror that the vicious and evil thief apprentices can like cats! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's slightly adjust the time forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get into the current white tower can be said to be simple or tough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the gnome McGee’s news from the merchants, the current White Tower rarely has serious businesspeople to go, but from some In terms of perspective, it can also be said that it is a city, or a half-black market. All the Bibi dikes or the rulers and managers have not gone mad. The city still stands in the temple of Tyre and other gods. You can see the goods you can buy and sell - evil casting materials, dangerous banned potions, despicable weapons, humans, humanoids... The reason why they still leave half, because Rosada’s pastor still Stay there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disaster caused by the clean water of the Rosada sanctuary has been diluted in the hearts of the residents of Baita, or something more terrible than it was at any time, so that it was deeply left in the hearts of the residents of Baita. Imprints are no longer so clear - they used to be rich, and now their money is not stolen. Being robbed is forcibly deprived by layers of heavy taxes; they have been beautiful, but thieves will rush into your house without any scruples, taking your daughter and wife away, if you still have a little money. Then you may be able to bring them back in a few days, but it’s not a broken soul that is a broken body, and you may not be able to redeem them for the second time; they have been happy, but now who dares to be on the street Showing a smile? There are wolves with sharp eyes and sensitive ears everywhere, they always have to understand the source of your happiness. Then he did not hesitate to take it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t try to escape from the White Tower, they gradually gathered around the sanctuary in Rosada, without a house, even lying down They also feel safe and warm on the ground, and the priests of Rosada protect them, more than once, repelling the thieves who want to take away the children and women, the soldiers of the lords, or the cockroaches that help the abuse almost every few days. It will come to threaten and intimidate civilians and pastors. If it is not because of the last accident, the pastor sent by the General Hospital of Rosata is more determined than the ordinary pastor. Faithful piety and powerful relationship, the last piece of pure land in Baitali is only a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that the White Tower is dying. Correctly speaking, the White Tower is even more prosperous than before. Even without the goods of the Elf, it still It has the temptation to attract businessmen to go all out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Tower is the most popular one. It is a special kind of tobacco that emits a sweet scent after ignition. Other spices can match it, and it can also relieve pain. For the treatment of various diseases, if there is no smoke tube, take a small part, immerse in water or do it in food. The most regrettable thing is that it is a bit toxic. People who take too much have encountered misfortune, but this is not its fault, is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fields around the hills and the white pagoda are almost all planted with this kind of tobacco, and the "fine net" guild controls every line from seed to finished product. They collect tobacco from the serfs and civilians at extremely low prices. Then sell them at a more suitable price. In fact, this kind of tobacco is not expensive if it is sold again. Unfortunately, their leader has said it very early. The first thing they have to do is to guarantee each Individuals have tasted the taste of this tobacco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its benefits are not in a few months, but in a few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that tasted this kind of tobacco and noticed the benefits was the mercenaries, who had old injuries on their bodies, and it was painful and itchy every rainy day. This kind of tobacco can help them to withstand this torture, and they find that eating a little while hungry is not so obvious as the pain that can split the entire stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then are serfs and some poorly run civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody noticed that the popularity of this tobacco has become more widespread and deeper, and only Ruiyite knows that more and more businessmen are coming to acquire this kind of tobacco. She also provides free tobacco in Fro's temple, and Fro's pastor claims that the tobacco can turn an incompetent man into a wild boar or a bear – look at the last ones who are willing to take away their parents. Young people with coins, but there are too many men obsessed with Pastor Fro, who knows what they are indulging in? Is it the fullness of Pastor Fro, or the tobacco that emits sweet scent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All merchants who are willing to go to Baita to acquire tobacco are welcome. They don’t enter the White Tower as planned by Gavin, because their profession is really It's a bit weird. How do you explain a priest with a knight, mages, thieves, Rosada and Fro in a caravan? Mei Mi entered alone as a wandering scorpion. Although she had to taste a little honey for the guard, the thieves strolling on the street did come up to intercept when she saw her, but she did not doubt her intention, but wanted Asked about her foothold, he asked Mei Mi to drink a glass of honey and promised to come to her room at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavalier was dressed as a mercenary, and together with Master Gavin as a merchant with mercenaries to buy tobacco, they changed slightly, see Going up unremarkable, under the hot afternoon sun, the guards hurriedly released after blackmailing two silver coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief Gülen is more complicated, because the white pagoda is already in the nest of the fine net guild, they do not welcome the thieves who do not belong to them, so Gülen from the dragon fire There was an identity in the pub of the island, and the thief had been recruited, but it was just a mistake. Finally, he ran to Longhuo Island to open a pub, and the business was still very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave Gülen the name of the person, this person is already dead, so Gülen does not have to worry about someone exposing him. When he entered the White Tower, he immediately revealed his hand, reported the name, and found a room outside the guild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing went smoothly and it was a bit scary, although the message left by the female warlock was to let Kreima go to Tali to win back his friends, but in fact. Both Leona and Birdwin were detained in the prison of the "fine net" guild. Leona also received special privileges. She had a room, although the room was only six feet long and had no windows, only one. The wooden doors with the iron hinges and the reinforced strips are also lacking in furniture. The chairs and tables are fixed on the ground. The only bed is disturbingly laid with furry bear skin. There is also a bottle of sweet peas on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona once asked for water, if they brought in a jug or a kettle, it would be dangerous to put it on the king, but those people sent It’s actually a peach that has been removed from the nucleus. At this time, the peach can’t be said to have matured, but the one that Leona got is basically mature. The degree is almost in the hand and must be carefully touched. It will be turned off - the solid food is cheese and bread, the bread is white and delicate, not the kind of wood chips. Can be used as a black bread for sticks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her room is still a room, not a dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mei Mei and others first found Leona, the girl is in good shape, but just the moment they left the room. The scene in front of him suddenly turned upside down. Mei Mi and Leona were thrown into a dark passage that smelled of rancid smell. The passages were sticky and slippery. They walked on it and fell a little carelessly. They climbed hard. After a broken road, I found a small door that could be opened. But at the moment of going out, the corridor they were in was walking into two little guys who were still a little childish. Their short robes showed that they were only thieves apprentices, and Mei Mi immediately pushed the little one. The door, want to return to the dark road, the gods are on, this door can only be opened once, Li Aona helps Mei Mi to work hard, but her strength is much more than Mei Mei, with a dull sound, that small The door was actually disengaged from the hinge, and Mei Mei sat down on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of movement wants to continue to be unknown. It is purely a cover-up, and Mei Mei panicked and learned to call the cat twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are like what we saw at the beginning, the two thieves apprentices came over with the small fish, they couldn’t see the cat, they only saw it. Two stupid women with gray faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought it was a cat." A thief apprentice said with anger that the small fish was taken back by his pocket and replaced by a dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isn't it a cat?" His companion licked his lips, and his unintentional smile showed that he might no longer be a child: "The wild cat we dispose of..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden door that Li Aona took directly hit his face. If you can't find a good pastor, this thief apprentice may be the second "you-know-who". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief apprentice who prepared the dried fish for the cat was shocked. He reacted agilely to raise the dagger to the plum, but found that the dagger was stabbed anyway. Without going into the soft skin, Fro's priest grinned at him, grabbed his wrist, and violently, the apprentice's dagger immediately stabbed into his own belly, and he shouted sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" Liona shouted, then she said, "Oh, damn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An adult male, a thief is quickly rushing from the other end of the corridor, Leona looked around, the corridor should have been sculptured, but it seems to have been taken away by the thieves, she jumped From the beginning, they caught the chandelier hanging on the top of the gallery. The ceilings here are all candles. The curved branches have the spikes used to insert the candles. She wants to pull it out as a weapon. However, it was installed too firmly, and Leona hangs in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey made up a spell in time, the thief’s dagger hit the transparent barrier and fell, Liona was not in danger for the time being, but the thief’s The line of sight immediately fell on the priest of Fro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor little priest turned back and ran away, and the thief apprentice who was crawling out of the hallway with his nose grabbed her ankle. Mei Mi fell to the corridor. This time it was not her butt but her front chest. Her painful tears flowed out. For the first time, it was not a good thing to feel that some positions were too full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was caught up in her hair before she recovered from dizziness. She silently cursed Gülen while struggling in vain At this moment, she remembered the trick that Gülen had played with her. Gülen was an excellent thief. Of course he knew what a thief would do when he wanted to kill someone, even though he was a joke at the time. The spot was used as a demonstration, but now Fro's pastor really wants to thank him for his bad taste! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memeen wears a ring on his finger, the ring is inlaid with a large crystal, the base is black iron, it looks less valuable, but It's more expensive than a pure gold ring of the same size - plum is pressed down the middle finger of the ring, a delicate needle jumps out from it, it's just small, but it's sharp on both sides, and sharp It’s like grinding on the devil’s skull, Mei Mei didn’t bother to stab her thief – she’s not ready to open a piercing hole for her – just lift her hand and cut her hair, while The homeopathic decline, tumbling from the thief's dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
