			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the king of Grenada is a peace<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is a predatory war like the past, then slaves, food and cattle and horses have been transported back to Greiner by the merchants accompanying the army. It’s up, but this time, the requirements of the temple are very clear. They don’t need slaves or food. Even gems and coins can be withheld at their discretion. Greedy wants to see victory and destruction.Therefore, most of the merchants in Grenada have even been doing nothing at all. They can only wait for their companions to come back and see if there are any more interesting and rare goods. Only the guys who have both the warlock and the merchant status can follow. The speed of the army’s actions, as well as ensuring that they are safe on the battlefield; in addition, there are some businessmen who serve the residents of the seventy-seven islands and hired the warlocks to follow them. This is also a helpless thing. The lichs are generous, but their picky and tortoises are among the best of all casters.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the slaves of the black-haired dragons, the long-growth team passed through the outer city of Wangdu, they attracted a lot of coveted Vultures and jackals, although the merchants of the army have already explained that these slaves are the property of His Royal Highness, who is inseparable, although not everyone has seen them, but the numbers on the scrolls, Some of the more important surnames are not allowed to make mistakes.It’s just that this kind of rhetoric has left most businessmen frustrated, but some of them have attracted the attention of those who work for your nobles or are particularly beautiful (even after hunger and sandstorms, tired and invasive, they are as sharp as an eagle The eyes can still pick out the pearls from the sand. They have special talents or souls with toughness and brilliance. The first two are mostly among young teenagers, and the last one is not pure blood and A distinguished identity is a fateful fate, or a profound knowledge and a bright mind, or a combination of the three. Whether it is a sacrifice or a soul, it is best to make a soul gem. Compared with the soul of ordinary people, it is like the difference between the so-called wheat bag with the fine wheat flour mixed eggs and the rough bran mixed with the wood chips.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among these people, except for the dark-haired dragons who are specifically on the list of slaves, they are inevitably transferred to huge interests before, rarely Some Grinada people will not be tempted. As for the difference, it doesn't matter. They can take slaves from other places to replace them, or directly put them into the ranks of death. As long as they are not too excessive, such a trick will not cause Anyone’s attention<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich certainly knows that this kind of thing is inevitable, maybe the soul from another plane knows, but they all know that this is what they can’t do. One of the many things, it is no exaggeration to say that just saving so many humans from the spears of the Knights of Grenada has exhausted most of their efforts, and then See if the god of destiny is willing to take it away from the malicious sight. Simply put, it is the new king, and Greedy will not take back the arrogance and indulgence that can be said to be abrupt. Unable to master or understand<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Austal walked into the circular palace belonging to the new king, what he saw was that the king who was still young for the dragon was sitting. His favorite armchair, and his hand is covered with crystal clear blood wine, and in front of him is a delicate and gorgeous model.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If another plane designer, Adrian Smith, is here, he will scream and plagiarize because the lich is too lazy to think about these. Very important thing, of course, he also knows that he still needs to come up with something that will not be questioned, so he turned over in the memory of the cohabitee and found the tallest building in that plane. It is known as the Burj Khalifa. The wonderful thing is that it is also standing beside a blue sea, and it is surrounded by arid wasteland and desert,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This pyramid-shaped building, which looks like a long cube with a myriad of angular shapes, is as high as 1,800 feet. This height seems to be a bit too much for Grenada, so The lich limits its height to a thousand feet. Even so, the existing mortal masonry cannot build such a tall building, so it requires a lot of magic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is something about magic that has to be put a long time later, the lich’s submission declares (also from another plane), The building will span the time it takes for a mortal to die from birth to death, that is, a hundred years or more, but the one that makes Greeder succumb is because the tower will be the highest in this plane. No matter which shrine is the temple and the sanctuary, at the top of the spire, you can overlook the entire peninsula and the seventy-seven islands at the end of the sea.The Mithril covered in the tower body, the obsidian covered by the tower body can shock all the humans or non-humans who see him. In other words, the towers surrounding the towers, just look at the small ones, such as the crystal stone towers. With the model, you can imagine how big and gorgeous the city will be in the future. The greed, vanity and ambition of the dragon are the most vivid on this tower, even though Greed has produced some subtleties. Suspicion, but in the end her curiosity and desire for the building made her decide not to interfere. If she said that if everything goes well, the city will be the moment before she completes her wish. This gorgeous building will be the most brilliant pearl in her crown.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weird look of the beasts caused some waves in the slaves. At the beginning, they were somewhat cringing, and there was some mercy, but just a few days later, the heaviest test came and someone fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take them to a Grenada attendant." What surprised them was that the priest, Yadell, who was trusted and respected by them, did. Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they will be killed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is their choice," Yadel said: "We have already warned them. If they still do this, they are also willing to accept the consequences." He silently silenced for a while: "If we do nothing to this hundred people, So what should other people do? The resources of the slaves on the black market in Grenada are not too scarce, but it is only a matter of time to get into the cognac. The legion does not rob the slaves, but kills all the people is the will of the temple. Merchants can't complain, but if they find evidence that we can't control these people, what do you think they will do?” He lowered his eyes. “Even if we let go of our hands and let them leave, they definitely can't go. A thousand feet away from the king, whether it is a dragon tooth, a dragon claw, or a dragon thorn, they still guard here, and those vassals who did not go with the army, lost the opportunity of looting. They are already hungry Even in the outer city, there have been several riots. Do you think they will be tolerant and kind enough to allow a slave who can exchange gold coins to escape from their horseshoe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Tell these to the elders in the slave," the priest said coldly: "Tell them that the Grenada people have a law that is ten laws, that is, if a slave is escaped, then their masters will I will arbitrarily choose the cruel killing of ten slaves in front of others, to deter and punish them. This time no one can escape. This is their luck, but then it is not necessary, let them look at each other, I don’t want to watch To the pointless sacrifice Since they have not escaped the shackles of the Grenada in their homeland, it is the same here, and any expectations are unrealistic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There will always be some interesting people around my little son." The new king of Gryanda said: "I even regret it if he stays with me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So he Will not get to know so many interesting people. "Dios Tal interfaces Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New King laughs, he is one of the few people who even feel gloomy even if they laugh, his appearance is beautiful, but still Reminiscent of those poisonous insects or snakes that are flamboyant but evil in nature, he stands up and puts his hands on the spire of the model. The spire is a pure and flawless rock, which is very beautifully cut, in a weak The light is also as bright and brilliant as the crystallization of sunlight, and here, when the building is built, it is a star-gazing room. According to his dark-haired descendants, its walls and tops will be made of large pieces of glass. And it can be stretched according to the demand. After the glass falls, here is a platform for the dragon, which is the dragon dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think..."dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is my Cremaris thinking? He has got so many slaves, is he really trying to build his own tower? Or... "The new king blinked at Austal: "Is the other half of his body influencing his thoughts? Maybe there is behavior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is really a difficult question to answer: "I think his purpose is still very simple," Austal shunned and said: "If it were me, I would also choose to find a place to build my own fortress. I have been away from Grenada for a long time. There is no place for him. He has to find another way. It is also possible that he has a little bit of goodwill..." He gently bends his finger and puts his index finger between his thumb. The gap is pulled to a minimum, "but this may only be to get those human hearts. After all, he can’t get loyalty from Grenada here. Soldiers and knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New King smiled gracefully: "A child's cranky, reading (ww.kanshu)" He said: "Do he think Can an ordinary human race compete with the Knights and Warlocks of Grenada?" There are also cat ears and birds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not," Ostall said. "But he has to catch what he can catch."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that many people in the Dragon Tooth Legion owe... He is riding a debt, he is too naughty, isn't it?" The new king carelessly pushed the spire : "Do you know what the herb is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
