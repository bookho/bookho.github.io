The person who killed himself paid the agency fee for twenty gold coins. He took his own. He lost nearly fifty gold coins in the "puffer fish". The most irritating thing about him was the three-legged dagger of the gold. When I got it, I carefully studied every part, from the spindle-shaped hand to the vicious snake-shaped hand, and the cone with three blood grooves, its length and thickness did not change, dull The color is also no different from the original - fine gold is a metal that emits a soft silver-blue ray, but perhaps because the person who used it was a thief, it was disguised as a layer of copper-iron alloy. The plating, when hanging on the waist, no one will want to look at the second eye - only two places are different, one is a snake snake wrapped around the palm of the user, its eyes are originally black coal, but now it looks like It’s garnet, and it’s a garnet that’s not too good. It contains a lot of black impurities, but it looks more like alive, not as dead as it used to be. When Gülen holds it, the triangle's head is just pressing on his thumb. The instant thief even produced the illusion that the snake's body covered with fine scales slipped across the skin; the second place was its temperature, it was so cold, and the thief felt that the temperature of the whole body was absorbed by it. The limbs became numb, and even the wind blew through the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tore off his cloak, wrapped it up and took it to a cliff on the beach, under the cliff, the sound of thunder, "Blowfish" I have complained that this is too noisy and that nothing grows. The barren people can't give birth to even a little bit of interest. If you just throw it away, there will be only dark sand in addition to the sand reef. It may be taken away by the sea and brought into the deep sea. It will never appear in any place, and it will be held in the hands of another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the sudden abnormality. What makes Gülen even more uneasy is what the newcomer said, although it sounds like a madman, but in terms of his power, even a madman is a fearsome madman, he said the dagger Originally his thing, but did not take it back from Gülen, he killed Gülen - if Gülen is an ordinary human, of course, ambitious young thieves will never open their eyes again. To read the book w book ww·1kanshu Gülen can almost imagine how the “puffer fish” complained about dragging his body out of the room, and may also take away all the valuable things in him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that person is so well aware of everything, the fine gold triangle dagger is deeply inserted into the floor, the position is extremely precise, only a thickness of a nail, Gülen has to wander the most important equipment for men to find Asia. Dell prayed for a cure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, the thief was still a bunch of red sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief opened the cloak, and the coldness from the dagger made him chilly, and he carried his handguards. Pointing out of the cliff, this may be the last time he had the dagger. But at this time, a faint black shadow suddenly rushed to the thief, completely out of instinct and reflection, the thief backhand clenched the dagger and stabbed out lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow fell on the foot of Gülen without making a sound, and the feathers passed over his boots. It was a late-tailed short-tailed skua, about three feet six inches to eight inches after the wings were unfolded, and could be counted as medium in seabirds. The skua are greedy and vicious birds. They seem to have a stomach, sharp claws and shackles that connect the bottomless abyss. Happy to rob all the birds, grab food from their mouths, and sometimes humans can't escape. The food they hold in their hands or things like food are often taken away by them - this skua may It was exactly what Gülen was holding, even in dim light, it was not very clear whether it was a burritos or a dried fish, but it was! It is obviously also a veteran, even if Gülen is thinking about hesitation, can avoid the sharp ears of a good thief, sneak or say gliding to a place so close to him is enough to be proud of this skua, although it This is not needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan did not go too far to think about the skua's attempt, he stared at his dagger, he believed in himself, and believed his eyes, he started A glimpse of the attack, the dagger disappeared - not really disappeared, he can still feel its cold and hard, but it does disappear into his vision, as if it does not exist, he can feel himself Stinging the smashing bird, a strange wave that was slightly undetectable from his weapon, Gülen is no stranger to it, it is a kind of inevitable after depriving another life. The shudder and the feeling of pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head and tried to find blood. If the dagger had blood on the bird, he could still find it, but nothing, he The dagger was lifted to the front, and the left hand was tentatively repeated, until a sharp pain made him wake up from indulging.壹Reading·1kanshu<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "that kind" state disappeared, and the dagger gradually returned to its original appearance. Gülen gasped in uncontrollably, and he grasped it firmly, fearing that he accidentally slipped it off the cliff - he Will it be discarded? Of course not, this is the weapon that every thief has dreamed of, an invisible dagger, and it can do more, it is said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German hides the dagger in his shirt, maybe it’s psychological, he doesn’t think it’s so cold, he checks the skua’s body but can’t find it. There was no trace of blood in the wound. Its wings were dragged softly on the rocks, and the eyes were still squatting. Looking at the sky, it seemed to struggle vigorously at any time, flapping its wings and rushing into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief was a little embarrassed when he walked on the promenade, almost hit the pygmy McGee who jumped out of another gallery, in order to avoid the gnomes, Gülen’s shoulder hit the wall of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McGid doesn't like Gülen very much, Gülen doesn't like McGee, McGee hates Gülen because thieves play with him for the same master, although Mai Base again thought that he should have been a dwarf, but the gnome's nature still forced him to hostile all possible opponents, and Gülen hated McGee purely because it was another idiot who wanted to become a so-called "good guy", dwarf I hate water, of course, I won't take a boat to the tip of Azores. But Glan has heard a lot about the dwarf from his mentor. To be honest, sometimes the dwarves are more troublesome than the elves. They are as ruthless and stubborn as stones. The Elf Ranger may also want to hear from you. The complaint, and the dwarf's first reaction is to use his hammer to break your head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gülen himself did not notice it. He has pulled out his dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The following is updated before 10 o'clock tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold-smelling dishes were left to the "puffer fish" by Gülen, and he had to pay for a person who had no reason to kill himself. The intermediary fee of ten gold coins, with his own, he lost nearly fifty gold coins in the "puffer fish". The most irritating thing for him was the three-legged dagger of the fine gold. He took it carefully when he got it. Every part has been studied in detail, from the spindle-shaped hand to the vicious snake-shaped hand. There is a cone with three blood troughs, its length and thickness have not changed, and the dull color is no different from the original - fine gold is a metal that emits a soft silver-blue ray, but perhaps because it was originally used Its people are a thief's relationship, it is disguised as a layer of copper-iron alloy coating, when hanging on the waist, no one will want to look at the second eye - only two places are different, one is wrapped around The snake on the palm of the user, whose eyes were originally black coal. It is now like a garnet, and it is a garnet that is not very good in quality. Because it contains a lot of black impurities, but it looks more like alive, not as dead as it used to be. When Gülen holds it, the triangle's head is just pressing on his thumb. Instant thieves even produced the illusion that snakes are covered with fine scales and slipped across the skin; the second place is its temperature. It was so cold, the thief felt that the temperature of the whole body was absorbed by it, and his limbs became numb, and even the wind blew through the body and felt stabbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tore off his cloak, wrapped it up and took it to a cliff on the beach. Under the cliff, the rocks are like a thunder. The puffer fish has complained that it is too noisy and that nothing grows. The poor people can’t give birth to even a little interest. If you just throw it away, it’s In addition to the sand reef, there is probably only the dark water left behind - it may be taken away by the sea, brought into the deep sea, and will never appear in any place, in the hands of another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the sudden abnormality, Gülen is more uneasy than the words of the newcomer, although it sounds like a madman, but As far as the power he showed, even a madman is a fearsome madman. He said that the dagger was originally his thing, but he did not take it back from Gülen. He killed Gülen if Gülen is an ordinary human being. Of course, ambitious young thieves will never open their eyes again. Gülen can almost imagine how the “puffer fish” complained about dragging his body out of the room, and maybe Take away all the valuable things in him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that person is so well aware of everything, the fine gold triangle dagger is deeply inserted into the floor, the position is extremely accurate, only a piece of nail thickness, Ge Lan had to wander in the most important instrument of the man to find Adel and pray for a healing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, the thief was still a bunch of red sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief opened the cloak, and the coldness from the dagger made him chilly. He carried his hand guard and pointed out the cliff. This may be his last time. I have this dagger, but at this time, a faint black shadow suddenly rushed to the thief. It was entirely instinctive and reflective. The thief clasped the dagger with his backhand and stabbed it lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow fell on the foot of Gülen without making a sound, and the feathers passed over his boots. It was a late-tailed skua. After the wings are unfolded, they are about three feet six inches to eight inches. They can be considered medium-sized in seabirds. The skua are greedy and vicious birds. They seem to have a stomach connected to the bottomless abyss, sharp claws and cockroaches, happy to rob all the birds, grab food from their mouths, and sometimes humans can not escape. A robbery, food held in your hands or something like food is often taken away by them - this skua may have seen what Gülen holds, even in dim light, it can't See if it is a burritos or a dried fish, but take care of it! It is obviously also a veteran, even if Gülen is thinking about hesitation, can avoid the sharp ears of a good thief, sneak or say gliding to a place so close to him is enough to be proud of this skua, although it This is not needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
