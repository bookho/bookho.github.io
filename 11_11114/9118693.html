			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, update at 9 am tomorrow morning<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prelude<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaper's unusual anger<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, the reaper born in the Chaos Sea has an undead creature that can accommodate a small giant family in the skeleton. The chief scorpion of the face exists, they are immune to mental attacks, and most of the spell damage is reduced, the power is infinite, the movement is agile, and the most important thing is that they can easily appear in the unpredictable chaos in the sea without locking the force field. Every place... looking for any neck that fits the invisible python, any creature that is attacked by a chaotic weapon made to break the damage reduction will be constantly under the shock of chaotic power. Painful suffering... until it is abandoned because of intolerance, it is a part of chaos<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the darlings of these chaotic seas will rarely encounter such a tough enemy, a paladin wearing a rough gray cloak, perhaps because of the long stay in the Chaos Sea. For a period of time, the clothes on his body have been broken. The only equipment is the dull but tight chain, and the unadorned sword, but this does not affect his high fighting will and strong combat effectiveness.Obviously, the double-edged sword, which is more reliable than the appearance, has repeatedly hesitated to slap the sickle that is smashing with ash, and the number of the wounds is increasing as the change of the chaotic sea. The fearless outsiders make more A small number of small wounds accumulate on the white skeleton, although some of them are restored to their original state, but more cracks are connected together and form a dangerous fine net... The pale bones make ominous sputum, and the reaper feels Fear often feels like they give to othersThe premonition of demise made him retreat, but hesitated because it was forced by the Chaos Sea to execute the distorted command to declare the orderly biological death. Finally, it was a kind of faint, strange, similar to the crying voice made for him. The reaper who decided to entropy gave up his mission and launched a plane-transmitting technique that only used one opportunity a day, disappearing into the enemy who was too enthusiastic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin whispered, dispelling the negative effects of the reaper’s last long, cold, vicious breath, and then he had to face up to nothing here. One of the most difficult things in the impossible plane is more than five hundred giant cockroaches gathering pebbles.A chaotic fluid is produced from the pebbles of this chaotic sea native.The giant python can recognize these fluids and flow upstream, gather around the spawning to lay eggs and fertilize, and their will even gradually expand a large tabletop pebbles into a continent.But the actions of the giants sometimes turn the chaotic fluids that grow with the pebbles into a huge chaotic storm. The worst part is that <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead Giant cockroaches will become the guards of the pebbles, stubborn, brave, hard-to-eliminate stone guards will shred any creatures or non-livings that dare to hurt the source of the storm with violent hurricanes, countless flames, ashes, gravel , gravel, hail, and even the condensation of energy... The spur of the order from the outside of this small self-contained small continent, like a grand, but large upside down Multi-material meteor shower<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, the frenzied giant breeding ground smashed a piece of solitary sea like a real stone and quickly left, like the choppy airflow aftermath After a period of time, it completely dissipated. It left only a large strip of areas that looked very clean compared to other places in this chaotic plane. Although it will soon be filled with more chaotic substances, It now looks very similar to a trace of a finger on a dusty table, and it is precisely because of this that the only thing that stays in it is particularly eye-catching.Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a small, quiet, comfortable, but dark space<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original face with a smile instantly becomes serious, and the paladin burns a pure flame, especially the forehead, as if there is a sun hidden in the skull.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to hold his arm has relaxed, and before the wide cuffs of the gray robes hang down again, the paladus’s sharp vision has seen the pale hand bones. Its shape is similar to humans, but it is obvious that the human finger phalanx has only three knots at most, instead of the four knots he sees now, which means that the undead creatures in front of them are transformed by elves or half-elves that are more focused on the elves. Cheng Cheng, this discovery will be even amazed by the gods. Since the destruction of the magic empire, almost no lich has been seen in the transformation of the elves, even if the elves are tempted by the devil and degenerate, how strange the noun, related The written record is probably only the oldest and secretive on the mainland, and can be found in several libraries protected by semi-stagnant time and space.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It silently retreats into the darkness that is not affected by the light, and the outline of the white skull that is slightly lifted is clearly clear in the shadow of the hood." He "gaze at the light, it doesn't seem to be as disgusting as other undead creatures can't reach... the subtle, fleeting mood swings are sharply captured by the paladin without greed, no hatred, no anger, no* *, calm and soft, except for the child's vivid curiosity and eagerness to try, if not the pure negative energy that can almost condense into the body, the rescuer almost thinks that there is a hidden in the decaying and filthy bones. Pure soul that has not been polluted by sin is actually impossible<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter what you are holding out for"The paladin said seriously," in the name of Tyre, I swear you will receive my thanks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hollow eyes of the undead, the tiny red light spots jumped, and the paladin could feel the joyful emotions flowing through his body. The lich is still very young. He doesn't even know how to hide his feelings. Or, he still has feelings. The old warrior cherishes his wrong choice and his eyes are more firm: "Speak your request."Then, in the name of Tyre, I will reach your wish, and then, liberate the soul that you have not completely fallen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull in the hood turned left and right, and the skeleton stepped back: "Hey," he said at a loss: "Required?... Hey, Say, thank you?” dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then his body glows white, more bleak than the Paladin, but softer Some, sudden changes caused the lich to be scared, the airflow in the narrow space became tense, and the action of the paladin was controlled like a shackle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin’s old face reveals an incredible expression, yes, a covert, simple detection, just to make sure that you are not being lichled The lie is misleading or exploited, but even he did not expect that there will be an undead creature, pure, not for any purpose to save life other than himself, which almost subverts the definition of the lich for thousands of years. Whether it is the nine-story hell of Bata or the blessing of the region<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light that surges on the paladin is rapidly expanding, his figure becomes taller, hey, the radiance is daunting, and finally The appearance of the show makes the Lich unable to stop the turmoil in the wind, the protector of the commander, the incarnation of the god of justice and justice, his thunder-like voice falling from the top like a solid lava in the sorcerer skull Above: "In the name of the God of God, you will be redeemed for your selfless charity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
