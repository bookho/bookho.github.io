			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do I want to do?" The Baroness changed her posture and lay down comfortably on the chair with her back against the armrests and legs. On the other side, this gesture is not easy to be beautiful, but it is not difficult for the owner of the "Night", and Li Naina, who is also a woman, can't help but move a little. "I want to find a new buyer." "His Royal Highness," said the Baroness, the attitude was very different from the original, not a scorn, but she was keenly aware that she could impress this slightly immature ruler. Pure respect was not enough, she could even push her away - she and Different from Lao Wang, it is also different from King John. Of course, there is no similarity with Dylan and Diane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her temptations got the best response, and the king was not so angry, even showing some slight distress, in such a beautiful face Seeing such an expression on the face, it really makes people want to comfort her with a warm and soft body, the baroness thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first time you are not like this." The king said, while rubbing the silver plaque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you have Birdwin. Don Cree." Although most of the people around the Baroness will directly call the man's name, not because of the kindness, but I don't think he has the qualification to inherit the name of Morton Don Clay, but the Baroness certainly knows what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to Byrdwin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can influence you," Baroness It is blunt to say that her body is twisted like a snake in a chair, exuding the charm and heat of the forced man: "His Royal Highness, if I am not humble, I may not even finish the first sentence." Was proposed to hang.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very happy You still have your position," said the Baroness. "But I don't think you have to be with him." She smiled, but unfortunately she hadn't gotten her favorite fan, which made her a bit unaccustomed, but she could Ignore: "You should probably know a little about my 'professional', I know a lot about the things between men and women, especially the men of Norman in the Highlands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Leona rolled her eyes. "I remember that it wasn’t someone else who accepted your suggestion last time. It was Bill Wen’s former wife, Penny." I have to say that he has a moment of heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is precisely because of this," said the Baroness. "I may be the only one in the world who has something to do with Benny and Don Clay. People who know, you know. In the first few years, Penny and I said that Baldwin, Birdwin and Birdwin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Leona feels embarrassed, she knows that this shouldn't be, but the emotions are beyond control, just as she now wants to know more about Baldwin, "You don't need to be, Baroness," she said: "I made a decision and I won't change because of some unscrupulous problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a small giveaway." The Baroness said leisurely: You and I are very clear that your heart is not a paper-like marriage contract. In order to get the intimate relationship between the heir and the territory, or one luxury, comfortable and gorgeous party, you can love him. I hope he can love you, but you will not shake the cornerstone of Norman Highland because of your love - you really It’s a greedy person, but I’m very happy. For this, I will teach you how to understand him – more love, reverence and gratitude will be ruined by the harshness of dispute and indifference, sometimes just A turn, His Royal Highness, you will lose your lover forever. This is not what I want to see, I can't find a cute buyer like you, know that if it is someone else, I will not expect I can go back all over, but for you, I want to be able to sleep in the hearth while I am old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp As I said, even the Baroness couldn’t help but feel a slight regret. If Leona is a male heir, there may not be so many sad things happening – and now, she You can't even lead the army, but if you hand the knights to another marquis or count, then he has the right to ask for a marriage contract with his loyal queen. This is a customary rule, if Leona doesn't want to be another wife. , Then she would only grant generals Bird warm, but let baroness, the temperature Byrd is not the best choice ...... that as a queen's husband, he lacks too many things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona hesitated for a moment, and she admitted that she was being convinced. "But now you have to go back to your room, Baroness," she said. "Next, I need to see your strength, your 'nightingales', or I will let the kitchen prepare a big pie, you are the middlemost embellishment."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
