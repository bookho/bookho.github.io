			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baroness and Mei Mei then heard a sharp shout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that she found out." The baroness said that she jumped naked from the bed* naked*, the teardrop-shaped ** jumped on the chest and Shaking - her chest is fuller and perfecter than any woman she has ever seen with plum and plum, from beautiful lines to delicate skin, from light reddish brown to rose red rutou When stimulated, it will turn from rose red to deep burgundy, and finally precipitate into a purple garnet-like color. It is as beautiful as a blooming flower, and as soft and sensitive as a baby's eyes - even plum Honey is a woman, or a priest who serves Fro, who is still stunned and dazzled when facing this beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled her silk gown from the chair by the bed and hurriedly put it over her arm and rushed out of the room in a whirlwind As she stepped into the hallway, the silky silky black silk just slipped past her knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me." She snapped, and Mei Mi made a face to her, even if the Baroness did not say that, she would quickly leave. What she doesn't need most is to stay alone with a caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny stood outside the room and shouted, the wet silk gown clung to her body, like a person thrown into the bucket and jumped out The hen, but no one can hear what she is yelling. When she saw the baroness, she rushed over and hugged her, and the baroness grabbed her arm and looked at it with helplessness. A woman and a buffalo confuse the ceiling of the scene, while frowning at Penny's invisible place, because Penny's water, wine, and spice powder are frantically torturing her favorite robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will have more robes, from silk to fur, the baroness comforts himself in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," she said softly. "Well, what happened? My little baby, let me, who provoked you?" "She gently stroked Penny's hair - it was the roughest thing she had ever seen and touched. The Baroness thought, she had to schedule the maintenance of her hair as soon as possible." Last time, the merchant from the south came to a new prescription. What came, camel or urine, and he was taken care of. He couldn’t do it. She also knew a red robe mage. He could The dead hair is glued to your head with the scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One..." Penny grabbed the front robes of her robes, as if she could maintain her own chastity by this: "A man, the gods are on, there is a man in the room!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baroness raised an eyebrow: "Don't talk nonsense," she pushed Penny away: "Impossible," she stressed. "Even our husbands won't be Allowed to enter here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Penny whimpered: "He is in the room."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see," said the Baroness. "If there is such a shameless thief who sneaked in here, I will ask the consul to tear off his limbs and his inch with a red tong. The cockroach - and then break his egg with a small hammer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the things in the room, the people are kept the same, the baroness and a lady wearing a cream-colored silk gown tacitly glanced at each other, the latter took a lazy breath The fragrant shisha, spit out a set of cyan smoke rings - it seems to be a signal, everyone in the room has a scornful smile and a sardonic smile in a timely manner, "You scared us one Jump," the creamy silk robe said sweetly: "Little Pannie, my sister, what's the matter? Is that slave not waiting for you? Didn't try to do it, or did he accidentally hurt you?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One...he is...a...man..." Penny stuttered and said, "A man!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, the Baroness finally turned her eyes on the young man who had been squatting in place since being pushed away by Penny: "...this may be a misunderstanding," she said. The tone slowly said: "Panne. If you are talking about this person - then he will never be a man, a slave, stand up and take off his clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Come, Penny," she said softly. "Look at him. I am in the name of my husband. Oath, you definitely will not see a man "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Penny grabbed her chin, semi-forced to let her see that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t look between the legs, he is indeed a very worthy young man, although as a slave, he can’t look directly at his master and guests. So he could only tilt his head down deeply, hiding his face, but his white skin was smooth and flawless, and his body proportions were perfect. Standing there was like an alabaster statue carved by skilled craftsmen. It doesn't matter. It's important that he is like the baroness. There is nothing between his slightly separated legs. It's like the craftsman who accidentally missed a certain point and he was rash. The apprentices polished it there again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a monk," the baroness waved, only to remember that her fan did not take it: "Sorry, Penny, because the sisters complained for some time - they always feel that the slave slave is not strong enough, the intensity of the massage is fundamental I couldn’t get the effect they wanted, so I bought a few monks from the south.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny looked at the Baroness and looked at that... Deaf, she was dumbfounded and didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But anyway," the baroness gave a stern look at her slave: "Since he scared you, then he should be punished, I will Let people smoke him dozens of whip and then sell him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's priest just sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slave cleverly lifted his head slightly. He was tall, but he had a beautiful face that was childish and full of tears in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." Penny hesitated. "But this is my fault. I don't know if he is... I thought he was a man." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, do you want him to serve you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If...you are not blaming him Then, Penny said, she gave another small scream because the slave kneeled down and kissed her foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the Baroness said happily: "It seems that you still like him very much, let him serve you well - I will come soon - I forgot my fan in another room. I always feel that something is missing without it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have any questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only wonder why you are doing this," since the Baroness has already Said, Mei Mi no longer hides her doubts: "She is just an ordinary village woman - and you just want her to fall - perhaps a knight can do this task in the stable."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is really just an ordinary village woman," said the baroness, sullenly taking her feather fan and fanning her fan. "But she has a high weight. As a young man, he is not ugly, charming and sincere and deeply loves her, the things she got from him - house, land, gold coins, jewelry... Trust, so much can make any woman in Wang Duo go crazy, even if it is our queen, if she is still alive - our King is not a loyal husband, his mistress is everywhere in the king In the corner, some people say that he has not been able to make an illegitimate child so far because the queen once cursed him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
