			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ps: Watch the exclusive story behind The Saints, listen to your suggestions for the novel, follow the public number (WeChat add friends - add public number - enter Qdread can), tell me quietly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the soul of the alien world, the so-called gnome boat is like a barge in his world, that is, the kind that can only be used to carry goods. Flat bare light, need to add a tugboat or top tug to sail the flat-bottomed boat, no sails and no paddles, even no steering wheel and ship rail (railing), only rivets fixed rings and ropes on both sides of the hull, it is estimated to be used To fix the container. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the rune plate, after listening to the Lich’s commentary, the soul of the outside world feels like it is an upgraded version of the spell reel or wand, compared to the scroll and The wand, the ingenious rune, can store many different spells, so that it can be inspired by a syllable spell – this is why it gets so many wizards, but it's too expensive, too expensive, even The Rune of the Alva Mage, who is supported by the Betty Dykes (this inappropriate term is naturally from the mouth of the undead), may not be more than ten, and it may not be a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The secret gold secret silver, the gems dragon blood, the lich’s tone plainly, all the scrolls and wands can be used with the obtained runes, they do not use The rune plates that are used will also be used. The more precious the rune plates are, the more rare the materials are, and the more spells they save, the more powerful they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as you can see, the lich says viciously, it’s just the name of the idiots and gnomes, for their shameless theft and forgery And already - the gnome has no magic! Only stupid and useless machinery! And these poor imitations are just made for driving machinery, and it has only one use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Oh? The alien soul is full of interest and asks, that is to say, can not be used by the person who is not the caster? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You are also a caster now! The lich screamed, please keep your dignity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Oh, if you can, the soul of the opposite world says, please don’t scream? I have headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The consequences of the power overdraft are so slight that it is worthwhile for you to dance around the cave around the cave for a week, the Lich said, I Finally, I know why the Alzheimer's disease is so generous. If this is an ordinary body, if it is not destroyed, it will be exhausted because of your recklessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I am a little bit flattered, the soul of the outside world responded dryly, you actually only used "recklessness." In addition, is it true that you call your God of God as an Alzheimer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- You have to make me a new word available, the Lich says, and even if the God of God is listening to our conversation, he will not Calling a fuss, after all, he is so great and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I always feel that this is very dangerous, he may not be a big fuss, but maybe he will make a joke with you, the soul of the opposite world said, wisely The land will "Do you not feel that your destiny is a bit ups and downs?" This sentence is hidden under a false smile - to be honest, he turned to a topic that may be safer, I thought you would stop me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Why should I stop you, the Lich restores calm, will you reject Kerry Ben? Will you abandon these humans? Will you hide some of your strength in accordance with my opinion? You are even running out of the scrolls. Since not, why should I waste my efforts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I believe there will be many chances to hear this in the future, the Lich said meanly, but at least this time, I hope your friends As sure as you think, this body is safe and sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he sank, which means that he never wants to talk to the soul of the outside world in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he did not see the bad face that the cohabitation had made against him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Lich’s dissatisfaction with the gnome’s products is cursed, but it has stirred up the curiosity of the soul of the outside world, he has pressed the mental exhaustion. Observing it, it's called "disk" is a bit uncomfortable, because in his opinion, it is more like a silver-plated B6 coated paper, engraved with magic and patterns, like a complex circuit board, Filled with fine gold on each of the key nodes, even if it is installed in a very similar way - there is a fixed and concealed card slot at the bow, and the rune is stuck in the correct position, Kerry Ben and Mage can feel extremely subtle energy flowing between lines, and waves that are very similar to the spellcaster's release spells spread in the air and water. The force it generates pushes the metal turbine inside the ship, and the turbine drives the propeller, accompanied by a low The thunder, the boat drove forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the White Tower?" Kreima whispered to the Ranger sitting next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gosula is flying to Bibi Dibao, it will replace everything I have here to Alva, and Alva and Baita The Antonio Master has the quickest way to contact us. When we reach the end, we will never be enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gosula?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friend, that little 鸮."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, that bad temper Guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grumpy, but very reliable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar wants Smiled, but he found it difficult. The body supported by positive energy is not tired. The senses that transcend ordinary people are still sending him various kinds of information constantly, but his lack of spirit can't identify and deal with them at all. He is very tired, but he can't relax at all. If you really want to find a familiar adjective, the soul of the outside world is very reluctant to think that the pain of insomnia has been amplified ten times, or one hundred. , A thousand times - fortunately table alternating moment is near, he had never had the pious attitude to thank all the gods of the two world fell into chaos dark sea of ​​awareness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired caster of others seems to have blinked his eyes in a hurry, but the eyes are closed and then opened, this body controller Already changed one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he feels is the heat and oppression around him. Elf Kerry is sitting at his side with ease and wiping his handle called "Starlight." The machete, the blade of the machete is as bright and white as the new snow, so that the undead who once was unconsciously removed their sights - although he knows that the blade of this blessed purified water will not cause him Injury, but he can still feel the sting of ruthlessness, he deeply hates the weakness of another settler left to him, an impulse drove him to take out the spellbook in the pocket, remembering it Magic, protect yourself and kill enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last reason is that the sensible control of his soft hands, he reminded himself that he is no longer strong, and that the shackles are entangled, and the blade is the head, even if it belongs to a certain The idiot wizard's spell book has the horrible spells he needs, and he can't display it to the elf or the druid. In any case, they have a ship with a dirty toe. The cook is more worthy of being recognized by the "good" rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also wants to go to the White Tower, plunder the collection of Beavis, take them to rest in the Grey Ridge, and restore strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still want winter honey?" Kerry asked, the elf's keen sense of sensibility gave him a sigh of uneasiness, he would It comes down to the concern and worry of young friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Forte’s instructions, they actually found a few boxes of turbid ginger wine or ale, and the caves were so cold and cold that the smugglers had to rely on this to protect the cold. The soaked survivors are of course more needed, and the mercenaries leave the better bottles to the caster and ranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranger unscrupulously poured all the remaining winter honey into a bottle of ginger wine, and the lich took it, although he didn't need it, but still simply After a drink, the spicy sweet smell suddenly filled his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You need a break, Kremar, don't worry," said Kerry Ben, "I am here."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t want to be better here, the lich says silently, before he hopes that the new friends who are sent by the alien souls are loyal and strong enough, lest they can’t reach the White Tower and die ridiculously. In the hands of a group of rabbits and smugglers, now he has to endure the inconvenience caused by this friendship. In this plane, there are many rules that can not be changed even by powerful and wise wizards. The most widely known one is the Master every day. Only one spell can be memorized. Of course, he is a special case. The positive energy in his blood vessels and bone marrow makes him not have to sleep to restore his body's exhaustion, while the two souls ensure that they can take turns to meditate to eliminate the loss of each other's spirit. But the problem is that this is a secret that may endanger their lives and souls, and must not be known to outsiders, especially Kerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of the elf is too long, and even the Lich’s mentor is not sure how long the library of the Silver Crown jungle has existed, but since he The instructor's tower can find records about the redemption lich, they will not be there - perhaps more detailed, more accurate, the lich does not want to gamble whether Kerry has been in his hundreds of years or more I have turned to that page during my reading career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich has never been so annoyed, he is full of energy, his mind is empty, he is still sitting with a Suron believer, his career is the ranger's elf, and he is the same. The most annoying things are gathered together, hate him and can't do anything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
