			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mai certainly doesn’t know that her abrupt behavior is a bit of a suspicion of grabbing a certain lens. She can say that she is screaming and screaming out from the thick mist of transpiration. Come out, it can be said that it is awkward to use the limbs, use the last bit of strength to climb the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her foot burns are particularly serious, she fell when she stepped on the ground, but fortunately there was a thick fur with a roll, but this is not acceptable. Too lucky, these white and soft furs are used by her to decorate the bathroom. In addition, she occasionally confuses her guests. It is said that they are a kind of carnivorous skin, from the whistling plain occupied by the orcs. The value of each inch needs to be exchanged with the same thickness and area of ​​gold. Even if there is no sunlight, they will emit weak heat even. It is also very rare in Longhuo Island, so Mei Mi still cherishes it, but now she can't care anything. The bath water suddenly became hot in the time of less than one breath. Before Mei Mei felt that the water was a little bit cold, it became violent and dangerous. She only cursed a sentence, the delay Time is enough to make the situation worse. Fro's priest is burnt under the shoulders, and the skin is like the red color of the rose petals. Even the breeze will feel the pain, in contact with the fur of the ferrets. The place is like a 10,000 steel needle in the thorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hurriedly moved her body and tried to hold them close to the cold rosestone floor, then she saw a pair of boots in the eyes of her eyes. Then, a handful of water with ice was poured on her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is Gülen, she heard the thieves are ordering the slaves to take more ice water, and then one hand grabbed her hair, "what happened Things," the thief asked: "Is it magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am not sure..." Meimi said painfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German walked over to the silver-filled bath, and he was shocked that in this short period of time, there were as many as fifteen feet. The water began to boil, the steam rolled, and the more hot, the thieves stepped back two steps. In order to prevent sensitive eyes from being burned by steam, the surface of the water is undulating like the sea in the storm, the surface is covered with bubbles that are constantly generating and rupturing, and there is a small stream of transparent trickles that scream into the air. He doesn't have to reach out and try to know that the current bath is only suitable for picking up an adult wild boar or bull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the temple of Fro, although it can be said that Kremar and Gavin half-jokingly cast corals to create a sanctuary, but they One is still a half-elf, and both are casters, they will not easily anger a god. Even if it is Fro, this sanctuary is not as narrow and cramped as the coral hut that they are temporarily living in the Red-throat Harbor. On the contrary, it is like a lovely and vast pink cloud that extends from the blue sea. The gum used to seal the gap holes is mixed with gold foil and silver foil, which makes it shine in the moonlight, but the altars, utensils, silk fur, ornaments, etc. are almost all The honey-loving admirers are generously gifted (whether or not they are really confused by the gems of Froor Pastor), and this bath made of precious cedar is one of them, and its capacity is destined to be impossible. Filled with human resources. So, like every house in the Dragon Fire Island, the water comes from the ground. The water that is burned by the lava all day is brought with high temperature. There are copper pipes to bring them to the ground, then cool down through the sea and put it Lowering to a temperature that is most suitable for humans is almost constant forever, because the temperature of both lava water and deep sea water is constant throughout the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female slaves poured the ice water on the plum, and she was no longer so painful, but what followed was that she began to have cold lips and she refused the slaves’ arms. She didn’t want anything to touch herself. . Fro's priest walked alone to the small altar, whispering under a sacred emblem inlaid with pearls and tourmalines. The white light was like the petals of sweet peas falling on her. On the body, as the magic works, her skin finally returns to its original appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spell is really a good thing," said the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a magical technique.” Mei Mi corrected, since she really got the favor from Fro (not the same as it was a few years ago) If there is no, intermittent, better than nothing, in the aspect of piety, she is no longer as flattering as in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also why she didn’t really think about him as the only lover when she loved Bydwin so much. She was expelled by her mother, and she understood that nothing was as important as the power in her hand. So Gülen had a sly and despised Fro, and she immediately issued a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am just a little envious," the thief said innocently, his fingers stroking the gold dagger hanging from the waist, approaching The nectar that was out of touch, he scorned in the past, and the scarlet tongue stopped on the priest's earlobe: "Do you need me to make a ritual with you? A respectable pastor, to pray for Fro's forgiveness?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei rolled a white eye and pushed him away: "Do you think that I will have any interest after this?" The slave girl put on her When she was in silk gown, she still trembled unconsciously: "What about your gift?" Mei Mi said that the businessman's Ji Yun, she was given to her by her former owner: "And you should not go to you." Did the Master of the Master report this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think will be this?" Gülen said, indicating that Mei Mei looked at the still boiling water: " I can't just tell him that our poor little pastor was almost cooked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amp;amp;amp;<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dragon is about to wake up," Dada said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon?" Kerry was surprised to ask, the reason why Longhuo Island is called Longhuo Island, just because it is shaped like a dragon spray The flames, as for the saying that the islands are sleeping with dragons, there are only some ignorant and ignorant humans who believe that because of their great power, the dragons may even cause changes in climate and magic. This is unnatural, and elves can It’s felt hundreds of miles away, unless it releases a spell to cover it up, but a sleeping dragon doesn’t do that, and its exuding power is also a kind of protection for itself. Deterrence against the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a real dragon." Dada is also one of the people who know the inside story: "We use this to represent the volcano," he said. "The volcano will erupt, just recently."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry's look becomes serious, and the soul of the opposite world is the same. It has read relevant content in its plane. If it is a volcanic eruption at sea, it is not a point of spraying. Volcanic ash and lava are counted. First there will be an earthquake before the outbreak, and the earthquake will almost always cause a tsunami, ground deformation, rock fall or mudslide is quite common. Coupled with the volcanic ash and lava that covered the sky when the volcano finally broke out, the worst speculation is that it would not be surprising to destroy one or two islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The volcano there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dongguan." Dada said: "It should be The East Crown, it has not broken out for three hundred years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said nothing, and his face was calm. The alien soul looked at him curiously: "But you don't seem to panic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to panic," Dada said: "The lord The casters will eliminate this scourge, like it was three hundred years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do they dissipate?" Please forgive the soul of the outside world I imagined that he only wanted a large group of wizards and warlocks to use flying to fly in the crater and throw a jelly-like spell down, but he knew it was impossible, even if the mortal knew to pour cold water on a large red fire. The result will only cause an explosion, which will cause the volcano to erupt in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Master," Dada said: "I don't know very well," the information is almost exclusively. The general eunuch can't be qualified to watch the mage cast. What he knows is that his sister, Ji Er, has heard intermittently from their father: "It is said that they will set up a plane pool that connects the fire element planes, and the warlocks' fire elements The pet will lead the lava to the fire element plane, dispersing the power of the volcanic accumulation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not easy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One can't, of course," Dada said. "But if a change occurs on a main island, then the lords of other islands will send their warlocks and mages to help complete the matter, after all, if The volcanic eruption, other islands will also be affected. If necessary, even the war between the island and the island will stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The more the number of casters, the better." Dada said, almost at the same time. His eyes swept over Kremar's cuffs quickly, and the elves instantly caught his eye. The white sleeves twitched a small bag, and Kremar's fire element magic moved. Climbing out of the sleeves, perhaps because of the news of the same kind, it was very excited, waving cheeks, the air constantly bursting with gold and red sparks. A few days ago it was summoned by Krimal to smelt Mithril, which caused it to lose a lot of power. So when the work was over, it returned to the fire elemental plane to rehabilitate, but today it greeted Cremari in the flame of the whale wax, wanting to be summoned to play, watching it look fresh. It seems that the recovery is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That said," Kerry said to the black-haired caster: "You may have to leave for a few days."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada lowered his head and hid his uneasiness. Of course he knew his father, why the lords of the East Crown were so generous, and the side island could be said to be the most embarrassing jewel in the East Crown territory. He probably wants to take it back at all times, especially after several of his sons have lost a lot of soldiers and gold coins on this island. His previous goal is to achieve more than half of what he is now. The cockroach is probably the new owner of the side island. The difficulties that the East Crown owner envisioned have been easily adopted by the black haircaster. Now the side island is not only well-trained, but also has nearly 3,000 trained and experienced. The soldiers, as well as the two Masters of Krimal and Gavin, and the heirs of the Silver Crown jungle, their strength is not only enough to maintain the operation of the entire side island, it is not impossible to expand outward in time, so the lord of the East Crown It really has to be a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, if Cremari refuses to work for the lord, the lord of the East Crown may use this to deprive him of the management of the side island and expel him; if He obeyed the order of the lord and went to the main island. Among the many casters, the lord could easily find one or two mages or warlocks who were willing to kill the same kind of gold coins or privilege. No matter what kind of thing, Dada didn’t want to Seeing that the slaves of Longhuo Island always belong to the Longhuo Islands. If there is no Kreima, he will return to his father or his brother Amos, and his ending may be more than his original. tragic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how can he move? Dada has to believe that fate is always used to showing its cruelty and badness to small people. If the volcano does not appear to be erupting, even if it is only delayed for three or five years, with a few years of rich output, he believes in his The new owner can really own and rule the side of the island, but now, Dada can only do the prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
