			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos hides in the shadow of the beam, peering at the seemingly ignorant black hair caster - the doubt in the heart of the little devil It’s just like there are so many corpses stacked in the city. It’s really unclear. In the White Tower, this half-elves, which is more similar to humans, always reminds its former owner, for which it also Deliberately tried it - the result was almost sent back to the bottomless abyss, and then because of the stupid Demon, for a long time, it was forced to stay with him and his wife, not as it was To track the caster (not to say that it dares to enter the gray ridge). In short, it took a lot of effort to get rid of the two innate idiots, got a little... ah, small, temporary freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a child licking a soul stone like a candy, and the exquisite spells of the gray robe can make the souls detained inside even Being melted to the last point is still alive and kicking. Although it will bring some tingling sensation, the devil who is not sensitive to the taste that humans love and can feel like this, has a unique taste and a very rich taste. The bitterness of resentment comes from the sorrow and grief of sorrow, from the frustration of salty glutinous rice... mixed with a little bit of sweetness, not from low desires or from self-deception illusions - so that the devils do not How do you like the soul stone made of the souls of people who are dull and smooth, and those who have some magical energy, but the devils taste as light and tasteless as we drink boiled water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many grey robes, or red robes, always make a lot of things that people seem to be superfluous before they take the soul of a mortal as the raw material of the soul stone. This is not only because they have too strong performance desires (that is only part of the reason), but more to make these mortal hearts full of fear and pain - even if it is not complete enough, but at least there is something to taste - the lich He has shown several soul stones he made to the souls of the outside world, lest he should make any jokes or troubles that should not be caused by not knowing the hard currency used for trading with the abyss. They look like egg-shaped gemstones wrapped in transparent ice, very beautiful and of varying sizes. Small is like a hummingbird egg, big like a goose egg, the color is different, the longer the life. The richer the experience, the larger the shape of the egg, and the more confusing the color of the gems wrapped in the ice. The soul of the alien world is a soul stone that resembles the black opal. The lich is understated. Tell him that there is a soul of a lord who inherited his father's territory and wealth when he was still very young. In the first few years he did a good job, after all, he was still smart and strong. Young, but with the stability of his position and the expansion of power, he gradually became arrogant, arrogant and cruel. He hired many thieves and red robes to serve himself, squeezing his people like stone crushing beans; he pretended to He negotiated with the enemy and entered into a marriage contract with his eldest daughter, but on the pledge of the oath, even the mother and the baby were not let go; he had many lovers, when he was hanging down, he could no longer be a male. When he was convinced, he ordered his soldiers to drag all these women out of the dagger; although he had a small church in the castle with such goodness as Rosada, in fact he did not obey the teachings of the pastor. Accept their condemnation - like this sin is deep and strong and stubborn, but has not signed a contract with any hungry demon soul, once entered the mourning plain, it will sink into the Styx, or be captured by the devil and the devil The endless abyss, perhaps after a long and terrible torture, is directly transformed into a barb magic or a small devil. Rather than being the soul of other mortal souls, it is drained into the lowest level of the infinite abyss. It is a mentally inferior.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before he died, he was caught by the Lich's mentor, and his soul was made into a soul stone and was transferred to the Lich as a reward soon. This is a big candy, even the succubus will be coveted, let alone his little magic pet, but because Asmodeos can't do anything that makes the Lich appreciate the good thing, at least It is worth the soul stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the lich puts this soul stone in his own pocket. Perhaps Asmodeos would really associate this dark-haired caster with his bone-framed master, but the cautious undead would leave the original pocket, crown, and staff before leaving the port. - Everything that may cause others to suspect that his true identity has sunk into the sea thousands of feet deep. The little devil is certainly unknown. It only confuses why this wizard with half of the elf blood is like an uncertainty. Sol blame has changed and changed, and those things that make it feel familiar and intimate disappeared in a blink of an eye, and now the dangling in front of it is a stranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is silently squatting, while using the slender tongue wrapped in the soul stone up and down the drum, sucking the energy inside - this stone The only thing that is forbidden is to sell the soul to the devil's trader for a few gold coins. Although the taste is rich but not rich enough - the mixed hybrid of the cockroach! The little devil complains in the heart about the ampoule that is thousands of miles away. This woman can become a "powerful" character she wants to become. She can't take the little devil's dedication, but in the reward, the endless abyss is down, she still Not comparable to Demon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want a master, a generous, tolerant, and truly powerful master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos thought, absent-mindedly lamenting, while casually letting his eyes sweep across the room, its sight was touching the tub It suddenly stopped - it saw itself in the black eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil jumped up, he wanted to escape, but a small thunderbolt had hit it, it screamed and screamed from the beam It fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can still escape. The question is why it has to escape. It was originally for Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil dexterously opens his wings in the air, flips over and falls to the end of the tub, where there is a personal fish-shaped handle, rolled up The tail is a pull ring, and the rivets embedded in the wall of the barrel are tapped on the backs of the hands that are separated on both sides. Asmodeos stops on its head and the claws hold the raised ear fins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar frowned, raised a finger, and a thin thunderbolt wraps around the finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please stop," the little devil hurriedly said: "Please stop - I am harmless, at least for you - absolutely harmless, great and powerful The caster, a respectable and tolerant adult. Please forgive me, I didn't mean to peek... Oh!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima throws lightning Accurately hit the dark, furry, wretched group, and he slammed his head and slammed it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair caster stood up from the tub. Being so upset, he didn't enjoy the hot water and sesame oil. He put on the clean, soft cotton cloth that the maids had prepared, and put on the tight trousers. Then, when the bat-like creature, like a long-haired bat or a winged hamster, crawled out of the shadow of the tub, he stepped on without hesitation—he didn’t know why he did that. But this action is as natural as breathing, and there is an unspeakable sense of comfort - almost no thought that if this is really an ordinary hamster, this may be tragically stepped on by him. A small black cake that can be shoveled with a shovel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Asmodeos is not an ordinary hamster. It carries the high heat that is common in the devil, or it is soft and muscular. Resilience, and very full, ah, in terms of the feeling of the alien soul. Quite similar to the kind of rubber ball that only has life, it will scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ten thousand...hey...sorry, hehe..." the poor little devil shouted, "...I am a last resort, respectful... Hey, adult, I have... Hey, important things to tell... Hey, you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima walked away from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil breathed a sigh of relief and lifted himself from the ground - the devil would hurt. Of course, its bones and internal organs are crowded together. It pulls its own flesh and makes it flat before it flies. Carefully fell to the dressing table, and kept a long distance from the caster - it twisted the neck, feeling the whole body is hurting, but there is a wonderful vagueness, um, even a refreshing familiarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a little pet." It raised its wings and made a deep bow to the caster (although not very ugly) Come out), "You can call me Asmodeos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired caster pulled up the white robes that had been restored to the original, and pulled them over the chair on the side of the tub. The thick white bearskin was covered in front of the tub, and the bare feet were not cold. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was made by a kind warlock." Asmodeos brazenly continued his lie, "After his death, he The apprentice got me, then took me around and traveled until I came here," he slammed his lower jaw and brought a just sorrow in his voice: "Beautiful multi-spirit, kindness and multi-spirit" - Who would have thought that such a terrible disaster would come to him? The unfortunate child, he was only an apprentice. When he thought of taking me away, the disease took his life, adult, He is dead, the gods are on, what a painful thing... I lost my master and then lost a master... Adult, you can understand that this means for a magic pet. "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The caster asked, but there was nothing in his tone that Asmodeus wanted to hear. Instead, with a little ominous perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still don't understand?" Asmodeos jumped up and slammed his four paws in turn: "The magic pet needs the owner." The magic pet is created to serve the master. The meaning of its existence lies in the hard work! The greatest, the most powerful, the most beautiful and the most beautiful adults, is this not the revelation given by the gods? I lost my master, and you have no magic pets! We are a couple of heavenly creations!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster coughed and put the phrase "I don't want to Married to a roaring hamster "swallowed up the belly: "I already have a demon pet," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The little spider!" Asmodeos screamed: "The endless... The gods are on, can that be called the magic pet?" It's just a useless elemental creature - can it talk? Can it think? Can it understand you? It's just an element! No, I don't mind when you want to bake it, when it's called, But you can't call it a magic pet, it's an insult! It's all right!" It waved its wings to indicate that it was in a state of horror and anger. "The real magic can do more than it." Much more! Whether you are going to face an enemy or a friend - you will know, I am much more capable and smart than it is - I can stealth, fly, help you collect spellcasting materials, or pay attention to you Even a trace of the strangeness around him, the spike on the tail can easily paralyze a bison... I will tell jokes, sing, and dance a short leg, the shape is still so cute, if you I want to pay attention to that beautiful person... Ah, I will bring your hand to you - I The most respectable caster, what are you still hesitating, I, smart and capable Asmodeos," it confidently declared: "It is the best for you, the best for you." Devil's pet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
