			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A math problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cedar tree is known to have a six-foot breast diameter and ask for the tree Psychological shadow area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rabbit is still persistent, Kreima’s position is second only to Kerry, and the rainstorm is no longer so fierce, at least he can already Under the shelter of the cap, he opened his eyes and he saw the most rabbit he had ever seen. They are like a cream on a five-inch Matcha cake, and the human metasequoia is like a small candle inserted in it. The bottom of the candle is still shrinking at a visible rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Metasequoia began to tilt, in addition to the Master and Ranger, everyone began to yell and try to jump to another tree, Kerry Ben has stopped drinking them loudly. This metasequoia has more than two people can handle hand-to-hand distance. The trunk has become extremely slippery due to rain. The surrounding light is still dull and never accepted. It is almost impossible for ordinary people who have been trained in martial arts to move from one tree to another without help - they can thank Keriben and Crimmar for climbing the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf takes out a seed, embeds the bark of the metasequoia, recites a spell, and the white plant tentacles swelled and thickened from his fingers. Its roots are deeply plunged into this unfortunate metasequoia, and the stems stretch out to each gap and catch each branch that can be entangled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under its bundling and involvement, the falling metasequoia will accurately hold the shoulders against another fir tree after a slap and roar, then Under the command of the elf, the parasitic vine forced the third tree. After it reluctantly joined, the human found that he was perched on a triangular bracket, so that even if the rabbits broke the trees, they were one and a half Will not fall back to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raindrop behind the wizard suddenly became smaller. He turned his head and Kerry was on a branch next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already asked for help from Biyindi," he said. "But we still need time..." The knight who has always been clever has suddenly become a bit Hesitant, he does not seem to be sure whether to say the rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need to disperse these rabbits, otherwise they might light up the entire forest before the rescue comes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar thought for a while, he thought he Knowing what Kerry is scrupulous about, in this crisis-ridden continent, the casters have always hated or hated two things. One is to estimate their ability limit; the other is to exhaust the spell and mental power. - Both of these are likely to cause the death of the caster himself, or worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is doing that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the quickest case, Kerry is summoning one Only spotted, it is the fastest bird to be able to perceive. When it arrives in Alva, Alva or his subordinate master may be able to transfer directly here, but the path of human beings through a day is still Need the birds to fly... "According to your magical pendant, one time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an hour, the soul of the outside world is manipulating His body took a deep breath and turned to the group of rabbits. They started to bite three trees at the same time, and they were clever and clever! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them climb as much as possible," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only project sound waves to the rabbits, the damage caused by the cold is too small, after all, the rabbit has fur, flames and lightning will put them before killing the rabbit It turned into a string of fragrant barbecue. Under the damage of the sound waves, the rabbits fell silently, but more, the abominable three-petal mouth smashed after a moment of stagnation and smashed the body of the companion. Come up and continue their great cause of destroying vegetation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the rescuer arrived, the rain had stopped, the clouds had not completely dispersed, and the sky was so bright that what he saw was a pile of spectacular, gray-white fur and yellow The white mound hills, the fifty-foot-high cedar tripod is only less than one-half, and the tops of each other form a small platform, where the survivors huddle together and the ranger stands behind the wizard. Carrying the longbow, the sac is empty - some rabbits with the same size, auburn can jump over ten feet, and the branches directly threaten the mage who is casting spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the Master Alva who came to the rescue, but his most proud disciple, Leo, who was impressed by him because this young man has A ridiculous bowl-shaped hairstyle is very similar to one of the men in a movie describing Star Trek. He first gave a formal mage to Cremari, and then turned to Kerry Ben: "To you." I am most impressed," he said, with an imperceptible anxiety: "My mentor, Alva, could not come in person, because just a quarter of an hour ago, the Sea Monster and its fleet are approaching the Bibi Dibao. He must stay behind to protect himself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please tell Master Alva, he has given me the most important and greatest help," Kerry found a smile of relief: "I am so happy to meet you, my old friend."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary male human body jumped and steadily fell on the branches, and the right hand raised the chest, and slammed a slyly: "The followers of nature and wilderness pay tribute to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A druid, the lich said with disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——嗄? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I thought I was not talking to your soul for the first time, the Lich said, or you just have a dim sum – given the reckless move before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I was a little flattered, and the soul of the outside world responded dryly, you actually only used "recklessness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Not stupid, idiot, and hopeless? The once undead sneer poked the "body" of the cohabitation, which literally jumped in panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Why should I stop you, the Lich continues to calmly say, will you reject Kerry Ben? Will you abandon these humans? Will you hide some of your strength in accordance with my opinion? You are even running out of the scrolls. Since not, why should I waste my efforts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I believe there will be many chances to hear this in the future, the Lich said calmly, but at least this time, I hope your friends As sure as you think, this body is safe and sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he sank, which means that in a short time he never wants to talk to the soul of the outside world, the latter has to shrug his helplessly. Turn your attention to the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid is trying to communicate with the rabbits, he is dangerously kneeling in front of the rabbit group, jumping, pulling his ears, soothing howling or dissatisfied Howling, but the rabbits all yelled and screamed with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," after almost being dragged down by the rabbits, Barrow returned to Kerry Ben with disappointment: "It’s completely out of control, I am like It is facing a group of fierce and bloodthirsty orcs who simply ignore what I am talking about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at this." Kerry handed over a auburn big rabbit. It looked like a big dog, with bloody teeth licking his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rabbit was shot through Kerry's head, and Kerry's arrow was so sharp that the crack it caused almost traversed half of the skull, inside Something is faintly visible. Barro stretched out his fingers and pulled out a piece of tumor like a tumor. Numerous tiny blood vessels connected it to the rabbit's brain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a product of nature." Barrow said that his expression became both angry and sad. "...we must find another way, Kerry Ben."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Whatever it is, please do as soon as possible." Leo said that he took over the work of Kremar, which gave him a heartfelt admiration for the dark-faced half-evil mage: "I may not be able to Master Crimal is doing just as well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barra opened a leather bag on the waist, a two-and-a-half-foot small white diamond When it came out, it looked around and gave a scream of dissatisfaction. Barro stroked it and talked to it with the same hoarse voice. Can continue for too long, badger IOUs from Barrow hands jumped down, seemed to vanish in the foliage and cedar in the rabbit group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that the claws and their wives lived not far from here," Barrow said. "I will come back before the clouds are scattered." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a step back, his face and body shivered in an alarming moment, his arms stretched and he grew feathers, and the merchants stunned at a man wearing a cloth It turned into an eagle, and they probably looked at a druid into an animal so close to the first place - a brown cockroach vacated and the breath disappeared into the gray clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-eyedly wants to ask them what they are doing, but the ordinary people’s fear of the caster forces him to close his mouth. The fat man around him was more anxious than he was worried. He kept holding the branches tightly and kept looking down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine how happy it was when he found a rabbit who was absent-minded and occasionally supported his body to look around. This situation does not seem to be the only thing. One by one, the rabbits stopped the action of biting the trees. They swayed their ears nervously and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
