			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black-haired caster and companion who deliberately thanked the owner of the cottage after Krimar and Kerry arrived at the smog cottage of Alva Master. After all, Master Alva gave them a lot of selfless help, but Master Alva did not feel that he had something to praise - the triangular waters between Beitburg, Longhuo and Azores. It is the hunting ground where the pirates are galloping, and the mage and parliamentarians who are the Betty Dykes, if they need to fight against the despicable and shameless thieves, whenever he is willing to wait, as for the spells in the spellbook and the dior bag. The material, it was just a little reward that an older mage had pre-fetched to his children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to calculate it carefully," Master Alva still habitually smokes his hookah and uses water to entertain his guests. "Only a sea The devil's head is enough to cover them, let alone her subordinates and ships. We must know that since our outer walls have more unique decorations, let alone the sea, even the city is quiet. Less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard this," said Alva’s disciple, not the gift book that copied it to Cremari. Bit - that was the last disciple of Alva, standing here is the first disciple of Alva. After he left the mentor, he drifted outside for a long time. Master Alva had not seen him for more than 20 years, but he is said to have his own mage tower somewhere in the north, and he also has his own disciple and perhaps his collar. Min, but perhaps because of the hardships and bitterness, he looks older than Alvara, with fine wrinkles around his lips and eyes, deepening when he laughs and talks, like cracking after freezing Land: "You are a young but powerful mage," he said to the black-haired caster: "The bard has already fought you and the sea demon, and the Drake of the Golden Lady, and won. The melody of the things is sung around, and on the way to Bibi Dibao, every pub can hear the names of you and your companions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People are always happy and tired," Kerry said: "The bards must cater to them - but after a few months, we can hear new legends and new names from their mouths. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think Ranger Kerry is quite experienced." Alva's disciple said: "In any case, your name is the most common one in Psalms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; If the previous words are only slightly ridiculous, this sentence is not so gentle, even with a slight malice. Master Alva shouted the name of the disciple. "Sorry," his disciple immediately said, "Maybe I have just had a relationship with honey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between the mentor and the disciples and apprentices in the caster is very wonderful. To some extent, it can be described by the father and son and even the more intimate relationship - but even the most kindly mentor is in front of his disciples or apprentices. Extremely tough and stern, it is not that they are willing to do so. It’s just that the danger of magic is much higher than that of medicine and flame. Children who are apprentices in blacksmith shops or pharmacies are also inevitably tempted by temperament, mischievous and unfortunately killed and killed because of various accidents, let alone casters. Apprentices and disciples. Some mages even consciously force those gifted children to do monotonous and boring work day after day, such as wiping walls, utensils, cleaning carpets, making and sorting parchment, and so on, rather than letting The servants are going to do it, in order to obey and cautify them into their hearts, to sharpen their edges and curiosity - both of which can make them scream at any time before they have mastered the magic, or they will be implicated Other innocent people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every disciple's disciple will have a deep fear of his mentor, even if the magic contract has been lifted. Or the disciples have already served their mentor, they will still unconsciously lower their heads when they see their mentor, and let the way out to show respect - even gray robes or red robes, maybe You will say that the Warlock's Warlock is not a minority, but if you can measure it carefully, you will find that it only accounts for a small part of the total Warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now that Master Alva gave a warning, his disciples immediately showed obedience, and Kerry did not think that he was, and Kremar The governor of the Bibi dike near him immediately shifted the topic to the other direction, since the Dragon Crown in the Dragon Fire Island. That is to say, the side island has become the domain of the children of Alva Master. Then the merchants of Bibi Dibao naturally have one or more ports that allow them to buy and sell and park at ease. He is also a businessman himself. In a few words, Krimaar initially reached a simple but full-fledged agreement - he not only obtained a monopoly license for the black hair caster (the equivalent of Bishop's merchants does not need to work with any dragon The merchants of the Fire Island deal with the goods. Instead, they pick up the goods directly from the warehouse in the side island. They also get the right to settle in a port. There is also a part of the land near the port for him to build warehouses and houses. He promises to have 500. The soldiers of the Beitenburg are stationed there, both to protect their goods and to relieve the pressure on the Normans in the Highlands. In addition, it may be necessary to discuss with other businessmen, but it is almost guaranteed that the Normans on the side of the island can get three double-boats or two three-masted ships, and they are equipped with sailors. After all, wait until the pirates or other It is too passive for the Normans in the Highlands to evict them before they invade the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soul of the alien world drops his magic mark on the parchment—an unrecognizable weird pattern, the consul of the Betty Dykes carefully rolled it up, dripped the wax seal, and stuffed it into the hollow silver. The tube was placed in his arms and placed properly. Of course, there was also a copy of the owner of the side island, which also knocked on the seal of the consul of the Bibi Dyke. The ruler pulled the hookah and blew it into the beautiful agate mouthpiece. Mouth, after seeing the dark red fire re-brightened, I leaned back into the soft velvet cushion and took a sip of comfort. The pale blue smoke overflowed from his mouth, and the fragrant smell of the people pervaded everyone. around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien is the person closest to him, he sniffs, somehow, he always feels the smell of the present with him before the Master of Alva The smell is different. Alva Master's shisha uses almost all the spices from flowers and fruits. The most common ones are roses, gardenia, occasionally lavender, peach and lemon are his two favorite flavors, but He will also add citrus, grapes, olives or blackberries to his heart. Their smell is sweet. But I can never get rid of the unique gentleness of the flower and fruit scent, and now the soul of the outside world is beyond the ordinary people's keen sense of smell and tells him that there is a mellow and sweet smell among them. This smell seems to be heard not long ago. been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- is the kind of tobacco with bright flowers, the Lich said. You shouldn't forget this. He ridiculously said that you fear it is like a mortal fearing the devil - sorry, I said it is wrong, even if a mortal sees the devil, it will not be worse than the tobacco you see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The kind of tobacco is the devil. The soul of the alien world said that it bowed its head and searched for the source of the smell in the hookah that Alvar had given them, but the smoke of the hookah was chopped and mixed, and they could not see what they were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I don’t understand what’s worth panic, the Lich says, any less stupid caster knows how to remove toxins from the body, and they The soul is far more tenacious than a mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- At least we want them to know that the soul of the opposite world says. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-No, now, the Lich reminds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, in order to wait for an elf who is heading to Bituminburg. They still need to stay for a day. On the night of the night, people go to rest and meditate. The souls of the outside world visit the Master Alva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Alva will not be the kind of person who turns a deaf ear to the warning of goodwill, even if it is... "It is a gift," said Master Alva. "A caravan brought, it is said that the fruit of the plant is fermented. Formed, "Because the Master Alva is a member of the Bishop's Fortress and its biggest protector, the caravans that come and go often bring him something interesting and uncommon: "But that caravan is "From the North."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This plant is used to configure secret medicine on the Dragon Fire Island." The soul of the alien world said: "They use This kind of secret medicine is used to control slaves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have tested them, it is indeed slightly toxic, but it can..." Relaxation and relief he has to always Maintaining a nervous state, Alva Master paused a little. Because he remembered suggesting that he tried to put this fruit in tobacco, not others, it was his first disciple, and he was also very skilled and attentive in how to make them - perhaps he is also a The victim, or he and himself, think that the toxicity of this fruit may be harmful to mortals, but it is just a slap in the face of the caster? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he immediately thought of a problem, that is, if this fruit has become a cargo in the caravan. So where will it be shipped? The caravan footprint of Bibi Dibao can be traced to every corner of the mainland, including the orc's whistling plains and the dragon's Grenada. How big is the damage to mortals? Even if he didn't have the secret medicine, he couldn't imagine that they were put into countless soup pots - as Kremar said, the fruit can be used not only as a tobacco but also as a medicine. It can also replace food – not that it is nutritious, but that people who eat this fruit will not feel hungry, nor will they feel cold or hot, and even the pain will be reduced to a degree of ignorance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are addicted?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like a drinker, just serious Hundreds of times." The soul of the outside world said: "I heard that they bring more joy to people than they did."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will Note, "Mr. Alva said that he only feels chilly because he can already feel it - the smoke of the hookah has been with him for decades, but he wants to hold it anytime, anywhere, or in recent days. Things, no one was surprised before it was revealed, including himself. Alva’s closest companion was the hookah, which everyone knows, but no one knows better than him. The hookah was just an innocence for him. A small hobby, not as it is now, leaving him for a while will make him unbearable - he took a hookah before meditation, filled the tobacco, placed it next to the meditation and then sucked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
