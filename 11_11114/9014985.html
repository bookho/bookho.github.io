			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reiite did not immediately get the results she wanted, she was not anxious - that person would eventually compromise, his situation in the guild It’s even harder than Ruiyite – three of the ten casters who work for the guild have the blood of a dragon, just like in Tahi, their status is most clearly differentiated by the number of blood vessels. But even the lowest of them is more expensive than the most capable assassin or the most embarrassing thief. But there are also some unlucky guys, such as the blood of a poor male warlock who can't find even a drop of blood belonging to a dragon. His magical ability comes from a demon (not even a demon!), his mother It was just an ordinary human being, who was dedicated to a quark in the priest of the Tarona god. She was almost torn in half, but for the evil purpose of the abyss, the woman was allowed to survive. An ignorant poor woman, she thought she was lucky, but did not know that the demon had left evil seeds in her warm belly. In the seventh month she gave birth to a boy who did not show any difference. In the place of ordinary people, until his mother hit his back with wooden shoes because of an onion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He burned the woman, and the village where he lived for nearly 12 years, he wandered around, maybe someone wanted to contain him, but the devil Blood always causes him to fall into violent and furious from time to time. He is malicious, skeptical, temperamental, and cruel to anything. If it is not for the guild to promptly extend their hidden and ubiquitous tentacles, He may have been arrested or executed for his innocent behavior. The guild gave him a room and a mentor, where he received an extremely strict education, and learned to obey and endure, as well as writing, reading, martial arts and conspiracy, and other things that the guild thought he had to learn. Most importantly, he finally understood how to coordinate and use those innate abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those irritating little monsters. He is considered to be excellent, and his mentor regrets that he is not a descendant of the dragon, but so far, because the cause of the blood can never be the superior who manipulates and dominates the fate of others. And he can only choose one of the sacrifices and the pieces. He is not the first one or the last one. The most painful thing is that he still has so little wisdom that he can’t be as ignorant as his companions. In the short enjoyment, he spent every day and night, thinking hard to get rid of this terrible fate, and because of this, he climbed to the highest point where creatures like him could climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This task may be a turning point for him - too for Ruiyite. If he is standing at the highest point of the lower class, then Ruiyite, who has a dragon's blood, is at the bottom of the upper class – the dragon's blood in her body is too weak, her grandfather and a human being. The female mage gave birth to her mother, and her mother married a damn mortal to give birth to her - if not her mother and father have been punished, Ruiyi does not mind killing them again Once, she deeply hated the blood of the human beings. They made her weak and incompetent, slow and ignorant. She would even be sick like a mortal because she was too cold or too hot, nor could she be as good as other pastors. I prayed to Gredi for ten days, twenty days, and a month—so she will be thrown here, dealing with stupid humans and priests who are not very important even if they take their heads. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyote is deeply fearful because she knows how the guild and Wang Ting deal with the cumbersome things they feel useless – either the mission fails (sometimes only once) or is seriously injured (serious It’s not worth the cost of drugs and spells, or disappointing them in some way. Those who have been feared and worshipped by others will be abandoned in a less important place, then his wealth, power and resources. It will be taken away in the same way, and then it will disappear or die silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal ridiculed that she got a white tower like a shell, but Ruiyite has more far-reaching ideas. But it takes a while for this idea to be put into practice, and to be a strong support for the guild and even the court. In this gap, she must do something to prove that she is not a stupid mediocrity. Be aware that neither the guild nor Wang Ting is patient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled down her silk gown and walked into the beautifully decorated bathroom, relaxing in a hot bath, sesame oil and fine foam for a short time and restrained My own body and mind, there are still some work that makes her bored to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Baita Jewelry Guild is standing alone in the empty reception room. Wearing black mourning, his eldest son died two months ago. Then he was his wife. He didn't know what to do, but he still had a son, a son who was a thief apprentice. Because of this, he got more favors than the leaders of the other two guilds— - His taxes are the least in the city, but at the cost of his craftsmen, they must deal with the precious ornaments and ornaments that are unclear around the clock - the stones and pearls need to be removed from the base, and sometimes mosaic (sometimes They also need to be cut and polished to make them look different. Their bases are cast together with other gold and silver products into shiny gold and silver coins - one of his craftsmen told him with horror. Gold teeth with flesh and blood were found in stacked candlesticks, plates and bracelets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what can he do? Can he still complain to the consul and the lord? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That person... is no longer a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen walked into the reception room from another room, her pace was very slow, but it was not because she was not feeling well or her mood was not good, on the contrary, She never felt so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is yelling at her, she can find fear and conviction in their eyes, they no longer dare to despise her, deceive her, or play in front of her small means that are not elegant, now Hey, not only the White Tower's consul, it is not just the lord of the hills, but also a powerful caster. She can't rely on anyone to let them lie in her feet willingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the leader of the jewellery guild is a big businessman who controls all the liquor sales in Baita. He only uses the corner of his eye to sweep the ampoule. She put down her knees in trembling - when they persuaded the petite woman to murder her husband, she was still so fragile, so beautiful, but now... her half body is still normal, but the other half is It only makes people seem to fall into a real nightmare - a red line divides her into two parts from the center of her forehead, and some are still feminine like the gardenia under the moonlight. The other part is covered with blue-purple scars. The scars are covered with fine white scales. One of her eyes is like a giant python, showing a bright yellow color, and the surface is covered with a dark brown curved pattern. The black coix seed is no longer a round shape, but a strangely cold and cold shuttle shape; in addition, from the waist down, her limbs have a strange deformation, you can say that it is a tail. It can also be said that it is a claw, and the sarcoma on it is probably only as big as the finger, but the fat is full, just like the tree grapes he had seen on the southernmost island, where people use it to make wine. - The purple-black small fruit that grows close to the rough trunk is densely packed, and the milky white juice flows out when touched a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen knows what they are thinking, she just smiled tolerantly, she has no concern for these little things after she has the power, only the weak Will value other people's ideas. The strong is always above everyone else. Even the leader of the "fine net" guild had to respect her and agreed to contain and sort out the chaos of the White Tower. Although she made some concessions, she also made some considerable achievements for those who are willing to be convinced. Benefits - Even though she is faced with a powerful priest and a large guild (although there is a dragon's blood), she still secures her power and dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the wine guild is not easy to perceive a glance at the people around him, if only he and the leader of the jewellery guild can still say today The meeting is for taxes or other financial requirements, but what about the strangers who are frightened and restless? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to think about it before he realized that one of them was the deacon of the Lord’s Manor, and one might be the supervisor. But the taxes from the land are often not enough to cover one tenth of the caravans. Is it even now that they have to start taking on extra work? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want you to come today." An Zhen said, then he snorted less comfortably, and the garrison captain around her turned slightly. Trying to keep yourself from paying attention to the slender, split-black tongue. "I want you to see one thing." An Zhen continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maid is carrying a silver tray, her lips are oddly arched upwards, like a wild boar, but more beautiful than the current ampoule It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some dried leaves in the tray and a small pile of brown seeds of the size of rye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like a spice..." the deacon whispered. He asked about a rich aroma, but couldn't think of the plant that the fragrance belonged to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can be said that it is a spice." An Zhen suddenly said, scared the deacon, he felt that he was already very light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is not used to cook soup or sprinkle on the barbecue," An Zhen smiled, a sharp tooth slipping out of the lips, black The tip of the tongue flexed out and wrapped around it and then shrank back: "It is used for smoking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like tobacco? ?" the supervisor asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can be said to be a kind of tobacco." An Zhen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But... as far as I know," the leader of the wine guild cautiously said: "Tobacco seems to be more suitable for growing in warm places, all along, They are more from the Longhu Islands in the south."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hills are not too cold." An Zhen said indifferently: "It is It can grow here and be able to grow well - I hope that it will be seen from the next year to cover the entire hill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Where is wheat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All unplugged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Deacon Blurting out, "People don't need so much tobacco!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will need it very, very much." His master puts a tough The gesture, the tone said sharply: "And I am not talking to you, but commanding you - I don't want to hear someone, just to oppose my will - this is the first So I forgive you, but in return, you have to do this thing perfectly, I know you can do it," she opened her eyes, a human eye and a snake's eye, staring at the one. The old man with a gray face: "If you can't do it, or if you don't want to do it, I will hang your little grandson in the wheat field until his eyes are taken by the crows to allow others to put him down." - Before that, I promise that he will be alive and conscious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...No, no, please don't do this, my benevolent master!" the deacon shouted in a hurry. "Please forgive me, forgive me, as long as you say, I will definitely do it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Announces his lips slyly and slaps the "tail" with the claws: "Go and do it," she said. "But don't Forget me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the jewellery guild and the leader of the wine guild looked at each other: "So," the leader of the jewellery guild took a step forward. Deeply bowed, the magnitude of it is like breaking your waist: "Excuse me, what can we do for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "All you have to do is vacate your caravan," said An Zhen. "Your suitcase will be filled with this kind of tobacco." paused, she pointed to the tray, and the other two maids brought it. The pipe: "You can taste it, that's kind of... I will never forget it if I taste it. It's unbeatable." The leaders of the two guilds hesitated to pick up When the tube, she glanced stood cowering endless deacon, there has been wrinkled eyebrows of Supervisors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you." An Zhen said: "Try it," and smugly knocked on the arm: "They will exchange value for us." Ten times more than a hundred times more wheat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& After I had my own weight, Leona said with a disappointment: "In the court of Norman, Norman, or elsewhere, it is very impolite to ask a woman's weight."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you want to be a mercenary or an adventurer." Birdwin said with a smile: "It is important for the companion to clearly understand your weight and keep it. "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a joke." Kerry Ben said: "This is a matter of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Because it is possible to encounter the current situation or trap?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is magic," Kerry Ben looked at Crimall: " I know that there is a spell that can transfer people or things. A distance - "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; black hair caster nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
