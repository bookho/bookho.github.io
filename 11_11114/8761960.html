			<div id="content">Rosada’s pastor was kept in the smallest prison, where the prison guards called the “little comfort zone”, which was worse than the “furnace” because the caves were deliberately cut into inverted half-conical shapes. The person inside can neither lie nor sit, but can barely maintain a half-squatting posture. This position is maintained for a few minutes, and your spine will hurt like it is about to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were not many people who survived the deadly madness, and the injured were not cleaned and treated. Stay in this place for a day or two. It was infected, the wound was swollen, black, pus, and several people were feverish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who do you want to ask?" One of the guards said: "There are not many people awake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Director Pastor." Master Antonio said: "There may be other people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards bowed to him, "Yes. "Respected Master," but he immediately sarcastically corrected: "The former chief pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took them to the "previous" director In front of the priest's cave, the torch on the wall was taken down to his face. It was a skinny old man, naked like other prisoners, full of filth and small wounds. One of his wrists was dislocated, and his palm was weakly pulled. Under the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards slammed the torch into the iron fence, and Mars splashed on his face. The old man screamed in pain and opened his eyes, but he could see that His will is still in chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said the guard. "What do you want to ask? Or do I need to drag him out and put it on the shelf?" Crimmar followed him. Looking at the line of sight, the wall on the right side has a wooden beam about two palms wide, three palms deep, the color is black, from the end of the corridor to the end, the height is similar to the usual railings, with The thick nails of the thumb are nailed to the wall, and there is a hoop every five to six feet above. There are belts or ropes on the iron ring, and some creepy decorations are placed on the wooden beams. At first, the souls of the opposite world saw it but did not associate them with the torture apparatus at all - black metal shoes, two long forks, clips that looked like beaks, large hooks and scissors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will be fine." Master Antonio said that he lowered his knees and grabbed the iron fence. He whispered something, but the old man would only say " water". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give him some water," said Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards hesitated to look at the elf, although the influence of the Demon Master, the current White Tower people hold a vigilance against these beautiful non-humans Skeptical attitude, but in the long years of the past, Ranger Kerry has won numerous praises for his good character and admirable heroic wisdom. He does not want to confront such a person: "So he nodded, "you Give him some water. "But he added: "But I don't think this is useful for questioning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another guard climbed the ladder with Kremar, and they returned to the room connected to the kitchen, after obtaining permission, Kremarna There was a big wooden cup, and there was still a little ale left. He took water from the well, washed the cup and poured it into a full cup. The guard watched him funny and smelled the smell of water. Trying to take a sip, frowning, like ice is coming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This water is very clean," said the guard, the black hair caster Shake the cup under the light, the cup reflects the light, and it glows brightly: "It is a waste to give those pigs a drink. He shouted dissatisfiedly, but still returned to the prison with Kremar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outer world firmly grasped the cup, his tongue was very It hurts, he just bite it a bit, and the hot, sweet liquid suddenly fills the entire mouth - he remembers that the lich and he said that the purest positive energy flowing in this body, he made a thought To drink water, use a huge wooden cup to block your face, let your blood flow into the cup, and shake the cup until the light is scattered, so as not to be hysterical, they obviously don’t want to let the prison Man gets treatment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Master took over the cup brought back by Crimal, he held the cup firmly, crossed the iron fence, first the wood The cup pressed against the old friend's lips and tilted a little to let his lips touch the water. When he felt it, he opened his mouth and put out his tongue. He only increased his inclination. He was very careful, but some water still came from The prisoner’s lips and the gap between the wooden cups flowed down and slipped over the chest with the ribs clearly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair caster took a step forward, as if to hear the conversation they were about to start, in fact, Cremari just wanted to block the light of the torch. So that the guards will find that the wounds on the prisoners are recovering quickly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Master also found this, but he kept silent, and the chief pastor’s eyes gradually It became clear, indicating that wisdom and reason are returning to this body. He immediately discovered this little secret and raised a finger to make a gesture of pushing the wooden cup.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master returned the wooden cup to Crimall: "Also to other people," he said in an unquestionable voice: "Don't let me ask when I ask."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar walked away with a wooden cup. He first fed the priests of Rosada. They were very smart. Although they noticed the strangeness in the water, none of them came out. One of them was After drinking two mouthfuls, he gasped and told him that Adel was next to him: "Give him more water," he mixed his sentence in a trembling squat: "He is very hurt."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel in a "little comfort zone", his face was violently beaten, the jaw was broken, the eyes were swollen and purple, all over the body, and the waist ribs had a width The deep wound is like a fold at any time. This may be the most serious wound in his body. The reason is maybe because he has to bend his body and his hands are between his legs. The finger can almost touch his own tail vertebrae, and Kreima can't see his chest and can't see his abdomen, but it does have Thick stream of blood from his body below, wetting the dirty ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima sensed the position of the guards, they were standing at the Antonio Master, and their attention was almost entirely on their conversation, no one noticed Here, he swung his wrist, luxuriously cleaned the wound of the cockroach, and pressed the cup against the white lips after seeing it no longer bleed slowly. Yadel, who lost consciousness, moved slightly and whitish. The lips eagerly sucked on the edge of the wet cup, but the rock cave that was imprisoned was like a well-conceived tailored coffin. He couldn’t lift his head, and Crimmar whispered his fingers in the cup. There was a lively little water polo, only the marbles, it jumped directly into the mouth of Yadel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosada’s young pastor swallowed several water polo to wake up, but once he figured out what was going on, he was tight I closed my mouth - fortunately, the ones he had swallowed before were almost enough. His injury was getting better. Kremar put his fingers into the iron fence and dug some from the ground... he tried not to think about those. What kind of stuff is wet and greasy? Anyway, it is black, with blood, he rubs it on Yadel's face, covering the eyes and nose that have eliminated swelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his fingers retracted, he accidentally picked up Yadel’s hair and found that except for the skin, the hair inside had faded. There is no life in the lead white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale looked at him, Krimaar didn't know if he recognized himself, and then he found out what the pastor was trying to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
