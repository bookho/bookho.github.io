			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's words: I am sorry, originally this chapter should be issued at noon, the result is that the phone bill of the father and mother has not been paid, the phone is broken, and the telecommunications business is required. Office payment - air conditioning has a problem, someone needs to look at the repair, so late - sorry sorry, well, this chapter is issued, I continue to go to the code, may be late, adults can see tomorrow morning . Thank you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the sentence of ten years of exile, Kerry Ben reached out and held down the arm of Cremari’s arm, ten years for humans. It’s really a long time, but Yadel is still young. Even if he’s been in exile for ten years, he’s only 30 when he returns to Baita. This is a punishment for him. The disguised protection, in any case, occupies one-fifth of the life's life enough to make that terrible night fade in some people's memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until he heard the follow-up of this verdict, the Ranger looked at the ampoule on the platform to announce the verdict. And the young half-elf returned to the innocent and gentle questioning, just as she just opened an innocuous little joke - no one would accept a sinner with a brand on his cheek, especially the one that could not be healed and covered. This means that there must be magic or divine power. People will expel them, hurt them, kill them. No pastor will be willing to treat them. They can't even find a chance to be a slave. Yes, even Mine pits and gladiars that need consumables will not accept them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best result of them is to find an inaccessible place, not to be in contact with anyone, to live alone for ten years - if not infected, hunger, beast Or the human weapon is down. Ten years later they may be able to return to the White Tower, but the sign that cannot be eliminated will repeatedly remind people of what they have done and they will never be able to return to their original lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important key, even the elves, can't let Yadell with this ugly mark become the ruler of the White Tower, how can you make people how? Trust and obey a sinner who will be despised and rejected? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hot anxious caught the heart of the Ranger, he thought without thinking, stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Catch him, don’t let him say something that should not be said. The undead who used to rush reminded me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry Ben!" Crimdale shouted, and also stood up, holding Kerry's arm in the backhand, just like he had before ten The year of exile was a suspicion when Kerry was holding his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s eyes fell on them. In order to show respect for the lord and the law, the elf pulled down the hood of his cloak. His blond hair was wet by the rain, and the long ears were exposed in the gorgeous silk. Small pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon moves slowly from his chair to his body, he goes to the ampoule, and puts one of his hands on the waist of the girl lord Top: "It seems that our elf (he deliberately aggravated the pronunciation of the 'elf') does the Ranger disagree with the lord's decision?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Curry If Marr’s blockade has not allowed Kerry’s complete waking, then Demon’s problem is no less than a cold water filled with finely divided ice. The hot blood is swiftly from the ranger’s face and brain. Faded, he looked at Anzhen again, Anzhen smiled at him, and Demon’s eyes were like intertwined with poison and spikes. He looked at the people around him. He only looked at a face that was ignorant. - This kind of punishment on the face is not uncommon in this world. Some lords are quite keen on this, but the former Baita consuls are almost all elves and half-elves, they have never used this not only Destroy ** and damage the mental punishment, so the people of Baita do not understand this - perhaps they The poet has heard a little about it, but only heard it. It can even be said that most of them are still in favor. After all, their lords are also thinking for those who are unaware of it, if it is a generous good-hearted person because Is it a matter of great deplorable regret that you have lost your life and your loved ones? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some people who are killed because of loved ones and loved ones, but they can’t get the comfort they deserve because they hate. They don’t care if the guys with the shackles are Really suffering from madness, they just want to watch the lord order to cut off the heads of these wicked people, or other more cruel punishments. Of course they are willing to watch the murderer suffer more crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former and the latter have one thing in common, that is, they all believe in Demon’s lies, and believe that their misfortunes are all due to the White Tower. The covenant city of Gray Ridge turned a blind eye to their scourge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is not supported here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brazier that was prepared for a long time was burnt red, a mage recruited by Demon (if you remember, he was in the room of the "intestines") Throwing a spell for peeping), using a simple trick for the two soldering irons, changing it into a sacred emblem of Rosada, then he looked at Demon and painted at the lower end of one of the emblems. A strange bug with one leg, and finally he scratched his hand and split the two figures into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- What does that bug mean? Asked by the soul of the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The once undead person first gave a sharp laughter - a single-footed worm, swallowing siblings while still larvae, swallowing at adulthood Eating parents, so it is regarded by human beings as a symbol of kinship - it is obvious that the girl's body is more human blood, see, she is so legitimate and legally cut off the boy's all way (he Shaking his head gracefully) - Rosada is a very serious sin, but in the eyes of some people, this may still be a medal, but few people are willing to hang a name with a dear Deal with people on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——An芮? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Or Demon, the Lich said, but what is the difference between the two? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain has never been cut off, but the flame in the brazier is unaffected, and the execution officer and his deputy take turns to lift the handles of the two polished irons. Put the uneven bottom on the right side of the prisoner. When they burn the skin, they make a loud noise, smoke, and the bearers scream hysterically. Some of the weaker ones will faint in the past. The assistants who were temporarily recruited were dragged aside, and another mage, who was also recruited by Demon, dumped a translucent syrup on the burnt wounds. The syrup exudes a clear and clear acidity, which is branded. At that moment, they let them condense and swell, and in a short time they shrink and fall deeply into the skin. The tearing pain caused by the awake person faints and makes the faint person wake up. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale was put in the end, it’s hard to say whether it’s another difficult and intangible torture, when he saw the former director who he regarded as the father The priest calmly raised his face and let the iron that brought humiliation and pain hit him on his cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is the reason, when he was dragged to the front of the executioner, his heart got a bit of calm, the soldering iron fell on his face, he smelled The smell of scorching the flesh, strangely associated with his father's favorite roast suckling pig - if the cook baked the pig out of this smell, it would be a whip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t faint in the past, and after being dragged aside, it’s not someone else who poured him a magical potion. It’s his brother Demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good luck," Demon said. "My brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen reflects her greatest kindness in those who are exiled, she gives them a day of training, and allows them to bring them Bring something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosada’s pastors (once) have nothing, all their things are placed in the sanctuary’s own room, as a blasphemy As soon as they step into the sanctuary of Rosada, they will be burned by the light golden light, and they will not be able to live. They can't even get a piece of clothing to cover their body. The original robes worn on the body are already The guards who were jailed were thrown into the stove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar took off his black cloak and draped it over the old chief pastor, blocking him from the cold rain and the colder human eyes. The chief pastor habitually wanted to make a gesture of blessing, but was interrupted by a sharp pain that was not inferior to the iron of the talented person. He closed his eyes and prevented the pain and disappointment in his eyes from being exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry had given his cloak to another priest who seemed to have broken the ribs. He looked around with a slight sigh, and the crowd had dispersed. The night is coming, the clouds that bring rain cover the residual light, and the streets connecting the squares are dark, and only the lights of two or three pubs are still on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kerry wanted to try to go to the pub to see if he could buy a few sheets, an abrupt and cursing curse suddenly broke them. Calm, Kreima and Kerry turned to look at the past, an obese woman was throwing a large robes from the door - before she slammed the robes on the ground, she slammed the door hard. The sound of the door flapping on the door frame is like a ground that can shake the entire square. The door is still swearing that a stupid maid ruined her favorite robes, so that she had to throw it away because it It’s a bad smell of garbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar looked at Kerry and walked over to pick up the robes, which was not as bad as its owner said. It is double-layered thick cotton, white, 70% new, very clean, only the chest is poured with a large piece of freshly-applied curry sauce, and the sauce is stained with a few small potato chips, they are still hot of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man hurriedly ran from the end of the square, he had a parcel on his head, and there was one under his arm, let’s run over the naked body. The pastor, when passing the last pastor, the package that he had caught suddenly fell, and the priest who had just burned his cheeks couldn’t make a sound. When Kerry found this, the guy had already run. There is no trace of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
