The soul of the outside world asked with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Nothing, the Lich said, but I don’t want to see Gredi for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that he has done it once, the soul of the outside world has guessed his thoughts at once - but I don't want to! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- At this time I also hope to have a third choice, but unfortunately, the Lich regrets that he once thought that it would take a thousand years. Just as Gregory is on the front, at that time he may have been a half-god lich (although he hopes to swear), and may have died forever for various reasons. Anyway, he did not think about it so quickly. Reunited with this greedy red dragon - in Doring, he has learned from the illusion that Greed is still deeply rooted in the depths of his soul, fear and awe can still control him if he is facing When Greedy showed weakness or escaped, it was obvious that he could no longer get rid of the net from Grenada. At the same time, he believed that the "mother" would use him without hesitation. From the body to the soul - he remembers that Gree had a set of gorgeous and sturdy scales, all of which were from her dead child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——But I am an outsider, the soul of the opposite world said that they will find out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I will prepare an answer for you in advance, at least for a while. In addition, the lich is not polite to say, I want to know what caused your illusion - let you think that they and I will be a close family, do you think that I am you, and they are a group of water? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If they are really a group of white faces, then I am very willing to accept this commission... The soul of the outside world muttered, but it also knows this It is imperative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the black-haired caster stepped on the cloister, all the attendants bent down deeply, bowed to him, and the two female servants With dark hair, but under the bright fluorite light, you can see that the hair tips are like the smeared meteorites, showing their gray blood, their blood is not pure, from the yellow eyes, too thick hair and On the face of too sharp edges, in addition to humans, there may be mixed demons. But since they can stand before all the attendants, it shows that this chaotic lineage is not a disadvantage but an advantage for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is that in the extreme lack of ethical Grenada, a variety of mixed blood, although common, is not flattering. But for the current Cremari, these two attendants are just right, strong, but awkward, and since they used to be new kings or Mitt's attendants, they show that they are not too stupid, at least the lich and The soul of the alien world no longer has to face a group of self-righteous idiots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world moves around, and the lich will show him some places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This is where I used to "death", the Lich said, it should have left a black-eyed human mark, after being burned by the flames, the body The grease will seep out and be absorbed by the cracks in the stone, but they change the slate here, the whole corridor, but if you look closely, you will find that the color of the ground and the steps are not very similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Is it Kelmen and Kelsey? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s them, the Lich says, and they are only them. I sincerely say, I don’t hate them very much. To be exact, I still like them. I see that they have identity and strength, but they are lacking in thinking about problems, but this is a common problem for warlocks and pastors. They are blindly believing in less reliable things than themselves... When it comes to this, you have to be careful about Austal. He has failed several times in us. These failures will make him more cautious, if he Killing us, then he will be sure that our soul has been destroyed, instead of eager to dance on the bones like Kelmen and Kelsey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He will? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-In Grenada, anyone will be the cause of your death at any time. The lich said carelessly, sometimes I was very surprised how I could stick to that time, maybe because I felt so dead, it was too funny. Oh, hey, there was a nest there. The squirrels, but then I first emptied the stored nuts, and later I ate their cubs, so they moved away one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- At that time my food was provided by the attendant, the Lich said, but then... I was just hatched - no one cares if I am still alive, at least it seems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few years, he still got some care, but he always looks like that, his body is blue, his hands and feet are small, even the crying is like that. It is weak, if it is a normal dragon, then he should have been able to raise a one-handed sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t remember when the new king never set foot here again, and soon his food supply became intermittent, he might This was tortured to death, but the blood belonging to the dragon made him struggle to climb out of the room - he thought he had forgotten, no, obviously, he remembers, it was a night, there was a rare rain, he Looking up, hungering and hunching the rain, the rain in Grenada is also hot, and you will feel it burning in the throat, like a charcoal fire, but it gives him the last chance to survive, rain Let the ground become soft, and there are bugs crawling out from inside...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to know nothing, from his identity to status, but these can all be painful Learning with humiliation, although this learning process is too long and too hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich closes his eyes, and the wonderful thing is that those bad memories are not very clear, as he described to the thief, he still remembers clearly The green leaves of the leaves and branches, the sweetness of the berries, the freshness of the rats, the snakes and the birds...may be so impressed because of the scarcity, he thought, showing far better than Kelmen and Kelsey. After the talent, he never tasted the taste of hunger again. Every food that was sent to the front was so delicate and delicious, and the weight was so abundant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There is a bunch of berries, the lich said, and then he found that the berry is still growing vigorously, it is also an old friend It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world curiously took one into the mouth and then conquered by the sweet taste - this is delicious. He said with great enthusiasm that he had the meaning of taking them all away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- That is the belladonna, the Lich said, if it is just a mortal, ten can be fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Well... I said that the soul of the opposite world said that we should be able to ask for a big meal now, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the anti-theft section, which will be replaced at 9:30 tomorrow morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What do you want to do? The soul of the outside world asked with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Nothing, the Lich said, but I don’t want to see Gredi for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that he has done it once, the soul of the outside world has guessed his thoughts at once - but I don't want to! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- At this time I also hope to have a third choice, but unfortunately, the Lich regrets that he once thought that it would take a thousand years.
