			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster made up of the Lich's Soul Shard and the Locust took out a spell book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the alien soul almost blurted out, this scene is too abrupt, but it quickly thought that the lich had called this monster a locust mage, since it is a mage Then it can cast spells, which is nothing to be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who used to calculate the time, the locust mage who used the shard of the sorcerer’s soul as the source of condensation is hard to deal with, because its body is not Shaped and able to be reborn many times - there must be many fresh corpses here, locusts and worms pile up like mountains, it can be said that there is no fear of most physical strikes; and it can also cast spells, some of which are extremely strange and disgusting, and not Limited by spell gestures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before the Lich completes the next spell, his enemies suddenly "stand up" and rise above the level of Cremari, which is condescending," Look at the half-human of this black hair, constantly twisting and hovering around, looking for signs of weakness and fear - the numerous locusts that stick to its body are arched, and they are forcibly controlled to gather and entangle. The countless aphids are crushed out of the juice and internal organs, and the yellow and green pus are squeezed out of the gaps left by the grayish white body. To make the souls of the opposite world, there is no more than this. A more disgusting sight. But the fact quickly denied this wrong judgment, and the worm suddenly collapsed and collapsed, revealing a face that could be called a nightmare even in the endless abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world cannot find the appropriate words in his incomplete memory to describe the face. This face is not entirely composed of locusts. - If so, it has not seen this protein-rich bug, it is not too horrified, the problem is that it still retains part of the structure of the face, that is, from the lower part of the nose and nose At first, although it rots but still sees the shape and color, the mutated purple-black tongue sticks out from the jagged teeth. If you can concentrate, you can see the tongue root that swells like a ball. There are only two muscles on the cheeks to pull the tibia. The remaining skin is like a cracked moss on a clay wall. There are several black caves - white in a semi-circular skull. The swaying group is not the brain, but the locusts, which climb each other and fall from the black holes from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an attacking mage that is unique to the locust mage, if it faces a person who has no knowledge of how it behaves. Even if it is a mage, such an attack will cause him/her to be intimidated in the literal sense. Unfortunately, it is faced with a kind of thorough research on most evil creatures, so its dagger can only say There is no egg, because the lich has lowered his head at the moment he saw the locusts scattered and completed his own spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a simple spell, the drops of water falling from the sky spilled into the room, it infiltrated into the gaps of the locusts, and then white smoke emerged from those gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world does not know if the locust mage will feel pain, but it is certain that this horrible monster has fallen into anger. Although it couldn't scream, it immediately cast a flame that made the walls shock. The flame was lead-gray, and it fell to the wall, where the flying and crawling bugs solidified immediately and then turned into The pale white powder fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich, who has already moved the position, continues to cast a second spell, as the blue-and-white current of the snake group drills along the trail left by the water. The inside of the locust mage, and it violently bursts inside, the locusts are spectacularly exploding around, and wherever they fall, Ziz silently reveals one or more focal black holes - stripped The locust mage of the coat became thin. Almost able to see the outline of a humanoid, it stretched out his fingers and pointed to the lich, and a light like blood condensed hit the corner of his white robe. After a short period of light, the little corner became dim, but he was unscathed except this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich repeated the previous spell once, and the mist covered the locust mage, which huddled body violently, and the tentacles that entangled the mites curled. I couldn't help the souls of the outside world to think of the shackles that were poured into the boiling water; this attack made it lose its combat ** - after a disguised, better than no touch attack, the locust mage will have his own body Shrinking into the baby's arm thickness, rushing to escape from an unnoticeable aperture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it used to put the hand on the wall, turned the stone in that place into sediment, and removed the spell in the next moment, re-condensing The rock crushed the body of the locust mage into an unrecognizable and reconstituted piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A transparent black shadow slowly emerged from the blue-gray rock, and it opened its mouth, as if to read the last spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich's spell ends its last struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——End, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What did you add to the water? The soul of the alien world asks, our blood? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Yes, the Lich says that pure positive energy is a powerful poison for this kind of monster that is condensed by negative energy, but it is best not to use it in front of others if you don't want to kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished this and quickly entered the state of disorientation before casting, but this time he only cast a harmless spell, one with only the palm of his hand. The big black leather bag is tied with the ordinary leather rope, and the lich carries it out of the room. This room is also connected to two large rooms. Although it has been corroded and messy, it can still be seen. Originally how luxurious and horrible - especially the bookshelf covering three walls, their brackets are human hand bones, the brackets are giant flat ribs, with a secret silver depicting a spell, when it feels like someone is approaching The pale phalanx will stick out and frantically scratch, but the books above have been burned, and the boxes, lockers, and wands and wands in the room are empty. It seems that the white robes are not like The lich is malicious and useless and stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich stood in the middle of the room, holding down the spell book that was taken from the locust mage, remembering the spells inside, singing the spells repeatedly, some like a night cry The voice of a woman or a woman screams continuously, and some incomplete statues and spiders, scorpions, and ground worms crawl out to interfere with his experiments, but the undead are always patient, even if they are not dead. The same is true, even if he has to skip some spells that must be cast, but he managed to try out the secret words of the unlucky lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new dark passage leads to the Lich's lab. It was also a mess, but the white robe was not burned here, perhaps because the Lich had established a relationship with the spells here, they just chose to take away a few instruments. Many things are still here. The lich walked around and kept seeing the souls of the outside world completely out of the bag. Some were just metal fragments, some looked like a piece of leather, and some were alive. They are kept in transparent crystal scorpions or bottles, they are camouflaged, and they are hidden in very hidden places. I really don't know how the lich is discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to tell the truth, the souls of the outside world don’t think that there will be anything that can make a country instantly overturn, a plane is turbulent, and even Destroy and create a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich closed the room when he left, and there were a few twists and turns, dark and gloomy roads outside the room. The undead who used to make the surroundings slightly brighter, picking up a powder. Sprinkle it on the ground and see if there is a slight wind passing through it. The powder changes are minimal, but for him, he is going along one of the ramps, which connects several rooms that were used as prisons. When he reached the last one, a solid iron casting door blocked his way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former undead made a gesture to make the door transparent, and he stood behind the door. Going out, or talking down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one narrow stone behind the door that only allows the next person to stand alone, and the top, left and right and below of the stone are cold and terrible voids. Connected is a vertical tapered cave. If you want to come to the test scum or the captives that are no longer needed, they will be sent here and pushed down directly, saving both the tomb and keeping the underground palace clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the cave should be dark and stagnate, but now it is not like this, it is burning around the torch, the light of the flame is as yin as the locust mage throws Cold and flickering. There is no bone in the ground of the cave. There is only one huge array of weapons. If there is a human mage walking along the edge of the circle, he may need to walk a full half (half an hour), and the circle is densely covered. The cumbersome and complex crimson lines, the junctions are inlaid with gems with strength, and the mysterious spells are depicted in the line of fine gold secret silver powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central of the array is a monster - it has a body that is similar to humans but is more than three times larger, with chest and back covered with scales, long Like the dragon's tail, its face can even be said to be beautiful, but the golden eyes burned with evil flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those babies who plunder humans and animals attacked adults, bringing fearful white bats to the calm and peaceful villages hanging quietly at the top of the cave Covers the entire top of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What is that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The hybrid of the dragon and the devil, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is preparing to revoke the spell, but the soul of the outside world suddenly screams, and the lich is glad that the voice of the sea cannot be transmitted to reality. Look for something that makes it panic - he saw Kerry Ben, Baldwin, Gülen and Plum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf-led team is also starting from the swamp, after all, they are looking for Without any valuable clues, even Kerry’s cockroach almost fell into the poisonous smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kerry is an elf, even the plants in the swamp are his most powerful companions. With their help and traction, they also found the swamp. At the end, it was just the other one that the illegal teacher Crimmar found. They might have passed the mage outside the few martyrdoms and went in the other direction, during which they encountered a lot of tricky monsters. But there are no enemies as difficult as the locust mage. Although Gülen and Plum are still injured, Kerry has given them therapeutic potions, and he and Baldwin, he knows how to use therapeutic potions frequently. The problem is that the body is harmful, the problem is that they have no choice of opportunities and waiting time. As the degree of bat attack increases, the fear of humans in the village almost reaches the apex, indicating that the sacred field is already a mature fruit, ready to be picked at any time, and once it is launched, all life in the sac will be the same. Time flies, from human to elf, no one is spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
