			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan and Plum are not able to leisurely for a long time, a low and rough, not so much a house as a muddy shelter, there is a painful Lamenting, it was a charcoal house. Because of the need to burn charcoal, he and his three children lived farther away from the villagers but closer to the woods. The pastor of Ilmot also reminded him of this. He also promised to move to the cellar of the church tonight to live. No one thought that the attack of the bat would come so fast, so much, they opened. On the top of the mud shed, one climbed into the ground, and the charcoal worker just left. His eldest daughter escaped with a covered scar. The little daughter who just learned to walk was ridiculed by a bat like a voles. Going, I don’t know where to go, and they are still the sons of young children. Like the old cow, they are covered with bats. They spread their wings and overlap, and they cover the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charcoal worker held the torch and his axe to kill and drive away the bat, but his son was dead, his chest was open and the ribs were bent After being poked out of the body, the body collapsed and collapsed, and the hole was densely covered, showing a dead grayish white—his father could not faithfully drop the torch and reach out to touch his son's bitten face, and then found his The abdomen is still faintly undulating - the charcoal tells himself that this is impossible, perhaps because his eyes have been poisoned by smoke for too long, and it is no longer possible to correctly identify the sight... his son was eaten most of the time. The lungs and the heart are absolutely impossible to live, but a glimmer of hope still makes him eager to move his hand to the boy's bulging abdomen - it moves again, and the charcoal worker has not yet responded. At that time, a pair of sharp little teeth were deeply embedded in his palm. He fell backwards and screamed at the thief and plum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A greedy bat got into the boy’s body and thrilled in it, touching the charcoal’s fingers across the belly At the time, it felt the threat, so without hesitation, he tore the victim's stomach and bit the palm of his hand that disturbed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan's fine gold dagger accurately cuts off the half of the little monster's head. The charcoal worker made a more painful scream, and its teeth pierced deeper--the thieves walked in this small, dimly and lightly, so short that even the petite plum must go down in the mud shed. After a lap, make sure no bats are left behind. The torch was reignited, and the scorching flame added a bit of warmth to the hut, making it safer, and even the turbid air became less ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He... is it still alive?" Mei said with uneasiness: "I have no treatment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He only needs a little elder wood ash." Thieves Said: "If not, then the grass can also be." He knelt down and looked at the palm that was infiltrated into black by charcoal. The half of the bat was still attached to it, and the remaining eye was full of pride. - Don't ask the thief how to see it. The things in the skull are streamlined. It is convenient for the thieves to look at the structure carefully. He erects a fine gold dagger, which is more than three times heavier than the average dagger and more than three in length. One of the points, the weapon that is closer to a dagger than the dagger is light in his hand like a feather. He put the charcoal's arm on his knee and pressed it with his left arm. It took only three times to cut off the part except the teeth - those teeth are now white-exposed and the length of the canine Almost the same as Mei Mi's little finger, curved, and the other teeth, that is, the incisors, are triangular, with serrations, piercing the flesh like a barbed arrow. It is difficult to pull out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German hand-baked his dagger on the torch, and when the dagger with heat hits the skin of the charcoal worker, his palm instinctively shrinks But the power of the thief far exceeds him. He clamped it tightly, the dagger pierced the palm of his hand, cut the wound, and picked out the sharp teeth with flesh and blood. It was very painful, and the charcoal fainted when he was halfway through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief stood up. Commanding Mei Mei to give the sad man a little ash, he held all his teeth in his hand, walked to a pottery basin with water, washed them, and appreciated it for a while in the swaying light of the torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not the tooth of the fruit bat." Kerry Ben said that he also heard the sorrow, but he was being rescued by a group of bats. A pair of lovers lived, they secretly came out to private parties, so they failed to escape to the sturdy house in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the shape of the fruit bat?" Gülen asked, he was not interested in what the bat's teeth looked like, but he knew to please others. The most important point is to talk more about what he is good at and like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's thin and long, not so hard." Ranger said, picking up a tooth from the thief's open hand and marking it on the edge of the pottery basin. Plan, it immediately left a clear mark on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" Gülen said: "I learned some interesting things from the priest of Ilmot."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have speculated," Kerry said. "I suspect that it was set as a sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The festival is a popular saying, when a red robe, a dragon, or a priest of an evil god wants to achieve what purpose, need When a large number of people sacrifice, they will define an area with magic. All humans and humans in this area (a settlement, a village or a town, or even a city) will be regarded as a sacrifice. In order to ensure that there are no accidents, they will drive their slaves, goblins, little devils, etc., or contaminated animals and plants, or release a small lock, lest the insiders find that they are not right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, even this small village is so poor that even a few silver coins are inconsistent, but since their pastor is a follower of Ilmot, I The priests of Almaty never looked at the truth, and there was no need for any compensation. As long as they could expel evil, they would be satisfied with their enthusiasm, and the white robes and knights of other good gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pastor has concealed this from us." Gülen suppressed his own displeasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranger sighed: "Maybe he just wants to get a boost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Put us together into the vortex of death?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We are very likely to be at this festival from the beginning.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may not be," the thief raised his voice: "He can ask us to help out to the outside world, but he doesn't, he deliberately tricks us into the village, so we have to fight for it." Life - for your own life - the Ilmot who was cursed 10,000 times! He does not believe us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glan!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, saint," said Gülen, "just you - this is the end of the matter," he looked out in dismay, and the sky had become dark. “What else can we do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of casualties exceeds twenty. Coupled with the fact that the previous injury has not yet healed, this small village with only about 300 people is not a small trauma - especially the people who have suffered casualties include a lot of strong adults, they are concentrated. Transferred to the sanctuary in Ilmot, the only one in the village that is entirely made of stone brick, while others are busy blocking the windows with mud and stones to reinforce the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baldwin, Kerry Ben, Cremari and Gülen, and Plum were also gathered in a room, the room that was originally scheduled to be built by Birdwin. The thief leaned against the window and tapped the glass. It was not a good glass, the color was green, but it was very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irmot’s pastor stood in the middle of the room, like a criminal who was about to be tried. His performance was also the same. He was so apologetic. So uneasy, and at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, you don't have to say it." Birdwin broke the silence in the house: "I also..." He wanted to say that he also had His own people and warriors, the death of every life is a deep trace of the death god in his heart. He knows more about the pastor than any other person present, but he also thought of himself. No longer the owner of Thunder Castle, he has lost the qualifications and ability to own them. "There was a time when you had to make a decision..." He said concealingly: "For you, this is understandable, you Not for yourself, but for these villagers - your behavior is worthy of praise, you don't have to be ashamed of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if he is ashamed to commit suicide How can it be?” Gülen whispered dismissively: “He has dragged us into this trap.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey bit his lip. As a pastor of Fro, as herself, she agrees with the thief's opinion, but as a woman who has a soft spot for this gray-haired warrior. She immediately betrayed Gülen and herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think," the priest said stiffly: "I still have to say, I am sorry - I can't trust you - before you arrive, There was also a small caravan that passed through, and among them there were also hired adventurers who left immediately after getting my warning. I shouted and begged them to bring me help, but... they didn’t come back. There is no trace of any indication that the outside world has discovered our situation here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you wisely chose silence when we arrived." Say: "You are a stupid and despicable guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admit it," said the priest. "But I am standing here and not wanting to get you." Forgive us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still want our help," Gülen stroked his dagger: "So you don't have to bother, we are now I have to do that - but how do you think we will not retaliate?" The scarlet tongue tipped the air: "Even if we have an elf among them, please believe that even if I am alone, I can kill you all."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can get a reward." The priest said: "I know a secret, associated with a treasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief finally turned his attention to him:" I have heard this sentence in everybody who is about to die..." he muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And almost every man has said this to me." Mei Mi sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't believe it." The priest of Ilmot said: "But do you remember the bat cave I said?" Then he I saw a look of awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" IMHO," said the thief. "You seem to have only said it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The priest thought for a moment and embarrassedly licked his finger: "Oh... yes," he repeated the same thing he said to the thief: "In fact, it is not a natural cave, but a The house where the lich was once - it is said that his castle was standing on the woods. He was the local lord. Later his people knew his true identity. They feared that they burned his castle. They Thought he had already left, but no, he built a vast underground palace under the castle, like the dwarf, where he studied spells, experimented, and accumulated his own power - a team of adventurers The secret was occasionally found in the ruins of the castle, and they were killed by the lich, but before that, the caster in the team sent a message to his mentor, and then, as the singers sang, the gods The followers came here, they not only killed the lich Destroyed his life--in the last moments of existence in this world, the evil undead claimed that he had a book that would make a country instantly overturn, a plane for turmoil, and even destroy and create a god. The spell book, if those white robes are willing to surrender their fate, he is willing to give this spell book to the temple or sanctuary where the god of one of them believes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poorly provocative," Kerry commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guys won't believe that?" The thief asked with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said the priest of Ilmot. "But just as they destroyed their lives, an unprecedented and terrible force swept the entire palace." Everything was destroyed - only one of them barely survived... He was the most devout follower of Ilmot, who lost his eyes in the catastrophe, unknown The curse ruined his throat, and even with the care of Ilmot, he could only slowly get a identifiable light in the years that followed, but he still left a record of the matter." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
