			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill and other elves who chased the gray robe returned very promptly. Just as the sprites of the elves and half-elves were busy saving the entire gray ridge, the snakes popped their heads from the Starlight River. They arrived a little earlier than Demon expected, and the manager's animal companion screamed sharply. Remind him that there is an enemy attack - but this did not give the manager and his people too much preparation time, they are less than twenty, the number of weapons is not as good as the number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two giants jumped off the suspended platform and pushed the platform to the river. They were heavy and huge, and the slow-moving Starlight River could not lift their legs. The residents of the Grey Ridge shot only a few arrows. The Orcs and the Ogres tumbling from the platform and falling into the shallow water. The stinky blood polluted the clear river, and no arrow fell, but after the loss The enemy is still three times more than them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves and half-elves can retreat into the maple forest, relying on the complex terrain and the help of the plants to fight the enemy, but now, they can’t throw it down. Concentrated on the masters who control the double flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main force of the attack is the ogre, the half-ogre and the half-orcs, who roared over the slippery riverbank, waving an axe, flail, hammer and With a spiked stick, one half-elf was broken in the initial encounter and the other was cut in half, while others were almost besieged by two, three and more enemies; Half-orcs and ogres with crossbows and bows climbed the cracked maples to shorten their distance from the caster to make up for their poor skills and slow movements - an apprentice was unfortunately shot. Legs, he fell and looked into the golden red flame, but he used a trick smartly and calmly, moving his body out of the fire, but that doesn’t mean he can Surviving, several ogres rushed up, and the screams that he shattered made the whole gray ridge sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feet of the giants banged on the ground, and they kicked the weak creatures that just broke into their vision and route, but they did not mourn for them. Staying with the blood - this behavior is not in line with their past habits - Demon's mage considers their small head that is completely out of proportion to the huge body, pre-cast a small spell, lest they over-indulge in killing I have forgotten the real, better compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide starlight river passes through the entire silver-crowned jungle, the delicate pinnate leaves of the silver-crowned tree and the withered branches fall into the river, those nutritious Some will be eaten by worms, small aquatic creatures and fish in the river, leaving hard, inedible parts, which are precious metals that will be taken away by the river (which is why it will be It is called the cause of the Starlight River, but more will be deposited in the gentle flats and depressions, which is the source of the greatest wealth of the Grey Ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are not good at mining, they don't need it, and the Mithril brought by Starlight River is enough for them to trade everything they need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giants cut down the cracked maple trees, or pulled them up directly, like the human search for the nest, greedily destroying the search for elves and half-elves. In the air, they are not so afraid of ordinary flames. Their skin is thicker than elephants or rhinos. It is covered with wrinkles and covered with thick dirt and dust. Demon’s mentor gave it again. They have a bottle of oil that resists the burning of negative energy flames. They are applied to every part of the body immediately after landing, and the transparent flames are retracted a few inches from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have found so many good things - whether they are elves or one-half, they have no concept of anti-theft, all the precious things are directly Put it on the outside, at most, there is a lock box and cabinet. In addition to the secret silver sand in the bag, they also found a long sword, a short sword and a scorpion, a bow and arrow, a gemstone ornament, and a secret silver cast with Mithril and fine gold. Chain armor, a silk shirt that looks so tough and light (not burned by fire!), and a variety of delicate small bottles filled with powder and liquid, they don't know what it is, but also put it in In my own leather bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A giant found a small dot of the chart, more than two hundred, surrounded by sapphires and Mithril, equipped with thirty-two directions The rose compass was decorated with four colors of tourmaline. He made a stroke and thought it would be a good place to serve as a plate, but he couldn't wait for him to put this in his leather bag, an invisible arrow. It crushed it and cut his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant screamed, threw the astrolabe and pulled out his axe, which was enough to cover the entire chest of an elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mage gestured to his exhausted companion, replacing his position, the latter gratefully smiled, the god of life testified, the spells in his memory have Few, the flight is about to expire, he safely hid in a hidden and safe place, holding the next spell in his hand and observing the situation on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole situation has been reversed after returning to Ilva. This is a peculiar team. The manager of Gray Ridge thinks when he cuts off the neck of a half-orc. He can't see the caster, or even find a human being. Usually, the team that dares to attack the gray ridge will not It's purely non-human, because their brains are always not so good enough, and it's easy to fall into hopeless chaos - so that the elves can find every chance to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their number is so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless that person has already thought of it, only living will return to ask him for remuneration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager of Gray Ridge took a heavy breath, and the hot air mixed with smoke made him cough up, almost never escaped an ogre The stinging stick, his animal companion, a strong sparrow hawk fell on the ogre's face, his claws deeply embedded in his nose and eye sockets, when the ogre wanted to grab it, The elf's long sword pierced his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich’s flight was also ineffective. He supported the cracked maple tree slowly and vigilantly. His position was also returned by a gray ridge. Master replaced, the disguised gray robe did not use the spell to counterattack, of course, have you seen a deformed mage? So the spells they remember are almost always there, and they are all dangerous offensive spells. After all, they think they are going to deal with a sinister and powerful gray robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With new power to join, the fire zone that the Lich wants is quickly opened up, as he said before, lightning and corrosion The spell can also play an unimaginable role, the trees are burning, and the part below the tree is picked up more than ten feet. In the deepest place, you can still see the blue and white phosphorus fire, but they are very weak, after all, insects The vitality that can be provided is really too little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of negative energy surrounded by real flames screams like a ferocious cub that is trapped – it hasn’t grown up yet And will not grow up anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brightness of the flame and the huge amount of heat are amazing. No one notices that the dawn is over, and the morning is about to re-illuminate and warm this place - the exception of the Lich. As a caster, especially after encountering such misfortune (the soul of the alien world: hello!), he is already sensitive to time to a point where he can be pointed out - in fact, sometimes he even hangs than that magic The fall is more accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has two spells, the lich puts his hands in his sleeves, considering whether to leave them or use them - the battles around him have been reported In one paragraph, after about a hundred and twenty, he will return to the sea, and this body will be dominated and dominated by another soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead can be said to be comfortably holding his arms, he noticed that Ilva is fighting a giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant used a rare double-headed hammer and screamed a common language such as "knock! slay! kill!" while chasing the shadow of the female elf with his hammer - looks a lot like It’s a “hound”, a game that the alien soul has played on a computer, but it’s much more cruel and bloody than it’s. The strength of the two sides is not balanced. "", she is very difficult to cause any real harm to the giant, her sharp sword has a lot of bloody mouth on the giant, there are also on the arm, there are also on the legs, there are also on the body, but these wounds can not let the giant Even if the degree is slowed down, each of his taps is as heavy as the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a fifteen-foot-tall big guy, the lich is thinking, the spell he remembers is not a threat to this clumsy, stupid guy, but he might Remind Iir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Il妲 gasped, she was tired, sweat pickled her soft eyes, but the enemy in front of her made her dare not relax, she was on the spot Rolling, avoiding the hammer that the giant waved, the wind from the hammer scraped through her pointed ears, and the ear jerked forward, and the severe pain made her scream out incomparably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought that the giant would take this opportunity to step on or kick her, but until she stood up smoothly, the giant remained in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered his head and checked the leather bag in his waist. At this time, the leather bag was pulled again. It was very obvious that the giant yelled angrily. When he got up, he grabbed his leather bag with one hand and looked around, trying to find the little thief who tried to get his property and daring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ir smirked, she didn’t have to look for it and she knew who was making the poor big man, naughty Crimal, gave her a A wonderful idea - she adjusted her breathing and rushed to the giant again. Unlike the previous ones, she was confident this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not attack the giant's body, her long sword just gently passed over his waist, cutting off the connection between the leather bag and the giant belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bag fell to the ground, the giant screamed, and he bent over to squat - the movement was clumsy and heavy, while he grabbed the bag, Il The sly long sword pierced from his armpit position, and she pushed forward hard until the blade completely fell into the giant's body, and she was almost stunned by the giant's stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
