			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swear," the Norman king of Highlands stared at Byrdwin: "Swear, no, don't go to the Styx, nor to the graves of your parents, Don't swear to Tyre, or any god, the noble and great existence, I only ask you to swear by your heart, your soul, your love... Your words are true, no There is no pretense in falsehood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I swear...His Lord, I swear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony is extremely brief and simple. In the eyes of many people, it is hard to say that it is official, because no one has mentioned it in the whole ceremony. The name of a god, the rituals are only some mortals and casters, no paladins, no pastors, how can the vows of protectors and protectees be guarded by the unpredictable power of the underworld? Can mortal promises be purer than white snow, harder than steel, and more permanent than rock? Everyone knows that this is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the people present don’t care about this - the new lord of the Spirit, the young Marlene Lorenos, who has been beaten by his uncle After returning to the territory and the knighthood (received by a rude means unimaginable by ordinary people), his reverence and love for the daughter of the Norman Pharaoh in the Highlands can be said to have reached an unprecedented peak. Now he Even if Leona wants to enclose a smudged thief, he will unswervingly support, not to mention that person is Bywin. Although Mullen’s father did not like Baldwin very much, he was an honest man. He never deliberately obscured the merits of the thundering lords or deliberately defiled his character in front of his son, so Mullen and many Like young people, this man, who is humble in origin, has become a knight and even a sergeant man with a sense of courage and loyalty. He does not believe that Baldwin would be the one who killed the pharaoh. - Although his father left early, but Mullen was already ten years old, he was not the kind of innocent child who knew nothing about the darkness behind the light. He even listened to the stupid things that came from the king. Too lazy, everyone knows that after Baldwin is not a nobleman, at least not married. The polluted blood is not accepted by the kings. His only cuddling is the dead Pharaoh. Why should he destroy his only pillar? Look at the persecution he suffered after the death of Pharaoh. . The death of Pharaoh did not benefit him at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If before this, Princess Liona’s Highness has been established as the Crown Prince, and it may be possible for Birdwin to actually commit this horrible crime. - What was hidden in the pendant that the princess always cherished hanging on his chest is now no longer a secret in the kingdom - but not, or. To this day, the reason is even more unreliable. The woman of the Norman Vulcan in the Highlands simply stopped at a distance from the throne, then turned around without hesitation and left, striding away. The gold crown and the scepter with the sapphire and the stone in the top are no more worthy of her love than the mud toy she had pinched when she was a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is such a noble person. Although Baldwin is not a person who is not worth saving, Mullen still feels deep regret, if he is sitting on the black iron throne in Norman, Highland. It is not the weak and pale hypocrisy, but how good this young woman is full of vitality and strength, with kindness and determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea has been lingering in his heart, when he saw Leona wearing a luxurious suit, holding a sword, slowly moving from another room Entering here, looking up solemnly on the steps, sitting on a velvet high-backed chair, it was finally transformed into a stalking seed in the heart of Mullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For well-known reasons. The time taken for the oath was short, and after the oath was completed in Bedwin, someone needed help to wear his protector, the armor, weapons and short hair given by His Royal Highness Princess Liona. It’s not the knight but the knight’s embarrassment. The real knight will not be a wicked person who was expelled by Tyre and committed the sin of the monarch, but Birdwin does not feel sorry. Others have to admire Leona’s generosity—in general, in such rituals, the protector is to give the protector a valuable. But a gift with a symbolic meaning greater than the value of use, in many cases, it will only be one or two pieces in a full armor, like a helmet, a pair of spurs or a neck guard. But Leona's gift, even if it is directly used to dedicate to the god of morning light Rosada or the god of war Tampas is quite suitable - they have three kinds, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;A magical silver chain with a round neck, long sleeves, hem down to the knees, looks very slim, looks more suitable for Leona than her protected person - but from He lifted it over his head and placed it on Byrd's shoulder. It slipped from his shoulder to his knee like a silver water, and there was no sign of any distress and tightness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fine gold wide sword, thick and heavy, with a hematite ore in the head of the sword, and a sapphire inlaid on the cross-shaped guard. Gemstones are mostly used for weapons with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the short hair, most people didn’t recognize the texture at first because it was not soft, fine, and rough. Bumps, uneven corners, dark red similar to black, no embroidery on any pattern or coat of arms, and without cutting, it is not sewn, but four Mithril cards inlaid at both ends Buttoned together - looks more like an open cone, if you are a ranger or mercenary, then you are not unfamiliar to it - only the goblins hidden in the forest and swamp The object of the cover is probably this style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Baldwin squats again, the black-haired caster squints slightly, and the short scent makes him feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect it." Suddenly someone said softly beside him, Kreima turned his head in surprise and found that it was Dylan Don Clay. The candlelight and the last rays of light on his face as beautiful as a young woman, the shadows cast in the mess, distorted his expression, so that Crimmar could not see whether he was happy or angry. "That should be Zhang Longpi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not seem to care about the response of others, but continues to say to himself: "One continues There have been hundreds of years of rumors that the Norman royal family had received a dead young dragon from a powerful mage with half a treasury - or that people thought it was a rumor until today."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She really loves Baldwin, isn't she?" Dylan said, staring at Baldwin and Leona, who stood on the steps and stood on the steps. Below, the steps make up for the difference between them, they are four eyes, Li Aona's eyes are full of warmth in the spring water. And Byrdwin, he seems to be as firm and steady as usual, but Dylan guessed that he was full of fear, he knew he was cheating and stealing. But what he got was too good, no, not armor, weapon or dragon skin, but the trust and love of the king, this is something he never dared to blame - he is a civilian. Although he never thought he was low-lying, he knew that even a daughter of the count was unattainable to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t bother with this. He already has a strong and lovely wife. Penny’s blow to him is huge. He almost humiliated and died. But who can think of it, in a blink of an eye, he got the love of a woman who is the most noble of Norman in the Highlands. This love is not only pure, hehe. It is even hotter than the first morning light cast by Rosada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t refuse, who can refuse it? He even wants to take it firmly in his hand, and give it everything tightly Also do not hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Eye’s Don Kerley narrowed his eyes and hid a sly smile in the straightened lips. He knew that returning empty-handed might make him jealous. That is, the new king is dissatisfied, and his mother, Princess Ang Principal, will yell at the hype, hysterical, but as long as he can bring back Leona’s affidavit that is similar to giving up the succession to the throne. Then their complaints will not last for a long time. If you return to the 10,000 steps, if you continue to do so, he can still escape to Thunder. His mentor is dealing with the orcs - this winter orcs may not be too good, they need slaves, need food, need robes and blankets, the more the better, his businessmen have complained more than once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona raised the flame-shaped sword. Put the weapon over her shoulder over Baldwin's shoulder, cleverly flipping his wrist, tapping his left face with a cold blade, then his right face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin persevered with a symbolic insult to show his absolute obedience, then he raised a dagger and cut his little with a dagger The arm, let the blood flow on Leona's robes, indicating that he will shed his own blood for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was three identical swearing documents from Mullen’s uncle, and Leona first signed her name on it and then dripped her blood. Then, it was the protected person, Bywin, who had two witnesses. One was Dylan Don Cray, who replaced the old lord of the lord, and the other was the new lord of the multi-spirit, Mullen. According to the convention, there should be one. The priest or the paladin was signed as the third certifier, but Birdwin is now in a special status, so this instrument can only leave a helpless blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey holds her knees and sits on a wet slate floor, waiting quietly for the end of the ceremony - although she is only a priest of Fro, but is safe For the time being, she was not allowed to participate in this important ceremony - not as good as the thief Gülen, who was not only able to participate, but was officially invited as an important guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro’s followers groaned with their belts, and she suspected that the sudden princess Liona was stalking from her, she was deliberate, Even if she had beenhave like a saint-like tolerance before, but which woman can endure the admiration of her, there is a Fro priest, and she is so ugly! It’s not the distortion of the five senses, the ugliness of the dark skin, it should be said to be worse than that. I can’t help but laugh when I think of Mei Mi. I don’t know what it would be like to stand with Bedwin. Like a lover, it may be like a pair of brothers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closed door was opened at this time, Mei Mei looked up and walked in front of the princess who looked like a handsome boy, she brought A crown-shaped crown with a drop-shaped pearl hangs like a dark purple velvet robes, and a gold belt with amethyst. Her expression is gentle, her pace is calm, every move is so noble and elegant; Bird Tightly followed, his hand gripped a wide sword, a luxurious broad sword, and the sapphire inlaid on it was more pure than the one that Mei Mei had seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei wants to stand up, but she has been in an uncomfortable position for too long, her hands and feet are numb, she struggles to struggle When she stood up, her soles could still be uncontrollably painful. Today she deliberately wore a rose-colored silk robes that had grown over her feet (from a dusty room), she believed Her master won't wear it anymore, or it's not needed—the edge of the robe is adorned with delicate pearl tassels, and the shiny tassels will slap her slender white feet as they move around. To attract the attention of men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Mei Mi stepped on the edge of the robes. The smooth little tassels slammed her feet and neck like a mischievous child. She only slammed down with a short scream. On the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona immediately reached out, but faster than him and Birdwin was Mullen’s uncle, and she stepped forward and caught it. Pastor Froe's arm helped her stand up as quickly as possible - the pure gold bell hanging on the belt of plum honey rang as the big action rang, and Mullen's uncle bowed in confusion, waiting for her to see clearly. When she was a little girl, she immediately let go of Mei Mi and took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come there is a priest of Fro?" she asked, looking at her husband's nephew severely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be like this, she is a companion to Baldwin," Liona said softly. "Before she was taking care of Baldwin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a condemned sight immediately transferred to Birdwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a man, the most inevitable is to be associated with one or a few Froor, and Mullen’s uncle is not surprised, after all, she The husband is one of the best, but in her opinion, the man who is likely to enter into a marriage contract with His Royal Highness should converge slightly in this respect, at least not to let this filthy woman appear in front of the princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...that..." her little daughter said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The robes," one of Mullen’s cousins ​​hesitated Say: "It seems to be... sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I gave this lady," her sister responded quickly, she was more than a horse. Lun is still four years old and is a dignified beauty: "She had not worn her clothes before, so I took one from my suitcase and gave it to her."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona glanced at her gratefully, Plum was a companion to Byrdwin, and before she arrived, she looked after Birdwin, she was Grateful, in the same way, she did not want Baldwin’s companion to be looked down at random. She gently grasped the young girl’s hand, “Thank you.” She said, “I will give you a robe again. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
