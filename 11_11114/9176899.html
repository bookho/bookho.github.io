You said that you are friends with this human being?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Tiger’s face is blue and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also put up a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Western, I have heard that some of you in the West have quietly married people, but because there is no definite evidence, I have never called you. Asked. Now, in front of me--Dong Xuan Long Luo Xuan, North Xuanwu Kaohsiung, and the elders of the family, you have publicly declared that human beings are your friends?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;White Tiger bitterly and reluctantly looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this man is a human being, but my best friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people are in awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Western, do you know what you are talking about? You call our food friends, then why do you think of my people? Beasts, floods? The patriarch, your current words and deeds, can be confirmed as rebellious. As long as I make an order, I can hand you directly to the Suzaku execution in the South!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Since I came here today, I have already expected this result. I only hope that you can put that human!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"西家!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stubborn white tiger really irritated me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This human being is my food! West! If you ask me to share as my courtier, I can promise. But you want me to raise my hand easily. Let him go, it is impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Canglong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you think like that Save this human being, and come in the way of ghosts. West! Attack me, snatch my food from my wildfire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand proudly, burning From my own cyan fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stand up! West! Don't you think you are a member of the ghost family?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The tribe is boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white tiger of the Western family was shocked and greeted me with a sharp look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cang Long... Do you think that our Westerners are really a member of the ghost family?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is the West family not a member of the ghost family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reached out to stop the harassment of the tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the tribe truly treats our Western family as a companion, we will not marry humans.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But Canglong, the ability of our Western family is the same family. You know, if the ghosts in the family are married to the Westerners, the one with the same or weak ability will lose the ability of the ghost. For any ghost, It’s all more painful than death. So we are discriminated against by the tribes, which is also expected. But... I don’t want to and can’t watch the West’s extinction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canglong Luo Xuan, you are the head of a family. If one day, the ghosts are also facing extinction. At that time, you want to let the people continue to maintain authority and dignity and die, or endure With humiliation and indifference to survive?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer me, Canglong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said It is not without reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Tiger. I stared at the Western leader who I have not seen several times. Before I was an adult, the Western family had been excluded by the ghosts, and it was not forced to do so. No one would invite the Westerners to meet. Compared with Xuanwu Kaohsiung and Nanjia Suzaku, who are not separated from me, he is too strange to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light-colored hair with blue eyes and white wildfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He unnaturally regained his head and avoided my gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suddenly smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Western, that human being gives you back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Tiger and everyone around me are amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, as you said, the ghosts are unfair to your West, so then I will give you a chance."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Canglong!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I will give you a chance to fight for power, the white tiger of the West." Listen, at the beginning of the next full moon, there will be a one-on-one duel in the Holy Land. The final winner is my husband. How do you come to participate?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cang..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cang Long Luo Xuan! No..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders on the side of the panic stopped: "He is a Western family..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I screamed and said that there was no need to worry: "Do you think my ability will be lower than that of the Western family!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned to the white tiger of the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Western, would you like it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respectfully!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————————————————————————<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Luo Xuan, you are naughty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lie on the soft couch without any manner. For Kaohsiung's words, I only smiled with a smile: "Is it because I have found a strong opponent for the almost destined victory? But, Xuanwu, as the king of the ghost queen, should let all the people feel convinced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaohsiung reluctantly smiled and pulled up the fallen robes for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very calm, I think about it carefully, it seems that since I was very young, I have never seen this scene of Xuanwu’s emotional out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you care if I really fall in love with that white tiger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love It doesn't matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because your husband is in all ethnicities The strongest person confirmed before, this has nothing to do with whether you love it or not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I*............%<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so sure to be the strongest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is absolute. Luo Xuan, just like your existence There is no doubt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no slight ups and downs in the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, I still shouldn’t have any illusions about his reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is stubborn, sensible, and calm, but I love him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern Xuanwu Kaohsiung. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to see him struggle for my pain, covered in blood and mud, kneeling on the ground and kissing my feet for my love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how does he do this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only occasionally touches my lips gently, and even smiles are rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GAOXIONG<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; That person is fanatical, stubborn, and willful, but I love her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dongzhi Canglong Luo Xuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to struggle with her until she is covered in blood and mud, kneeling on the floor and kissing her feet to ask her to fall in love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can't do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only occasionally touched her lips gently and then left quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will retire first, Luo Xuan, please take a good rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No echo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quietly walked out of Luo Xuan’s bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t understand the purpose of Luo Xuan, I don’t want to do what she wants, but I am a priest of the basaltic, ghost family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canglong is the hope and glory of the ghost family, the only direction and leader. Xuanwu is the only ghost who can't be intoxicated by the dazzling light. He must be calm and neutral. Anytime, anywhere, remove even small obstacles for the dragon, stop her action before she gets involved, or block her body. before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can respect her, love her, worship her, but Kaohsiung, you must never love her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Father--The genius of the previous generation, the words at the end of the day are still in the ear, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love Luo Xuan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love her long hair with golden ripples, love her clear eyes, love her wild temperament, love her pink fingers, when they leave the ground Putting on the chest or neck of a human being, and turning the hot and violent gas into the food of the body, it looks like a slight ambiguity. It is blurred and dark, and that is the expression of Luo Xuan that I have seen so far. the most beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one noticed that when Luo Xuan publicly announced that the white tiger of the Western family had the qualification to compete for the husband, how did the fire of my heart instantly engulf my whole body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western! Rebellion among the ghosts, the kind of marriage with humans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how I control my black fire, not letting them pounce on the white tiger, surrounded him and sucked his anger, just in In front of the dragon and the tribe, he ate him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, really, really want to...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finger fingertips The black wildfire appeared around me, my body and heart, I was craving, eager for that sweet, full of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food, the blood that runs through the weak body, the sweet flesh and the crispy bone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly airflow drifts in the valley that has become a shadow, and I follow them to leap between the mountains and forests, stinging to the stupidity that is not yet aware of the imminent death. Humanity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guns! cannibal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the ghost family Xuanwu Kaohsiung! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hair and eyes are darker than the night, but the skin color is pale. I am a ghost priest, only the ghost king Luo Xuanzhi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of me belong to Luo Xuan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FEIZI<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Cannibalism! cannibal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the scorpion scorpion of the ghost family South! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a bloody red, pale gold skin, a pair of eyes like amber! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the most stern and ruthless of the ghosts, and I will kill everything that is harmful to the ghosts and the dragons! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only bend my knees to the dragon, obey her orders! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beijia, let go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stretched out a foot on the ground Humans, red fires blocked his coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Southern! You want to compete with me for food?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black night, Kaohsiung The eyes are radiant, the usual calmness and reason are lost in the tone, and the black ghosts in his hands are ready to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Southern!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Northern basaltic Kaohsiung, this human being is not your food. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lifted my foot and pulled up the human on the ground, and he immediately struggled tenaciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beijia, he is the prey that Canglong Luo Xuan promised to give up, belonging to the Western family white tiger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If that's the case, let the Western family come to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaohsiung's black wildfire does not retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is this human being so delicious? It’s so stubborn for the North, it seems that only the Canglong Luo Declaration is unbelievable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled and watched Kaohsiung clench his teeth and turned his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can this little child fight me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Luo Xuan, are much younger than me. When they were still asleep in the holy water, I took the hand of the ghost king and took them by hand. Every time I dreamt back at midnight, the tender touch of the skin still remains in my fingers. I am the last bloodline of the South, but I have lost the ability to bear. Perhaps it is an offense. In my heart, Kaohsiung and Luo Xuan are the children I can see but I can't get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark night, the ghost's eyes can see the most subtle changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at the young ghost priest and watched him slowly, slowly, and overwhelmed, and disappeared into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s awkward, hateful, very unwilling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that’s the case Fight as much as you can on the night of the full moon. As a suzaku of the ghost family, I will see the last with the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human being looked at me, maybe it was too strange for him to be eaten by the ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go south! There is my territory, the ghosts under my jurisdiction will not come to attack you again. If you have been walking for about a hundred miles, you can go back. The place of humanity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pointed out the direction to him. He still does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what?" he asked me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枥? what is that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Tiger..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that the West is in humans, even the name has . I smiled coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I talked to "food," I felt strange. This man is not very afraid of me, he stands and looks at me,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the feet still have a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since Ghost King has given a promise, he will not be attacked by the same kind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After getting my answer, the man showed a calm expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Tiger, are you friends with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity gave me an absolute answer: "He is my sister's fiancé."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hahahahahaha! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the human figure disappeared from my vision, I finally couldn’t bear to lean on a tree and laughed loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiancé? Human woman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not forgotten, just today, when Baihu first saw Canglong Luo Xuan, his look...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, maybe something interesting is going to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahahahahaha! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LI<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I saw Luo Xuan for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her, I have heard many rumors that ghosts and humans are telling her beauty and intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I didn’t think of it, she didn’t think that she was so beautiful...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her beauty, It is different from any human and ghost I have seen. That beauty is not limited to the eyebrows and the skin, although they excel in any natural or artificial ornaments; but what is even more irresistible is her natural indulgence and the cruelty of being hidden under the beautiful body. The nature of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canglong Luo Xuan, the person who saw her, in a flash, was captured of life and soul...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul no longer belongs to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants me to attack her and snatch her food; I want to hug her feet and kiss her skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she said her decision, it was even more ecstatic than the human being who returned me to have her through the power struggle. Opportunity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to get her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only obstacle that lie ahead of me is Xuanwu Kaohsiung! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like when I first saw Cang Long Luo Xuan, she knew that she was my lover. When I saw Kaohsiung, I knew he was me. The most hated enemy in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, Xuanwu Kaohsiung should feel this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, if it wasn’t for Luo Xuan and other ethnic groups, he would not hesitate to slam down, put his finger on my chest and eat me. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he will shoot faster than him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability that the West has is to eat ghosts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fingertips, white fires...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been waiting for the full moon time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the final battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, in the center of the Holy Land, only me and Kaohsiung are left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and I have worked hard, ragged, and described wandering. But in the situation, I am more advantageous than Kaohsiung, because the ghosts who tried before me have no exception, and they have become the best source of my anger. I really didn't think that my ability to be disgusted by the tribes would one day become a powerful weapon for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaohsiung also found this, he carefully chose the time of the attack, looking for my flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled slightly, I will not give him time to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xuanwu!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black WISPs are mixed with my white fires, one Touch it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of us quickly gave each other a ruthless blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaohsiung’s strength should not be underestimated. I gently touched my chest and the ribs seemed to be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the cockroach's lips have overflowed with blood, and the guilt has broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next hit, I want him to stand up, then put my hands on his throat and eat him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the dark has a slight sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet and angry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human? How can it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am innocent, he thinks, pounce on the source of anger, even if he kills this human, I will never give Kaohsiung a chance to get angry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"枥!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stretched my fingers to the human neck and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is he going to be here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black wildfire suddenly flowed between me and humans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
