"Why are you still holding her? I remember she has a son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is not yet a mature adult. If Anzhen is dead, Luzer is the right to be his guardian. I don't want to face the human being and his army." Ruiyite said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"McGee?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomish McGee turned back and shouted at him too A gnome is swaying and walking, all gnomes are like little children or enlarged dolls, and this is no exception. Every place has been carefully dressed, with rouge on the cheeks, trimmed eyebrows, dark brown hair boiled, and dark blue satin, matching the cobalt blue eyes, except The necklace on the neck and the ring on the finger, even the little boots under the foot are hung with gold chains on the edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If placed in the past, McGee would not pay attention to his people, but in the ceremonies of the East Crown main island, the gnomes unfortunately died nearly 100 people, right Their group of only a few thousand people is simply a big blow that can't be big, so he has now become more tolerant and at least willing to stop and listen to what the other party wants to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome raised a handkerchief that had smoked myrrh and agarwood, and tried to block it in front of his nose as much as possible. "You can't wash your body." "The little guy said the temperature and the ground blame: "With geothermal water, starch, and sesame oil, you will feel comfortable when you wash your body, and it will make you healthy."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mckey shakes his head, "Dwarf does not bathe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are a gnome." His people said helplessly: " You are a gnome, McGee, even if you put on a fake beard, a leather apron, do not take a bath, drinking ale every day will not become a dwarf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I want to be a dwarf." McGee said, reaching out and touching his 208th fake beard, the original fake beard was made of palm, neither as strong nor strong, now he The fake beards are all pulled out with copper wire, slender and curly, with a metallic luster for granted, and a flesh-colored hook on both sides. Hanging directly on the outer ear bones, special glue is used in the lower jaw. Only when the water exceeds the temperature of the human body can it be opened. Even if the hurricane is not able to blow it away, he has concentrated on coloring these days. The ointment, deep reddish brown, can be applied to the face and body to cover the original white skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is definitely not going to take a shower. Look, a gnome is not easy to stink like a dwarf, but he has accumulated for a long time to produce such a stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is good for the dwarf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gooder than gnomes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it because we took your father's drawings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's one of the reasons. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we all love you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love my drawings."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not willing to talk to us now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am talking to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go with those humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to hear their stories "McKee said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bard will also say, what do you want to hear, I am willing to pay you for one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no gnome in the story of the bard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no gnome to take risks."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I want to be a dwarf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"McKia..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to take risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin sees that McGee is coming with a gnome, he is trying to tell Leo Na asked her to prepare a snack, and the gorgeous gnome turned and walked away as soon as he saw him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do I hate gnomes so much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They worry that I will leak too much technology for you." McGee said, while climbing up the chair and sitting right up, Leona gave him a glass of ale, and he thanked the prince, and the little hand was tight. The ground presses the heart, which is to express his feelings inspired by the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not Kremar," Birdwin said with a smile: "I can't understand even if you put the drawings in front of me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mckey shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you can bring him with him," Leona said. "If he can listen to it, then he won’t worry that we will steal you. The drawings are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then they only suspect that we did a transaction that we should not have at other times." McGee said: "And that is not him, It’s her, she’s my fiancée.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin’s body is subtly stiff, these dwarfs are like dwarves in this respect, and dwarf women also have The beard, the body is also strong, round like a barrel, no curve, so it is difficult to distinguish them from the male dwarf, but the gnomes are because men also like to dress up, wearing gorgeous, fair-skinned, and never Without a long beard, it was difficult for Baldwin to pick the men among them from the female gnomes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When is Mr. Kremar returning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a while. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He should finish his work and leave," McGee complained. "It's really uncomfortable for your arm to be so placed." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin reveals a clear smile, and now he no longer feels anxious and anxious. He lost an arm and said that he can no longer Become a leader who can be trusted and respected. Before Krymar left, he came to his knight again and trained with them. He was defeated by his former subordinates and accidentally bumped into his own disability. Limbs, but these will never become a haze in his heart. Of course he is himself. The same is true of his knights and soldiers. No one despise and question him because he lost his arm. They call him Lord, complain to him that the dishes of Longhuo Island are too sweet, drink sugar cane with him, drink drunk, and spend the year with him. Women dancing in front of some people to get married come to ask permission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the people who came to Longhuo Island were strong men. There were only a thousand women, and some of them were already the mothers of these soldiers. The tragic deaths had already left them and replaced them with urgency. For the craving for new life, Birdwin can fully understand that in Thunderbolt, every time after the winter battle with the orcs, Thunderbolt will welcome a group of newborns. This may be the nature of human beings, prosperous and prosperous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do we still have to buy slaves?" Birdwin said with distress, he was happy to see his soldiers in good work and plenty of food. They gradually regain their health, their eyes become bright, their chests and backs become solid again, and their limbs are strong, but with the instinct they can't resist, they are all men of good age, no one can compare them. More eager for women's caress Some businessmen came to test Baldwin's wishes, although the way of temptation made the warrior feel embarrassed, because these businessmen also manage the port's 娼ji, and these 娼 ...... ...... ah, work It is too much heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember Dada said?" Liona said: "We can let them get rid of those who are being sent out and will be sent to do 'Niu Ma 'The female * slaves are handed over to us so that we can save at least their lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this female* slave," Birdwin dry Said: "They are almost impossible to give birth again." Not every female slave has the qualification to give birth to the lord, and the female slave lords will not sell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's ask those businessmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business people respond quickly, they There are indeed a number of female * slaves to be shot, not very beautiful, and older, but better than strong and good at farming, and as gentle as a lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you get these people?" asked Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary leader of the merchant reluctantly licked his own eyes. In general, it is an unwritten rule not to ask the slaves, but how can they come? What about it? Stolen, robbed, deceived, bought "a lord sold them to us," the merchant said with his hand, "not their lord, the enemy of their lord, you should know The two nobles fought and beat, and the knight who fell from the horse immediately died will be redeemed. Soldiers are also possible, but the serfs who were looted may not be male serfs as soldiers, their wives and Isn't the daughter left at home? They are like this, the kindness of your Highness, you may not be a good thing when you buy them. They are not beautiful, their temperament is not gentle enough, and they have never been a service person. Work, the fingers are thick like linen leaves, if they are sold to other people, they can only become 'bovine horses', and it is not a good thing to be a 'bull horse', like this, at most, it will last a few years. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Would you like it?” the woman of Norman in the Highlands whispered, “I mean, I need some young women to become the wife of the soldiers.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, those women are not beautiful, they can even be said to be black and thin, and the whole body is filled with unpleasant smells. They are crowded together and hold each other's hands to resist fear and hunger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona waited for a long time, and some of them spoke. This woman looks more white than other women, and her clothes are neat. With a headscarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods are on, good-hearted wife," she said in French, but the accent is heavy, like the highland Norman and Luzer bus The people in those places, "What else can we do? Our men are dead, we are also sold here by the nobles. My man is a groom, a respectable person, he has gone a lot. Place, I have heard of it from him. I know that we are all slaves. Even if we die, no one will come to converge on us. There will be no pastor to recite eulogy, and no one will be willing to We complain, what else can we expect? If you want a slave, buy us, be a soldier's wife, cultivate beets and sugar cane for you, but if you can, please buy us together. Well, we are very strong and we will work very hard. Don't let us separate. This is our only thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the Highlands Norman, or Luzer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are the Highlander The man is also a Luzer." The woman said slyly: "We are always taxed twice, once in Norman's Highlands, once in Luzer, and twice in servitude, once in Norman, Once Luzer, but when they were fighting, no one admitted that we were their people. When the soldiers of Norman Highlands came, they took our clothes and food. Luzer’s soldiers came, and so on. There was nothing left there, and they took us away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona was silent for a while, "How many people are there?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three hundred and forty." The businessman quickly and diligently said: "All are young and strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;?;&nbsp;Leona does not go to see the black sludge that is obviously smeared on the white hair, and the little girls who are trying to stand on their toes, those women who can stand alone stand their bodies Straight, hide them behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
