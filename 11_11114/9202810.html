			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony of the ceremony was only entered the next day, and the minister who was stunned by wild boar, fried fish, skylark pie and honey wine again Once gathered together, their new king sat on the throne, his face was impatient and eager to try, while lazy yawning, while covering his face with his fingers, looking at each familiar face below - Queen Mother Sitting on a chair beside him, dressed in a black robe, the veil hangs from her hairpin - although she is still mourning for her husband, her neck and wrists are heavy and gorgeous on her fingers. The jewels, which are in the shape of cheetahs and snakes, and even covered in veil, can clearly see that she used bright red rouge, which has never been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "King" certainly noticed this, but he did not have doubts, because he had already interpreted it as a woman's jealousy - he laughed in his heart Is his wife still thinking that he can win his favor with the loose and gray flesh? The brighter pearls are no match for the girl's eyes. The dazzling rubies are no match for the girls' lips. As for the juices extracted with roses and saffron, can it be comparable to the soft and beautiful colors brought by the vitality? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Begin," "The King," said, "Let my brother come in." When the Queen asked him to try to relieve the eldest son's vigilance, let him be unprepared. When I stepped into the trap, the "King" thought of this method with little effort. Is there anything that can make a person hesitate more than the title and glory? Especially when he heard that Laurie’s wife was pregnant (worsely, they were temporarily detained in the temple of Rosada, and now Rosada’s pastors seem to be full of guilt about the entire royal family. They may be able to save more things.) Even if Laurie doesn't care if he can get back to the title and become a descendant of Tara's ruler, he must at least consider his children, any one who has a sense of responsibility, loves children. The father will want his child to have a comfortable environment, unless he will feel that a thief's son is better than a duke's son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that his eldest son has some friends. If Laurie’s life has been for many years, or for several months, he may directly Detaining the other party or killing the matter, but since the queen has already said to him, as a sacrifice to make him perfect, Laurie can't see the morning light of the fourth day, then he is willing to kindly let his uncle's eldest son Feel the beauty of power, in the end, the short dying moment. He almost always began to expect the arrival of the day. When Laurie found himself falling into the abyss again, what kind of expression would he show? Is it confession, hatred, or despair? Especially when he discovered that the initiator was not his nominal mother, but the real biological father? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurry was introduced into the hall by two knights, and Laurie was bare-handed, with nothing but a gorgeous robe and nothing inside the clothes and boots. His own clothes, scrolls, wands, and all the things that might pose a threat to the King and the Queen Mother were left in the outside room, and two Masters supervised him—they saw the bright Greeks on them. At the time of Rick's emblem, Laurie vowed that they even had a moment of trembling and disgust. However, they should also think that a warlock with a demon blood is originally a powerful weapon. No, they should have thought of it, because it is obvious that every person standing or sitting in the hall is wearing a rune. The former Master is guarded by the King and the Queen Mother, and the King and the Queen Mother are protective. There are more spells and magical tools, ensuring that even if he is mad, he can't hurt the two distinguished people in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired dragon is telling the truth? Is it another way to use it? Laurie’s eyes stared at the boy sitting on the throne. He was very familiar with his father. I don’t know why, his father did not treat like a tool or a monster. Laurie, he gave Laurie the name, put the crown and ring on the eldest son, put on the velvet cloak, and watched his daily growth, it can be said that it is meticulous - he also taught Laurie to ride horses and teach him to use weapons. There is also reading and writing. Everything is not artificial. He really cultivates Laurie as an heir. Everyone thinks so... Laurie is also, but when the distance between them is close, you can see it. When the other side's look, Laurie involuntarily trembled, because he saw the horror from his brother's eyes, and then saw the regret, and finally the luck. If the horror can still use his current obese body to ruin a teenager to explain to his brother's imagination, what is regrettable? What is luck? Regrettably, this beautiful body has been filled with fat into a squad. Fortunately, because he finally had to choose his second son instead of the eldest son? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t you salute me?" asked the boy on the throne, and the ministers on the side of the body all glared at him. This illegitimate child was almost destroyed. The brothers’ pilgrimage ceremony is now disrespectful to their kings. Even some of the judges who think that Laurie should be respected by the brother of the king, even if they are not the orthodox heirs, can’t help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't salute you," Laurie said. "Because I don't know how to call you, Your Majesty, please tell me, should I be a brother to congratulate you on becoming a king, or as a son to congratulate your father. Once I got a new life, I was once again able to become the ruler of Tara again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurry’s words are like thunder in people’s ears. The ministers looked at each other. They even didn't understand Laurie's words. Only the queen's brother came out: "You are going crazy again, Your Highness." His words made many people look relieved. How was Laurie expelled? Is it not because of his madness that he wants to sneak his mother? He has been outside for nearly two decades. In this case, his madness has not improved without being improved under many harsh conditions, but it has become a very normal thing. But now, Laurie didn't mean to argue and present evidence. He suddenly lowered his hand and the dazzling light broke out from his back neck. - He has undergone a very detailed inspection, but no matter how detailed the inspection, it is difficult to find a size that is only peas, from the shape to the color is inconspicuous, and will quickly in the gap between the hair The crawling little spider, which jumped out of Laurie's curly hair, suddenly swelled to the shoulders of an adult male. The flame and the light quickly formed a dangerous barrier and shield. At the same time, the little spider swarmed. Jumping from the ground, from the body of Laurie accurately jumped to the body of the Queen's elder brother, he screamed with amazement and anger, raised his arms, but his arm immediately burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurry Trail rushed to the new king, the knights waved swords, but his skin was as hard as stone or steel, and he covered his eyes with his hands. So as not to be hurt by the soldiers' bows, while carrying a full flame to the high platform with two thrones, the Queen Mother of the High Platform has stood up and guarded the new king behind him. The two mages also lifted up. The hand, the magical vortex is shaped in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid," said the Queen Mother, "He can't touch you, dear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But to everyone's surprise, one of the wizards suddenly threw his spell out. When his companion disapproved and frowned, he thought that he did not accurately grasp the opportunity, he suddenly found out, The target of this spell attack turned out to be himself - his runes flashed a bit, and he was broken when he insisted on less than two breaths, and when he had to give up the spell he was about to cast to avoid fatal errors. The second spell of the companion came silent and his protective spells were consumed after the soft screams. He wandered back and swiftly recited a spell that allowed him to reduce his time to cast spells. The third spell that screamed in the air collided in the air - he wanted to blame the other party, but the other party did not give him time, because he was too unprepared, he regretted falling after six consecutive throws. On the ground, a rose petal falls on On the tip of his nose, pathetic loser struggling to what to ask for, but still resist the power of magic, however, entered into a deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard who defeated his companion nervously looked at the throne, and while they were fighting, Laurie had completed his mission, he was like a wrap The red raging eagle licked his prey like that. Although the Queen Mother wanted to stop it, but Laurie did not hesitate for her intimidation or pleading for a moment, he put the young new king on his chest and let him and I faced the minister myself, and at this time, there was a fierce commotion from the Queen’s elder brother. The queen’s brother stood there and looked unremarkable. The little spider did not do worse than Laurie, when the man caught by it found it. Only by the power of human beings, only when it was burned to death, out of fear of death, he immediately turned from a respectable count to a dark day that was guarded by the Tara and scorned for hundreds of years. Priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His upper body is almost naked, and on his chest, the emblem of the sacred emblem is hung. This jewel of the jewel is different from the tattoo, wearing Its people will only be Hirik's high-ranking pastors, and there is a clear gap around his circumference. The ministers are amazed, their hands are on the hilt (some have been pulled out), but they don't know. Who should swing the sword for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you remember that gesture?" Laurie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what you are talking about?" The young king replied, then he shouted: "Qiao Wang! You, my loyal ministers, you What are you waiting for??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe waiting for a fact." Laurie replied, and no one knows how he did it, New King The hand suddenly broke neatly from the middle of the arm. When the hand fell to the ground, it was trampled by Laurie. When the sword was about to approach, he said loudly: "Look at this hand," he used The eyes indicated that although they were stubborn, they still had their own criteria. They would not easily be tempted by the power and the coins. "Look at this hand," he repeated. "Is this a hand of a living person?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
