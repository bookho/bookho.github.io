			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a thousand miles away, in a huge mansion with dozens of rooms, Fro’s priest Mei Mi is stretching his arms and licking his fingers A scent of spices is sprinkled into a copper scented boat heated by pyroxene powder, and then explored through the body, deeply sniffing the smoky smog that rises from the furnace. And Penny around her eyes widened, curious and focused on her every move, she felt that this Fro priest was both mysterious and beautiful, full of charm that even a woman had to admire, she It was completely attracted to plum honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To smell it," Mei honey habitually called in that sweet and hoarse voice: "Penny, this is hard to come by." Benny /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny carefully sniffed her nose and sniffed. She smelled the smell of pepper, red currant, honey, and some other things she couldn’t recognize or didn’t know. How to describe the smell - the smell she and Berndell can smell on him after she is happy, but to be more intense, kinky, they pierce her nose like a needle. She sneezed rudely and shook her head. When she found out what she had done, the thick powder on her face could hardly cover up the heavy blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's priest smiled succinctly. "It can make you more beautiful." She said, while picking up a small silver mirror, Pan Nie saw her eyes in the silver mirror - it was too small to accommodate a part of the face, and the priests of the lady and Fro hang it on the belt, both decorative and ready to see their makeup - - Once the spinning girl had never seen such a pair of eyes (although the line of sight was blurred), the black pupil was enlarged to three times the normal size, and the plain brown iris narrowed into a golden brown circle, filled with eyes. Tears, reflecting the drifting candlelight... She blinked and the eyes in the mirror followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A myrrh, three **, half a belladonna, a nitric acid, a copper," Mei Mi sings low: " Expensive, but value for money, every man who sees these eyes will be unable to extricately fall in love with its owner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is... Magic, or magic?" Penny asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a drug," Plum added a little spice to the fragrant boat. "Come on, smell more - it has a lot of utility." - Penny, you will like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny did what she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of smoke is strange and weird. To be honest, Penny doesn’t like this smell at all, and I’m not used to it, but she’s really Mei Mi got a lot of benefits, her skin became fair and delicate, her lips became red and the ru was sore – Mei Mi said it was a sign that it started to grow twice, she trusted this Fro priest, and Other ladies, baronesses, princes and even counties are doing this. Look, in this warm and luxurious room, only a loose silk gown is placed, and there is no beautiful woman inside. Are people everywhere? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are here to indulge in joy, dance, sing, drink indiscriminately, taste honey, and say something that can only be circulated between women and women. Male jokes, touching each other, kissing, feeling tired, can return to their own room to rest, or lie down on the spot - this room is covered with white bear skin everywhere, and the pile of velvet pillows is like It is the scarlet hills that stretch on the snowfields. The soft and ** body of the woman is like a fleshy river flowing in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny took two more breaths. After inhaling enough smoke, she felt that the smell didn’t seem as peculiar as she initially thought. The smell was so fragrant and tempting, she giggled, she remembered Bywin, she remembered their hut, the black and small mud shed, the pigs they had and they slept together, stinking The heat of the heat radiated from the pigs and Birdwin, which made her feel happy and happy. Her spirit was defeated by **, and the body quickly relaxed with the relaxation of the spirit. She poured heavily on the plum. On the body, Mei Mei grabbed her arm and pushed her to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's priest sprinkled a last spice into the copper incense burner, and then turned his head before it gave out more smoke: "Penny, you want to massage She whispered, "I think you need a happy and enjoyable time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny snorted ambiguously, plum blossomed Shrugging, standing up, she shakes the brass bell, a handsome teenager wearing only a pair of silk trousers pushes the door open and walks in. When he kneels down Penny, Mei Mei rubs his toes and walks quietly out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey went straight through the corridor and turned to the left side corridor at an intersection, where she looked for a seemingly different carved wooden door. In front of the door carved with a pontoon and fennel flowers, she sang the exquisite door knocker with respect, the door opened itself, and then closed behind the plum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The naked baroness reclined on the bed, and it seemed that she was alone in the room, but Mei Mei knew that the Baroness was not a caster. She might have been busy with her body to entertain a mage. When she thought of this, Mei Mei’s nose Involuntarily faintly painful - at the tip of the port, she and a half-ogre, half-human, human thief gang gangs colluded to try to rob a strange and wealthy passenger, who did not expect He was actually a caster. He killed Mei Mi's accomplice and broke Mei Mei's nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei cured her nose with the magic of prayer, but since then, she will hurt as soon as she sees the caster’s nose, and she I always feel a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is our Penny Sweetheart?" asked the Baroness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I am doing a good dream." Mei Mi said that the spices in the copper scented boat are called by people except for what they say. The powder made from the fungus of the devil's finger is said to be the most devout white robe if it is used properly. Mei Mi only heard about this, and it is the first time that it is useful. Not as direct as the bard said, Fro's priest thought, in order to win Penny, she also inhaled the smoke of the devil's fingers, it seems not so difficult to get rid of - perhaps this is the most dangerous The place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a little plum can still confirm, that is, this powder is really expensive, it is about buying and selling, although the price is floating, but it will not be low. For a thousand gold coins - if there is a need for the caster, the price will be doubled or more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pannie and Mei Mi said that she once gave the Baroness 5,000 gold coins, which is a lot of money, the problem is, just today For the devil finger powder, the baroness made a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's priest tried to hide his doubts. The Baroness was only a baroness, but she was the owner of this comfort zone, her skirt Behind him, there may be a shadowless man who can hide Mei Mei from the moment without losing his finger. She bows her neck neatly and listens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is basking in the sun, and is dominated by a negative energy For the undead who supported it, this is no easier than Bathing’s bathing under the enemy’s swords and fangs—even if he knows that the sun is good for his present body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
