			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the giant trebuchet is devastating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden retaining wall and platform will be hit by it to crush, and the stone wall will leave deep pits if it falls within the chest wall It will roll and roll, and it will cause a fracture or a flesh torn when it is rubbed to it - two trebuchets can cause damage caused by ten small trebuchets or three hundred orcs in a very short time. - If it wasn't for Thundersburg and had its own mage, the loss could be even bigger - one of the casters casts fossilized mud spells, turning the stone into a sand without any lethality, and another The two used the sand wall and the throwing ball that were originally used to stick the creatures. The former made the speed of the stone ball slow, while the latter made the stone ball deviate from the direction, but unfortunately it could be intercepted by them. There is only a small part of the stone ball. Most of the woodwork on the wall, including a precious cannon, has been destroyed. The other three need to be repaired, and only two barely survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knight was hit by a stone ball in the chest, the breastplate and the inner chain were penetrated, the twisted steel was inserted into the soft internal organs, and he immediately died. There are only surprises and stuns on the face. Ten soldiers have also suffered similar disasters with him. If the stone ball is in the middle of their vitality, they are so lucky that they will not suffer too much, but several of them are only smashed in their arms and legs. The place in the shackles is like the Master’s trick, and the wounds are more horrible than the swords or the orcs’ fangs – like a clay man who has been squeezed by force. Everything was broken and glued together, and people couldn't stop bleeding for them—they quickly ushered in their deaths in panic and pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an archer, a stone ball just hit the shooting hole, the splashing gravel stabbed his eyes, his companion dragged him Go, pull out the piece of gravel that is like a big nail, and then regret to find that it has penetrated the archer's brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin’s sideways let go of a fast-moving gravel, the situation on the battlefield is not ideal – the half-beasts already have an advantage, they even Start to sneak a meal - well, as you think, they eat the dead or dying enemy, wrap the armor clothes that have solidified in the blood and wrap them on themselves, picking up human weapons, those The sinners on the face began to turn and fled to the Thunder Fortress. The Orcs chased them and chased them into the small slings and rifles of the humans. The stones thrown by the slingers allowed the hybrids to taste the defensive of the Thunder Fortress. The bitterness of the encounter, and the spears fired by the guns can pinch two or three of them together on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-beasts wisely chose to escape, and as usual, the soldiers on the wall would laugh, but now they can't bend their lips - the scarred sinners ran under a solid wall, hysterically shouting The weapon or fist in the hand, the foot and even the forehead hit the cold boulders, praying for the people on the wall to put down a life-saving rope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have completed the task!" They cried: "We have redeemed! Let us go in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The soldiers looked at Byrdwin, and before Bedwin issued any orders, the stone thrown by the orc's small slings and the arrows they shot were already pouring down like a rainstorm, but a blink of an eye. They all died under the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, please don't stand there," he said nervously, although the only giant trebuchet that directly threatened the wall suddenly stopped moving. They stood there, motionless, surrounded by darkness - the early winter nights always came very early, the heavy gray clouds covered the ordinary stars, and only the magical galaxy visible to the caster was still shining, but Their radiance is invisible to mortals. There are no light sources in the orcs' camps. Their eyes are like wolves or bears. They can see things in the dark, but humans can't. They ignite torches on the walls, even if they know This is to point the subject to the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin turned and he knew that these people were not his soldiers, and that these people were sinners who were dead and sinful, but he still felt愧疚—and...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cast the enquiring eyes, elves, and humans to the mage, and they all shook their heads, the most powerful mage of Thunder Castle, That is, the mage, who is also good at plastic spells, raises his hands: "Sorry," he said. "I'm not sure my spells can radiate beyond five hundred feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A master who is skilled in mantras nods and agrees: "This distance - even if it can summon a flame spider they will inevitably lose control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And one of us has not been able to cast this spell." Another wizard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creima touched its ring, and if someone accidentally touched the ring, it might wonder why it was hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you walk out five hundred feet? Asked by the soul of the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It can, the undead who once replied, but leave you, or your magic is too far, it will become weak - five hundred Ruler, as far as your current strength is concerned, it may still be a little fluffy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The soul of the outer world sighs, I think the elemental servant is a very powerful creature, he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In the fire element plane, of course, the biggest role of the elemental servant is not here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did they stop?" A knight asked: "Is the stone ball gone, or are the two slings finally falling apart?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry went to the mouth, "No," he said. "They are still solid and stable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing The red robe mage in the shadow of the valley made a gesture. His apprentice ran over. The orcs opened the prepared wooden box and took out the dark clay pot of the size of the stone ball. It was much lighter than the stone ball. The trebuchet was once again adjusted - the pottery whistling through the cold air and the darkness, but as soon as it landed, it burst into a bright light that could cause blindness. These lights jumped around, carrying a lot of smoke and emitting The smell burns the throats and eyes of human beings. Except for the stones, anything they touch will burn fiercely - even if it is only a little bit, the human being burned by them will roll and want to put out the flame but find that it does not help. - these flames are like living things that can be quickly Into your skin and bones and burn part of it as dry as dead wood horribly burned them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar immediately raised his fingers and used a power of thought to bring a large pot of water - fortunately they were still cold and dumped in the nearest person The body, the white mist, the irritating gas makes all humans and elves painfully hold their throats - the young black spellcaster is no exception, but he is less adversely affected than others. Some, so he can smell the smell - the smell of garlic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the nine-year compulsory education, the soul of the opposite world prayed, although he did not remember his chemistry teacher is male or female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dispels the smoke around him and magnifies his voice: "White phosphorus," he loudly reminded: "This is white phosphorus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White phosphorus is also one of the minerals that the mage can reach, but it is not very common. Some casters who fail to react immediately will cast spells, disperse the smoke and call a large amount of water to wash the soldiers and instruments that are caught by the flames, but More clay pots filled with white phosphorus were shattered, and Byrdwin seized a mage to let him convey his orders (now only the mage can move freely on the wall), he can't let his soldiers be miserably and miserably The flame of the devil burned alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink," said Kerry Ben, who handed over a small bottle, and Birdwin took it and found that it was a diluted water of life, he Drinking a little, and a little bit in my eyes, the burning feeling suddenly faded a lot, "Thank you, my friend." He said with tears, with the consent of Kerry Ben, the small bottle passed down: "I The orc's teeth and fur will be used to pay for the purchase," he added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves were barely injured. They helped the injured humans to retreat to the tower. An elf mage flew into the air with flying, overlooking the entire dragon's abdomen, the orcs. The first real offense has been launched - they are like phosphorescent green eyes in the dark like a wave of ups and downs, and the waves are surrounded by a sharp shadow of high bulge - that is the attack of the orcs City Hammer, the throwing arm used by the giant trebuchet is twice as long, but its diameter is three times or more. It is hidden under the triangular wooden shed to resist the rolling oil, lead and boulder dropped by the defenders. The triangular wooden shed is covered with soaked hides, both to increase the toughness of the wooden shed and to prevent it from being ignited. The huge chain of chains hangs the siege hammer on a solid support, and the roller is mounted under the bracket. The platform, a few orcs, squatting in the flattened wild cowhide in the place where it is about to pass, lest the soft land after the snow melts to trap this heavy behemoth in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant trebuchet is still in operation, the white phosphorus pottery and the stone ball are knocking on the wall of Thunderbolt, and the high temperature caused by the white phosphorus flame melts and adheres to the stone brick. On the ice, the stone ball has a deep mark on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs stopped at a distance of three hundred feet from the city wall. They were also afraid of the flame, smoke and smell of white phosphorus, but now the walls of Thunderbolt have been lost. With guns and small slings, soldiers and knights can shoot arrows and throw darts down, and the wizard can throw lightning and flames at them, but this will undoubtedly be much harder and more dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have equipment and weapons to replace," Baldwin said. "But it takes time. Prepare," he said to him. "We want to go out of town." Combat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
