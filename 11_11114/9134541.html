			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Walled City is a powerful mageHis father is a grandfather, which means that he has a resource that ordinary people can't reach from birth. After he is confirmed to have the power that mortal can't have, he loses his inheritance, but it doesn't matter, he can use his talent. More things, even his brother, the current Grand Duke will also bow to him, because he has this terrible walled city - just like Grenada, the caster occupies the advantage of the number, about There are thirty mages or warlocks who work for him under his command, as well as their disciples and apprentices, so that the casters in the city even exceed the sum of some countries.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these people, as people do, is a poor pity that is rejected by Grenada because of stupidity or clumsiness and worthlessness, but There are also some, their ability is second to none even in the warlock tower of Grenada, but there are always reasons for them to get a place there, some because they are too arrogant and can’t stand the Dragon of Grenada. The scorn of the warlocks, some of them are trying to tease his employers because they are being used for sale, and some because they have supreme wisdom and sufficient reason, and they are always vigilant, so they can get from that dangerous The gems in the lava are taken out of the Red Dragon Capital and leave quietly - the leader of the Walled City has always been so self-satisfied, only he knows that he actually escaped from Grenada - he came Grenada was still very young, with handsome looks and strong body, which made him a little bird that the female warlocks and priests chased. He was really angry in those years. Fat, high spirits, but unfortunately this is a better situation to disappear faster than the morning mist, and when he was a lover of the dispute, accidentally killed her<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this lover, unfortunately, is a follower of the Grid, who has both the warlock and the pastor status, both of which have both It shows that her body has the blood of a dragon, and this woman, in the identity of Grenada is very high, the leader of the city has hoped that she can introduce herself to the owner of a warlock tower or a certain highness For this reason, she has done a lot of unknown evils for her, some of which are even quite dangerous, but his pockets are gradually empty (the cost of the wizards is very amazing), and he is also injured. When she needed a long period of treatment and cultivation, she was ruthlessly ridiculed and expelled by her - her contempt gave the frustrated and furious magi a chance to kill her with a magic, and then stole all him. Precious accessories, magic items, scrolls, runes, etc.Perhaps the goddess of fortune is always watching his relationship. He not only escaped the kingdom of Grenada, but also successfully erased the traces left by himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the priest is not important to the point he thought, or it may be that her death is considered to be another pastor or other strong enemy, Master Disguised as a mortal in a quiet village, after three years, there are no deadly followers and assassins - but he will never return to Grenada, and he does not want to return to his country. Because his father is already dead, and his brother doesn’t like him very much, and he put his sight on the mouth, and the mouth is very close to the village. He managed to recruit a group of goblin thieves and humans in the village. It was the first step after looting as a slave and building a small single-storey fortress on a steep mountain. After that, he threatened his Grand Brothers, along with his pastor from Grenada. The stolen things framed the prototype of the cityAmbitious, he spent a decade here, not for anything else, just want to establish a "Grenada" that belongs to him only.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t say that this wish has been reached, but let him, and the villages and caravans that have been plundered and hurt, his city’s Many people will tremble. As food, gold coins and slaves accumulate day by day, his legions (he calls them so) become bigger, thieves appear, assassins appear, giants and orcs also move here, The casters who are most eager for the leaderThe walled city is like a stinky clay group. When it rolls in the dust and feces, it will become bigger, bigger, and bigger every time it rolls. Later, the messengers of some countries will appear in his meeting. In the living room, they brought some thieves’ guilds who were unwilling to accept or they were not willing to hand over to the thieves’ union. Others tried to recruit the leaders here. After the presence of Grenada, there will of course be Other countries follow its example, but no one succeeds. After all, not every country’s founders can make a lot of red dragons and warlocks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in recent years, the merchants of Grenada are also in contact with the city, but the leader does not know if they know anything, this protection The squad was decided after he hesitated. It was expensive, but the bottomless abyss was down. It also seemed to have the power to match the high price. The prince certainly knew that the Grenada’s Dragon Tooth Legion also saw those. The eagle lion is swept from the top of his head (when he is still in Grenada), of course, he does not think he can be important to alarm the red dragon, but he also knows that his position in the walled city can be easily Resist the attack of most of the enemy, but for the air, all his means are only the brakes and the casters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ready to escape, but before that, he wants to give some of these Grenada people a look at the colors to reward the shame and torture that the country has imposed on him - the warlocks of Grenada are When the mountain was busy, he asked the giants to set up a giant trebuchet, but he was not sure if they had done what they had done, or they were driven away by the falling stones, but what did they want to do? The leader thought, unable to come up with the correct answer. He hurried to the key points of each circle to see the runes that only he knew. Those magical gems that were damaged or exhausted were only changed a few days ago. And the magic gems in his second pocket can last for a few months, although he may only stick to one tenth of the time or less.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the leader of the Walled City was joyful and sly from the rough path back to the people’s sight, he suddenly heard a kind Very weird sound, if it is in another plane, this sound will be described as a train passing through a tunnel, where people can hardly describe it, and the sound is emitted from a deep underground.The leader bowed his head and saw the pebbles falling down on the steps. Of course, these pebbles would not fall out of thin air. He quickly found their source - those stone steps.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader responded promptly by releasing a flight. He floated up and stopped stepping on the dangerous steps, and he looked around when he looked around. On a platform not far from him, where a giant trebuchet was set up, the giants were rushing to put the round stones back into the basket that was suddenly dumped, but they had not waited for them to tidy up the heavy stones that were round and tidy. The sour screaming sound, the giant trebuchet with three giants slammed down, pressing a giant under the shelf on the spot, and the shovel connected to the wood fell off because of the violent impact. The wood rolls on the platform and smashes a short wall and stops.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe someone might wonder why wood would roll on the platform, well, of course, because the platform is no longer a platform, the leader of the city immediately puts himself Something has improved. What makes him feel that although he is in the air, the wind passing through the mouth is still very fast, but it is not magic but the wind brought by nature. Although strong, it is no longer a weapon or a powerful barrier. - The hurricane brought by the formation disappearedAnd the half-seat, correctly, a tall tower and many small fortresses attached to it, their bases, that is, the peaksA large area of ​​landslides has emerged. The fragmented rocks carry about one-seventh of the building’s decline. The walls and stairs are twisted and broken. Some fortresses can barely maintain their original appearance, but among them In the impact milling of the stone, they lost their lives, and there are huge gaps. The brakes, coffins and hot oil they prepared for the enemy have fallen, or they are placed in places that the giants can’t touch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outer world can detect the sights of the warlocks and the wizards, and the warlocks also Well, the little claws in the hearts of the wizards are almost going to scratch their throats, but they are patient and don’t ask this spell recklessly.Even if you ask, the souls of the outside world will not tell them, lest these casters turn this spell on those who are innocent or upright.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The array has been destroyedHe said: "Ready to attack"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bad thing about this array is that the rune plate required by the array method needs to be fixed on the key node. Once the rune disk is destroyed or left, it should be there. The entire array will be ineffective, and some people may want to look for them, but the current situation is obviously not allowed. Then, after asking about the situation of the Lich, the soul of the outside world will soon make a decision. ——It’s really difficult to find a small thing that is hidden. If it’s just to be damaged and moved – the whole mountain is shaking and shattering, is it necessary to ensure that the spell is in effect, so it’s impossible to just put it in a small The rune in the room can really be unaffected? As long as a rune plate no longer works, the other runes will be bleak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is a bit rude, and the soul of the outside world is not 100% sure, after all, it is a mountain, not a sand table, but he There is no other way, just a little trouble... He took a look at Asmodeos, the hamster-like little devil unconsciously twitched his nose and walked away from the sheltered branches.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no interference from the formation, nor does it mean that the army of Grenada can drive straight into it. This is, after all, an evil that has been carefully crafted for nearly two decades. nestThe giants quickly re-established the trebuchet under the encouragement of the gold coins. The orcs and humans manipulated the brakes. The casters rose to the sky, throwing spells under the cover of smashing arrows and round stones, and you can see that some people are digging. The ruins, obviously, are going to restore the rulings completely. In addition, on the ground, it is also a problem that the Deinonychus can’t stand on a narrow ladder. At this time, the dragon tooth knights who received the order are no longer eager to fight for the rule of the sky. Right, but first clean up the lower part of the walled cityThe shadow of the lion's lion's beast flies across the ground like lightningThe flames and lightnings of the Warlock and the Master shine on the steps and corners, and those who hide in the fort are careful of the poisonous fog and the magic pets of the casters - like this "cleansing", if it is not necessary to keep the Master and The power of the warlocks may be three times in a row, but the soul of the outside world does not need to be too "clean". He casts some seeds. When these seeds touch the ground, even if they are stones, they will immediately Rooting, the purple-red vines quickly spread to every corner, and those who were lucky not killed by poisonous weapons and monsters mourned, an orc drew out from a gap that seemed impossible to accommodate him. With the tip of the vine in it, the Grenada people have noticed that the vines are sucking his flesh in a frenzy<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
