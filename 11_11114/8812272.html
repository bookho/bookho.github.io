			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's words: Sorry, I was dragged to the meeting and sent late...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** *<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar has never seriously seen the White Tower. [full text reading]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time he came to the White Tower to inherit the legacy of Beavis, during which he lived in Rosada. In the sanctuary, in order to avoid the newborn, fragile muscles, blood vessels and tendons will not be harmed for the second time, the number and scope of his actions are reduced to the minimum and minimum. After obtaining the inheritance, he and Kerry Ben Returning to Gray Ridge, there was no excessive stay in the White Tower; and the second time, he and Kerry Ben came here to ensure that Yadel and other innocent people could obtain a fair judgment - due to Demon's lies At that time, the white tower residents’ perception of the elves had been reduced to the lowest in history. Many people died in the city. Most of the shops were forced to close. All the walking around the streets were Indulge in sorrow and sorrow, in the poor man in black, Cremari will certainly not have the mood to appreciate and appreciate the beauty and wonders of this city, he and Kerry Ben in an Antonio Master Old hotel opened in the hotel , Unless absolutely necessary, otherwise they will stay in his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Tower left him with the impression of a gray fog, all things are ambiguous, except for Beavis’s residence, III The White Tower - the main tower of the Lord's Castle, the Master's Tower of Antonio's Master and the Most Holy Place of Rosada, oh, right, and the Temple of Fro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Tower today completely overturns the one he remembers - it’s not as dark and humid as the city of Point Harbor, with skewed houses and The narrow roadway occupies the largest site; it is not much like the Biyindi Fort. The Biyin Dyke is clean, rich and vibrant, but as a free port, it also has its own loose and complex, such as too much. Taverns, hotels, chaotic shops, fixed and unfixed merchants in the market, displaced people outside the city, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former governor of Baita was a lonely and stereotyped person. He did not like to have anything beyond the scope he recognized, so in Baita, Everything, no matter what, must be in order, at a glance – all the streets are straight, the intersection is not a right angle or a half of a right angle, the pavement is laid with a three-inch square gray square stone, the width is divided into It is 6 feet, 12 feet and 4 feet. The narrowest between the two houses is not less than two feet, and there are drainage facilities. Unlike the Bibi dike, the Baita is also a commercial city, but Pubs, hotels and other types of shops must be opened in accordance with the will of the governor, that is, if you want to drink, you must go to the pub area; if you want to stay, you have to go to the hotel area; want to buy something - The silk cloth has a silk cloth area, the linen has a linen area; the blacksmith does not mix with the goldsmith, and you don't expect to find a hat to sell on the opposite side of the shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these, even the thresholds, porches and columns of each house are restricted. The length from the extension to the number of columns is required, the color is also, they are all gray, the walls are made of gray large stone bricks. Masonry, the pillars are made of a lead-gray sandstone, some people will hollow it out (the pattern of each household is not the same), then point the oil lamp inside, the light is transmitted from the inside of the pillar, forming a A unique symbol that is difficult to imitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the outer city, you rarely see tall trees. People can only talk about these two small places in front of the door and behind the house. **Shrubs and grasses, if you can look down from top to bottom, then you will find only three places to find large green, Rosada's sanctuary and Fro's temple, and the entire white The sides of the river on the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima and Kerry Ben walked on the side of the river, and the phoenix tree and oak stretched out the broad green leaves to the slightly turbid river. Their The shadows cover the entire blue-gray wood plank, and the dark brown oak stars are dotted with the grassy slopes below the plank road and the plank road. The children drilled in the rushing crowds, before they were hardened by the boots and Before the wooden shoes are crushed, they are picked up and put into their pockets. People who can settle in the White Tower can afford wheat and flour, but these fruits like a small hat can be put into the fire and grilled. Can be regarded as a good little zero mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul from another world observes the crowds around them - among them are the residents of the White Tower, and they have come from other places to witness and participate in this Merchants, knights, bards and craftsmen, but you can hardly find the difference - those who lost their parents, siblings and spouse children not long ago seem to have completely rid themselves of death. In the haze on their heads, they took off the black mourning, put on bright silk or velvet clothes, and wore gold, copper and wood necklaces, ruddy, light pace, they laughed, they shouted, young People are like each other happily chasing and singing with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In our case, the undead who once said that death is not popular and the most common guest. In general, long-term mourning belongs only to the king. The aristocrats, the casters, and those who are in the same position, the death of mortals is sometimes a kind of relief, their loved ones will not be sad for too long, they need to be busy, work hard to ensure that they will not become The next person to be mourned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s just a little hard to imagine, the soul of the opposite world said that when I came last time, I was still full of anger and tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——When you can eat honey, don’t think about bitter medicine. The Lich says that being happy in time is the true meaning of life. After all, human life is so short and unpredictable, let alone—he gently shakes his fingers. Ruthlessly, the justice has been done, and the sinners have been punished. I think they are satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not unchanging, the souls of the outside world have noticed that compared to the past, the people of White Tower are no longer so keen to wear Rosada. The logo and the holy emblem, more accurately, only a few people, and they quickly took it off or hid it in a jacket, and then easily and happily integrated into the happy river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They eat, drink, dance, listen to and talk about the slutty jokes about the lower body, and go to the knights in droves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the convention, before a wedding of a lord or consul, there must be a knight competition for a period of time. The owner is responsible for notifying and calling those brave. The fearless knights are responsible for their room and board, and they also provide the color of the game. Some of the more generous lords will also give armor, swords, horses or pay their ransom to his favorite knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of competition usually lasts for two rounds, up to six rounds, that is, more than half a year. The number of knights gathered depends on the color head provided by the owner - the lord Will provide a buffalo on his own territory, whether it is part of the armor, a sharp wide sword, or a famous cockroach, of course, it may be a marriage of a daughter who does not want to ask him to like, so that he does not want to provide a dowry. ...but sometimes, they will come for some prestigious opponents, because once they defeat the latter, they can get both fame and exquisitely expensive equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please like that one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been outfitted and only reveals a little curly dark gray hair from behind the helmet. His armor is not as cumbersome as other knights. There is no gold-plated sacred emblem on the top of the helmet. The devilish horns are either feathers or fur-made helmets. The helmets are not eagle-like or puppies. Mouth, just the most commonly used pig's mouth, there are no fine and delicate patterns and curves on the breastplate, nor do you leave a beautiful poem on the arm, only a balance placed on the hammer in the heart position - indicating He is a knight who belongs to the fair, the protector of the commander, the god of justice and justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the value of this armor is even higher than those of gold-plated or gem-set, not just because it is all-steel and is made of fine gold. It is also a clever and practical idea - the armor and armor of the armor are ribbed, which can reduce the weight and enhance the protection effect; the breastplate is composed of three pieces of nails, and the outer narrow piece is only used as a The connector is present to ensure that the wearer does not become awkward and sluggish because of the inability to move the huge breastplate; the armor is divided into five parts, which are respectively covered on each finger, and the joints can be flexed and stretched freely, which is most worth mentioning. It is also equipped with a large neck guard with an ankle guard to protect the fragile neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
