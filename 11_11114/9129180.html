			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a scroll, so the casting materials and steps that need to be prepared are much simpler. There are only two things that the Lich needs to carefully consider— - The first is the ban and the devil's tactics. He once had a room for summoning in his house. Like Antonio's Master in the White Tower, all the lines are inlaid in the obsidian ground with Mithril. On the above, there is no need to worry about accidents and the destruction of the law. Of course, this approach is also extravagant. After all, this array has only one effect, and it can’t be taken away in one place, but now the lich can’t continue to use it. This room - although it seems that it has not been damaged or tampered with, but no caster will use a format that is unfamiliar and unsafe for him.?? ??w?w?w?. ?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the reward that the succubus needs. The lich calls her not to ask for an answer, or to order her to assassinate an enemy, she Will stay in the main plane for a whileThe devil is quite happy to see this situation. They can get the most soul and flesh and blood in the main material plane, but the undead who was worried about whether he will be sentenced to the small black house because of the sin of the summoning object - that comes from The thief in another plane can now handle most of the problems quite well, but as far as its memory is concerned, it probably gives it 50 years to learn how to deal with a succubus. He is really worried about it. When you open your eyes, you find yourself facing the six-finger Grazite. You must know that the scorpion king has a curiosity that is 10,000 times higher than that of a human baby. The witch king’s lover will never let go of such a special existing<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the caster who is not standing in the neutral or good camp summons the demon or the devil, who often uses harsh and cruel spells to force these abyss products. Obeying the command, the former will use more bribes—that is, the soul gems that the devil or the devil will like, such as the sparkling little things that can act as a currency in the abyss, food, and decorations. The violent and mentally retarded Orsay Magic calms down immediatelyFortunately, these things may be rare in other places, but they are never lacking in Grenada. When they were in the North Sea, in addition to Rune Fragments, the Lich’s Dimensional Bag did not live up to the expectations of the owner. Although he didn't know what he had caught at that time, in the chaotic grave, everything that was piled up like gravel was once a precious treasure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only took out a small part of it, and he switched to a bunch of sparkling soul gems, given that the summoned is a succubus - the lich Picking the gems that taste sweet and sourPerhaps this is something that mortals can't imagine. After all, it's not candy, but after all, Cremaar used the devil and the devil to feed on the human, humanoid soul.Yes, as a lich, just like the monsters born in the endless abyss, for them, ordinary food has lost its appeal, they can't get happiness and fullness from them, only the soul - year The old soul tastes more than the younger soul. The suffering soul is always bitter than the life-stricken soul. The soul of most children is light, so if you can, extract the soul before they die. The caster or the abyss will use their means of intimidation and torture... Want to know if this soul gem tastes so sweet and delicious as the ripening berries, just check if the soul in the gem is taken from For young women - when love is wrapped around them, they even have sweet dreams, and when their love is quietly gone, their hearts are always brewing a sour pain, they settle in the depths of the soul. Until the joy of being a mother turns into another kind of sweetness to hide them - but if their lives are stopped, then Their soul gems only taste this bit monotonous, but because of the sheer and appears strong taste<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fell into the lead from the hands of the undead, and the lead was used to isolate harmful rays in another plane. Interestingly, it is here. After the plane, the auxiliary gems and the runes, it is also used to block the perception and spells of prying magic tools.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room is rebuilt, the black rocks on the ground and the walls are all viewed by Kremar, and the line of chiseling The magic runes and patterns must be personally hand-picked, but he does not use the secret silver thread that has already been created, but allows the souls of the outside world to cast spells, let the Mithril flow like water, spread along narrow passages. The whole room - Mithril is not from the black market or any place in Grenada. When the lich remembers that he is still in the kingdom, a careless colleague is using the Mithril line taken from someone else. In the hands of the devil that he summoned, in order to control the devil, they dispatched nearly a quarter of the warlock tower.Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are spices, ores, gadgets for casting spells, etc... The Lich finally checked his own reel and potion, and With a wand, open a bottle of snow honey into the mouth - in the case that the silver crown jungle has been closed, the price of these sweet and delicate little things on the black market in Grenada is almost flush with the real dragon blood But if you can get it, it depends on whether people who have a need can deter other people's status and identity – in any case, this can help the speller to concentrate a lot and give them a quick reply. The energy of the **** is only a small number of warlocks, mages and pastors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he saw was the dark water, a round of radiant light, and even the lich's movements did not wake it up. It slept very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who was once dead for a while, back to the surface of the body, must be because he is too nervous, he said to himself, his current level For a succubus, it is not high enough, so he will think of the elf - if Kerry is here, he will think... wait, etc., the lich is simply looking at himself with horror, he just thought What? Just as a weak person commits his life and soul to others? He looked at the blurry shadow reflected on the bright black stone wall. Is he like this? The dark-haired dragon, once the undead, until now, a deformed monster, but he is Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar, a lich, cruel, evil, cold, lonely, forever. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed loudly, for the fleeting hesitation, the laughter calmed him down and made his eyes re-established. He looked at his hands and magic, and this is his most trustworthy friend and helper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————————————————————<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the endless abyss, a little devil is moving carelessly between the lava river and the blackened rocks, there are always some debris in those high temperature gaps - or The high-level demon or the devil eats the rest of the breakfast, lunch and dinner, or the old body that faded when it evolved, and the broken limbs thrown by the devil and the devil when they fight each other, and some hiding The soul locust that got up, it was so concentrating that it could not escape from a furry goat's hoof in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a succubus, um, a succubus in anger, this is unfortunate, the succubus is a demon, and small The devil is subordinate to the devil, and the devil and the devil are not two close races, although a long time ago, because the nine layers of hell and the bottomless abyss are assimilated into a huge space that is now twisted and weird and intricate, the devil and the devil can not Don't share each other's fields, but that doesn't mean they can hold hands and sing songs and eat hot pots, and they will pay a smile in the past – or it should be said that on the contrary, if the previous two abyss races were large battles, There is still a fixed time node in the blood war, so now almost every few decades, a hundred years (the shortest one is only ten years), there will be a terrible bloody battle here - even the devils I agree to call the new home a bottomless abyss, but this is not to say that they agree that the devil should be one step ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forty thousand please forgive me," the little devil shouted. "Please forgive me, respectable adult, I wonder if I am next to you." The foot? If it is..." When the pressure on the back of the back became louder, the little devil shouted in a panic: "Please let me go, my bones are too hard, and the blood is stinky." It may pollute your shiny hair like gold."dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly not saying that the succubus can hang down to the feet Long hair, um, that is auburn, it refers to the succulent hoof, from the succubus's knees down, growing hair like wool, they are curly, very beautiful, covering three points One of the sheep's hooves, indeed, this succubus is proud of this, but her anger is not so simple can be dispelled, she leaned down / body, pinch the tail of the little devil tightly, Then he pulled it off the body of the little devil, and the little devil screamed because of the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very angry," said the succubus, although the little devil was so painful but still tried his best to listen. It needs to know what the succubus is not happy, maybe it can find a glimmer of life from it, and then it hears a terrible name: "The scorpion king," the succubus complained: "Of course, our king can do Anything, including kicking off his subordinates and going to the main material plane, but I don't want this hobby to be inherited by his children, wouldn't anyone call Sheriff Hill? The devil said with anger: "Why did she give me a hoof? I haven't gone to the main material plane for a thousand years. I need a soul, I need a man, I need to have fun! The bottomless abyss is down, I need to have a good time. Killing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil is almost desperate to say nothing, if it still has a little extravagant, then now it has heard two consecutive The most dangerous name, the succubus will not let it go, because it means that her complaint will be passed to Graz's ear, and perhaps the daughter of the sorcerer's daughter, Felix Hill, even Grazite Not doing anything, Ferry Hill will also This punishes her - and although Ferry Hill is not a lord or a king of a certain level, her father once robbed her goddess Woking to her own territory for her, and gave her a godly drink every day. Blood, although later because Woking pinned the deity in another place, and was not replaced by Felix Hill, but Ferry Hill has also become a handful of great devils, although she is still a charm The devil, but already the most powerful assassin of her father, even the abyss refining may not dare to face this, not to be such a small succubus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
