			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes and stand on the flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are feelings in the past two chapters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Author. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: Kerry's elf name can be extended to Keller, meaning silver tree, belonging to an ancient and great elf king, absolutely tall - - As for him, Mao will be a Ranger. Well, in my setting, although there are kings and nobles in the elves, they are more responsible than just enjoyment, so Kerry needs to be his. The people who traveled abroad served as a striker and guide, and his special identity also helped him to get a higher starting point in the outside world - almost all of the people he had known and dealt with before were quite authoritative or powerful... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team led by Kerry was originally on the sixth day At noon, they rushed to the Thunderbolt, but thanks to the goblin community, the sporadic orcs, and the giants, they finally got into the vast territory of Sir Birwin in the twilight of the seventh day. By the time they can see the edge of the gray wall of the thunderbolt, the magical star river has completely traversed the black velvety sky, and the light of the stars illuminates the sturdy road and the mud shed in the distance. The elves can also Smell the smell of burning moist wood and leaves from the wind with the scent of coniferous forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbolt’s night patrol team met the elves when they were fifteen miles from the fort. Their captain was a very spiritual boy, he left Going with the elves, his team continued to perform their mission, and two other children who were good at riding and sharp-eyed were sent out by him to inform the city of Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the dragon's abdomen has nothing to do with the dragon's abdomen. It is more like a blind tube of a dragon, slender and curved, with steep cliffs on both sides, people's So it’s called it just because it’s as fragile as the dragon’s belly for the land of humans and elves – thousands of orcs ride through giant wolves, horn deer and horses every year when Thunderbolt is not built. They have empty stomachs and leather pockets, and when they go back, they are both full. They drive the flocks like the slaves who are twice or three times as many as they are behind them. Ten times the body of the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman in the Highlands was only a big tribe at that time, and their leader had a far-sighted vision that was hard to reach. He could be said to have built all the thunderbolt, and isolated the only way for the orcs to go south. The bloody and brutal invasion was obtained. With the containment, his tribes were able to breathe and develop. He took back more wealth and the love of almost everyone. His son established the country on this basis. When the leader died, he could not wear a robe. Rod, but in order to express respect for the father and the identity of the identity, respect his son, the will of the Norman king of the Highlands, he became the first king of Norman in the Highlands nearly twenty years after his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first lord of Thunder Castle is the younger brother of King Norman of Highland, and then the second son or nephew of the king, the son-in-law of the king or the grandson, in short Relatives who are worthy of their trust and blood relationship, the last lord is the king's uncle, when he recommended the humble, not even a noble Baldwin to become the next master of Thunder, the people of the king are Boiling, and then people agreed that Birdwin was the illegitimate son of the old jazz. The so-called adoption and combat skills were just to hide the eyes and ears. Even when he was a prince, he fought side by side with Birdwin and knew his bravery and wisdom. The current king is also inevitably holding this rumor with a suspicious attitude. After all, as a civilian, no matter how great the merits he has made, how good talent and bravery, a small piece of land, dozens of serfs and a knight The title is enough to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old jazz always responds to those who come to inquire with an ambiguous attitude, when the king waits for the king to make a decision, he gives A series of reactions is not so much a clarification of the rumors that it is a fuel. The wonderful thing is that his biological sons are not dissatisfied with this. It is important to know that the Thunder Castle is dangerous and barren, but it is still in the area. It is quite objective land, but the sloppy orthodox heirs face the provocations of the friends and friends. It is not pretending that they do not understand or simply express that they are not interested in the ghost place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin lived briefly in the king’s time when he was sealed and received the Thunderbolt, and he also had a relationship with the old jazz’s son. He had to admit His brother is not so bad, but although this is noble and rich, it is more similar to a businessman's mixed ball is not suitable for Thunderbolt, he is worried that this guy may sell the Thunderbolt a good Good price - as long as the orcs can afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also considered it, and he promised to the gods that he believed in, Tyre and the king, that when he was old, injured, and died, he could not continue to perform as a knight. When the lord is obliged, he will return the Thunder Castle to its real masters - let the king decide who will inherit this most important level - if not the king has only one daughter, and the king's brother is weak ( He couldn't even ride a horse. As a knight of Tyre, Birdwin would not accept the rule of Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Byrdwin didn't know why he remembered things many years ago, maybe because he returned to the king this time and saw too many people's relationships - the king, the princess, the duke... he went to the old jazz family The cemetery visited the upright old man who died six years ago and met his nominal brother, who now owns the largest Norman in the entire Highlands, every time he sees him. Devin had to cover his eyes so as not to be stabbed by the brilliance reflected in the gold and jewels on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is his wife, Baldwin smiles, they have spent many passionate and crazy nights, leaving behind on each other’s body Traces and bruises, he may have a child - Birdwin thought, a child, they have been expecting for a long time, he wondered if he should go to Gretti, but he must say that as a Tyre The Cavaliers, the many acts of Pastor Gredith have made them suspicious - or he should receive his wife from Thunder Castle, and the couple who are thousands of miles away will not give birth to the animals that sacrificed to the entire pasture to Greed. Children come, at least not one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Baldwin couldn’t help but think of the mistress--the nobles always have mistresses, and the nobles of Norman in the Highlands are no exception, but the last time he was When returning to the king's debriefing, Wang Du's ethos was not so corrupted - Norman's aristocrats had previously only one or two temperately looking for one or two unmarried small businessmen or civilian women as their mistresses. Now, they are keen In any class, not even limited to women, men are smeared with powder, women are bare-chested, and there are priests and priests participating in the party all night long. The barbecue is piled up into hills, and the honey and ice liqueurs flow like water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, his wife still maintains a plain and pure nature, but Birdwin knows that she is in extreme tension and uneasiness, she has asked about it more than once. Devin’s view of the lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We won't be like them," Birdwin shook his head, raised her hand on the cheek and kissed her side: "We love each other." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to take his wife to Thundersburg after the end of this winter campaign, she can live in the inner city instead of the fortress, so Byrdwin can go home every ten days. He misses her broth and vegetarian pie. Since he left the small shack, he hasn't eaten it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian’s brief interrupted his warm fantasies, and Baldwin ordered them to lay down the suspension bridge, pull up the gate, ignite the torch along the way, and prepare hot water and food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
