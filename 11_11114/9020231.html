			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several smart apprentices found the situation when their reed boat suddenly stopped, but did not know if it was brave or reckless, they jumped I got off the boat - I jumped into the water marsh. Fortunately, the water marshes here are not wide. In addition, they are still some children, but the depth of black water is enough for them to flap their hands and feet to the strips that are only 50 steps away from them. Grassy hills instead of plunging into the mud, the two-legged gnome dragons are still staring at more prey, only a few dozen gnome dragons rushing to them with their tiny front paws - people's "run!" For them to squat, they must at least run within the scope of the bow and magic to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy, the moss and the decaying mud are constantly scratching their feet like the fingers of the deceased, a child falls, the back of the gnome The dragon immediately rushed to bite his back neck and back. He cried and blocked his neck with his arms. The arms became bloody in the blink of an eye. The sweet smell spurred the predators who had high knees in adult men. They screamed loudly, concentrating on him, licking his ass, legs, and tearing a small piece of meat from above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companions are innocent and dare not even look back, they chase the reed boat, it is not easy, after all, the reed boat is still dragged Going forward, although they have been harassed by the gnome, they become somewhat uncontrollable, swaying their necks constantly, trying to get rid of the ropes and escaping from the mud – but for these young children, they are still too It's fast - their power is quickly exhausted in the tough run, their faces are red, and they become pale in a few moments. The wind blows through their bodies and fills their mouths. The cold is like holding a handful of ice. Water, in contrast, their throats and lungs are filled with red-hot soldering irons, their fingers are numb, and their feet are as heavy and dull as the casters applied petrified spells. They are almost desperate, and the only thing that allows them to force themselves to move forward is the screams of their companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a rope, grow a little longer, be fine. But be firm." Gülen suddenly said that he was on the leftmost boat and was also away from the child. One of the nearest ships, he stood on the curved stern of the reed boat, and the turbulent dragons that jumped up and slid up like a fish did not seem to have any effect on him - the mercenary gave him a look. Turned around and took a bundle of rope from his rucksack. The thieves took the rope and licked it. It gave a glimpse of the mercenary. This kind of rope thieves also used it. It was a thin wire rope with three strands inside. Wrapped in linen and silk, only one tenth of a pound, every three feet, although the girl's little fingers are so thick, it can easily take up the weight of four or five adult males. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He handed the end of the rope to the mercenary, and the other end was labeled as the most commonly used adjustable knot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too far." The mercenary said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not less than fifty feet." Gülen blinked. There is not much time for him. The rope of this circle is at most one hundred feet. He used to only set the prey within 60 feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Pig" is running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentices are mostly from the lower class in the city. Their parents are certainly not able to learn the origins, so the child does not have a repetitive name, like Jack. Or Todd and the like, is to use numbers to rank, for example, Jack's third child, if there are two Jacks, and they have unfortunately have more than three children. The name will become Jack's third child of toast, and Jack's third child who makes the barrel. It is thus conceivable how confused and troublesome a group of children will be when they gather together, so they are often asked to find a name. Newcomers and younger, weaker, will be shunned by stronger children with their fists to avoid their names—those who may never touch paper and quills, of course, can’t think of a good name, “Little Pig” One of them, he was originally called Leimen, but the name was very nice, so he was taken away by the big boy. When his master whipped his ass and asked his name, he had to twitch and say that he was called "piggy", which was the property he had left as a butcher’s father before he died, even though he had been The mother took it, but he remembered the "pig." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because his father was still alive, the "pig" always eats more than other children, and his accumulated fat not only makes him After spending the most difficult day, he made him grow taller than other apprentices. His legs are the longest of all - his master once joked that he should be called a donkey instead of a pig. But the "piggy" is very satisfied with his legs. This step is almost the same as the two-step leg of others can make him run very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s here, he knows very well, he can’t run through those monsters – even if he can really run under the reed boat, he’s absolutely It is impossible to climb up, not to mention the dense monsters climbing on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sudden power came to him, the "piggy" could not detect that it was a rescue rather than a harm, he screamed His arm was caught, and his body was tilted forward uncontrollably. The gnome dragon behind him jumped up immediately, but what puzzled them was that the prey suddenly jumped like a fish or a bird. It’s up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary shouted and violently pulled the rope back, and Gülen had already got the second rope. The next step was to do the same. His goal was to be the second closest to the ship. No one asked him anything. At this time, everyone knows how to choose - the lasso he throws accurately captures a child, and immediately other mercenaries take over - several mercenaries venture out of the ship and intensively The smashing arrows opened a narrow path for the apprentices who were pulled by the ropes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last one!" shouted the mercenary who first handed the rope to Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may not work, and Gülen said in his heart that they are more than seventy feet away from the child and are constantly stretching - but he Still throwing a lasso, the child saw it, but at the moment the lasso fell, he fell, a gnome dragon was biting his ankle, and the lasso passed over his hair, everyone There was a lament in the heart, only Gülen rushed forward and grabbed the end of the rope - the mercenary holding it relaxed unconsciously, the ropes were tightly stretched, and people made a short Cheers, the child stretched out his arm and passed through the lasso. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child had been bruised when they dragged him up. He only looked at Gülen and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world nodded to Gülen and turned to look at the ship A reed boat stranded in a mossy grass. There are only three mercenaries on the ship that can be said to have lost their lives. They have no way to look after others. The apprentices pulled out a bundle of reeds from the reed boat and lit them, hoping to use them. The flames drive away these monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the bow!" The caster shouted in the air, he slightly increased his voice, and then issued a spell, hundreds of ships around the ship The gnome dragons of the carnival scorpion fell in a stun, and the pressure of the mercenaries eased a lot. They immediately followed the caster’s words to the bow, and the apprentices threw the last burning reed. I also rushed to the ground immediately after the run. The reed boat is not as big as a real wooden boat. Its bow is also very small. When ten people gather together, it is like a ant nest. The gnome dragons, which were not involved in the previous spells, have climbed up and probed, and they screamed, and the evil light shone in the small eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come a fireball, or more!" a mercenary cried, he didn't dare to speak too loudly, but he was very anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
