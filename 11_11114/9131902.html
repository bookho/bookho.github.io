After losing the boring burdens (the dragon tooth knights and their mounts), Keou couldn’t help himself. ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will be soaked," the Lich said. "Maybe there will be a few sneezes because of a cold."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean," Keou is not very satisfied with this answer: "I mean, you just throw them out of the Grenada?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do you want me to do?" The Lich said: "Make sure their women can have boys?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is very The ironic words are converted from the proverbs of another plane. The male lion beast certainly can’t understand, but he immediately realizes that he is a bit too nitpicking. He should know how the current master can do it all. Difficulties and dangers, the dark-haired dragons not only keep the women and children alive, but also retain most of the men - they leave the desert, even if the eggs of the spiders cannot hatch, they must spend a period of time Quite hard and bitter life. But this is not necessarily a good thing for them. Keou discussed this with Moussa’s father when he was the leader of the male lion and beast, but Moussa’s father, despite his authority and strength, still could not Their own people give up and cannot say peace, even full of blood and death. This is an extremely contradictory phenomenon. Every barbarian is full of hatred for this poor and dangerous life, but they are not willing to leave the desert, leave the spider beast, and work hard like ordinary humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you want to say the barbarians in the desert, you can’t say that they are completely extinct, they still have a small branch that will be in the identity of Kremar’s legacy. Entering the kingdom of Grenada, living under the protection of the black-haired dragons, perhaps most of them are very suitable for Grenada - Keou remembers how humans greedily stole the human face lion The beast's eggs, really, if Moussa did not send them back in time, Keou's minions would tear them one by one - this is a bit less in line with people's perception of the human face lion beast, but It doesn't matter, Keou has never been a male lion in the usual sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But in the future?" Keou asked, he asked, the entire sky is showing the color of lead ash, sapphire blue and gray red, and the endless dunes Rendered by today's last sunshine, it is like gold shining in the fire. This gorgeous color will make many people feel drunk. The male lion body beast flaps its wings and lands in the cool wind. At the top of a tower-shaped sandstone, his claws fell on the rocks, the gravel dust fell, and the huge wings fell from the shoulder to the buttocks. The tip of the wing was almost flush with the tail. The lich was not surprised. Why is Mittite difficult to hold on to the love of Keou? Keou meets the grievances of the Greinada people in every place: fallen, evil, powerful, arrogant, and able to conquer such a It is a wonderful thing to be a lion and a beast. It is almost second to conquer a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the age when the dragons still have to worry about the gods, it is almost impossible to make a dragon a mount and a slave, even if it is The people who are the most trusted by the dragons can only be caught or held. If you see a person riding on a dragon, don't doubt, it must be the human form of another dragon. Although this situation can only be said to be few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the leader of the Dragon's tooth, right," said Keou. "And for them, you have done this very well, that is, you will not be dismissed. Of course, I am not saying that you can quit this appointment. If you can, you will not accept it from the beginning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Lich sighed. He did not intend to return to Grenada so early. If he can, he plans to serve in Gray Ridge." But obviously, the hand hidden behind the fate will not give him so much time. Once again, Ostal appeared in front of him, calling his dragon name, and asking him to return to Grenada, he knew that he could not - he could reject Austal, but no doubt, after He will be sent a heavy embarrassment, which will lead him into the kingdom with a frustration of a loser. No one knows more than the lich how dangerous it is to be - if you must make a metaphor In this case, Grenada can be said to be a small pool with tens of thousands of piranhas floating in it, almost to the extent that they may collide or squeeze at any time. At this time, whoever flows A drop of blood will be the first to be attacked. This has nothing to do with the conspiracy. It is only from the instinct and nature that Gredith has intentionally cultivated for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean," Keo continued: "When they want to attack a country, what should you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will set up regulations to avoid some tasks that may be tricky for me," the Lich said slowly. "I have a lot of love for Greed and the king anyway," he said slyly. "I can do anything about it." This is my privilege, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Keo shrugged, and this movement made the dragon on his shoulders jump. "Okay, I will help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course I need your help," the Lich said. "Where can you see?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?" The male lion body beast asked, looking at the direction of the lich's finger, he only saw the intersection of the desert and the Scorpio, where it seems There is a slender and faint light. "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the sea," said the Lich. "The sea of ​​Grenada, Grenada has many ports, but the Red Dragon They don't like water, or they don't like sea water, so the king of Grenada is in the plateau and desert, but Grenada is also embraced by the sea, it is a peninsula."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to have a city of my own," said the Lich: "Myself The fief, although the sons of Gredi are in the kings of Grenada, they all have their own army and territory, and I don’t have these. Although, "He said: "If I I may get one if I want to, but I don't, I just want to have a territory that the descendants of the Red Dragon never thought of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This and What is the relationship with the sea?” Keou paused suddenly. He suddenly understood the meaning of the lich. “I know,” he said in amazement. “Do you want a port as yours? "Heh?" he hesitated. "This may be a good idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all," said the Lich: "Have you ever thought about us? Can there be a city standing in the sea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keou is really surprised: "Do you want to put your city in seventy? Are the seven islands going up? Where is it not part of Grenada, there are a bunch of stinky bones... Oh! My mane, my mane, my mane, my beggar--oh, look at the endless Why do you want to get rid of my mane in the abyss? Even if you are jealous, licking my mane does not make your beard more lush!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Respect your enemies,” the Lich said in a serious way, putting the mane that was subconsciously smashed into the pocket of the next--the mane of the lion-faced beast is also a good one. Casting materials, "And I am not prepared to expand my territory to the seventy-seven islands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Grenada did not Too many islands can be built," there are only a few sporadic islands around Grenada. When the tides of the islands rise, they will all disappear by half or even disappear. "Do you want to build a city on the bottom of the sea?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can also be said." The reason why the Lich had this idea was because of the glory he saw in the mind of another uninvited guest. It is also exquisite, like a tower-like building. This is just a group of buildings in another plane, but here it can be called a city, and he can do a lot of things with this city: "Keou, Do you know what the first legion of the Grenada army is entering into a city? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men's lion body beast silenced for a while, "Slaughter." He said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are six thousand knights in the Dragon Tooth Corps, two thousand warlocks, and I can't ask them not to destroy those innocent lives," The Lich said: "That is... their fun, and their hobbies, unless I am in front of them, otherwise they will never follow this order, they will even question and resist me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to do, and need me to do it," Ke Omin said sharply: "Is this related?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two eagle lions Strolling into the camp.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each lion-faced lion has a knight’s squat, that is, the mercenaries are responsible for preparing food for them, but these Although fresh but not active foods can't fully satisfy the appetite of these bloodthirsty beasts, they occasionally fly out, looking for one or two beasts and monsters in the gravel desert and the desert, or small caravans with insufficient protection. It will be the target of their attack - these two lion-faced lions have just attacked an unfortunate caravan, which has lost many mercenaries in the sandstorm, and no Grenada warlocks. Or the Cavaliers as a card, but only two slaves and the horses they are holding are enough to make them grateful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
