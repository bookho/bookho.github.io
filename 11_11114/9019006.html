[Feng \ / Huang \ / update fast Please search] <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the guidance and help of Kerry Ben, the reed boat produced by humans is 30 feet long. Fifteen feet wide and seven feet high, the mercenaries removed the cowhide tents as awnings, so that both the goods and the people could be comfortable - because the caster was used to it and needed a quiet environment, the owner of the caravan The two mages share a boat, and Kremar gets a separate boat. Although it is inevitably occupied by the cargo, it is really spacious compared to the mercenaries and apprentices who must be crowded into a canopy. Much more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary leader is seeing Kremar’s excuses to leave, the average person always has a respectful and fearful attitude towards the caster. In particular, mercenaries are often able to reach the caster compared to many civilians who know little about the caster, like the soldiers and knights of Thunder, but that’s why they In the face of a caster, it is like facing a beast with a claw and a fang, or, more than that, at least the beast will not suddenly throw a flame or thunder, if you can, They will try to keep a safe distance from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for the little monster." The Lich said, in exchange for the elf a dangerous eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it’s not necessary," Kerry said: "It's better not to get too close to it - I don't know what it is, but it's always There is a place that makes me feel wrong." If it was before, Kerry would not allow this unsettled factor to exist in his own team, but now he must consider Birdwin, his best friend - Highland Norman Pharaoh and Birdwin’s wife almost completely destroyed the faith and will of the former paladin, just as the rainstorm hit the sand fortress, and what Badwin could do was to rebuild them hard and slowly—and He said that he would become the protector of Pastor Fro, so Kerry would have tolerate Mei Mi and the little monster that she was hiding in her arms, but this is not to say that they can seduce and deceive as they please. His people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Additional." He added: "The little monsters are not the best choice for the devil, although they have childlike intelligence, but they are teasing others. Have a special liking, and sometimes even slack off the work or tasks delivered by the owner because they want to complete a prank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so important," said the undead. But he did not return to his own ship, apparently he still insisted on the original idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," the elf said helplessly: "Be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich made A simple gesture, in the elf's silence, it has the meaning of commitment and affirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three multi-legged lizards with a tail that is nine feet to twelve feet long, fluttering briskly on the surface of the swamp, chewing the elf as a reward for acidity Pulp. While dragging the huge reed boat, leaving a trace of smoothness as a mirror on the water floating on countless white velvets, it is worth mentioning that even so, the movement caused by lizards and humans may not be as good as a violent swamp. Red-billed cranes come big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some apprentices between children and teenagers are excitedly crowded by the boat, exploring their heads and enjoying their enjoyment of speed, the sun will Their hair was fluffy and hot, and it looked like a pile of brown and yellow hair balls. The merchant and the older apprentices kicked their ass behind them, urging them to do what they could never finish. Work - but as long as the caster falls on the boat. They will get into the tent together, but after a while, you can see many twin bright eyes from the gap in the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich thinks that his magical pet, Asmodeos, also has a very strong curiosity, or that many devils have this hindrance The emotions of reason and life, but unfortunately its source is not so cute and harmless that people do not want to misunderstand - the devil, and most of human curiosity stems from greed - they explore any kind of feeling they might bring Things to benefit, from rock to mushroom, from steel to flowers. From the body to the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every caster can understand this, but the Lich is quite familiar with it and has used it several times, especially Asmodeda. Oss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he accidentally perceives the existence of the little devil in meditation, he can only say that he is slightly surprised - because he knows that the little devil must be very curious about him. Why do you have a place that is very similar to its former owner. Not the body. When he became the master of Asmodeos, he was already a white robes wrapped in gray robes. The little devil could not find their similarities from the outside, but the magic energy overflowing in the soul was unchanged. Or, it should be the same, but his original magical energy is as cold and evil as the negative energy in the bottomless abyss. Now it is as hot as the broth heated on the hearth, and Asmodeos will feel strange and strangely familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Asmodeos betrayed him, the undead caught it and released a mantra of his own change and expansion. This spell can be said to have cut off the connection between him and the little devil, Asmody. Oss could no longer perceive him, and he couldn't get the magical energy he needed when he stayed in the main material plane, but he couldn't sign a real contract with any of the casters. In any case, the real name of the little devil is always in his hands - so the little magical energy left in the little devil will soon be drained by the main material plane, it will face two difficult choices, if Continue to stay in the main material plane, although it can draw magical energy from the mortal soul, but those thin magical energy can only be said to be a glass of water, it will eventually become weak due to malnutrition, not by other evil spirits or The little devil eats forever and dies; but if it chooses to return to the endless abyss... Eternal Asmotels! For the devil, this is simply an unprecedented pain and shame, it is not even forced to be sent back by a white robe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who will call it later? Asmodeos affirmed that its former owner would completely destroy its name. How long does it take to wait until once again to reach this plane full of food and fun? Five hundred years? A thousand years? Thinking of this little devil is going to go mad - it should be called Toto or Mimi, maybe there will be such a silly elementary schooler to call it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos is fortunate, and when it is dying, he meets Ostal, a warlock with the same name as its former owner. Not only did he not let his devil pet, the snake viper, Animos swallowed its kind, but also found a master for Asmodeos - a stupid short-sighted and weak-minded master, but just in line with A The need of Smodios - Demon's ignorance of the devil made him rush to sign the so-called contract without getting the real name of the little devil, and did not get the real name of Asmodeos. Can be smart to discover the clues, as for what is contained in his soul. Those poor magical energy, loose is like a mass of sugar, he could not find out how Asmodeus gradually swallowed them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔, if you want to make Asmodeos a metaphor. Demon's magical energy is a mass of sugar, and the magical energy of Austal is a hard candy mountain, and the black hair caster is very interesting. His magical energy is like a hot sometimes condensed when boiling. The Chocolate River - the inability to find the origin and the end - Asmodeos likes chocolate. Also like its untestability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if there is no commission from Austal, it will try to follow him, even if it was almost last time it was cursed for thousands of years. Deported back to the bottomless abyss, but he is only a personal class (well, maybe there is a stinking elf blood), he will always neglect or shake, Asmodois is eager to pierce the spike on his tail The eyes, then catch and shred his soul, sucking those sweet and abundant magical energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it really has nothing to complain about when it is caught by the wizard - tell the truth. His grasp of the little devil also made Asmodeos familiar - many people thought that Asmodeus had only a spike on the tail that was dangerous. In fact, every hair on the little devil They are all containing venom, which can both paralyze and poison the enemy. They are softer than white fluffy flowers when they obey. They stand up even if they are a leather armor, and they have claws. With the teeth - but the young wizard of this black hair is holding it, his fingers are as hard and cold as the rocks, his thumb is against the throat of Asmodeos, and the four paws of the little devil are all pinched by him. Into its fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Asmodeos. The shadow of the little devil is reflected in the black eyes, but the little devil can't find a trace of human emotions - that is, the little devil thinks, it tries to find food to sneak into the black spellcaster's ship and still wants to How to argue against each other to kill his alert. But when it first fell to the ground, it was noticed that it was wrong. If it was as sly and embarrassing as a personal class, it could only rely on perception to identify people. It would have thought that it was another person standing in front of it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but its perception tells them that they are the same person, the little devil is completely confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s not a time to think too much, and the fingers of the little devil are not so friendly. They are clenched together, powerful enough to crush a piece of rock, the little devil's body is pinched into a small group, if it is really a little monster, then it is now dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos did not continue to hesitate, "Help!" It shouted, not at all shy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Maymi shouted, and when Cremari’s sight fell on her, Fro’s priest took a step back But still staring nervously at his hand, or the small bag hanging around the neck of Asmodeos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich’s finger is pressed on the bag, it’s small like a toy, but it’s really a magic item, and it’s still hidden inside. Asmodois escaped from the elves' exploration - perhaps a scroll or rune coat of arms, he also made this coat of arms, after all, Asmodeos often needs to appear in the elves and white robes. Some areas that will appear - he can feel that the spell he applied to the little devil has not been lifted, it has no new owner, it is only hired - who hired it? If it’s just because of Byrdwin or Leona, things are much simpler. The problem is that he just found something interesting from the dragon grammar book on the pure gold cover—ah, interesting, and fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingers were pinched on the body of Asmodois, like a pinch of potato (also a special product of the Seris), savage, the little devil thought, he was a bit like My former master, my former master also loved to pinch me when thinking about it - when can he think about it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't kill it!" Mei Mi pleaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he is not prepared to repatriate Asmodeos, although it may cause some casualties, but what does it have to do with the Lich? He only needs to look at Kerry Ben, the soul from another plane is stupid and dull, but he can barely say that he has a little reason - it should be able to understand, after all, he was just an undead, not the dead. Always better at killing instead of rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just...hey, let it do something for me." The undead who once slouched pulled the cheek pouch of the little devil's fat. Pull it to the original twice as long, relax, stretch and relax... This is not quite right, the little devil thinks, my former owner is not so boring! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Mei Mi grabbed her robes and asked cautiously. At this time, Leona suddenly yelled and slammed down her body—two transparent holes suddenly appeared on the cowhide tent. According to its trajectory, if it is not her quick response, it may run through her shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reed boat shook a little, and then they heard other people yelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mars." The Lich said that this is also one of the common monsters in the swamp. It is only hidden in the water and squirting water to fight hunting. It's not dangerous, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Meimi stunned as the wizard took the little devil's thin, long tail and repeated it in the air. After a few weeks, it was thrown into the water just like throwing a chain iron ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's this." The Lich said happily. (To be continued.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p:Sorry, it’s late, the previous chapter is not very satisfactory, so simply remove it... this, let me Come back slowly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
