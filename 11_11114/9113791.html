			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young red dragon looks at the city under the mountain, and today's Grenada is still full of deformed prosperity like every day before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Grenada can only be said to be a port city like Bituminburg, but its conditions are far less than the Bibi dike, the tourmaline The place where the dykes face the sea is a wide cliff, but the land connected to the land is a gentle hill, the climate is warm, the rain is abundant, the products are rich, the business road is smooth, and its wealth is not even in those cities. Residents, just looking at those who fled from the war-torn places, did not have the opportunity to enter the Bibi dike, but also can find a glimmer of life on the edge of the city can also know a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada, of course, it was not called Grenada at that time, just a small stone city standing at the end of the sea, in this stone city Around you, all you can see is the red terracotta and the shiny black rocks. The sun shines on the land, evaporating the water inside, leaving only a thin layer of salt on the soil. This salt makes the land There are no trees and plants, and the inhabitants of Shicheng cannot farm or collect. Their only way out is to drive the ship out to sea. When they look at least weak, the sea they can have is extremely narrow. Ships from other countries will throw stones and torches at their boats - although it must be said that the fishermen in Shicheng are not without fault, in any case, the first large-scale use will make the fish extinct The net is not someone else, it is them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation has been maintained for some time, when did it go in the other direction? No one knows, they only remember that in the catastrophe of a thousand years ago, the insignificant Little Stone Town turned into a peaceful and isolated place. After the neighboring countries fell into chaos and became weak, they did not Reluctantly revealing claws and fangs - the fine net used for fishing can also be shrouded in the soldiers and knights, allowing them to turn over; the grease and fire used to burn the sails and masts are igniting The eaves are as good as the beams and columns; and they are pleasantly surprised to find that the human body is much more tender than whales and seals, even the strongest enemies are not as heavy as a thousand pounds, or There is a skull that can hold the hammer and beat. Moreover, looting and slaughtering can be much easier and more fun than fishing hard in the uncertain sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fierce and violent warriors around, it turned out that even a country may not be able to afford the red robe warlocks, in the initial At that time, they are not many in number, but they are as powerful as dragons. Their power seems to be never scared. They don’t fear death. They don’t care about fame. All the wizards and pastors who dare to stand in front of the Grenada soldiers, or Good magical creatures tremble and fall under the flames and lightning they cast. No one can resist them. Together with the army, they can even capture a city or even a country overnight, just like the tsunami, the ruler And their relatives have no chance to survive, and the property owned by them, and their people, has been taken away, regardless of the identity of the original inhabitants (unless it is the caster and willing to sign the magic contract loyal to the Grenada) All of them were slaves, with ropes around their necks, and they were driven by a goblin to a simple but huge market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This market is the black market where Grenada is famous for the entire plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tyre, Rosada and other good gods finally returned to their position, calming the mental and physical damage, finally have time and energy When the line of sight is directed at the main material plane, Grenada has completed two difficult tasks of establishing the country and expanding in 50 years, although in the hands of other humans, these two tasks can be delayed to one hundred years. Or longer, but at least it will not be filled with sin and blood like Grenada - but it is indeed a country, not a goblin or an exiled orc community, so the last good priest and holy What the Cavaliers can do is to help those countries that have not yet been fully encroached to establish a strong line of defense, and to secretly find those descendants of the royal family who may still be in the world. If someone complains, the rule of Grenada will also be shaken. Unfortunately, they can only find some scammers and fools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young red dragon yawned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada’s King City has expanded from the original Little Stone Town, and the three countries it has annexed have five depths and breadths on the crooked shores. The considerable deep-water port, the unsettled merchants soon discovered that although the red dragon's appetite is much larger than humans, they can get many cheap goods and slaves from Grenada. The red dragons used the looting and the wealth obtained from the merchants to enrich the inner bank of Grenada; the black iron and the steel were carried to the five ports by the merchants in the cabin, and the craftsmen became the armor around the clock. The army with the red dragons equipped with weapons; and the tens of millions of slaves bear the stones and build a city of dragons under the whip of the supervisor. Of course, their pain, mourning and lost life will not leave a trace in this triumphant kingdom, but the casters can occasionally glimpse the magic of the bricks on the building. Imprint - Each caster has his own magical mark, and the descendants of the Red Dragon are no exception. Some vanity guys will leave a signature under the connivance of the Red Dragon. After all, support for these magnificent buildings except solid. The column beams are only their spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada’s streets are also wider than other cities’ streets. If you use another plane to make an analogy, King Grenada The main roads in the city can be compared to four or even six lanes, and the important walkway between the secondary road between the house and the house is also as wide as two lanes. The tall dome and the cliff-like wall are drawn. The beautiful murals are generally depicting how the red dragons destroyed the enemy's cities and armies. The material is not difficult to find. After all, in the nearly 100-year battle, the red dragon's sons have cast their wings more than once. The shadows are shrouded in the eyes and hearts of human beings - unlike other cities, the courtyards of the kings of the Grenadines are also in the most sunny places, and the courtyards also have reservoirs and trees, but in the courtyard In the center, there must be a vacant site. It is not a sturdy red clay or a flat slate. The owner often places a bonfire on it and puts in sulphur, because the smell is the favorite of the red dragon, and then when they want In the case of Baigridi, the sacrifices will also be sacrificed there. The sacrifices can use pregnant ewes, cows or doe, but usually slaves are used. Some devout believers even deliberately choose from slaves. The men and women who look good, let them marry and then kill the future mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the people walking on the mansions and streets are not wearing crimson robes, or wearing heavy armor - except for the Red Dragon and its descendants, every Grinada's people are soldiers. Or those who are going to breed soldiers, they do not need to work or study, work as slaves, and the right to learn is in the hands of the caster. Merchants generally sit in the carriage, wear luxury, follow their entourage not only have a mage, but also orcs and giants. This kind of equipment is very necessary in Grenada, who knows when there will be a The evil warlock is looking for a guinea pig, or is there a soldier who wants to try his newly purchased sword or bow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A walking on the street, the guy who is alone is not a slave or a tourist, or a mercenary and adventurer. The slaves will be covered in black wool felt, which is ugly and rough, but it is safer than ordinary clothes, because a slave is likely to be doing things for his own master, but a smashing outsider may not be lucky. God sometimes looks at them, sometimes not. But there is still a constant flow of fresh blood into the city, just because Grenada is full of dangers at the same time, and in the black market of Grenada, you can buy anything and sell it. Nothing, no one will ask for directions or go to the east to ask for directions. You don’t need to leave any signatures or other things that will leave personal traces. The employers are professional and powerful, and the employers are generous. Generous, and some young mercenaries and adventurers expect, in Grenada, if you are handsome enough, or strong enough or smart, then you are likely to get a wonderful night - it is said that female warlocks and The priest of Greetian is as passionate as the followers of Fro, and they will not only ask for expensive gifts like Pastor Fro, but occasionally give a beloved lover two or three precious magic items or It’s a weapon, and if the child they gave birth to you is a boy, it will become a warlock. If it is a girl, it will become a pastor, and you don’t even have to pay for it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the young red dragon licked his tongue, and almost all of these innocent thoughts are stupid, that is, they will never be made up of those proud female descendants. It is a poor worm that is classified as a hunting object, but they are likely to become objects of teasing. The result is not to become a sacrifice and material in the Warlock Tower. It is a food of the Dragon. Yes, even The food of the red dragon is not qualified. The red dragon prefers young children and young women, and their recipes are meat and meat. Compared with other dragons, they are very paranoid in this respect. If there is no meat, then the red dragon would rather put Starve to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several flying dragons alarmed the young red dragon, its scales stood up in the inexplicable danger, the throat was itchy, the one dedicated to The stomach that brewed the flame contracted uneasily. It curled up its claws, retracted its wings, lowered its neck and head, and paid the highest respect to the great existence that was flying above the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their common mother - the most evil, the most dangerous, and the most intelligent and noblest red dragon Gree, once again returned to Grenada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy landed on the platform in front of the nest, she The mountain that has been chosen and inhabited is called the “death of death” because it looks like a dry, all-in-one sacrum, and black smoke ejects from the pores, just like the dwarf of the Iron Bone City. In that way, in the deepest part of the mountain, there is also a lava that is introduced into it by the power of the red dragon. The river of lava is surrounded by rocks and merged into a lake. They burn the rocks and make the stones hot and hot. - The Threat of the Gree is raised from the lava lake, a bucket-type stone nest that can accommodate Greed and all her children (whether semi-human or dragon) lying down, lava The temperature makes the gold and jewels that fill the entire stone nest hot, and can directly burn human skin and muscles, but The red dragon is very comfortable. When it is lying down, the gold and the gems fall like the sand in the sand dunes. Only the bottom layer is softened by the weight and high temperature of the red dragon. The solidified metals are still moving, and they have become a solid base connected to the stone nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these are just a small part of the gold beads that Gredith has. What can be safer than a half-position that you have developed? . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gredi, who has entered the old age, is as energetic as a young dragon because he has the relationship between Fro’s power and Barr’s fragments. There is no trace of blue-violet or gray-blue on its wings (the traces symbolize that the dragon is already aging), and its eyes are still like the flowing gold, the hottest than the most The flame is brighter, no matter whether it is falling asleep or waking up, there will be no enemy or friend, or if the child enters a hundred miles away from it, she will still be unaware of it - this is also Why is the "Death of Death" the highest, the most burning, and the farthest mountain from the king, even so, when the two claws overlap on the shale that looks like a tongue out of the mountain, It still overlooks the entire kingdom of Grenada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy squats down on the shale, and the usual action that makes it feel peaceful and happy today makes it irritating. It stood up and flew into the depths of the nest, between its gold and gemstones, with its long tail hanging down, feeling the burning temperature of the lava flowing underneath. This choice made it suddenly a drowsiness. I swept it, but after lying down, I always felt that there was a small thorn in the abdomen of her, maybe a scepter or a sword, but she lifted her body and rummaged inside with her claws. But nothing was found - a gold plate that requires two people to open their arms to slant down from the edge of the hill. The red dragon accurately blocked it with the tip of the tail, lest it fall into the lava and then use the tip of the tail. Roll it up and put it in front of yourself. This golden plate is engraved with the pattern of sweet peas, and the name of Fro, perhaps its spoils when it destroys a certain Temple of Fro, which Greed does not remember, or is the dedication of the children. But it reminds itself that the craftsman will recast the gold plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy wanted to sleep for a while, maybe only a few days, but the pattern on the gold plate seemed to be a warning - it hesitated for a while, or chanted a spell and opened the half-face that only belongs to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy walks in the dark corridor with human gesture Inside, the whistling call will lead people other than it to the hungry monsters, but Greed can find any place he wants to go without his eyes and ears. There are many only on both sides of the ramp. The first door to see, the door is full of its favorite treasures, and at the end of the corridor is the goddess Fro, who is the goddess of beauty and desire. Before Greedy captured her, she still had a marriage priesthood. But now it belongs to Greedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the prison was opened. The first thing that jumped into the view of Greed was a monster from the abyss. It was so ugly and so beautiful. It is not surprising that two conflicting impressions appear on separate individuals. After all, most of the creatures you can see in the endless abyss are deformed and distorted, but after it takes the power of Fro, it The body has some features of the goddess, which is very strange, because even the beauty of this monster is extremely abrupt and unnatural, even more disgusting, simply like a rotten, like a rotten The body of the corpse still retains hair like gold, or a soft, white finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gredi doesn’t like this guy very much, she puts her hand in front of the monster, the monster sticks out the tentacles, and the power is passed from it to the gritty. The feeling was really so pleasant, the time was fleeting, and Grydi opened his eyes, and he looked at the monster with all his eyes, and she regretted that the monster had already dropped the tentacles. The light shimmers, but Greed knows that it will not give her the remaining power. This is the contract, and Greedy can only get half the power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Greed is a red dragon. As everyone knows, the red dragon has always been the most greedy of many dragons. Greed has already planned, waiting for Eph Luo really disappeared on this plane, the contract was reached, this ugly abyss creature did not want to return to the endless abyss, the most suitable place for it is the stomach of Grein, now the red dragon only hope it is not too Too hard, maybe she can crush it and mix it with the baby? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, Gredi once again checked the spells and nails that bound the goddess. Compared to the last time, the goddess was thinner and more broken. She could even see the rock texture behind her through her body. She raised her arm and applied a spell again with the power she had just got. The invisible shackles firmly tied the goddess, and she screamed in pain. But it can only make a little hoarse voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
