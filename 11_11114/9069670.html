Among them, Xiqiao was destroyed by the nearest relationship with the East Crown, and a whole port and part of the building were destroyed. The south and north holdings were cracks on the ground, and some ships were The blazing stones falling in the air hit the sinking. The smoke emitted by the "Dragon" when it awakens and the lava flowing into the sea will cause a large number of deaths of the polyps. Even if you can hire druids and white robes, it will take about a dozen. Years can barely recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lords of the three islands quickly summoned their warlocks and mages, of course, those who had done the spell on the East Coast Island I can't understand why the volcano in the East crown suddenly broke out. Only the two masters hired by the East Crown lord have guesses about the black hair's caster, but they are not idiots to rap at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These don’t prevent them from releasing spells to understand why, whether the wizard or the warlock can summon the souls that mourn the wilderness to ask questions, or cast The voyeur and prophetic spells, the lords soon knew that the priest of the group Talos was attacking the East crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see," the lord of Nanguan inherited the father's position for a few years, still a young man, he sighed, if not the disaster of the East Crown Affecting his island, he may be interested in watching the beautiful scenery with a wine glass: "I said that the priests of the gods are all mad," they also tribute and tribute to Talos, but not pray His protection is not to incur revenge, so even if the people on the Longhuo Island offer more sacrifices and money than any city in the sea, they are absolutely unwilling to join the priest of Talos. Most of the lords of the East Crown, not only regular, irregularly and dedicated to the date of the sacrifice of Talos, but also gave one of his islands to the priests of Talos, perhaps he wants to be from these pastors Get some help that you shouldn't have? The other three lords have always been tempted by these priests wearing lightning cloaks. Although Talos was a very small god, he did say that his pastor could destroy the enemy's fortress or vessel at the request of the devotees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because the other three lords are always vigilant, and they also have a lot of relationships between the property and the soul. These priests are not on islands and islands. Intervened in the war between the two. The old lord of Nanguan has ridiculed the lord of the East Crown more than once in front of his own children. He is an idiot who has made a loss to buy and sell. Now it seems that the poor lord of the East Crown may have to dedicate his last capital to power. Crazy Talos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the young lord of Nanguan jumped up from his bed, and the female slave in his arms rolled agilely to the ground. I can't escape from the master's sole, but it is still a small matter for the owner to step on the abdomen or calf, but if the owner falls because of standing instability, she will be immediately dragged out and cruelly executed. Her master did not notice her, he Strode to the door, when his eunuch leaned down to him and kissed the ground with his lips, he heard him shouting loudly: "What about the Master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "And my soldiers!" He said, "Call my knight!" The knight here is just a name, there is no knight on the Dragonfire Island. The real knights are hard to bear the things they see. The knights of the lords are essentially the chiefs of the mercenaries. They are only loyal to the gold coins in the money bag, and are happy to enjoy and trample on the humble weak if anything is worthwhile. Praise may be that they will not hesitate or unwilling to accept a despicable command when necessary, and they are quite quick and enthusiastic, just like now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Knight" of Nanguan, the leader of the mercenary, was originally a pirate leader. After sinning the female grandfather of Azores, he had to find another way. The pirates who are willing to follow him sneak into the Longhuo Islands and start with a tour operator who has no lord protection. He climbed up step by step through vicious means and meticulous thoughts, and eventually climbed to the lord. He always wore a black eye mask, but his eyes were fine. It’s just that the pirates often do this in order to ensure that they will not be able to see things temporarily because of sudden changes in light when they jump into the dark cabin. He is not a pirate now, but he still keeps the blindfold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the orders of the lord of Nanguan, his wide and fleshy face even reveals a sincere surrender and joy: "Too "Okay," he shouted. "This is really the most wise and alert I have ever heard! My lord!" he said as he waved his hat with a huge ostrich feather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord of Nanguan did not go too far to count the compliments of the mercenary leader. "Then you are willing to do it?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The honor of 120,000 points!" The leader replied with respect: "If someone wants to snatch this sale with me... No, this task, I am I will find a dozen transparent holes on him and hang him on my mast to dry the salted fish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So go get ready "The lord of Nanguan looks at his mage: "I will give you one, no, two mage, they will cast spells to make your ship very fast." He paused: "We want to grab other Before people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the wise is not only the lord of Nanguan, but when the other two lords learned about the status quo of the East Crown and then realized that this was a good opportunity, they did not shyly do the same as the lord of Nanguan. Arrangement, even some businessmen are eager to move, everyone knows that the East Crown is now a sweet and sweet doughnut, even if the lord of the East Crown is not dead or has a new lord, he can not be so In a short period of time, he re-integrated his army. Other than that, the beet sugar and cane sugar piled up in the warehouse of the port and the shiny silver coins and gold coins could be equal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They even forgot that the East Crown is still under the wrath of Talos. For the sake of money, they can deal with the devil, let alone a priest of evil gods. They can take part in the sacrifice after the looting, and they can completely destroy the East Crown. It is also a storm and the ocean. One of the things that the god Talos is willing to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenaries and merchants prayed nervously and excitedly on the turbulent ships, but did not expect that they needed to be scrupulous, except for the priest of Talos In addition, there are believers in Su Lun and Rosada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf-led ship and army blocked the guys who wanted to rob the fire on the waters off the main island. The ships were highland Norman soldiers. They are not good at wielding weapons on the rickety deck. After all, Highland Norman is not a sea-facing country. Some of them have not seen rivers outside the moat before being exiled. Fighting at sea has never been their strength. But the genius Kerry has summoned a group of seaweeds from the bottom of the sea. They grow like a forest in the shallow sea. Soon the sea area was completely occupied. When the enemy ships entered there, they would be entangled in the oars by the seaweed and whip the steering wheel, even if the sails were pulled up. The speed of slow movement like a sloth can only be said to be better than the soldiers in Norman, but they can pull their longbows hundreds of feet away, shoot rockets, throw sulphur balls and white phosphorus bottles. As soon as it fell onto the wooden deck and the cabin, it quickly burned. The sailors and the soldiers had to jump into the sea one by one. Before the end of the battle, Kerry was only ordering the Normans to cast the board for them. on one's last legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some so-called "businessmen" did not dare to grab the lord's army, only dare to fall behind the fleet, seeing this situation, they immediately ; circumvented on both sides. Wanting to avoid Kerry, they went to attack other ports. They don't believe there will be a second Ranger Kerry, but unfortunately, there is no second Kerry book, but there is Cobbert and him. Friends, these ships, which are more accustomed to explaining the Sulun teachings in the sea, are not as strong as the new little birds, but they and their sailors are veterans who can confront the pirate ship. How to be skilled idiots is simply a breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there are also jellyfish in groups or seas and sea turtles following the jellyfish. They are dense and large, and jellyfish, like translucent bags, float in the sea. If the oars or the steering wheel are trapped in them, it is much worse than the seaweed. Because the jellyfish's stings, the paddlers don't dare to jump into the water to untie them. There are also those turtles, whose strength is like a steel axe, not to mention a paddle, and even the lead plates wrapped around the ship can be bitten by them. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the help of the sorcerer with the help of the spell, the squad of the other three lords was shattered. Although they finally obtained a compensation through the mistake of the East Crown (even if they did not know what was wrong with the priest of Tallos and the lord of the East Crown), several warehouses far from the port were encountered. The looting of small soldiers (I don’t know whether it’s a soldier outside the East Crown or a soldier inside), but after a staying night, the East Crown was forced to settle down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become the new lord, of course, the youngest son of the former lord, Amos, the name Dada has been thrown into the lava together with the broken body. In the middle, the former eunuch miraculously did not die, but continued to stay with his new owner to serve, no one asked, because Amos’s first order to the mercenary leader was to let him kill all He is a male member of a blood relationship, that is, the male descendants of the brothers of Amos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the convention, but before executing this order, the mercenary leader still asked if he needed to leave a part of the castration as a supplement to the new eunuch, but he The new owner just shook his head: "No," he said. "I don't need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mercenary leader indifferently said:" Obey, my master," he said. "I will bring their heads to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the mercenary leader left the room, Jier looked Amos took a look. "Is it because of the relationship of the eunuch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is also my relationship." Dada, no, Amos said: " Castration can only destroy their hopes, but they cannot destroy their ambitions. "It’s just that there are not many people like the eunuch and him, perhaps because of the educational relationship they have received. Most of them are forced from the son of the lord to be converted into The eunuchs just think about how to get the trust of the new owner, do everything possible to stabilize their position and make sure they can grow Live to the ground and hold some of the more comfortable authority that you can make yourself, rather than being like them or more accurately, like the eunuch, he simply disdains the so-called trust and favor, he even satirically Pushing a eunuch to the throne of the lord, for this reason, he risked the huge risk of completely consuming him at any time without leaving a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you don't have to be embarrassed in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe..." Amos hesitated: "But it may be bought from outside..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can Craimaar allow it?" Jier said boldly: "He is a half-elf, and he doesn't seem to like slaves very much. I mean, he is right. They have sympathy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every newcomer to Longhuo Island will have such a stage." Amos said: "Soon he will Knowing that he is doing nothing and if he is dissatisfied with our system, he will fight not only me, but also the entire Longhuo Islands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;姬儿Without speaking, she is always smarter than other female slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does he want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Side Island." Amos said: "Two Ten years of domination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is also my relationship." Dada, no, Amos said: "The castration can only destroy their hopes, but They can't destroy their ambitions. "It's just that there are not many people like the eunuch and him, perhaps because of the educational relationship they have received. Most of the people who have been forced into eunuchs from the son of the lord just think about how to get it. The trust of the new owner, do everything possible to stabilize their position, ensure that they can live for a long time, and have a part of the more comfortable authority that they can make themselves, rather than like them or more accurately, like the eunuch He simply dismissed the so-called trust and favor. He even ironically pushed an eunuch to the throne of the lord. For this reason, he risked the huge risk of completely consuming him at any time without leaving a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, don't you have to be embarrassed in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe..." Amos Hesitantly said: "But it may be bought from outside..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can Cramer be allowed?" Jier said boldly: "He is a half-elves And he doesn't seem to like slaves very much, I mean, he has sympathy for them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every newcomer to Longhuo Island will have "This stage." Amos said: "Soon he will know that he is doing nothing and if he is dissatisfied with our system, he will fight not only me, but also the entire Longhuo Islands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
