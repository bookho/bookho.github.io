There are 7 kinds of color patterns, and I don't know it is a change of Liao style latrine, but the exquisite embroidery, the small and unique gold button and the bottom surface of the gloss that has changed with the light have already made her fascinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing that made her look away was a plaything in my hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a piece of vermilion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural crystal of the crystal will contain chlorite, rutile, pyrite, mica, tourmaline, kyanite, tremolite, Yangqi stone, garnet ..., produce a variety of needle-like or hair-like inclusions, the color naturally changes, glamorous can not be square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary hair crystal naturally does not suit my mind, this hair color is as beautiful as rouge, as big as the palm, the most special is the "hair" inside. The crystallized lines I have seen in the past are always short and chaotic. It is like a tangled tangled red hair bundle that has just been cut from humans. It is also like a hibernating rainbow trout, quietly inhabiting a transparent crystal mine. In the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been holding it in my hands and caressing, I don’t know how to be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading for a while, the little girl actually said: "How much is this crystal? I bought it!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am laughing and laughing at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"100 million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She idiot-like laughs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"100 million? It is too expensive for the Korean won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"100 million pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was discolored at the same time as the boy around her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy pulled her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some people are not willing to do business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like it! I must have that crystal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are actually in the store I am screaming and screaming, and I secretly scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the headaches, the yin winds are protruding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uninvited guest dressed in a full black costume came in with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it today my black 13th Friday? How come you are the kind of guests who have no benefit at all? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Black is happy to say hello to me, and reveals a pure and innocent look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time, when do you play with children?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; won’t fall to be ridiculed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hateful girl is still not enough chaos, skip over and reach for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to sell it to me anyway!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quickly evaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you want... Why she doesn’t want the Mt. (one of the world's super large crystal deposits)? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is especially embarrassed, there is moisture in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her boyfriend obviously couldn’t see her crying, slamming her chest heroically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! Boss, you have a serious price, big deal, I will borrow loan sharks!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Knocking zero... I love you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My chin is almost falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Black is stunned on the biggest jade globe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing him, I gave birth to inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"100 million pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under what they say, I followed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or your first child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哎哎哎!~"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Black has protested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time, how can you rob us of this business?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young men and women I was surprised first, then I seemed to be funny and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good...more than 100 million pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then please ask this gentleman to be a witness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pointed to Mr. Black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is you, this is your profession, and when the time comes, please also collect money for me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the bad luck has taken the sewage, of course, it is necessary to use someone else's clothes to clean it. This is my usual guideline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands that he has made a helpless expression and touched the snow contract and the pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I built a private seal, and the guests signed the name with a slant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl put down the pen and immediately took the crystal in her hand and hurriedly stuck to her cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy on the side stared at her with patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Black looks at me and gently puts two contracts in his side pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2014. Zurich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he turned around, Mr. Black was holding two people standing at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a closer look, Hehe, is the two guests who have not seen for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls are much mature, and the boys seem to be the same, all faceless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Black, according to the shoulders of the two men, smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can collect money at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"100 million pounds?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is impossible to have them cut off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Black is quite dissatisfied with my knowledge. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The firstborn of both of them has a full moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They heard more horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you ask each other to find someone you love?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Black is laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will plead their attention to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't know if it is true..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am partial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing, Mr. Black is better than me, he has great powers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two first sons..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Black won a meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or 100 million pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl does not give up and continues to plead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hair is shining...I lend it to a friend...I am going to find it back to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goods are not returned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sacrifice the magic weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have nothing to do with what these humans have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are you!..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are!..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After despair, they began to blame each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at us so dragging, Mr. Black let go of the two and approached me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it, I accept his advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as one...just you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two flashed together with hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy took the opportunity to talk. Mr. Black raised his hand to seal his speech ability. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the last concession. Give another day, you can discuss who will give the child.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;They can't help but look at each other, but they find that they only hate remorse and suspicion in their eyes, and quickly avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Black looked at them as they hurried out of the store, and the scarlet tongue could not help but slip over the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants more than just the two children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He respectfully holds a suede bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the agreed thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bent over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't ask them what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm not interested."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings are the goods he and his like, but not my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I want to advertise the harvest of last night, but I don’t give him a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also received a cute gem yesterday, do you want to take a look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I am slightly headed and invited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only one I can show off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(End)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ———————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doom Hope Blue Diamond<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer of 2004, Russ Vegas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the place where the personal class creates, the incredible golden wall, and the countless men, women, and children swim in the mountains and fish, and they will never end in the day and night. In the light and shadow, for a moment, the rich are rich and rich, or vice versa, all the faces are full of excitement and fascination, the feet are floating, the behavior is grotesque, as if the air in this place is full of drugs, they have already been in the breath. Reasonable destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inbound, I also set up my own shop as a small casino, scarlet carpet, half-man high walnut wall, flower and bird silk wall covering, dark The velveteen and the curtains are wide and wide, and the tables and chairs are carved with grass blades. Naturally, there are also rare glass crystal lamps, nine zeniths, six-storied land, three pedestals... all of them are beautiful and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is even a vivid display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the middle of the store, in front of the Louis XIV Sun King’s Royal Book, I sat down with a guest, and it was “Stud”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the guest is a snow-white curly-green eyes dressed neatly old man, with a deep facial features and a serious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike his meticulous three-piece suit, I have only one long, thin, soft-colored dress, like a skirt, a skirt, and a pair of feet. Swing gently under the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already 4 cards in front of each other, 1 dark and 3 clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I opened the last clear card and watched him ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his own dark card, smiled slightly, and did not hurry to take out the bet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a brilliant blue diamond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oblate shape, as large as an apricot, deep in the eyes of the gods, the inexhaustible cutting surface diffuses the same uncountable sharp needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name "Hope". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a terrible force that is completely opposite to the name. The beautiful diamonds with the bluish fire seem to penetrate the evil spirits and full of murderousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This diamond weighs 112.25 carats and shines with glamour. Originally appeared in ancient India, at the end of the 14th century, it was set on the forehead of a statue of Lord Shiva. Once a young man had stolen it, he was then killed by the Brahman responsible for the guard. In the 17th century, a French missionary hacked two guards and stole it. After bringing it back to France, he was cut off on a rainy night. The blue diamond was still missing. 40 years later, it appeared again. In the hands of a jeweler, the merchant’s end is being killed by a mad dog. The diamond was re-honored in the hands of Louis XIV, named "Sapphire in the Crown", and Louis XIV was once worn to suffer from smallpox. Louis XV lends this strange stone to the mistress, and his mistress is beheaded in the French Revolution. Later, it was passed down to the couple of Louis XVI, but the Louis XVI couple were both sent to the guillotine, after which the diamond was sealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1830, the diamond was bought by the big banker Hope, but its weight had been reduced to 44.53 carats. This is called the Hope Diamond. When it was passed to the grandson, the bank closed down and was transferred to the owner after the auction. In 1908, he hoped that the diamond would be in the hands of Hamid II of Turkey. His wife and children went out to climb the cliff and died. The Sudan rewarded the blue diamond to the cronies, and the cronies were killed. The Sudan himself also stepped down in the military coup. Later, the blue diamonds crossed the ocean and were bought by American millionaire McLean. Soon after McLean's son died in a car accident, the daughter died of overdose of hypnosis. The seven-in-one was also completely bankrupted and died in the madhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last owner did not dare to save it and gave it to the Washington Smith Institute for professional appreciation analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took out a thin Citibank cash check, amounting to 100 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two opened the cards at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old gentleman is Red Heart A, Spades A, Brick A, Plum A, Plum K. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Red Heart A, Red Heart K, Red Heart Q, Red Heart J, Red Heart 10. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight Flush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled and reached out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is unmanned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is absolutely no red heart A in a set of cards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can't prove who If you cheating, then the two sides are equal. So follow the rules you have agreed with me... I won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently hold "Hope", my There is a very small light shining through the fingers, and it is a spark in the dark shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old gentleman’s eyes are terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could have got the money that ordinary people like him couldn’t get in his life, but he was not satisfied with it, he wanted to get back ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you really be confused by this magic charm? Or is humanity always so proud and greedy? Although the words are full of good words such as morality, reason, and piety... but seeing something that is attractive enough will not hesitate to rush directly. No matter the body and mind, the vigilance is not even as good as the fish before the bait. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old gentleman stopped talking and walked out the door silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of the store is a crossroads, the green light flashes, the vehicle is turbulent, but he sees it and sees it directly to the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the harsh brake sound,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least three cars hit, slip, grind, and pull His body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloody red jumped out of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, there is one more outstanding performance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled slightly. I am not interested in paying more attention to this scene, unfolding my fingers, holding the cute "hope" and putting it on my lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am so happy that you are as old as ever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to rest for 40 years. After self-destruction, I have not seen it for hundreds of years. I naturally love it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glazed blue diamond lies in the hand and seems to be faintly heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no hurry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will find a new owner for you soon... Listen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door The jade fish rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
