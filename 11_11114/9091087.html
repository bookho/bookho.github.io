			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as the fact that there is so much in the place where their eyes are not seen, they are Walking in the jungle, this is the most northwestern end of the silver-crowned jungle, and the farthest place that the power of the elves can reach. Like some metaphor, the silver crown wood, which has almost become a symbol of the Singer elves, can no longer occupy the position of the main tree species. Instead, spruce and fir have been growing here for hundreds or even thousands of years without being disturbed. They are towering into the clouds, the emerald green and the dark green leaves are criss-crossing, the sun shines through the narrow gaps, and casts a light-like light on the elves and humans... The squirrels and rabbits that they eat themselves because of the arrival of winter Shaking his tail in the snow, watching the creatures walking upright with vigilance; a black woodpecker with a red hat was unmoved - it accidentally found a larvae hiding many pine cones. The trunk, the strong and powerful crotch, is simply hitting the trunk all the time, squatting down another piece of feather-like sawdust, which is more efficient than the human iron chisel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jungle echoes the crisp and rhythmic percussion of the woodpecker, and even Leona can find its place, perhaps because it is loose The relationship between the larvae of the beetle, the spruce has withered more than half, the sun is shining on its light gray-brown scaly bark, and the black woodpecker is only twenty feet away from them. The place, the broken, white feats piled up in the roots of the tree. With the extraordinary vision, the elves and the wizards even stopped between them, and the action of a white insect swallowing the throat Seeing clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s arrogantly glanced at the stupid outsiders and continues to do their work, maybe some birds will Flying away in horror, but this black woodpecker is a smart and conceited guy who is sure he can fly away before the humans put their fingers on the bowstring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief’s fingers can’t help but feel itchy. He really wants to try. Although he doesn’t have a longbow, he always holds a silver coin, like him. The thief can hit a bird's eyes with his hard fingers within fifty feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when there is a druid in the team, it is better for him to control his fingers and killing **, Gülen regrets sighs In order to divert his attention, "How far is it from the snow cover swamp?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant looked at him, as if he had already seen the thief’s mind, "We are now in the high ground," he said briefly: "From the snow covered marsh There are probably about three hundred and fifty miles." As he said, the druid put his hand on the tree. He used to be an experienced ranger. He had already noticed the human left here in a short journey. Traces - Before he returned to the Silver Crown, it was still a place of inaccessibility. But this is the power of human beings. It’s amazing. It’s obviously a weak race. It’s better than a dwarf. It’s better than an orc, and it’s better than breeding. It’s like a natural darling and a powerful giant. The dragons are in the same breath, but they are struggling to survive, and in just a few thousand years they have become the largest number of races on the continent. Their footprints are everywhere they can reach, and the wealth they gather is like a river. And the power of their faith is as solid and long as the Longji Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves calculated that if they don't use the power of magic, they may take three days, or four days before they can enter the snow cover swamp, but after entering the snow cover swamp, they can't say that it is safe. He didn't forget them for the first time. The things that happened when crossing the snow cover swamp, but he has already confirmed with Kerry Ben, they are going through the most dangerous and quaint part of the entire swamp, there will be no caravans there, if Be sure to say what they will encounter, most likely to be the enemy who is tracking them - not to say that this is a comforting answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the opposite, if those people would let them go all the way to the last legacy of the metal dragon - the chance is simply not better than Birdwin Believing in Tyre and changing to serve Mask is much lower, and Gülan certainly has no expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They spent the night in the jungle, except for a few daring squirrels who asked for their food, there was no uninvited guest coming to disturb, < Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking a little hot eucalyptus wine and eating a few pieces of rattan powder, the adventurers gathered in their biggest tent, hanging at the top of the tent A white fluorspar, the light from this color of fluorite will make people feel cold, but it is best for reading and viewing the map - a map drawn by an elf in the tent's fine felt Expanding on the child, this is the most complete and largest and most detailed map that the soul of the alien world has seen since coming here. It covers the entire continent and its surrounding islands and oceans. From the map, the whole The mainland is like a broken disk. The spattered pieces and soup are the islands surrounding it and the isolated land. The elves paint different large areas in different colors, from the white north. The sea begins, and the sea in the extreme north is the black night sea. Under the night sea is the broken bone coast. Below the broken bone coast is the Wuthering Plain. Below the Wuther Plain is the Longji Mountains running through the northern part of the continent. The silver-crowned jungle is depicted as a silvery silver jungle extending from the north side of the mountain to the south wing of the mountain. But it does not cover the entire mountain range. It can only be said to occupy about one-third of the west side. On the east side is the highland Norman. The highland Norman can be said to be an extension of the Longji Mountains, both highlands and In the plains, Luther, ruled by the Grand Duke of Luzer, is adjacent to it from the bottom half. There are many sporadic small countries and territories around them. The hills are already southerly. It is like The longest tail feather stretched out like the pheasant-like Lutheran Principality. Even so, as long as you can see it, its area is not inferior to any small country, and the hills are down. The giant sea otters that we are familiar with are located in the southern part of the country, but the largest of them cannot compete with the area of ​​the hills in the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar’s line of sight rests on a piece of color like a bright pearl, which is another branch of the Elves, the Emerald Island of the Aya Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where his other half is located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but only for a few years now, the soul of the outside world is not the real Cremal, after all, his vision quickly moved to the south side of the island. The outline of the flame is like a dragon-shaped island that is erupted by a dragon. The island looks like a nail and looks like a snapping turtle. Compared to the Longhuo Islands, the Azores on the left hand side. It is necessary to be neat and vast, and it is said that it is an archipelago. In fact, the main island where Gülen is located at the tip of the port is the center of gravity. The surrounding small islands can only be regarded as breadcrumbs falling from the bread. There is a vast expanse of red sea between the Azores and the Seventy-seven Islands. This ocean is periodically turned into a dark red blood like a solid blood because of the growth of a red seaweed. The seventy-seven archipelago is probably an elf. The most unclear places we can draw, many islands are just a square marked with black spots. The real island certainly does not have such a regular outline. The soul of the outer world is combined with other places for a while. It was discovered that this is a graphical representation of the elves that they have not been closely explored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Sea is a dull twilight, and the Grenada between the Seventy-seven Islands and the Azores is smeared by the elves. One reddish red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- That is because Grenada is constantly expanding. The lich said. This map may be older than Kerry's, and there are many changes in the country and region. If you look closely, you can see that there are traces of correction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- It was originally just a seaside city-state, and the Lich continued to see that it was going to turn into a dark brown dot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application of layers is of course not because the elves are not elaborate enough, but this way can clearly distinguish whether a country is in a hurry by the depth of the color. The land expands and shrinks, the elves of the silver-crowned jungle are not as greedy as humans, but they need to protect their own people, protect the silver-crowned jungle, the countries around the jungle, and the dangerous and evil like Grenada. The country has always been their first target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——How long does it take to expand to the present level? The soul of the alien world is not without conviction. Compared with the original, Grenada is simply growing himself into a watermelon from a cute little watermelon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--A thousand years. The Lich said that the Great Holocaust was a war between the gods and the gods, but inevitably, all the countries were in chaos. No one noticed when a red dragon decided to settle in Greiner. When Dahe reached an agreement with the city owner at that time, people only saw that it suddenly and rapidly rose with the help of the Red Dragon. The small countries and city-states around were not the opponents of the dragons and the warlocks. The flames took their subjects. They burned their palaces and took their lives... If the gods were able to respond to the pastor’s cry, maybe the development of the matter would not be out of control, but then they were fighting each other happily – who How about going to care for mortals? Anyway, in time, these weak little lives will multiply to an irritating level. In short, when all the dust settles, the things that the gods least valued become what they need most to value, they suddenly discover This plane has become quite strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the gods are not allowed to directly intervene in the war of the main material plane, they begin to find and comfort their followers. The problem is that in that great catastrophe, almost all the priests of the gods are not one, let alone a few new gods, even their holy names are rarely known, and wait until their pastor and holy When he was able to return to this land, Grenada has become a huge empire. Its territory is full of red-scaled dragons and warlocks with red robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone wants to beg the metal dragons to help, but unfortunately, they found that the metal dragons disappeared and their nests were closed. Abandoned, sunk into the sea or pushed into the lava, buried in the quicksand, all the changes are newly produced, perhaps when they find the abandoned nest, the soil above has not grown enough grass to cover this There is no place in the place, no one can see or hear the sudden loud noise when there is a battle between the dragons, and no acid and flame leave scars on the stones and the land. They disappear so quietly. Abandoning this plane, it went without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——So now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The present gods are not as leisurely as they were a thousand years ago, but their pastors and paladins do their best to control this behemoth and further engulf the surrounding The land and the country, but in a country, the most is the warlock, they can play a small role, but at least let those countries support for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich lets the souls of the opposite world look around a few blue and brown patches around the reddish area, they are like clusters The leaves of the "watermelon" are unkempt and complicated, but they can still be seen as a fairly good solid chain. They are also the high ground where they are located. The country and territory here are more messy than the southern countries. Some countries can only be said to be a city, while a city-state may be a union of a dozen cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most noteworthy is that the pillar highland is a basin-side highland, and its edge is a snow-covered marsh. The shape of the snow-covered marsh is like a plant with soft stems and lush foliage. Its roots are deeply implanted. Between the Longji Mountains and the West Column Heights, it is an unprecedented huge water mooring. It is said that all the fresh water sources in the west side of the mainland are from this, and then the strong stems sticking out to the early morning light, the stems are curved. Stretching down the countless branches, the branches are covered with fine leaves - but it can also be said to be a beautiful band hanging outside the silver-crowned jungle, hanging with countless treasure beads, this band is in the Starlight River The location was abruptly cut, but extended on the other side by a width and length of several hundred miles and assembled into several lakes. If you want to compare them, they are like the fruits of the branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time they crossed the snow covered marsh was through the "fruit", but this time they have to go through the most dense places of "leaves and leaves". Even from the map, it can be seen that the width between the two is almost twice as much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we go through the villages and cities?" Li Oona muttered, "Before entering the snow cover swamp?" She did not delay or escape. Meaning, but thinking that it will take so long in a white, ridiculous, ridiculous place, a normal human wants to look at the color more, talk to people, feel the warm bed and the closed house. It is also a very normal thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is for sure." Perant said: "Maybe we can see the farmer or the hunter as soon as we walk out of the jungle."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant is quite right, but in addition to the farmer and the hunter, they also saw the knights from the castle. As far as Birdwin’s sharp eyes are concerned, these knights, regardless of equipment and martial arts, Or the morality can't be compared with a Thunderbolt soldier, because when they meet, they are tormenting a few black-footed halflings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s probably difficult for ordinary humans to distinguish between a halfling and a dwarf, and the dwarf, but the most beautiful of the three is the gnome, the black foot. Halflings may be more annoying than the average halfling because of their relationship in the swamp. Their skin is dark brown, like a scale like a crack - in fact, it's just the dirt they apply to the body, in order to Resist the insect bites, like crocodiles and hippos, but even if they have a smooth white skin, their facial features and facial bones are enough to reduce the score until the pass, they have a frog-like face, the mouth is strangely prominent The eyes bulged, making people wonder if they would pop a pink split tongue at the next moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
