			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Claw Knight gasps and raises the short sword. He is almost close to the dead elf. After the battle is over, the nervous nerve finally allows him to find himself. The sense of smell, he frowned, because he smelled a sting that made him unbearable. “It’s like boiled manure,” he muttered, shaking his head incredulously. Although the Grenada was always a deadly enemy because the red dragon and the elf had always been, the blood of the elf was always dull and stinky. But a dragon-claw knight can't help but know that this is just an attitude. In fact, as the darling of the god of life, the blood of the elves is more vibrant and pure than the blood of dwarves, humans or gnomes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it because of the relationship between the Singer elves eating meat? But it shouldn't be stinking into an orc. The dragon-claw knight climbed up unbearably. When he touched the back of the dead elf, he felt furry, not like hair, but like hair, but he looked down. When I went there, I saw a hair like a gold, which was a bit bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow neck saw an elf warrior on the battlefield, this should not be, but he is obviously very strong, because he just killed one Orc warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but are these elves also riding like the Grinada? The yellow neck is not very clear, but he can't hold too much in his simple mind, and the things that the elves ride on seem to be different from those of humans. Well, the Grenada people are riding with fear. Dragons, and the elves seem to be riding just some... What he doesn't know, just in terms of shape, looks like a sheep with two hooves. He likes sheep, but prefers elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc licked his lips, and when the elf knocked down one of his peers, he threw his short axe and the axe swung in the air. , making a whistling sound, followed by the yellow neck, lifting the dagger in the elf, slap on the side of the short axe, and hit the short axe, followed by the yellow neck and lifted the spear, hands tight The grip, even with himself, crashed into the other's arms, the initial touch made the orcs want to curse, because the elves did not wear the chain armor as the Grenada people said, or even the chain, the chain The hard part of the chest is also added with hard steel, but the strength and kinetic energy of the orcs still stab the spear, the elf screams, and the weight of the orc crushes him, and the yellow neck uses all the strength. On the spear, he gritted his teeth and looked at him. The prey under the spear struggled. His short sword was cut on the yellow neck, but the yellow neck was an orc warrior. He had Gersh like Grinada. The leather armor that comes from blackmail, the defensiveness of this leather armor is not even lower than that of black iron. It's tough and can eliminate a large part of external shocks - such as this can not be found to combat the focal point of the yellow-necked though they feel pain, but not enough to make him give up about to hand prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Claw Knight is confused, even if he knows that it is not a time of confusion, but his horror cannot be described in words, hidden in the branches and leaves. In the meantime, the elf who attacked him actually took a short spear belonging to the Dragon Tooth Legion. He certainly recognized that all the weapons in the Grenada’s army had the imprint of the dragon, perhaps it could be explained. Cheng was captured or stolen, but in addition to the lingering smell, he smelled the dementia dragon skin. Can anyone know more about the smell of the deinonychus than him? Even if the elves catch the Deinonychus, they will not hang the skin of this evil monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His vision was blurred for a while, he tried to see the enemy’s face, but the face was always covered by fog, he was like In a nightmare, wait, maybe he...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Claw Knight uses his last strength to reach out and put it on that abominable face. The flame bursts from his hand, and something burns up. Under the light of the flame, he finally sees the semi-melting face. It has nothing to do with the elf. It is the face of the orc! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to yell and want to warn his companion and the red dragon, even if he is not a warlock, nor a pastor, but he also knows that they may Already caught up in the despicable traps of the elves, they are not fighting the elves, but fighting their own allies and the orcs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately his mind broke down here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neck of the yellow neck burned, and the last blow of the dragon claws of Grenada was not to be underestimated, and the flame spread from his head to him. The shoulders and arms, chest, he is like a torch set on the dragon claw knight, burning like it until it is ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See it?" The red dragon who supervised the war suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired dragon looks down, and a small elf is withdrawing from the center of the fierce battle toward the edge of Wang Ting. Their speed is not very fast. But the Grenada people encountered have almost no room for resistance: "Do you have someone you are familiar with?" Red Dragon asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am familiar with everyone here," the dark-haired dragon said respectfully: "And understand them - for Gredor."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Dragon smiled and said: "Of course, for Gredi, why not?" It stretched out a paw: "Then you can go see you." Friends, I hope they don't be too surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black hair dragon back gives it an evil smile, bows to the red dragon, walks On the edge of the stony platform, a sharp call was made. It took only two or three breaths. A whole body was dark, and the human face lion that had nothing to do with goodness was flapping its wings. In the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I saw it for the first time," said the red dragon, holding the lower jaw and saying, "The human face of this color is a lion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like this color, my dear Red Dragon," said Keo. "It’s much better than those that are like eggs or chrysanthemums."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon laughed and slammed the ground: "You have this very interesting mount, after you come back," he said: "I have to ask How do you get together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are a pair of heavenly creations, even if they are separated by a thousand miles, they can still feel each other's attraction." The dragon said that it caused another red laugh. "Go," said it. "With the elves' ears, it's a good decoration. I will put them together into a round light hanging in the center of my nest."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keou made a face under the cover of black and black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesh is surrounded by two priests, as well as the most refined and brave warriors in the Blizzard tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are filled with irritating shouts, screams and crying in their ears. It’s hard to imagine that the elves will be as noisy as humans, but it seems It didn't hinder their combat power. The form of the battlefield was peculiarly caught in a stalemate. It was so violent that Gersh was so furious that until now, he did not see a Grinada appear on the battlefield. No, no one, no knights, no warlocks, no mounts, they are like disappearing, throwing the entire enemy of the jungle to the orcs - maybe the orcs think this is a good thing, no matter How to say, all the spoils are owned by them. Only Gersh feels heart cramps when he sees the orcs falling down one by one. These are not the old and weak women and women who can be used to consume, but the last and true of the orcs. The power, he was worried, whether the Grenada people planned to steal the fruit after they lost both the spirit and the elf. Gush could not imagine, if it was, the orcs still had no And get out of Grenada's Third Army war ...... once orcs soldiers here wreck and exhausted, they stay in Humble similar Heights Norman only to be driven back to human whistling plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, how many years does the orcs have to restore their original strength, one hundred years, two hundred years, or five hundred years, one thousand years? There are not many orc tribes on the plains. Gersh has such a moment of regret that he forced the merger of all the big tribes, but his heart is hardened. He did not make a mistake, if not, he has a luxury. The gods, they now have half of the Highlands of Norman, and there will be more after that... and if the orcs eventually die here, then they can only be said to be the will of the orc god Kay, and this god The will of the beggar has never been recovered. This is an orc that cannot be rebellious and rebellious. This is still not his fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they walked through the towering silver crown to a wider area, the priests suddenly jumped up and screamed and cast In the magic of the stick, the magic light illuminates in the gloomy environment, making Gersh’s eyes feel stinging, and before that, he has reacted agilely and tumbling, which makes him lucky to escape. After a robbery, the two orcs behind him were cut off by the invisible wind blade, the neck and the arm, and even a priest’s chest left a deep cut, but he just lowered his head and sprinkled it. With the powder, the wound healed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
