			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesh sits on the black iron throne, "I have to melt it," he said as he stroked the armrest that was cast into a bear claw. Feasting more than Morton Don Clay and Birdwin Don Cray, and in the halls of hundreds of Thunderbolt lords before, the hearth is still burning, but the smell and gray smoke can make a sense of smell Normal people vomit, the beasts are sensitive, but they are not only used to, but also like this smell, because this smell means they have rich and favorite food - that is, human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the bones that have been sucked and cleaned by the marrow are thrown directly into the flame, only to hear a bang, and then the grease attached to it creaks. The bones become dark and gray - in any winter before, this is considered too extravagant, except for a few orc warriors, priests and tribal chiefs, most of the bones are also to be crushed. Swallowed, but now they have food. After the monsters invaded the king, as soon as the warlocks said, one after the other, the belly bursted, and the fresh flesh and blood flowed out from the inside, flushing away the acid etching liquid. It’s still delicious – some young orcs who can’t get the samurai treatment are collecting this meat. They are not qualified to hunt in the wilderness of this stone like the orthodox orc warrior. The orc warriors rely on keenness. The nose, looking for and capturing those humans - more fat and delicate meat than the slaves they had previously exchanged from merchants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will also be weakly resisted, but here are all the orc warriors that Gesh annihilated dozens of large and small tribes, they may not It is a tribe, but it is a slave to King Geshe. They are not allowed to fight each other, but also respond to the call of their companions, so there are only a handful of human beings who can escape the catastrophe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Gersh heard a sudden commotion outside, and then he saw his priest hurriedly let go of a girl's arm. I ran over: "Is my warriors coming up for the meat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have a lot of meat now," said the priest: "Yes Those hypocritical white robes. They hid humans and hid them in their rooms and halls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesh looks at Rica, and red The robe warlock just made a gesture of powerlessness. "This is not within the scope of the covenant. Gersh is kneeling down." He said, with a smile that made Geshe's claws tickle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can add remuneration," Gersh rudely pulled the symbol of the Norman kingdom from the bottom of his butt: "How is this?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rica is obviously heart-warming, but I am sorry, even if the young Red Dragon Lady can’t cross the sky, he won’t try it, “No,” he With a very obvious eagerness to look at the sight: "I can't do it. But." He said: "You have nothing to do with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't The young red dragon can't move because the red dragon doesn't want to attract too much attention. Of course, although the believers get the answer that Gredi is the god of birth and marriage, both of these priests can be said to be Froor robbed her, she has not yet been able to obtain the final recognition - the Greinada people can wage war, can kill mortals, can invade the territory of the enemy, but they can not destroy or smash the temple and sanctuary, unless Rydi is ready to become an enemy with that god, but the orc and beast card This luxury almost no trouble, anyway beast God kau luxury enemies already more than enough to destroy the beast God kau luxury residence hostile gods of this world will be rewarded this cruel gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geshe certainly knows that he is just trying to extort more things from the Grenada people, "then to the respected Kau "A gift for luxury," said Gersh, "in order to thank him for the victory he has given us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is said that in order to thank Kawu luxury for the protection of the orcs, In Wang Tingzhong, the orcs have "organized" a very large altar - they removed cloves and other trees, slaughtered innocent humans directly on the gray-yellow rocky ground and black soil, and blood flowed into the gaps of the slate or The soil, the air filled with bloody suffocation and a thick visceral smell, the priest walked over and the blood did not pass his feet. He passed the meaning of Gersh to several other priests—perhaps Kay Luxury had been watching them, and they quickly responded, and they poured their spirits into the buckskins that they kept the poisonous insects, and the bugs screamed and crawled. Out, the body is three times bigger than before, and even the orc's hand is difficult to hold after the wings are opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worms flew directly into the enemy's sanctuary and temple under the command of the master. At first, people thought that it was a bird, and waited until they saw what it was. Already people have been bitten by them - almost all children, the needles of the poisonous insects are like a thin and long dagger, from the top of the head, from the back, from the arm, the child's body immediately swollen and becomes pale - Because their blood is almost sucked clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
