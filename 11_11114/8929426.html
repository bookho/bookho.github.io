			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white face of the otter stands upright, and the two claws, like gloves, are held on the chest, and they slammed crisply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima immediately turned the fish in a direction and stuffed it into his mouth. These small fish were in the cave where he accumulated from the river. The catch is that the adult fish is only as long as the fingers. Under the thin scales, it is fat and clean fat. After applying a small amount of salt and winter honey, it can be baked directly on the slate to make it sizzling. - Whether it's an elf, a half-elves, a scorpionfish or a otter, I love this special little snack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a druid who respects nature, Perrin, the manager of Gray Ridge, disapproves of giving animals things that are not in their recipes. The problem is I am afraid that it is difficult for someone to face the "threat" of a otter family and they are indifferent. Their eyes are always black and bright, more beautiful than polished gems, chubby body, smooth fur is tempting to reach out all the time. Going to touch - they are also very smart. If Cremari opens his hands and says that he is not carrying food, the husband of the otter will catch the fish and the snake and put it in front of him - certainly not asking him to taste the sashimi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When your children grow up," said Kremar, when they gave them a small dried fish, "There is no such discount."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that the leeches, at least the white-faced otter is able to understand his words, because he just got a bite after he finished - since he discovered this half After the skin of the elf was much thicker than the snake and the bony fish, the otter found a new way of protest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima paused for a while, ensuring that the small fish did not hinder himself from speaking until he stood up slowly, as the otter warned, behind him Standing with Perant, and Raven, the hair that curled up in the sun is as soft and bright as a rose, wearing the corolla of a silver-crowned tree, wearing a dark green silk robes - it is like a summer The river or the jungle directly grabbed a pair of clean water or a leaf. She took a short mage ceremony and then gently embraced the black hair caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otter looked at them and talked with Perant in a sly manner. They talked for a while, and the complexity allowed the souls from the outside world to be born. Strong curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you talking about?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is asking if Rivin is your spouse," Perant said, then gently holding Ruiwen's arm and letting her return to her side: "I told him not, Ruiwen is my spouse." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otter screamed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He asked if you have a spouse," Perant said, and he replied with a short scream. "You don't have a spouse, are you?" Asked Crimmar, but his expression shows that he knows this problem is superfluous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I told him you are still a child," Perant added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otter turned to look at Crimal and then bowed his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" It said that even the Druids could hear the excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," said Kremar, "This bastard is laughing at me, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Perant laughed: "Yes," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?" Kremar said if It was a year ago that he might think that Perant was just walking around, but he noticed that both Perant and Ruiwen could be said to be dressed in formal. The elves are rich, smart, and tasteful, but they never pile gold, gems and embroidery on their bodies like humans. Their dresses are always simple and elegant. When festivals, ceremonies, or friends and enemies that are worthy of attention, they will wear jewels like armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant chose a silver-gray robes with a white-bellied spider silk and a mysterious silver thread, narrow collar, no embroidery and dark flowers, but these only need The original texture of the fabric, like the melting metal, is enough to make up for it, not to mention that he also wears a large aquamarine collar with a scorpion, its color is right with his eyes, and a gemstone ring worn on his hand. be consistent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager of the Grey Ridge leaned over and said goodbye to the waters. Yes, at least this sentence Kreima can still remember, though It sounds very different from other buzz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me," Perant asked. "Do you know anything about Norman in the Highlands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Our ally?" Crimmar replied While speculating on the roots of Perant’s questioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ruler of Norman Norman sent his messenger," Perant said - with a precious gift and an invitation: "He invited us before Go to the triumphal style that will be held in Wangdu - the triumphal style for Baldwin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar surprised and hesitantly raised his eyebrows The tragic battle of a month ago can only be said that Norman’s human beings have escaped and the Thunderbolt has not. It has lost thousands of soldiers, knights and nearly half of the people. Birdwin’s Tang Cray has tens of thousands. The most evidenced possession of the orc's body, but he is also at fault, and is a big mistake; in addition, the final victory does not come from his bravery or wisdom, at most, he and his decisive can bring a little bit small Connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry," Perant said: "But without you, we feel that you should take a good rest for a while - compared to humans, I think You are more willing to look at the little otter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt," said Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But another messenger insists on adding you to the list of travellers - he is the Duke of John."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant stopped and turned to look at Crimall: "Do you remember the knight? He played for Prince Thun, Prince Thun, the Duke of John, although he hated the Prince. The title - his illegitimate child is said to have been assassinated by the thief Gülen, and your testimony allowed the thief to get rid of torture and defamation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The black hair's caster nodded calmly: "Okay, I will go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry and Krimall met Baldwin in the outer city of Wangdu - he had not even been able to step into his home just six hundred feet away, although he would like to see Pan Ni, but the king's messenger and ceremonial officer forbids him to do this. He must enter with his knights and soldiers at the dawn of the next day, when the first morning light falls on the mouth of the king's wall.  All. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel like I am a clown or a juggling one." Birdwin complained: "But my Majesty warned me that if I don't do Thunder, I won't get new knights and soldiers."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He showed Kerry Ben and Kremar the armor he wore when he entered the kingdom - the king gave him last night, he had to work hard to curb his own mouth. The impulse, this armor is even more gorgeous than the one the Prince Knight once wore. It is no exaggeration to say that the pattern carved and etched on it is more and more complicated than the embroidery on the woman's skirt, which is the most unbearable for him. Yes, in order to make this armor look old and vicissitudes, the craftsmen skillfully carried out the old treatment with acid and mud. "If there is an orc who knocks on such an axe," he said: "It will be like a porcelain bottle." It was knocked and shattered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with this armor, there is also a cloak of jellyfish skin, the surface is pure black thick satin, embroidered with gold and silver thread Don Cree’s coat of arms and the name of Birdwin, of course, the pearl and Stone, "It's too long." Birdwin said: "On the battlefield, it can stumble more than a dozen war horses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how much Bedwin Dissatisfied, he can't defy the king's will after all, and he also knows the true purpose of his best friend and the owner who is loyal to him - although he also thinks that the king's thoughts are somewhat weird, but Highland Norman is his country, he Have the right to decide to hand the scepter in his hand to his brother or his daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin does not want the Duke of John to become the new king of Norman in the Highlands, because Princess Diane and Dylan, the Duke of John never hugged Birdwin There has been a goodwill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——When you enter the king, you need to go through a long road. They walk on foot, and Birdwin is at the forefront, while Kerry Ben and Cray Mar followed, when they came to the sun, the people of Wangdu cheered and thundered, and the bells roared. The white, purple, and purple cloves poured down like blizzard, and the petals fell in the golden morning light. , paved the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin extended his hand with iron gloves and caught one, sniffing happily and carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" Today’s non-rotating alien soul said: "I am familiar with this scene."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have a triumphal world in your world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
