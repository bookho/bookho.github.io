			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the Giant Mountain tribe is caught in fury and fear, and he finds himself coming to a wasteland with only dust and wind - he looks up at the sky, the sky It was a thick black, with no stars or clouds. He looked down at the ground. There was only white dust like ashes on the ground. The wind blew on his body like a sawtooth knife cutting his skin. He was cold and hungry. When he raised his hand, he found that he had lost his crutches and clothes. He trembled like never before, and he looked around hard, looking for a companion, or an enemy trail, but No matter how he looks, the eyes that used to find a trace of a lemming in a thousand feet in the past are like being covered with a fog. There are several shadow images that pass from the edge of his vision. It disappeared quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know how long he had gone, but when he heard the sound of a heavy carriage driving fast, the priest almost instinctively put himself Hidden, although it is almost impossible, because he is still a huge frost giant, and this piece of wasteland has no stones over the palm of his hand, but he is very lucky, the driver and carriage in the carriage Before the hunter found him, an agile and elegant figure caught their attention, they reversed the original direction and eagerly chased it up. There was a cry in the wind, the voice mixed in the wind, almost no different from the wind, but everyone who heard them couldn't help but start shaking - and, what kind of carriage is that! It looks three times bigger than the mankind's favorite open-top cart. It is assembled from a variety of bones. The bones are unclear and unclear. They look like semi-solidified blood. It is a rotten internal organs. Only the wheels are black iron. There are one or more broken limbs fixed on the spokes. The dragging of the big car is the nightmare of smoke, the nightmare of the flames, and driving They are a humanoid monster with a black body. He has a wolf face like a peeling skin. The lips and nose are pulled forward, like a long kiss. His eyes flash in the dim light. The hand can hang down to the ground, and the legs and feet are twice as long as humans, and they are reflexed like birds. The fingers and toes are stretched like branches, with claws, especially worth mentioning. They are covered with thorn-like spikes, heads with no hair, arms, legs and knees, extending from the spine to the tip of the tail. These spikes are erected with some rhythm that is incomprehensible to ordinary people. Up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horses did not have a lot of galloping, the hunters crouching on the carriage (they looked like a white cock with a fat abdomen) caught Their prey, it is a beautiful human female, the huge "螳螂" ruthlessly stabbed her abdomen with a spear in her hand, lifted her back and threw it into the carriage, this time the giant of the frost The priest found that the carriage was full of humans, orcs, and there was a giant at the bottom, but they all seemed to be breathless, and there was no power to confront these looters. Some of them even became distorted, and the carriages The body sticks together and even has the tendency of assimilation. If the "螳螂" find the latter situation, they will use their own spears to separate the carriage and the body of the prey. The whole process is bloody and mournful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the priest wanted to go further, the spiked scorpion seemed to have discovered another prey. A calm human being suddenly appeared in the dust of the sky, like a gem. Light, but before the carriage was restarted, after a moment of confusion, he did not hesitate to rush in one direction. As far as the priests seemed, there was no difference between that place and other places, but it was like a breeze wrapped in moonlight. After scorning, the human being suddenly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunters were obviously resentful. They waved their arms and spears and frantically tortured their prey. The priest saw the head of the human female. Rolling to the ground, but after picking it up and hanging it at the tip of the spear, it can also blink and tear, and lick its lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest suddenly understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is already dead, and here is the mourning of the wilderness that almost all the dead will inevitably pass. The devout believers can obtain the guidance and containment of the deities, but fall. Unbelievers and false believers can only sway in the wilderness, waiting for them only two roads, as the priests just saw, captured by the hunters of the bottomless abyss, sent to the devil or the devil to squeeze the soul Every point in the energy, and then in the depths of the bottomless abyss was transformed into a worm-like inferior; and there is an ugly ornament on the wall of the Eternal City built by the death god Klanwo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the Jushan tribe did not even know when he came to the front of the god of death, Clauwo, as the legend described, he kept His own appearance as a human being, body shape and clothing - a weather-stricken, sloping face, dressed in a leather jacket and chain armor commonly found in warriors, half covered with a dark black cloak, he ruled that the priest is a false believer, And his soldiers caught the shoulders of the Frost Giant. He knew that he would be fixed on the wall, painfully and longly rotted and forgotten, but even if there was a finger-sized bone, he would not be free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," he shouted. "No, this is an unfair judgment! I am the priest of Kausuk! It is a great and powerful orc. "God's followers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are a devout believer," said Frank Lavaux, "So why didn't you hear your god? Summon and shout you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the venerable Kawu is drinking the blood of an enemy," the priest said. "The blood of the enemy is The most mellow wine, just give me some time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we may be able to ask the orc god Kawu luxury." Ke Lanwo said that although his voice was low, he echoed in the hall of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, perhaps in the next moment, an image that has been dedicated to the priests countless times is projected into the palace of Cranbo, he looks like A very impatient orc, but taller than the Frost Giant, his fangs bulge like a wild boar, and the skin presents a strange and quirky turquoise, starting from the head, to The ankles are covered with an old, dark black iron armor, and the armor is scarred. There is a hole in the center of the helmet, and a flashing eye can be seen from the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you admit that this Frost Giant is your believer, your priest, your follower?" Ke Lanwo asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest looked at the hope with hope, but Kawu was just bored and gave him a look: "No, I don't have such a priest."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest shouted, but the projection of Kawu’s luxury had disappeared, and before the command was issued again, the priest shouted again, “Ulu Tiru "He shouted," Ulu Tiru, ​​all the Frost Giants are his people, let him come, let him come, he will recognize me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this is what you want," Klanwo said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another god's projection appears in the temple of the god of death, with more features of the frost giant on his face and body, but compared to the card Wu Xuan, the atmosphere surrounding him is much calmer and more stable. His eyes are like the sea of ​​the sun in the sun. Although it is cold, it is full of vitality. He holds a cane, but with the priest's crutches. Compared to this piece of wood cut from the birch tree, there is no decoration, it looks unremarkable, and the clothes of Wulou Tiru are the same, just an ordinary white robes, and the feet are ****, compared to one Warrior, he is more like a scholar who needs to be white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you admit that this Frost Giant is your believer, your priest, your follower?" Kramer repeated the previous question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wulou Tiru looked at the priest of the Frost Giant, perhaps as short as the one before Kao, but the priest felt that this eye was hundreds of years old. So long, when Ulu Tiru shook his head to Clanwo, his heart was like being dug out and immersed in the sea of ​​the never-night sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the priest also knew that Ulu Tiru would not admit it. When Ulu Tiru was not sleeping, there were many Frost Giants who refused to believe in him, although they survived under the wing of Wulou Tiru, ​​but Wu The teachings of Lou Tiru do not conform to the nature of the Frost Giant (or the nature of all giants). Wulou Tiru does not allow them to kill the cubs and mothers, nor does it allow for simple decoration or to show off other creatures. Even more involuntary massacres and wars, compared to the Kaussian who loves blood and death, he is a cup of tasteless warm water for the Frost Giants - after Ulu Tilu suddenly fell into a deep sleep, among his followers Even a frost giant can't see it. What's more, in order to be able to flatter Ka's luxury, the Frost Giant's priests have directed the Frost Giants to attack the Aratial igloos and kill their children. The women who plundered them and hung the followers of the incompetent Wulou Tiru in the wind to make the dried meat. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; but when the frost giants priests were nailed to the walls of the Eternal City time, although mourning wilderness winds are like sword thrusts his In the throat, he was still mad and desperately screaming. He laughed at Ulu Tiru, ​​cursing Kawu, and exhausted every murmur and vocabulary he knew. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ---------------------------------- ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand doesn’t know how he woke up in a valley, but around Since there is only ice and snow except ice and snow, it means that he has a great possibility of still in the sea of ​​the north. He rubbed his thumb and held it in the air. He found that there is only a very small wind, and the temperature can even be said to be suitable. - Compared to the ice sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Frost Giant’s priest walked into the valley steadily, Gülen had already hid himself, and the once-unsuccessful Frost Giant looked like Not too good, or can be said to be very bad. Although he has eyes, his eyes seem to be unable to see anything at all - his crutches are only ten feet away from him, but he does not look at it; his arm And legs and legs, but as far as the thieves are concerned, they are simply cumbersome for the current Frost Giants, because they are constantly hitting the ice. "It looks very painful." The thief yelled in his heart, but he quickly realized this. The Frost Giant priest may have fallen into a real illusion. He stroked the dagger in his arms. It was feverish and trembling, eager for life and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait." Gülen said to the dagger that if it was just an ordinary frost giant, he would not reject the proposal of the beheading, but it was a frost giant. The priest, the follower of Kawu luxury, in Lei Biao, he has been in close contact with these colorful guys, their deaths will not be as quiet and silent as mortals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
