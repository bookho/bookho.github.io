			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really don't want to see you here."The soul of the opposite world<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every place has evil and darkness, and Grenada is just a little more."If it is the young pastor who is still calm under the wings of his father and mentor, of course it is impossible to produce such an idea, but standing here is a lot of torment and hardships.He lost his father and brother in the night, and on the same day he was murdered by his other brother to kill his loved ones. He was taken away from Rosada because of his dereliction of duty. He was Branded, exiled, and fate seems to feel that he is not cruel enough - his companions and mentor are ruthlessly swallowed by the wolves, he left the elf's shelter and wandered around, almost no place is willing to accept him, because of his The face marked his crimes, even those villagers who couldn't even understand a letter would drive him out because of the ugly scars - and finally he came to Thunder Fort, which was ridiculously cold, but maybe it was Because its conditions are so bad, people there have instead tolerated in other places. Yadel could not get Rosada’s response by prayer or other means, but he learned from the tutor. Knowledge allows him to identify every herb that is silent in the wilderness. He will not only collect them, but also cultivate them. Humans don’t believe him. He can also give injured birds. They treatment, as well as those who have been cast aside criminalsEveryone knows that they were sent to Thunder for the last value of their existence. Even if they were injured, they could not get treatment. Yadel’s herbs saved more than one life.Next, it’s the guards, soldiers, and ordinary craftsmen of these criminals... When I met Cremari in Thunder, Yadell was already an undisputed part of Thunder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him unable to stand by while the people in Thundersburg were in trouble. He led the sorrowful people and took them out of the film. It can take away all the wilderness of life, but perhaps because of this, the true master of Thunder, the former lord Bywin never had trust and goodwill to himself. This, Yadel can understand, anyway, these are It is his people - in addition to this, Birdwin may still have some inferiority. When he was in Thunder, a simple instrument would allow the people of Thunderbolt to give up their home and go far away. There is no doubt. Hesitant, he is so sublime, and he is deeply trusted and respected. But here, he even borrowed from his friends to rent the land of his people. Even if he had a grain of sand, he did not arbitrarily squander and deal with it. s rightThis makes him frustrated. Without a doubt, it is conceivable that when he discovers that the loyal and loved people of Thunder Castle are exiled and chased because of this, they can’t do anything but they can only rely on one that is rejected by Rosada. When the priest struggled to survive, how angry he would be with his incompetence...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Yadell was on the first day of the Longhuo Islands I handed over all the rights in my hands. Anyway, he is not very keen on rights. To be honest, if the White Tower has not had such terrible things, he may have become a mediocre and gentle pastor of Rosada. Like the adult colleagues, they collect the admiration of the girl like a flower, enjoy the youth and love, and live their life peacefully under the glory of Rosada.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it is possible that he will die in another situation, even if there is no Demon, no ampoule, as the gray ridge of the elf is tightly connected The hub, the White Tower still can't escape the tentacles of the "fine net" guild, and all they can do is drive these dirty mice out, whether as a member of the White Tower's Rosada Sanctuary. As the nephew of the consul, a member of the White Tower resident, he will do this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just... I’m thinking of this, Yadel couldn’t help but sigh, he’s a pastor, and of course it’s so painful to know how to abandon the gods he’s following. Things - he did not think of atonement when he was on the way to exile, and in the thunderstorm's change to help those in need, please forgive his humbleness, but Yadel never thought his crimes could be redeemed, Even if he has been recognized by the god of morning light - but these things, young and ignorant Yadel does not understand, has it gone so much, saw so much, and heard so many Yadel still can't understand? Their negligence and indulgence of their peers enshrine the glory of Rosada with an indelible gray dust; and the sword he holds does penetrate the brother’s chest. Can these sins be used as a last resort or Is it "spoofed" to offset it, and if so, can those souls who are mourning the wasteland return to their bodies in the world for these two reasons? If you can, Yadel can bear all the crimes committed on these two grounds for 10,000 years or forever.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his god Rosada was as clear and gentle as the morning light he was in charge of. He forgave Yadel and allowed the young pastor to call him again. The holy name, Yadel must admit that he is happy for this, he is willing to do something for his god, Rosada's temple and sanctuary can seem to have forgotten the gods and are forgotten by the gods Longhuo Island stands up, as the chief pastor from the White Tower said, he does have a non-negligible achievement.But what Adel hadn't thought was that the white sanctuary would sting Baldwin's eyes and heart like a sharp arrow, which was also mentioned by the Cavaliers and him. The Cavaliers had a headache for Bedwin's stubbornness— - Byrdwin is also punishable and abandoned by the god he believes in, but if he can still numb himself with a long and arduous cognition of the path of atonement, then he seems to be felony Yadel’s re-enactment of the white robe so quickly destroyed the only reason he had – he frantically wanted to get the forgiveness of Tyre, and for this he could almost be said to be unscrupulous. The more, not only from his friend Kerry Ben, but also from the daughter Li Naina, from his subordinates and his people, he even used the tax on the side of the island without any embarrassment, forcing the merchant to send more Black iron and steel – they may have to thank Leona, if not this temperamental king will wake up her lover and courtiers, he may still put aside research plans to curb “tobacco”. Part of the caster with a physician is transferred to his army to<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know who asked me to come to you?" asked Yadel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry Ben." Rosada’s pastor said, then He saw a look of joy, nostalgia and sadness. He was happy. If this quick and subtle expression is false, then there may not be real things in this world, but he immediately saw the past. In the eyes of his companions, there is a bright color of fear. It’s strange that Kerry is because the locks of the Silver Crown jungle have completely fallen and can’t leave. If you can, it’s not just Yadel’s. It’s never because of its own safety. Stopping in the footsteps of finding a close friend, but when he communicated with Master Alva, he knew that he had left the Longhuo Islands. When he was in Biyindi, the elf almost did not hesitate to entrust the task to Yadel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale thinks of another possibility in the blink of an eye: "If you say your identity," Rosada’s young pastor bowed slyly: The smallest emperor of Grenada, His Royal Highness, this amazing name is no longer a secret at least in Kerry Ben and Alvara, and they have long guessed that the other half of your blood may come from Dragon," Yadel paused. "They also guessed that it might be a red dragon or his descendants. After all, the other dragons have been away from this plane for a thousand years."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world hides a bitter smile: "What did Kerry Bun say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He reminded me to remind you," Yadel said. "When you go back, remember to bring a small fish." He smiled curiously. "What is this whisper? Or is Kerry really like small fish?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other "people" who like small fish, the soul of the outside world is in the heart He took a deep breath. "Is Alva Master and Antonio Master still okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good," Yadell was not angry with Cray. Mar did not answer his question. Since it is a secret, even if it is a friend, it is best not to touch it: "They are extremely powerful mages, and Harvey Dagong connects between Bibi Tibao and Longhuo Islands. The sweet business road, so those parliamentarians are quiet, for the merchants, making money is always the most important, so the Bibi dike is almost as calm and rich as before, although there will still be assassins and thieves, but change It always brings hatred, which is unavoidable, and even the gods may not be able to calm every angry soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe there is still one "You are willing to listen," said Yadell. "I didn't go straight to the coast along the coast or through the inland. I went to the port of Point, although I was not willing, but Gülen asked me to act on my behalf. Say hello."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-—————— ——————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Glan was a little surprised when he met Yadel in Port Mind, but he quickly released the priest of Rosada and sent him to a ship to Grenada. This coincidence made him involuntarily think that he had once sent a black-haired spellcaster on the same dawn to a ship called the "Little Bird". The most painful and most bizarre part of his life also came from this. At that time, he did not know that he would be punitively discarded by the guild, but he did not expect that he would be able to return to the port of Point, as a powerful caster - no one knows that he has two rune fragments. Except for those people, he doesn't know if they should be called companions or friends because he doesn't want to sell and hurt them, but he doesn't know if there is a second proper name to use on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he can live in that tower, even the guild's mage can't resist the invasion of the debris, he has a group of loyal loyal men, powerful A reliable ally, and a wife, perhaps not a wife, wants to marry Mei Mi, but Mei Mi insists that they maintain their current state. Thinking of this, Gülen couldn't help but want to try his own dagger - with the priest of Fro, she was the mother of plum, the one who drove the plum from the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they found her, she was no longer in the temple, and there was no one in the temple. Listening to other people, the priest Fro in the temple did not know why Fro's rejection, aging overnight, after the gods took back her power, some of the Frocian priests died immediately because of old age, and those who did not die, even if only forty years old, there are still sixty At the age of seventy or seventy, it is like the priest of Woking who took interest at the time of recovering the loan principal. The darlings they received also took more youth and beauty when they left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
