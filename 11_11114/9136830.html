			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame at the top of the whale wax candle jumped slightly, and the soul of the aliens looked up. In the room of the dragon, the main light used for illumination was white. Fluorite, after all, he is a caster, and when copying scrolls or experimental spells, the color of the white fluorite that is similar to the skylight is the least likely to cause errors, but he is waiting for the fire element plane. Visitors - Usually, the best place to come and go is a dimension pool that connects the planes of the elements, but there are things about the fire element, whether it's the alien soul or the lich, they are not willing to let too many people know So he just replaced it with a whale wax candle that depicts the magic runes - anyway, they summoned the fire elemental creatures not for combat, the little thing doesn't matter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of the candle swayed, casting a complicated and variable name in the room, and then the flame burst open, the bright glare of the white filled the room, but only for a moment. Just between the breaths, the burning light disappeared, and the flame of the candle writhed, gradually evolved from rose red to gold-like beautiful color, and the slightly shallower tip rises, like, or is a head The beautiful curly hair dances in the air, and below it is a small pointed ear like an elf, and a delicate and beautiful face, this face is only as big as Cremari's small fingernail. But even the slender eyelashes can be seen clearly. The black-haired dragon has stretched out his palm. She jumped to his palm with a jump. Her feet are probably only as big as the grain. The moment that falls on the skin becomes dim, like wearing a pair of cute little boots.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled happily at the souls of the outside world. As elemental creatures, they are not so sensitive to justice or evil, but their wisdom - every The wisdom of an elemental creature can be far more than a human being, a giant, a dwarf, or even a dragon, because you will never know how long they have existed in this plane. After all, it is hard to say that a drop of water has died. If a fire dies, or if a soil loses its life, their disappearance often only changes one form. If anyone is the plane, or the final winner of the entire astral world, except they probably No more people will be there anymore<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlocks often summon and support one or two elemental creatures, but they often seldom explore them, their inner, and a considerable part of the red robe Summon elemental creatures only for combat or sacrifice. Probably only, souls from another world will not hesitate to treat all things that can smile and cry as similar. His emotions are not like lichs. It is speculated that it is an unhelpful joke. On the contrary, his input has been responded to, and it is an extremely valuable response. Even the undead will feel a trace of the ambiguity - there is an elemental plane Various forms that we can see in the main material plane, from the house mouse to the flying eagle, or fish, monkeys, insects, but if you see an elemental creature with a human form, and it is for you With good words... but the increase in spell effects is enough to make people crazy, let alone other<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the soul of the opposite world (rather than Kremar) can let a humanoid fire element elf send him a letter without worrying about the other— - The lich did not know before that an elemental creature would be so docile and loyal when loving a human being - as long as there is a flame, she can come and go between ignorance, and even if some people have it It’s hard to detect a flame, not to mention that the flame is just as dangerous as a dragon. Most importantly, all her services are free of charge... Oh, no, etc. Maybe it is needed, the lich is holding arms in the sea, he can see that the tiny flame is approaching his body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world moves the palm of his hand to his cheek, and the pocket girl in the form of fire element happily extends two arms and embraces the black dragon. The face of the descent, warmly kissed on it, her lips are more hot than the hands and feet, leaving a little red mark on the pale skin, and there is something like a needle Slightly painful<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen him?" asked the soul of the alien world, while putting the palm of his hand on the marble surface of the desk, the satisfied element of the fire element was gone. Down, looked down at the parchment on the desk. The parchment was a human text. After looking at it for a while, she looked up with pity and looked at the human being she loved. She nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world has a long sigh of relief, even if there is no fire friend, he is not ready to watch it again. This is what they captured. The second Principality, unfortunately, the Dagong apparently did not have the courage and perseverance of Grand Duke, and he rejected the conditions of Kremar. As they had thought, he was not willing to give up his own and his descendants. Life, but also use shameless lies and vicious orders to force his people to consolidate the crumbling wall with flesh and blood, even if he knows that this resistance has no use except for the killing of the Grenada. But he has prepared the horses and the reels - extremely disgusting, he has abandoned his wife and son in the empty fortress, creating the illusion that he has not left the country, in fact, he Before the Dragon Tooth Legion launched an attack, he fled from the dark passage with his mistress and illegitimate child. What is even more ridiculous is that he actually brought in countless treasures that he gathered, and the alien soul really wanted to follow the example of the landlord. ,hit His skull to see, how can he think he can take a team still can quietly escape the eagle eyes beast head lion body and Grenada caster's spell? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the soul of the outside world even wants to thank the grandfather for his stupidity. Because of his unpopularity, the knights and lords who are under the arm are almost in a semi-independent state. Before they see the first lion beast, It has already decided the fate of oneself and the people - the serfs and peasants in the wilderness have been driven into the jungle, the swamp, and some places where the Greinada people will not go wherever they are, if the people in the city are unwilling Escaped, the first time I chose to open the gate to surrender. Given the poor money bags of the Grenada Legion Knights, they at least saved their lives like the Tilans. As for their managers, they have not disappeared. It is the peaceful arrival of Crow's crow messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most devastating situation only appears in the capital of the Grand Duke, the Lich does not know whether the evils of the Legion Knight will affect himself - he is not this The initiator of the war did not plan for it. He didn't even shoot. Fortunately, he is now the leader of the legion. The knights and casters of Grenada will only think that this is just because of his scorn, not willing to Precious spells are consumed by some mortals, and some may be confused, but what about it? Before the new king and Grein did not want to give up, even the Red Dragon might not directly threaten his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who used to know does not know how the rules of the underworld are commenting and thinking - he is not punished, at the appointed time, the soul of the outside world It was replaced by him, and it was a heavy burden for him to care for and care about the Lich. The parchment scrolls on the desk transcribed his slaves and were responsible for sorting out this. The warlocks of the materials were very careful and cautious. The slaves not only divided the gender, but also divided the age group. The elders in the 40s were a copy, the children under the age of 10 were one, and the baby was a copy. There is one of the most special, copied with reddish cinnabar ink, which is the list of pregnant women, the warlock is simply full of joy to indicate the identity of these women, still behind the noble blood, the soul of the outside world Of course, I know that it is very, every, he said, except for a very small number of people, the Grenada people will regard these "goods" as the best sacrifice to Grein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I don't need it," the soul of the outside world said with a loud voice: "I am now a single dog of unknown gender." They are about to cry out, but in contrast, as a precious sacrifice, these pregnant women can get extra care, otherwise they will probably die before they arrive in the desert because they can't bear the hard work of the trek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was still sitting back to his desk after hesitating for a moment, he didn’t want to see them because he knew that the numbers and names were followed by a living person, but He must check and organize them and arrange their "uses" here, otherwise those merchants may simply dispose of them, especially those old people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire element girl returned to the whale wax candle, she leaned over to watch the young dragon, fluorite and candle illuminate his eyes, that pair The eyes of the abyss flow with crystal and radiant light. This is a kind-hearted person, a light of compassion from the depths of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken stands in a white pine forest, and the white pine bark is covered with eye-like scars, just like Countless people are silently monitoring this field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human women go for the twentieth, or forty, or a hundred times, but as before, she is When she was tired and couldn't move anymore, she returned to the place she was familiar with. The sap of the branch where she used as a sign of the break had solidified, with a cold gleam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t know what it’s called a lock. Her husband used to be a soldier in Thunderbolt. He has seen elves and sincerely trusts and loves to wear them. In the noble race of the mortal, he told the ugly chicken about these things, but he didn't know, it was even more impossible to tell the ugly chicken that there was a layer outside the silver crown of the elf, even the orcs, and the giants or the casters could not easily Passover barrier - the god of life, Angris gave them, the Singer elves' Wang Yinggewei and the numerous elf wizards arranged together the lock, while the lock is still open, not It is impossible to invade even if it is allowed by a bird. Now, when the lock has fallen, and the silver-crowned jungle has been closed, this place has become a whirlpool that can swallow countless lives at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken is lucky, she is the most gentle and amiable ring in the lock, she is only invisibly expelled, but with this The stubborn humans stepped into the place where she should not come again and again, and the lock seemed to be angry too - in places she didn't see, the thorns grew like waves, cutting her feet and legs. The blood flows into the mud, but the ugly chicken is unaware. Her only thought now is to see the elf, "speak" everything, although she has no tongue and can't write, but she thinks she always has a way. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
