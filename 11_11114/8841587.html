			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about humans?" asked the Oaks priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In their tent." The leader said, then picked up the deer's legs and greedily bite a big mouth, grease and blood sticking his mouth. Hair with the jaw: "Do you think they will have meat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just give them gold and gems," the priest said: "Human merchants will put themselves The children of their own children or their parents are sold to you. If you can give them a higher price, they can do it themselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader laughed "I don't want such a slave," he said. "But they may be able to get what we are missing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go ask them if they can No," said the Oaks priest. "Let them see what we have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader nodded and he clung to the half-baked deer leg Going out, sticking out the greasy hands and opening the door of the priest’s tent, went out, more violently cold than the ten days, one day or even a moment ago. This moment rushed into the tent, blowing away the heat and the dew of the roast deer's legs, blowing up the white hair of the Oaks priest and the blond hair and red hair decorated on the chest, his two humans The female slave groaned and quickly climbed over and pushed the heavy door bill back into place. They are very beautiful and young, and they are the latest gift from human merchants. Unfortunately, it is not a good year for the black blood tribe. The orcs must also calculate how many meals they eat each meal. When the deer were in the head, the slaves could not get the food at all - they were completely relying on the fat accumulated before, and they should have kept the ruthenium and hips of the plump and smooth, and the stomach and stomach swelled because of hunger. The knees and elbows are thick, because the human slaves must not raise their heads above his knees when serving the Oaks priests. They can only climb or lie down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can still be said to be more fortunate because the Oaks priest is second only to the leader’s special status in the tribe, and the meat he gets is always fresh and plentiful. But he is old, and he is unwilling to put this fact in front of everyone, so he will torment his remaining teeth and fragile gastrointestinal ribs, ligaments and bones, and become the only supply for these two slaves. And as a slave to the Oaks priests, they will be slaughtered second after the horn deer are eaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise is that the Oaks priests need their service, and can always maintain sexual desire to overcome his appetite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Black Blood tribe also got two female slaves, which are more beautiful than the ones the priests got, and are younger, if they are dedicated to Eph Luo’s temple would also be accepted by the priests. He enjoyed them all white and a whole night, and then he felt very hungry, so he ordered his slave to set up a campfire in his tent. I cooked his female slave and ate them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader knows that some humans think he is wasting, but he never feels that a human female slave has something to keep, they are too weak, and they can’t give birth to his embarrassment. But it tastes really good, quite delicate, comparable to lambs and deer, and he happily licks his teeth as he passes through the darkened ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the leader of the Black Blood Tribe, with thick brown hair, a huge nose sticking forward, like an orc who is always smelling something, striding When approaching the tent where the human businessman lived, the mercenary hired by the human being and the wandering mage issued a warning signal, and the leader discovered it, but he just showed them a hairless skin all of which pulled back and folded, revealing All teeth and gums are ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of humans sat together, there was no bonfire in the middle, but a small silk carpet was laid, the human being headed, that is, the life of the elf The water-mixed pharmacy was sold to their mage, and it was slowly rolled up and stuffed into the open-collar robes. The leader took a look at him, pulled a leather bag from his arms, and then dumped it to make those green The red, black, and colorless stones fell from their eyes like hail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants exclaimed and quickly picked them up, and a gem fell off the mage of the mage, and he possessed it and picked it up. It Green is like a miniature lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the gems have not been thoroughly polished, and the most dazzling fascination is almost covered by rough inclusions and uneven surfaces. But an experienced gemstone dealer only needs a few glances to determine the value they should have. Except for the Master, almost everyone is unconsciously swallowing saliva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader sat cross-legged in front of the mage, and his male officer was exposed to the mage in such a unobtrusive manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By what you have given," the leader said bluntly: "Our horn deer is about to be eaten up. Humans, our soldiers are starving." He stared at the wizard, like a lion watching a cockroach Fox: "Sometimes I really doubt if you are a human spy, you sell those potions to us, just want to watch us being surrounded by famine earlier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The merchants present can hear the orc language, and they hear that they suddenly moved backwards unconsciously, and the mage immediately became empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I reminded you that new orcs will need much more food than normal," the Master said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need more food." The leader said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage laughed: "This sounds a bit embarrassing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If you can't do it," the leader said, "I will pour a pot of melted gold water, pour it in your mouth, and cook your internal organs and flesh from inside - I believe that as a human, you may like this. "The way of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems a bit new," the mage said, "for you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, who's the meat, someone else's or you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask me," said the Master: "Others ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," Demon said: "I am I thought about why a dear tutor would let me search for useless people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In one fell swoop," said the first viper, Anemos: "It can remove the weeds around the white tower and feed those poor. The fluffy velvet has given the untouchables a pretty good dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it not?" Demon said: "They just heard it out. A little bit of money can be exchanged for a very good place to live from a generous and selfless lord, almost happy to be crazy - really good, although it is a bit cold, a bit dangerous, but the land is fertile and belongs to them Own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lord also gave them a charter," said the little devil, and then laughed with Demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if Bedwin was still in Fort Lauder, things would not be so easy," Demon said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he was sent by his king to attend your wedding," Anemos said slyly. "And he has to go to the king." To pay back the temporary rights granted to him by the king, and to keep warm with his long-lost wife, this time is enough for us to send enough reserve food for Huxiao Plain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Better than cattle and sheep," Demon said: "They don't even need someone to drive them away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The drive to drive them is ** And greed." The little devil said: "Like Baldwin's knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bedwin is so trusting him," Demon said. Why don't we try to buy the Thunderbolt directly from him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Still by some refugees through Thunderbolt for the unknown aristocracy Mining is one thing,” said the little devil. “It’s another thing to sell the Thunderbolt.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s fun,” Demon said. Some people think that little crimes . Innocuous "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"? Just like you "little devil asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost." Demon looked out the window: "I am just a white tower, and he is a whole highland Norman or more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Demon asked unintentionally: "Is the instructor still whistling in the plain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;But the little devil has seen what he is trying to hide: "Maybe," he asked viciously. "Do you think he will sell your contract to an orc priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon’s face suddenly became pale, and he could not grasp the wand hidden in his robes, a wand that helped him to imprison the mentor, but until Anemo He smiled and disappeared gradually, and he did not dare to take out the wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
