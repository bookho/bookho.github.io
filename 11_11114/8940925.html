Also ask the adults to continue to support and encourage! Support genuine, support the author! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the extravagant banquet, the King of Norman’s King of Highlands generously announced Delaying the contest that lasted for about three months to half a year, "until my dear friend took him and his knight back to Fort Lee," he said loudly, and under the thick curly eyebrows towards Bedwin. Blinking eyes - and the nobles, although most of them are quite disappointing, full of jealousy and hatred, but still full of smiles on their faces, raising the cup in front of them to celebrate loudly, for a time flattering The sound is endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin expressed his sincere gratitude to His Majesty, according to the King’s expectations, he could be loyal to the King before the humid heat invaded the King. The aristocrats and princes got 1,500 knights and 4,000 soldiers, and then got 500 knights and 2,000 soldiers from the Duke of John before the fall, so that, together with the existing forces of Thunder, he The army that is held in the hand reaches the number that can be said to be unique in the past - second only to the king. And the king promised that he would receive a title and a seal of the Earl, and that Princess Leona became the master of Norman in the Highlands, married to the descendants of one of the twelve nobles and gave birth to a male heir, no, two, or More. If one of them can afford the responsibility of sticking to Thunderbolt, Birdwin can deliver the Thunderbolt and return to his territory and his wife, and his children will spend the rest of their lives in peace and tranquility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they don’t have children yet, but there will be, boys, girls, gray-haired, yellow-haired, straight around your boots or apron Calling, like a group of fat puppies, Birdwin pinched his glass and thought that his son would be a nobleman rather than a farmer or hunter, and the daughter would become a noble wife, her The dowry will make the princess of Wangdu shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot atmosphere reached its peak after the King gave Birwin's wide sword to the dwarf, and the easy-going courtiers immediately became arrogant. The ground was resistant to a rusty, long-lost armor with only the upper body and no lower body. They fixed it on a wooden stake. The lord of Thunderbolt left the table and took a step forward with a slight drunk in the shouts of the crowd, waving a wide sword - Kerry suddenly sounded a warning, but it was too late, and the Tyre Knight’s sniper always looked like a cockroach. It’s so strong and fast, and the wide sword is so sharp and unparalleled that the blade is cut into the armor, like cutting into a piece of decaying wood, and instantly smashing it into two, from the left shoulder to the right. Your majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then people heard a terrible scream, what a terrible cry, I was afraid that after a thousand years, someone could hear this miserable cry through the land - the armor flowed out Blood and internal organs are like living a living person. God, it is indeed a living person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several knights rushed up and untied their armor, revealing in front of them a terrible corpse, a freak who was only five years old. So the jesters were able to stuff him into a half armor - he was a jester who was favored by the pharaoh, but since the new king became king, he was no longer so flattering, people almost forgot him, and He has been wrapped in dog skins for years, eating the rest of the dog’s food, stealing the bitch’s milk – obviously, the new king’s jesters hijacked or deceived him – the latter Because he didn't say anything in his armor, maybe he thought it was a good chance to win the new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore a pair of red and blue two-tone blouses with a velvet spiky cap, which was not completely dead. The huge head was like a salted water. The cockroaches swelled and whitened, the eyes stood out, the opaque tears, the hands holding their belly, a few feet away, the feet that came out of the tights were still slightly kicking, a knight was pity The dagger broke into his throat and ended his pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin slammed back one step. He had faced thousands of orcs and was accustomed to bloody killings, but he never thought like this. To vomit and escape - people face each other, completely unaware of how to deal with this scene, including those who are full of malicious, if not one of the most funny hunchback dwarf suddenly giggled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He danced and sang a song to praise the heroic knight, and had to say that this song once comforted countless knights and their singers now It sounds like that irony. But Princess Diane burst into laughter behind her feather fan, followed by the Duke of John, then the King, and the nobles and knights finally got rid of the embarrassing atmosphere. They returned to their place and sat down. Down - the servants carried the basket and picked up the body of the freak. His body was piled up with the remaining bones. A hound dog smashed his heart and a few dozen dozen dogs. Then the intestines and the liver were put up, and then some people poured charcoal on the ground soaked with blood, sprinkled with wick and lavender. When the fresh and beautiful squid was brought in, almost everyone seemed to have forgotten this accident and ate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care too much," said King Baldwin, who was indifferent to his face. "They always do," he said. "The last time they caught a poor fellow's hands and feet and threw him into the hearth." —The servants who cleaned the hearth scrubbed for a full day before they finally cleaned the greasy glue on the stone bricks—they always did, not because of this, but because the one died, but fortunately there was always new supplies added.” Br < br br br br br br br br br The place looked away - he and the elf had left, and they were seated in two treacherous knights who were stealing this time and hurriedly filled their stomachs with various foods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cast a questioning eye on her son, Dylan snorted helplessly and nodded, indicating that he had been arranged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry and Kremar left their seats as soon as the humpback dwarf sang, but did not leave the hall too far, at the owner When you have not left the table, it is a very rude behavior for the invited guests to leave without permission. Moreover, the owner is still a king, one of the ally's allies, but if it is only possible to go under the gallery, after all, there are often some guests who need it. Vomiting and urinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wangdu was not like this." Kerry Ben said: "When Pharaoh is still..." The current owner of Norman Norman is on the throne The means are not very clever. For the crown, he compromised with too many people, Don Cray, John, Diane, Fukai, Dylan... He didn’t know that it was like drinking and quenching thirst, but he was too eager to hold The gold scepter with the stone and blue gems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who used to be undecided, before or after he became undead, similar things have been seen too much. In his cognition, the court of the Norman in the Highlands is still very cute. After all, it is only an unpicked jester in the armor, and in his father’s court, it may be a king. Son, and in the mentor’s mage tower, being smashed by a wide sword and painfully dying for about a cup of tea, maybe it’s a lucky one – at least better than being devil or It is the devil who eats lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His silence was misunderstood by Kerry Ben, "In general, such a party will last for three days," Kerry explained, with a few Consolation means: "But from tomorrow, we can have a choice. After all, Birdwin is their main goal." The elf paused here because he thought of the scene just now, uncontrollably. It was so annoying - as an aurora, he heard something in his armor breathing and shaking. At first Kerry wanted to think that it was a cat that had only gotten into abandoned armor. He didn't I thought it would be a personal person - but he stood up and shouted loudly, but it was too late, and the people around him shouted loudly... It might be as high as the king of Norman said that it was just a jester. Mischief, bloody mischief, but Kerry this thought it was for Birdwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birdwin is a follower of Tyre, and this will be a stinger that is pressed against his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet will last for three full days, but only a few people Being allowed to live in the royal court surrounded by twelve fortresses, it is clear that the Duke of John, Princess Diane and his son Dylan, and some of their cronies, as well as the protagonist of the banquet, Birdwin, and his wife, friends, and friends It is qualified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a simple bath, Baldwin led the maid to the room where he and Penny were, the room was wide and beautiful, with more than a dozen pieces of furniture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny only wore a rose-red silk gown sitting in front of the dressing table with a dazzling silver mirror in front of her, wet hair draped behind her, two The maids were busy drying them—using expensive cotton cloth, a maid squatting on the floor to polish her toenails, and she was busy wiping and grooming her cheeks and lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She became beautiful, but made Bedwin feel strange, he almost no longer recognized his wife, no, not only she dyed straw-colored hair It became black, and she didn't put lead powder on her face and rubbed her rouge on her mouth. Her change was more in her heart, and Baldwin could feel it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at least tonight, Baldwin wants to spend quietly, sitting on the edge of the bed, taking out the wide sword that the king gave him. Using a piece of deerskin to carefully wipe the sharp blade, there is no blood on the smooth blade, but he always feels that the blood of the jester has infiltrated the weapon. If it is not given by the king and his friend, he will break. It then let it be buried with the victim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin felt that Penny was strange, and Penny had the same idea? Is this her husband, is the man she once loved? Why does she only feel fear and nausea when she sees him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He killed a poor, innocent person, but did not see remorse; the same color as the gray eyes filled with cruelty and tyranny, his skin is rough, only I feel a pain in my eyes at a glance; is his hair beard always so messy? Will there be fleas inside? Or a bed bug? He is so old, wrinkles in the corners of his eyes and corners are as deep as gullies, dense like spider webs, and scars that make the surrounding skin twist and discolor, like the mouth of a monster. Why did she sleep with such a cruel and terrible man before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny gently walked over to Bedwin's body and sneaked into the thin wool blanket. After a while, the breath became even and stable. Birdwin breathed a sigh of relief. The reunion night was always Warm and pleasant, but today he really just wants to take a good rest - he took a bottle of winter wine from his skin, without water, and the transparent water flowing through the throat turned into a burning magma - This is almost a routine, since he personally destroyed the Thunderbolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he had forcibly removed the residents of the city before, he knew that not everyone was willing to leave his home, except for the gray stone. The orc still has his people; and he has not really protected those who trust him. Birdwin has recalled more than once, repenting, why did he not give up more troops to protect his people? Or send the mages and the army to the patrol before the residents of Thundersburg enter the tunnel? Even if only once, those people can survive to live with their families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the merchants and mages sent by Dylan have begun to rebuild the Thunderbolt. Since the orcs have suffered a setback, the Thunderbolt can get ten or even twenty years. The tranquility, the things that the orcs can't get from the looting can only be obtained by trading. There will be more gems, gold and pyroxes flowing into the Thunderbolt. A large number of merchants and craftsmen will fill the dead in the shortest time. The blanks - but they are not the original people, swearing and remorse torment Bydwin, he began to sleep by spirits, in the gloom and darkness brought by the spirits, he can not think, not to recall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin fell into a muddy sleep, as if in his sleep there was a boulder crushing his chest, like the people he saw in the tunnel, they were crushed Lived his legs, pressed his chest, and faced the fierce thieves and the orcs without resistance. The same was true of Baldwin in his dreams. He thought that he was actually crying like a mosquito, he tried to wave him. The wide sword, but only caught the blood, the sludge and the broken body, an orc raised an axe to cut him, the illusory pain suddenly turned into reality - he shouted and jumped, a small axe deep Deeply embedded in his right arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panni squatted back and Bydwin looked at her in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry..." she cried, pulling the axe from Bedwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin couldn’t stand upright, he grabbed the wide sword created by the dwarf, but he didn’t even pull it out, and Penny had already rushed. When she came up, she was even more powerful than Birdwin. Only the hand holding the axe was stable like iron. She didn’t have the experience of killing. She only slashed by feeling: "Please," she sobbed loudly. When Birdwin raised his arm and rebelled: "Please!" she muttered to herself: "Dead, please, die... please, die..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bywin could be said to have escaped an axe that almost cut his neck: "Why!?" He shouted: "I am your husband! I am Baldwin! Wake up... Penny "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry." Penny said, she looked at Baldwin, painful and firm: "Bedwin - both My fault... but I want him to live, he...and children..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My children and other children," said Penny. "I am sorry, but Birdwin, I can't let you kill them..." She raised her axe high. "Can't "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the maid rushed in, the first thing she smelled was thick Bloody smell, she quickly opened the copper sheet covered with fluorspar, the light returned to the room, she saw Birdwin kneeling on the ground, holding his wife Penny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scarlet blood almost covered the whole person in Byrdwin, Penny’s black hair has been soaked, but Birdwin’s wound is no longer bleeding. Instead, Penny was bleeding, from under her silk gown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin gripped Penny tightly, and at the last moment, anger and survival ** gave him the power to fight back, though that was just a glimpse That, but for Penny, it is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Like awakened by the light, Penny said weakly: "Bedwin?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bedwin, I...like...made a sweet dream." Penny said. Then she was silent for a while: "No," she sighed with a sigh. "I think... that should be a nightmare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nightmare, Baldwin slowly raised his head, isn’t it a nightmare? It’s just that she can’t wake up anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he saw the maid standing on the side, she did not panic, but with some sympathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
