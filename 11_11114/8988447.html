			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not difficult to avoid the waiters’ peeping, for Princess Leona, after she lived as a woman for twelve years, in her father At the request of Norman Pharaoh, she lived as a man for five years. She was like a male heir, learning the skills of using the best teachers to fight and use weapons. At the same time, she gradually showed inheritance. The part of the Norman royal family - she is not afraid of pain, not afraid of blood, the battle will make her blood, and her teacher has bluntly said that her strength is even bigger and longer than the average male warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She puts her prepared things into a small pocket and puts on tight clothing when hunting, Leona did not disguise herself because in the middle of the night In the case, a female official or a young guard is going to rush out of the city, but it is more difficult than a princess. The only maids who need to hide and hide are the female aristocrats with knighthood who can directly meet the majesty of the king. They are just ordinary people. They almost never wake up after falling into a sweet sleep. Leona jumped out of the window of the room and fell into the lilac bushes. With a bitter fragrance, she quickly ran to the stables. In the middle of the stable, the best horse was taken from the stables. The night of the night was only a small servant. When he panicked and called other servants, the other servants went to inform their supervisors about the matter. Her Royal Highness has already passed the closed gates - the vigilant knight and the guards were initially unwilling to obey her orders, and were prepared to inform her uncle, the current Norman New King, but Leona took out That handle The knife, wrapped in the handle of the flame lizard skin, is not purely meaningful - it belongs to Norman's first heir, and the person who owns it is said to have half the power of the king, although John does not really take this The right is handed over to the prostitute, but it is okay to use it to open the gates of the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When New King John heard the news, Leona had already left Norman’s King City behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me some honey." The new king said that his servant immediately put on the prepared drink, which is different from Pharaoh's preference. The new king's honey wine is added with a thick layer of honey and heated to the extent that it will burn the tongue. "Can we still find her?" He asked Fu Kai, the Chancellor of the Treasury responded to the speed of the new king's call almost to John. Thought he was sleeping in the doorway of his room. Of course, that is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Possible." Fukai said with a smile: "But as far as I know, Pharaoh has left a lot of precious possessions to His Royal Highness - There is a rune plate, you know, respect your majesty. It is a magical tool that can be used by mortals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Specific." John said that he lived in Wang Ting. In the room where his brother had lived, Pharaoh was a stubborn guy. His floor was not paved with pyroxene like many nobles, so he stepped on the cold. From the soles of the feet to the heart, and the new king has not had time to improve this shortcoming, although in May, the fireplace in the room has been burning, but he still feels cold after drinking a hot cup of honey. As a last resort, he drilled back into the account and wrapped himself in the fur of the white bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fu Kai said after the warmth and darkness created by the account: "Let me look back, kneel," he said: "I suspect that Princess Leona is carrying In the magical device, there is a rune that can confuse the spells - we may not be able to find her by spell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hounds?" John is on the account Asked, the voice was very dull and fuzzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Princess Leona has obviously thought of this. Before she went to the stables, she went to the kennel and sprinkled hypnotic powder there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, can't we find her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. At least not very soon ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's too bad, Fukai," said the new king. "It's dangerous outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Danger is extremely good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, dear Fukai. You know, I have always trusted you the most," I yawned arbitrarily: "This matter is handed over to you. Please tell me the first time, no matter what news you get." He lay down and pulled the blanket on his body: "Do whatever you can." Don't be too scared, you know, I am not a king who will blame the minister because of the unavoidable disaster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt," Fukai said: "So, I will retire first, may you To a serene dream, my majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new king stretched out a white and thin hand from the account as a reply and allowed him Leave the sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona is holding the horse on the edge of the outer city, she comforts the tall A strong gray horse, taking out four horseshoes from their pockets, they are magically applied and can be fixed on the horse's hoof without tapping, and can reduce the weight of the horse and the rider, summoning a small wind element Supporting horseshoes, allowing them to run at three times the speed of ordinary horses without any effort, but Leona forgot that the horses in Wang Tingzhong were carefully served. The horses of the gray horses have been hammered with horseshoes. When she frowned and thought about whether she had to dig through the pockets to remove them, the ordinary hoof that was closest to the magic horseshoe suddenly fell off and replaced it with a magical horseshoe with silver light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray stallion, which had never been through this matter, was uneasily swaying, and Leona took it quickly. After bribing and comforting the stallion with a piece of honey, she picked up four heavy old irons on the ground. Leona first wanted to throw the four dirty hooves into the surrounding thorns, but after considering it again, she put them into the pockets, and even the nails were smashed by her one by one. Come back and put it in a small bag with loose coins. Who knows if these magical tools will be destroyed after the attached spells disappear? She heard a long poem by the bard, and there is a The king lost a war because he lost a horseshoe nail, and then his life, his country, Leona, did not want to make such mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing this little work, Leona took another pendant from the pocket, which was used to place her before her. The pendant of Birdwin's hair is a little bigger. When you open it, you can see a small image of Leona, but as long as you open the portrait above, you can see the little elephant below - Bydwin's; In this way, Leona never dared to wear it on her neck, thus avoiding the second more convincing evidence by his father - this small image is not just a simple portrait, it It was Lee Oona who privately traded a precious rune with a mage. The paint was mixed with Baldwin's hair and the blood he volunteered. With this pendant, Leona was able to perceive his position. - When approaching him or when he is close to Leona. The pendant will heat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of the making of the pendant was more than four years ago, when the old king who had broken the hope of having another son took Leona back to the court, preparing Treating her as her own heir, so when he returned to the kingdom in Bydwin, he asked Leona to meet with the owner of Thunder. He was asked to drop his knees to the girl who could almost be his daughter, and to offer his loyalty... Leona still wonders why she had such courage at that time, leaving the maid and the female official, blocking the cloister Birdwin, hurriedly asked him for a drop of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers that Bedwin was very upset at the time. But still satisfied her requirements, perhaps for him, but to meet the whimsy of a wayward child. But for Leona, this pendant is like her belief. When Baldwin returned to Fort Rebecca, the pendant had only a very weak heat, so weak that Leona had to rub it with ice. It feels a little warm after the cheeks cling to it, but when Baldwin returns to the kingdom, it warms like a living heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it will guide Leona to the person she loves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona put the pendant on her lips, southeast. The heat from the pendant is most obvious: "Wait for me." The princess said, put the chain of the pendant back to the neck, put the pendant into the shirt, and let it cling to his skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan Don Clay and his mentor have nothing to do with the magical instruments in Leona’s hands Knowing that otherwise, their work may be simpler, but Leona is very cautious about this matter. The mage she chose is not a Norman. He is with the messenger of the Grand Duke Luzer. To participate in a celebration - that is, the old king to show his new heirs to his courtiers and people, Leona caught the mage when everyone was drunk. Excuses to escape the abominable swordsman and asked him to make this magical instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robe warlock Austal entered his own divination room, unlike the large room filled with Mithril, the Warlock’s divination room was dark black Wrapped in wood, the wood is very hard. And it was picked up from the bottom of the lake, which has been immersed in the depths of the lake. Before that, it has been immersed in it for thousands of years. The coldness of the lake has already smashed every core. Even if no spells are applied, they will Exudes a cold cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a soft cushion in the divination room, a support made of demon's claws. Holding a crystal ball that is as big as a baby's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal sat down on the cushion, facing the crystal ball, whispering the secret language that triggered the magic device, the crystal ball was first raised for a while The thick white mist, the mist is rotating, showing a variety of shapes, some are like the resentful shouting of the screaming, and some are like the birds flapping their wings or the insects turning the compound eyes, the warlock knows it. Waiting for further orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin. Don Clay. The warlock originally wanted to name this name, but he immediately changed his mind, because Baldwin has been deprived of his surname, and on this continent, there are not many people called Bedwin, after all, this name symbolizes the brave warrior. Many knights will take this name for their eldest son - thief Gülen! He said firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog in the crystal ball rotates, rotates, and then slowly spreads out, it presents a city to the red robe warlock, Austal carefully I found out that it was a city of chaos in the seventy-seven islands. No, they would not go anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thief named Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Error," Ostall said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog in the crystal ball condenses again and becomes clear again after a few breaths. This time it is a desert, the sharp eyes of the warlock captured. A group of black vultures, they are surrounded by several bodies and eaten and chewed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Error," Ostall said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball shows several places again, but it is not the person that the Red Warlock is looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes he really doesn’t understand what people are thinking about. Gülen is a narrow valley in lingua franca, and people use it to describe ghosts. Poor people with many fates, I did not expect that there will be so many parents willing to take such an ominous name for their children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the crystal ball became clear and transparent for the seventh time, the warlock saw a narrow and dense forest belt, accompanied by a thin and bright stream of water, he closed his eyes. The map of Highlands Norman is unfolding in his knowledge of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He concentrates, the picture in the crystal ball gradually expands, and when the top of the highest tree is about to touch, the warlock stops, he knows that the caster is able to Feeling that he was being snooped over a distance, he made a gesture, chanting a spell, and the crystal ball flashed to represent the light of life. At first they were as dense as starlight, and as the spells were screened, they became sparse. In the end, only five are left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin, Elf Ranger Kerry Ben, Master Crimmar, Froe Pastor Mei Mi, thief Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found you," Ostal whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan launched the map and asked his mentor to point this location on the map The warlock looked at him strangely: "I don't understand what you are thinking," he said. "My child, why don't you ask me to cast spells to send you directly there?" He bounces his finger, map brush The ground rolled up and almost caught Dylan's finger: "Or, you are doubting my ability, Dylan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
