To read the book · 1ka book nshu<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid the tragic ending that can be seen almost Gülen must make a choice. Unfortunately, his master is not the kind of caster who will study his spells in his towers, copy the scrolls or teach his disciples. On the contrary, he is very keen. For travel and adventure, Cremari has a pair of dark eyes. Sometimes they are as dead as the dead, and sometimes as innocent as children. The only thing they have is that they are always greedy. They are like It is a sea that never stops, and it seems to be calm and surging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the other world looked at Gülen, and he also heard about the relationship between Gülen and Plum, which has recently been intimately intimate with men and women. Purely, as a foreign soul who has lived for nearly 30 years in both the legal and moral requirements for both men and women to maintain their physical and mental integrity (at least during mutual interaction or marriage), this state makes it Feel happy and comfortable, to be honest, although there are many female and male and female systems in its scattered memories, they can barely endure as a curiosity or an exception, but here, one Women actually only have to live like a cheap donkey because she is a pastor of Fro, which is too uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you really think so? The undead who used to say suddenly, but I don’t think so, my cohabitants, they are heading towards an extremely dangerous edge, especially plum, maybe you should remind Gülen that his mother is an expelled Pastor Luo, he knows what he will face when he abandoned the priest of Fro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——But the emotion is difficult to control, and the soul of the outside world argues that he feels that Gülen and Plum are really born to the heart. The joy of the family, although they did not clear the relationship. But the Lich's cohabitants are happy to see this change, Gülen is no longer so sullen, and Mei Mi is no longer so mean - in the eyes of the outside world, he thinks the latter even thinks she loves her. When she went to Byrdwin, she had to come to her eyes and be happy and relaxed. She probably didn't notice it. When she dedicated her love to Birdwin, she was humble and humble. She was kneeling at the foot of Birdwin, so low that it was difficult for the former paladin to see her eyes; but she was with Gülen. When they are equal, Gülen does not need to cover his black hands in front of Mei Mei, and Mei Mei does not have to pretend that he is pure as snow. They can not only see each other's glamorous surface. A reading of the book www.1kanshu also sees the dirty and dirty heart, you can drink the blood red wine mixed with fresh lamb blood, you can say some rough and low-level jokes and stories, you can enjoy the fun anywhere, no need Avoid people's sights and words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Lich gave only a slight sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-A little way? The soul of the alien world asks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Yes, the Lich replied cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Can you talk about it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Replace Fro as the god of love and **, the lich slowly said, so that you can modify the original doctrine - you can Tell your pastors. They can also marry a man like a normal woman and breed for future generations. Then...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Then? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Then you will find that your pastor is running out all night. Your temple is abandoned, your power is diminished, and the believers are left with nothing. As a god, as long as you have been in the past hundred years, you will die. The gods are broken, the fire is extinguished, and your remaining body will become a huge reef in the chaotic sea. Of course, if there is a god or human being interested in your priesthood. This ending may be a little earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——But...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Fro’s teachings have been counted among the gods The gentleness and kindness of the people, any violation of the doctrine, even if you are just an ordinary believer, will be judged as a false believer, public opinion to follow the gods pastor? Everything of the pastor belongs to the gods they serve. Their voice is, their ears are, their eyes are, their tongues are, their souls are also, even the softest and most embarrassing gods will not Allow his/her pastor to succumb to yin, because this means that their beliefs are embarrassing and even disobedient, which will shake the foundation of their strength. As I said before, the priests and believers who intend to indulge themselves are dead. Their names are not in the long river of time. Their temples are the slaves of the pigs. Their intentions will never be performed by even one person. More correctly, this is not death, but death. Do you understand? It is more sad than some human beings, because for the latecomers, they do not exist, they have not existed before, they are not now, and there will be no more in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you don’t want to see something you don’t want to see, the Lich continues to say that you’d better make a difference, I suggest you choose Gülen The cold sea water of the North Sea is still able to keep him awake.壹Reading·1kanshu<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alien soul sighed, but it didn't feel that it would be a pleasing job, and what do you want him to say, Gülen's performance is not so obvious now, he gave Mei Mei an expensive gift. I didn't forget to leave a silver coin every night. He didn't stop other men from entering Meimei's room. Can it still go over and tell him that he is better to change a bed? That is too stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Wait, the soul of the opposite world says, are we going to the sea of ​​the North, Keriben, even though the god of destiny has been right? We smile, we have to spend nearly a year, maybe we will return here a year later, Mei Mi has found another boy worthy of her favorite? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The lich “sees” it. Who told you that plum honey will be left here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world bounced in surprise, somehow, its body was fatter in addition to being more solid during this time. This makes it no longer like a translucent fish when it comes to the sea, but like a jellyfish or an irritated puffer fish. The lich thinks that if it can, this shape is suitable for his favorite bone. The chair is used as a cushion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Mei Mi also want to go with us? I don't know that I have become a stranger of the cushion reserve, but she is just a priest of Fro? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——There is something in your plane called adventure novels or games. Once the undead answered questions, in general, novels and games often There will be a protagonist, and the protagonist will gradually gather his teammates. Like wizards, thieves, priests, archers, warriors, etc. and so on, then they can start their adventure story. Ok, tell me, you have seen a novel or a supporting role in the game. Sorry, I am too weak and too incompetent, so I refuse to participate in the next adventure, is there? Maybe, but this role will therefore lose the need for his existence. There will be no ridiculous good life waiting for him. He will not greet death or a more tragic ending than death...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you not think? My dear cohabitant, since we left the Chaos Sea, no, since I stepped into the astral world and you were dragged into this plane, isn’t there an invisible hand that has been pushing us in the direction we have set? ? My previous plan never included the Thunderbolt and the Dragon Fire Island. Originally we came to the Grey Ridge and we should have a calm 50 years. Instead of sitting here and discussing how to snatch a legacy of a metal dragon that may have vanished from a group of red robe warlocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a thread in Baldwin's business, then Gülen. How many times the fingers of fate have to fiddle with them in order to let him meet us. First, he must escape Drake's revenge, escape the curse of the death god Clanwo, escape the Norman New King's noose, escape the orc's axe and minions... ... so many coincidences, so many opportunities. It’s just to let him meet with us. Well, let’s see what happened next. He should have been tried directly by the new king to kill, or be imprisoned forever—for example. I used the red lead water to fill the iron box that contained him, or there were other ways and places of detention, but no, they let him appear in front of us again, we fled together, in that small village, in that In the damn underground swamp, he stole a tight pocket from the waist of a half-dragon and a half devil. What is in this pocket? Do you think this is a coincidence with the things that guide us to the sea of ​​the North? Even if the half dragon has been hit by our spells, Gülen is just a personal class. Even if he is a good and outstanding thief, he can even be unscathed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should be familiar with, my idiot, the game you used to play, the half-dragon identity is npc, and his dimension bag can be picked up. Items, and the dragon grammar book in the pocket is the condition that triggers the next task, and you, and me, the character, the manipulated character, we have no right to choose, because no matter how many roads we walk, we end up Or will you go to the designated road - and the people around us, Kerry is also, Gülen is also, Bywin and Leona are also, Mei Mi is no exception, you may not want to believe, but you Try it out and see if the final result will be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- But Mei Mi is not strong, she can't even compare with Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This is not her or you and I can decide, the lich is cold and ruthless, I will not interfere with your decision, because I also want to see See if your power can modify the story that has been written in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today's winter will be very cold." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why," Ostal asked: "Because the autumn is too hot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Isn't it?" said Gersh: "All things are seeking balance, the autumn is hot, the winter is cold, the deer are running, the wolves are going to go hungry, how bright the day is, and there is night. How dark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs have had a difficult spring, a sad summer, and may have to spend a hungry fall, and a bleak winter - in spring, because they have not been able to grab enough food and slaves from Thunderbolt. They had to take out all the things that human merchants would be interested in in exchange for dried meat and wheat. The hateful thing was because in the Battle of Thundersburg, the relationship between too many soldiers was broken, and those who hate human merchants robbed their gems. When gold and pyroxene, they can't even entangle a sufficient number of orcs to deter and secretly rob them. They can only watch the human beings fully loaded to leave a deep rut on a solid ground. Leaving the food and the thin slaves of the orcs, this is still checked and selected under the tough requirements of Gersh. Before, the human merchants also mixed sand in the wheat, stuffed the mud in the dried meat, and even they The slaves sent are all. Carrying an epidemic with an epidemic. Carrying an epidemic with an epidemic. Bringing a disease with an epidemic disease<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter today will be very cold. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why," Ostal asked: "Because the autumn is too hot?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But isn't it? "Gash said: "All things are seeking balance, the autumn is hot, the winter is cold, the deer are running, the wolves are going to starve, how bright the day is, how dark it is at night." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs have had a hard spring, a sad summer, maybe a hungry fall, and a bleak winter - In spring, because they couldn’t get enough food and slaves from Thunderbolt, they had to take all the things that human merchants would be interested in in exchange for dried meat and wheat. The hateful thing was because it was damaged in the battle of Thundersburg. The relationship between too many soldiers, when those hateful human merchants arbitrarily robbed their gems of gold and pyroxene, they could not even entangle a sufficient number of orcs to deter and secretly rob them, they can only watch the human beings full of The team that left the rut on the solid ground calmly left away - leaving only the food and thin slaves of the orcs, which were checked and selected under the tough requirements of Gersh, before the human merchants In the wheat, sand is added, and the mud is filled in the dried meat, even the slaves they send carry the disease.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&& Nbsp;&nbsp;They can’t even entangle a sufficient number of orcs to deter and secretly rob them, they can only watch the human beings fully loaded to leave a deep rut on the solid ground and leave calmly - leaving only The tortoises barely eat the food and the thin slaves. This is still checked and selected under the tough requirements of Gersh. Before, the human merchants also mixed sand in the wheat, stuffed the mud in the dried meat, and even they sent them.
