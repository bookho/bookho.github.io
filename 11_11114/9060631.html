There is an assorted cookie with more than 10 flavors, super delicious! It is very suitable to eat while reading a book! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants around Mei Mi also have a fascination. At this time, there is a fresh sea breeze through the promenade, relentlessly taking away the joy brought by alcohol. With Chaos, he suddenly woke up and now he is making a big mistake - although Mei Mi is a priest of Fro. ?. ??`? This means that she will not be occupied by a person for a long time, even the king does not work, but in their perception, at least until the heat of the past, the ownership of this petite and pleasant thing should still be young Black caster's hand. Maybe they can meet with them quietly on a certain night, and sip a sip of luscious juice, but like this, face-to-face confrontation with his lover can be said to be a provocation - this conclusion 訇However, when the businessman blew his brain, his messy robes had been soaked in cold sweat. He thought he had taken a step back without a trace, but wait... what are their new owners talking about? He knows who Gülen is, the thief, and then says that she has been given to her own by the former owner. He suddenly put his shoulders down safely, although they are not willing to irritate a fine thief, but two The meaning of the person is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still sighed long in his heart, his father’s pure gold sea chest chain may not be what he wanted The role, he pouted his fingers, the string of sea pearls and a single barge ship worth the same, if not to please the new owner's lover, it should have been hung on the neck of their youngest sister, as her dowry One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gullan is here too." Mei Mei said with a smile: "He is also very happy - Ge Lan..." She prolonged The voice shouted: "Glan... Why don't you come out?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloomy thief came out from another shadow, really damn, he just Want to try the hot emotions can reduce the fear and pain that hangs over him, because this, he did not even choose those female slaves who are overly docile, but pull up from a low-status businessman One of his 妾, the female who may have a part of the Norman blood is not as beautiful as other women, but has a well-defined tall body, she stood taller than Gülen, but Gülen So she picked her because of the eyes full of **. She is also very fanatical, and fanaticism is like swallowing the thieves whole, and the thieves are really in a state of blank thinking for a moment... but when he hears that Krimal is talking, he Lost all interest immediately. He heard that it was another adult - after you knew they were two people, the difference between them was quite clear, and the other adult would never ask for that stupidity - even then, he didn't want to I saw the face again, but he didn't expect it. The plum drink that had been drunk was not only stupidly ran out, but also forcibly called him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief was on the upper body, and in a hurry he couldn’t even find a shirt that he didn’t know was thrown there, with traces of cockroaches, female nails and teeth, unless there was a big cat here, and his woman The companion also followed him up, her bare place was more than Gülen, but apparently she did not mind, or there is some regret that the light here is not strong enough. So that her places where men can get hot are not fully revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," the soul of the alien world muttered: "There is a chaos in your circle." He can only say such a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s on the thief’s eyes, and it’s surprising that Gülen’s eyes are cringing when he’s looking at it, unlike every previous one. He looked at the black caster's look like he saw a dragon that was awakened by him - he was thinking about the problem when he was lying in his room late last night - the one he faced with the deal Man, the thief once thought he was a mage, but he suddenly said that this may not be a common mage in a black robe. The best possibility, he was wearing a red robe before, the worst possibility, he was originally ... wearing a gray robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little question is in its psychological leaven. When he left the pillar hall of the black sandstone, he couldn't help but ask the undead who was once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Can I know? It asks, is there anything special when I am asleep? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I thought I had told you, the Lich said, Gülen came to us. He wants to establish a thief guild belonging to him on the side island, which requires our support and permission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——But he looks at our eyes... even when he is facing the orc, he is not so scared, the soul of the opposite world says that he thinks To escape, you want to kneel down and pray for forgiveness, or you want to end your life... You must have done something, otherwise he will not show that expression, even if he has allergies to the wizard, it is delayed. It has been too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is always keen when he shouldn’t be keen, the lich is thinking - I really threatened him a little, he said, then consider It gave a story of a reduced version of the soul of the outside world, but he did not conceal the things he had threatened to extract the soul of Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——... Is this really ok? The alien soul is hesitant to say that it is not the little idiot that connects the language and is not good. At least, it knows that in this plane, extracting the soul is not something that every caster can do, and this The behavior seems to be quite... evil, or vicious – if the thief really doubts their true identity, then he might get the card that they are holding in their hands...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This is also a helpless thing, the lich said softly, the curse of Gülen... No, or should be said to be a variation of blessing, so that he is no longer threatened by death - as I guess, even if He was killed, he is still able to resurrect intact, isn’t it true? I can only threaten him with his soul - not so worried, the soul warlock can do it, not only the Necromancer or the Lich can do this, and he will know that there are always eyes His - if he guessed it, the threat would become even more powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——......I don’t know, the soul of the outside world is stunned and said that if a white phantom can also make an expression, then its current eyebrows I must have been entangled together, I always feel that you are a bit strange, I mean, since leaving the Norman Highlands - especially after coming to the Dragon Fire Island...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;——So is the trend good or bad? The Lich asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——... Should you say good? The soul of the alien world tempted to ask, he also thought about ways to let the Lich brew the drugs used to relieve the toxicity of the secret medicine and "tobacco" - I did not expect that the former undead can be said to be I took this task calmly and didn't need to be embarrassed. There is no need to analyze the interests, but to know that it is only a slave, but in the eyes of his arrogant cohabitation. I am afraid that a mortal like Bedwin is just a boring frog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——So what else can you say, the Lich asks, do you think I am better? Your brains are so small that I am about to dig a hole with a spoon. Can you use them in some more important places? For example, consider the breakfast menu for tomorrow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. At least for it, the lich is still the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month's time is fleeting, and the heat of the Dragonfire Island has slightly diminished, but what makes the Gnomes and Masters painful is that they must be better than The former is ten times as much as the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of melting steel is red or orange, but the melting of Mithril requires a cyan flame, the former is only one-third of the latter or more Less, this kind of flame is not easily accessible to mortals. One of the two methods is to ask the caster to cast a small fire plate that connects the fire element plane, such as the one in the Alva Master Mage Tower; or As the black caster summons a fire elemental creature as a magical pet. As long as there is a master's order, it can even raise the flame to purple, or colorless, but now it can only maintain the flame in cyan, the gnomes have come up with a huge gold plate. It can fit into three gnomes, only one elbow in depth. The melting point of fine gold is much higher than that of Mithril. They throw the particles of Mithril on the plate, and the small eight-foot fire element below screams with grievances. plate. It is now three feet in diameter, holding the bottom of the plate with four slender feet, four feet standing, and his eyes flipping over. It is also the first time to see a gnome, very curious about this small creature like a miniature human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the gnomes are waiting on the side of the plate, although they can walk away, although it is very important to throw the star sand in Mithril, but their little hands and feet can't touch the plate, and they can't accurately Put the required star sand into the plate. So this thing still requires the caster to do the work, but the gnomes firmly believe that the caster can not master the most critical moments, so they still have to watch them for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world thought about casting a spell to lower the temperature around him. He just screamed as he walked around the gnome McGee - the fire elemental creature The flame can stabilize the temperature, but the fine gold is a very sensitive mineral, it will be affected by the surrounding temperature, then for a moment, the Mithril they invested will be scrapped - fortunately, taking them out can still do other The purpose of the use, but the previous process must all be repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result they had to spend a whole day in the invisible melting pot like a pile of sweet potatoes, plus half a night, it’s finally the secret The success of silver beads smelting - the original star sand (that is, the hard rock powder that has been ground to the finest) is used as a secret silver condensate tuberculosis. Of course, it is necessary to apply spells before, and the same big stone with them. The gnomes were carefully hidden in another place. This rock was used as the core, but it was only taken out when the wizard was casting a spell, and the secret silver beads, the soul of the poor world, waited. For a long time, there is no qualification for even touching. The fire elemental creatures are called away by its owner. The gnomes are swarming up and will be tossed away from the bright red gold plates, even if they wear gloves. The soul still smells the smell of flesh and blood, but he wisely does not say a word. Except for McGee, other gnomes can't wait to dig out the eyes of humans who dare to steal their secrets. If he asks them to wait, maybe Later there will dwarf carrying a small hammer to bash in his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even if their current body is comparable to the dragon cub, they can persist for so long in the high temperature that can instantly turn the steel into a smog. The soul also feels that they urgently need a refrigerator or ice bank. Fortunately, outside their house is a deep and icy lake in the island. This lake, known as the eye of the sea god, is bottomless, in the dark. Like a glimmer of jade, no one else was alarmed. The black caster came to the lake, took off his boots and robe, and jumped into it with his shirt and trousers. The cold lake wrapped him all at once. Up, the caster made an inexplicable sigh, feeling that he was never so comfortable. He said to another soul in the body, and then applied a spell to himself so that he would not be sad and ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
