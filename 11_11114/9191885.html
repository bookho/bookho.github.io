			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-level abyss of the abyss, Grazt, is not terrible or embarrassing, as the poets have said, he has a kind of darkness only. charm. His skin is dark, his eyes are shining with a fascinating aquamarine glow. He is tall and tall, and he is nine feet tall and six-armed snakes when he stands up. Unlike when he was invited to come to the place of Longhuo, today he is wearing a grand and gorgeous king who can make the king of the main material plane self-defeating. He not only wears a robe, but also With a crown like a falling star, with a scepter's hand with gloves, six distinct fingers are placed. The glove is inlaid with gems and Mithril, embroidered with runes. It should be a deterrent magic. Appliances, in contrast, his feet are not wearing boots, just wearing gorgeous ankle bracelets, which are mostly visible on the female feet in the main material plane, on the dark feet of the Wuhuan Prince. Instead, it reveals a mysterious and rough beauty. The devil's six toes have thick nails, and the nails are as clean as a mirror. The tip is slightly curved and folded inward, like an eagle or a cheetah's claw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to remind, Arthur, and the Lich deeply to the "most like the devil" demon Lord, here, this time, self-respect Obviously one of the cheapest products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw you, among the many gravel, you are like a gemstone," Graz said, his voice is like His appearance has a unique charm. He speaks in the abyss language, but none of the people present can understand the language. Arthur and the Lich fit a little bit of a flattering look and bow again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will be working for me for fifty years," Graz said. "The bottomless abyss is for the living of the main material plane... or other Existence is a dangerous place, but dear friends are also a place full of opportunities and wealth, and I am happy to provide them, as long as you will not disappoint me - you may have to withstand many tests, As before, but I also hope that you can cautiously abide by the bottomless abyss and my laws, the war is imminent, and I need every drop of blood to flow for Tanari - how to balance will be what you need to master. One."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But after the war," Wuhuan Prince said generously: "You will also be rewarded for your bravery and wisdom, I am from Not for the people I love, in fact, many people think that I am one of the most human demons, hey, maybe one of them can be removed..." He said with a sigh of relief: "Maybe you are now Can tell me, you need it. What kind of rewards? Spells, scrolls, or magical tools? Or is it an interesting secret, a loyal subordinate, a record that has been forgotten?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The contract, the Lich dared to guarantee that Arthur had the same idea as himself. The contract between Arthur and the mentor was not used passively, but Arthur appeared here as a dragon who is only darker than the black hair. The one or two hundred-year-old lich, bloody battle is not his only choice, unless their mentor Edelhas transferred the contract to Grazite, just like the undead, but did not know the mentor used them two How much interest has been extracted from Grazt, hope not too much, or they have to worry about whether they can leave the bottomless abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s my pleasure and long-term hope for you to work for you," Arthur said. "The respectable Ugly Lord, my wish is to be able to follow. Your left and right, whether in the bottomless abyss, or in any place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sly but some ordinary answer, Ferry Hill is boring Playing a yawn, able to follow Graz's undead, especially a caster, of course, will not become a chess thrown freely, the lich is not a minority for Grazt, and this answer is also vaguely It is pointed out that if he can return to the main material plane, he will become a "fixed portal" of the Wusong Prince in the main material plane. It is not a joke, the devil and the devil will do this, intentionally (their believers and pastors) And unintentional (those who are daring adventurers), someone returns to the main material plane with the abyss token, and then he or others can use this token to open the main material position for the demon and the devil. Surface channel<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tokens are sometimes just a piece of sulphur, and sometimes a jewel, or a bone, a variety of colors, not the same, but the main material plane A few horrific catastrophes have arisen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although ordinary, but for the demons, this is quite attractive, just like Asmo Deuss, the main material position It is the restaurant and game venue of the abyss creatures. They will not let go of any chance, just like a human being in a famine will not let go of any mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably to be able to kick a woman's ass." The Lich replied that for a moment, Arthur thought he was talking about Yige Weil, which was once successfully summoned and imprisoned. One hundred years of Graz's witch, this can almost be interpreted as a sarcasm, but he immediately found himself wrong, but fortunately he did not reveal it at all, if Graz did not peek at his thoughts at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is obviously much more exciting than Arthur. As the most embarrassing demon, Grazt understands the Lich hidden in the discourse without any effort. After that: "Everyone has this expectation," he snickered: "I really hope that you can succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A looming plunder Passed Arthur’s heart. But Grazt believes that today's meeting time is enough, "take them to the Tower of the Storm," he commanded: "Ferke Hill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Tower of the Storm is one of Graz's sixty-six ivory towers. The tower is full of storms and lightning. It can be said that it is the last test of the newcomers to the bloody battle. If it is not a newcomer, but can enter This tower is much more than twice as lucky as those who have been eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Ferry Hill took the newcomer away, Grazt turned to a six-armed snake demon around him: "The lich gives you, Wiyn ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinin may be one of Graz's most trusted demon lords, in the 100 years he was imprisoned by Igo Wilhelm, he The triple aspect of this is that Viking is ruled. During this period, the loyal subordinate did not know how many temptations he refused, but also faced an incalculable assassination. At the moment of Grazt’s return, he gave up his control. The right of the year, back to his own territory - he is as good at using the tongue as Grazt, and the human beings who are tempted by him can build up into a city, but in front of Graz, he has always been ignorant. Language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinyl is not a six-armed snake, his level is higher than the six-armed snake, but he does not want the newcomers to see themselves so quickly The devil's eyeliner is omnipresent. If they see him here, they can be sure that Viking will play as Graz's marshal or general in the future bloody battle, even if people know that this may be new, but Yin did not want this information to flow out too easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Another?" Wei Yin asked boldly, this is something that Ferencair did not dare to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is Ferry Hill," Grazt said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vining was confused, but still respectfully bowed to obey. “Do you want to see other people?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glasz changed his position, “Why not?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————————— ——————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robe warlock, the unlucky one who was almost swallowed by the flying demon, was led to a thief with a thief In front of Zitt’s, on a short journey side by side, the red robe warlock constantly and self-righteously observed the thief—the thief is certainly more luxurious than other thieves, but after all, it’s just a thief. Or is he also a warlock? Can you be valued if you have the blood of a demon? The red robe guessed, but when he passed through the bone tower, he did not see the other person from the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not unprepared. In the main material plane, he has a grand father, and his mother is said to be a succubus. Although it is not Ferry Hill, it also has a prominent reputation in the devil, not to mention, after knowing that he must serve for Grazt for 50 years, his father recruited for the only son. The powerful mage, with no scruples and all the effort to make the red robe have a proud capital, he is so young that he can't see what is in front of him, and he is not afraid of the devil and the bottomless abyss - he even If you want to make a deal with Grazt, as long as Grazt allows him to go back, he can sacrifice it with the soul of a whole Principality besides him. He believes that even if it is a black prince, it will be expensive. The ransom is heart-warming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that his interest was high, his face was red, and he did not notice that his fellow practitioners had retired to the side of the hall without knowing it. Graz's acquiescence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hongpao almost thought that he had succeeded, but the succubus around Grazt just raised one hand tiredly: "Can it? My sire?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
