Uneasy white mist, when he threw a female slave into it, she was burnt red, but in any case, she was much luckier than the former slave, the former almost became the oil in the broth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this festival, he did not use the usual soft sedan, but let his mage remember a floating disc or a floating bowl (he remembers not very clear, But who cares about it?) The spell is given to him, his slaves work together to place a agarwood-covered footless seat covered with gold foil in the center of the invisible bracket, and the ivory seat cushion on the no-foot seat is adorned with When people look at it, they feel cool and clean, and they have a cloud-like white silk canopy that moves with him under the spell of another mage. The slaves are on the side with a little salty. The breath and the strong sea bream of the myrrh and the aroma of the cardamom are coming in. The silk that has been filtered by the silk has become a soft and radiant sun. The ornaments worn on him are like the stars falling from the sky - maybe the gods. Not as good as his current life, the lord thought, but he did not dare to say it out loud, although he thought very much, and there was no faith around him, or that the faith was the slave of the master, but he knew that he was still only Personal class<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be great if human beings could become gods. The lord lamented silently. What he did not know was that a thousand years ago, in that great catastrophe, human beings became gods. However, these have nothing to do with the lord of the East Crown. In order to satisfy the little ulterior lust of the heart, he secretly gestured to his sergeant, and his sergeant ordered the "smart hand" in the slave to be in his white. The robe is embroidered with a pattern of golden lightning. People living in the coastal areas know that the sacred emblem of the storm and the god of the ocean, Talos, is a burst of lightning. His pastors are dressed in black robes and embroidered on them. Teardrops or broken jagged patterns, and the most favored chief pastors or believers, often dressed in blue and white robes, embroidered red stripes with bursting lightning. No one dares to embroider golden lightning on the mountain. This is the privilege of Talos. The embroidery on the East Crown lord can be said to be a madness, but perhaps because the priests of Talos have long been enshrined by him (isolated ) The relationship to another small island, his costume did not attract anyone's attention. At first, the lord of the East Crown had some fear when he was wearing the ritual that was supposed to be held by the priest of Talos, but with the completion of the rituals, the storm and the god of the sea, Talos, did not seem to have fallen. Come, he also became more at ease and took it for granted, this time in addition to this robes. He also hung up the secret silver emblem of Talos on his neck, with a huge gold crown decorated with sea pearls and gems, and three or more fine gold knives in his waist. It must be said that if Talos It is coming to this place, but in the dress of the gods, the half-body and black leather armor, the eye mask and the gloves, there may be dull mortals who mistakenly believe that the lord of the East Crown is the real god. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female slaves who walked on the side of the floating plate were all newcomers, and they also had a look in their eyes. The face is also fresher and the body is softer, although the lord still has such a slight fascination with the daughter who has his hair color and ochre, but the eunuch is right, the sweet peas have been withered three times, he should Look at other scenery, he no longer needs a son, but if it is only a daughter, then you can do as much as you can, and every day a new female slave is born. There may not be any more lamb-like people - he told the magistrate, remember to keep the name Jier, it should belong only to the female slave with pale yellow curly hair and dark brown eyes, which may become a commemorate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord thought this way. While slightly over-heading, the eunuch made a gesture, and the female slave holding the wine immediately stepped forward and sent a cup of blood-red wine to the lord's hand. The lord lifted it and enjoyed it for a while. The red color of the jade-like skull slowly moved it to the mouth. He frowned after a shallow sip, and the big eunuch next to him saw the honey used by the lord, but was refused. "For the sake of the later ceremonies," the lord said with a rare and kind explanation: "I heard the blood red wine." More matching with the ceremonies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he finally failed to drink the whole glass of wine, blood red wine is a boon of pirates, specifically rum Adding hot blood, it is best to just spew out from the blood vessels, it sounds very good, but it tastes disgusting, even the best blood red wine is inevitable, so the lord of the East Crown After tasting a small bite, I decided not to torture my tongue. He was not ashamed when he asked for a honey drink. Anyway, it was his slave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the lords of the East Crown, their sons are a little uneasy, they can be said to be semi-mandatory to invite the East Crown, and the purpose of conveying this is not The eunuchs around their fathers are the mage around their fathers. Although they secretly raised a few masters, they will not show this last power before they are poor, but they enter the column. When they were in the hall, they were ordered to remove the weapons, but they did not collect the rune seals they used to protect themselves. This made them reluctant to reconcile, and then when they saw the Kremar and his party, they almost Completely put down the guards - this sacrifice is not one of them, but poor, Beavis's young disciple, and perhaps his "friends." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your entourage?" Naga asked: "The thief?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He Already left." The soul of the opposite world said: "I asked him to do something for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the East Coast Island, slaves who act privately without the permission of the lord will be sentenced to death," Naga said. "When he is caught, he will be stripped of the skin of his back and abdomen, and then cut off his limbs. "Don't break the neck bone and die, his master, that is, you have to be punished." When she said this, she smiled. "Maybe you don't have to care about this, my dear mage, anyway, humans will only It’s a regrettable thing to die once.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Really.” The souls of the outside world said calmly, and at this time, they There was a very slight vibration around the feet and the foot, and the rolling sound of the gears was rotated. Then, the Cavaliers and Yadel were surprised. The center of the hall, that is, the position where they stood, there was about one The ground of the hundred feet square is sinking down - the laughter of the lords' sons began to grow bigger, and the Cavaliers took a step forward. At the current height, he could still leap up with his wide sword. The mage and the pastor opened up a bloody road. He just had the operation, a neat row of crossbow aligned on him, all arrows flashing his familiar shiny stainless steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is still falling, the Cavaliers immediately close to the Master, and Yadel is also on the other side of the Master, they don’t look scared, Naga is holding On both shoulders, a smug smile is hidden in the mouth: "You should be honored," she said. "Our program is arranged in the first place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the original ground was more than twenty feet away from them, a group of gnomes came up, and they eagerly pointed their little finger at the mage in the trap, the mage, when they gestured. Naga laughs loudly, but if you carefully discern it, you can still see a trace of tension. As a warlock, she tends to do everything she can to destroy her opponent, but the lord of the East Crown does not think so. He insists In his ritual, he dramatized the first rich sacrifice to the god of the storm and the sea, Talos. At this point, his stubbornness is like a squat in the deep sea. Finally, the warlock retreats, but she still Asked two wizards to cooperate Just to be on the safe side, they will not be shot when Naga sends out a signal for help. Today is the day when the dragon blood in her body only surpasses human blood every month. She can feel it is in her. The blood vessels twirled, and even the eyes were covered with a red shade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enjoy all this!" she cried, then sticking out her tongue, a thick cone of acid that was as distorted as a living creature. They are coming to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greet of these acids is a more rapid flame than the coiled on the obsidian disk. The acid is also a liquid, and it is immediately evaporated when it touches the flame. The nausea and smog they all create in this semi-enclosed space that is not too small but not ventilated - Naga moves quickly, closes his eyes, searches for opponents by hearing more sensitive times than usual. The position - at the same time crushed a protective rune seal on the body,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
