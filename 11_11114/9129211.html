I can feel the lungs being cooked in a saucepan. "But I think the first thing we need to determine is whether we are suffering an ambush."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh," said the male lion and the beast. "I don't think I need to be sure. Do you see those birds? They don't always come to us." Heart's "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; at the same time, he put away the wings, suddenly falling, rapid changes in almost his black hair long descent on the back thrown out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The soul of the alien world shouted: "And me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, sorry," said the male lion body animal without any sincerity. "I am not used to it. In fact, I think I still need one year, two years or three years... steady, dear. "And while the sound is still echoing in the air, he has connected a dozen beautiful moves that will make the most discerning referee get a perfect score. It may be a two-and-a-half-week reversal of two and a half weeks. Ten times or one hundred times - followed by violent shocks and shocks, the little spider slammed the cheek in the owner's hood, spurting flames from its cheeks, and putting a flame The eagle-headed lion is burned into a roast bird: "Pay attention to my feathers," cried the new partner of Dragon. "Very good," said the soul of the outside world. "Please also pay attention to me." dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a group of wild The eagle lions and beasts, but they do not have a trace of relationship with the Grenada, even the stinky eggs of the bird will not believe. The yellow-brown feathers scattered around in the air, accompanied by pain and mourning, but the male lions and beasts felt that they should remind their companions that they had been injured in each other’s battles before, and they now seem to be in the second fifty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have anything to throw out to destroy a whole group of spells?" The male lion body animal gasped and asked, he looked at himself distressedly. The chest, the beautiful mane there was torn off a big piece. “Or can we manage to get out of here faster?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you mean to run away?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well," said the male lion and the beast: "I just ran away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to," said the soul of the opposite world: "You can Fly to the place where the wind blows?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said the male lion and the beast: "But I hope that you can give us a satisfactory Answer."dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three eagle-headed lions rushing over them, obviously the birds are also aware that their strength lies in the number, They are always crowded up, which can make the male lion and the beast unable to take care of every side, and leave enough space for the companions to smash and tear, while other eagle lions hover around them. Fang, blocking their way to prevent them from escaping from the encirclement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former leader of the male lions and beasts can feel the wind madly slaping their faces, his side, let an eagle head The beast's claws passed over his forehead, which ruined half of his face, but at least kept his eyes, blood flowing into his eyes, half of the thing dyed red, and he saw the other two. The black shadow that flies over the edge of the field of vision, and the old guys who have played numerous battles with the birds, of course, know their tricks. He vigorously agitates his wings and lifts his chest, still leaving them on his waist ribs. Two deep visible bone scars - but they rushed out at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world has taken out the succubus Frick Hill from the Dimensions bag, it is a plant When I got it, it was baked and ground into powder. Obviously everything is not ready to be generously allowed to be planted again, even if Frick Hill is the daughter of his master, but the lich and the soul of the other world are also Only powder is needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
