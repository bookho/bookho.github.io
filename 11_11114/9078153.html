A small silver bottle, opened, swayed gently on Leona’s cheek, and the Norman’s prince heard the sound of the potion swaying in the bottle, and then smelled a feeling that was not so comfortable. Sweet, but when the maid brought the edge of the bottle close to her lips, she opened her mouth and drank the potion. As soon as the potion entered her throat, the numbness that approximated the itching suddenly dissipated. When she sat up from the bed, she didn't feel anything wrong except for the slight sorrow and floating feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid ignited more candles, which exuded the scent of cloves and jasmine, dispelling the turbidity in the air and the disgusting sweet aroma of the scent For a moment, the room was like a white, golden light shrouded everything, and even the large and bloated body of Anzhen was no longer so disgusting. Her son smiled and swayed from the mother’s lower limbs. The meat underneath is pinched like a dough, and the tentacles of the ampoule hang down and gently pick him up and put it in his arms, the boy’s eyes – just like his mother’s The kind of light blue eyes can be said to be the thin ice on the lake. It can also be said that the deepest night in the sky, people see the skylight on the window, full of trust and warm light, his two small hands naturally fall down On the side, placed on the outside of the rough tentacles, and after he was seated, the ampoule reversed the head - her head was like a nightingale that could turn as much as she could - turning to a sputum in her mouth would not drip on her son The angle of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, Anzhen will tell the credible maid to summon the tailor for the first time, making a cloak for her and not wearing it. Buckle and laced skirt, but as the situation worsened, her body swelled and rotted day after day, she simply no longer wore clothes, even the cloth wrapped around her was abandoned, the boy curled up In her arms, her face intimately glared at her naked ****. And his hand is placed on the other side, just like any temperamental temperament, trying to monopolize the mother's arms, holding it tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona vomited a long breath. Her clothes are in good condition, but the pockets and other weapons that are hung around the waist have been taken away, but for a virgin who has been guided by martial arts for several years (and is the instructor of the best knight), in this room. There are too many things that can be used as weapons, look at the bedpost of the cherry wood. Look at the brass candlestick and look at the obsidian statue! Her gaze was slightly on the statue, because the statue was the thief's god Mask, he was shaped into a forehand holding a sword, the eyes were inlaid with red gems, reflecting the candlelight, drifting light spots Maybe people think that he is alive: "Here is the fine-net guild?" she asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said An Zhen. "This is the tower of my Demon, although it was not finished." Demon certainly wants to have a mage tower belonging to him, but the fine net guild and his mentor pushed him to this. The location is not out of compassion. They have drawn too much money from the White Tower, just like a large group of cockroaches smashed a sap that could have been said to be quite abundant in a small tree. The business before the White Tower was stagnant, Demon’s Tower It was also temporarily suspended because of the lack of gold coins and gems. As for what he had imagined in the past, the luxury practice of painting the secret silver in the tower was also because the elf cut off the trade relationship with Baita and became a wonderful and empty dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if Demon is still alive, he will be ecstatic for the refill of the White Tower’s inner library, no matter in the process, the city It is a seemingly abundant nutrient from how dirty and evil the mud is. He has always been a shallow, narrow-minded, self-serving idiot. Anzhen now regrets that he has not been able to find out in the first place that he is such an ignorant person who is so easy to satisfy and manipulate. If she can, she may kill Demon without the help of the fine-net guild--but they, those people, will find other ways to achieve their goals, perhaps worse than now, even if Anzhen feels The current situation is also difficult to find something to be happy about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she has no retreat. If it is ok, she would like to kneel at the foot of Perant and cry and beg for the forgiveness of him and the one, but now the canal connecting the White Tower and the Starlight River has been closed, just like the relationship between the elves and the ampoule- - After Demon’s death, even the veil of the last layer of affection between her and the fine-net guild has been torn away. She has seen more things and is more clear. She is like a walker. The people in the dark forest, when she touched a huge claw, thought it was a reliable cornerstone, but when their distance was close to the hope that the prey had no escape, the beast would naturally not continue. Hide yourself in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ahn had a little hope before that, I thought that the elves of the Silver Crown jungle would not really give up on themselves; she The secrets obtained from Demon’s relics almost completely collapsed her. She never so clearly realized that she could no longer get the help of the elves. The double attack on the White Tower and the Grey Ridge is still fresh in her memory. It is not uncommon for scattered orcs and half-orcs to sway on this land, and in order to please their gods, it is reasonable to attack an elf and the city they care for, but what Demon left behind It shows that he is not only related to these things, but may even be directly involved in this attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon is not Yadel, Anzhen has no doubt that he will cast spells on his brother, look at the results, how simple, his father is dead, he The eldest brother died, and the only one who might compete with him for this position, his younger brother, was tried and expelled because he killed his brother, but in any case, An Zhen did not think that he dared to indulge with the orcs. One breath. The Singer Elves of the Silver-crowned jungle are different from the Eya spirits of the Jade Island. Their tolerance is even a human being. They can only be self-defeating in their arrows and swords. They have always been the deadly enemies of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, what makes Anzhen even more frightened is that from the only words left by Demon, his mentor may still be the leader of this conspiracy turmoil. No one knows more about the hatred that the elves may have. - They must be looking for this person, and it is possible that they already have vague clues. Perant’s cruelty seems to have already explained this - and now she is no longer possible to enter the Grey Ridge, Gain strength. She drank the potion that Demon's mentor had prepared. Her blood was contaminated. She was a monster and would not be accepted by the Grey Ridge and the Silver Crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona looked at the child with some confusion. She finally understood where her sense of violation came from. The child seemed to be at least three years old or four years old. But in her vague impression, An Zhen’s son should be less than one year old and two years old, and he should not be so tall. Although he looks very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen saw her doubts, she smiled slightly (that is the most ugly smile that Leona has ever seen), "Water of Life, From the royal court of the elves, under the huge silver-crowned tree, the original gift of the god of life, Angris, when my mother left the silver-crowned jungle, the king of the elves, Yinggewei, took it out of the spring water. And then handed it to me in the Mithril bottle, it can dispel the sinister and healing damage that you think too much. She left it to my father, and the father left it to me, I I gave it to my son again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was injured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't Said to be injured," An Zhen sneered awkwardly, the blue muscles twitched under the bright lights: "They gave him the potion, the kind they gave me, although the amount is much less, And it is also mixed with dragon blood - the most pure dragon blood, His Royal Highness, Dragon Blood. Especially the real dragon blood, it is really a good thing. Not only can it bring strength, but it can also help humans grow up quickly - probably they didn't expect my body to be so fast because it couldn't adapt to the power of dragon blood. Fine net needs Baita and Lushan Qiu has a lord who can be controlled by them - Luzer Dagong is not a good choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona is a natural heir to the throne She also watched her father and the king play a similar trick. If a lord or a knight on a territory lost all the direct blood, then the lord who gave the land to him was entitled to take back the reward. The White Tower and the Mt. Hill can be said to be a land of milk and honey even if they lose the shelter of the elves. Moreover, it is not the Grand Duke of Luzer who angered the elf. He can try to re-establish a firm and intimate relationship with the elves after recovering the white tower and the hills; if the only lord of the territory is still alive The toddler, that is another matter. As the owner of the lord, Luzer can also designate a guardian for him, or raise him to receive his own territory, which is managed by his own officials. It is also common to govern the White Tower and the Mt. But no matter the result, the fine-net guild that has become the giant hand of the entire white tower and the hills will be the first goal of his expulsion. Therefore, on the one hand, the fine-net guild tried to delay the time when the dragon's blood finally broke out in the body of Anzhen. On the other hand, Demon's mentor also sent another prepared potion to encourage Demon and Anzhen children to be ordinary children. Fast growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps ignorant civilians will wonder how Ahn and Demon’s marriages can only give birth to such a large child for a few years, but in the nobility and the royal family, this practice is sometimes there, in any case, the confirmation of inheritance rights. Instead of using your eyes and ears, you use magic. Magic doesn't care about the age of the people who are tested. They only care about whether the blood is pure. The problem is that people who take this potion can't live comfortably through the age of thirty. Some will die before adulthood, but it is obvious that the guild and Demon's mentor don't care if the child is healthy and happy, they only need a little time to let them finish what they need to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I gave him all the water of life," An Zhen said tiredly. "All, one drop is not left, at least it seems that he is in his body." The dragon's blood and potion have been cleaned up, but I don't know how."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want me to do?" Asked straightforwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will release you," said An Zhen. "My maid will take you out of here, there will be a knight, you will be able to meet you soon." The friends met." She lifted the barely shaped arm and gently placed it on the child's hair. Leona shook a little, and she seemed to be able to guess the ampoule. The idea is: "My condition is to take him away, take my son and let him be with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want me to hand him over To Yadel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not," said An Zhen. "If I just want to hand him over to Yadel, my knight can do it." Yes, I know that he is with you now, on the Dragon Fire Island, and has already achieved Rosada’s forgiveness.” When she saw Leona’s slightly surprised look, she smiled arrogantly, and everyone thought She was just a skeleton and a body, but she finally learned something from them: "But I don't want Yadel, but you."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think I have anything special," Leona said. "Even if Highland Norman has modified the inheritance law, before Bedwin's charges have not been cleared, I will It’s not Norman’s heir to the throne, it’s just an ordinary exile.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An芮嗤 smiled: “But you know, since someone has pushed Inheritance law amendments, then they will continue to fight for you to return to Norman Wangdu, not as an ordinary exile warrior, but as the king of Norman, the first heir of the throne to go back, this is only a matter of time ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
