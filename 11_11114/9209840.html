"A bard heard from a frightened farmer that there is a tower of the devil. Wrapped in viscous vines, moving from the sea to the land, there are countless poor souls trapped inside, their heads sticking out from the narrow window, pale is like a layer of flour"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just beside him, the Elf Ranger holding a hot cup of honey suddenly showed a happy smile. "Don't want to say something?" Kremar," he looked sideways at the mage or warlock who was busy on the desk, "although your whimsy was amazed by many people."Kerry is referring to the elf spells in the silver crown jungle. In order to perfect the Crayfa, the soul of the alien world is not only his mentor, the demigod lich Edelna - in each plane In a novel, the protagonist can often become powerful or wise because of various ideas and theories from another world, but in fact, compared to this, whether it is a mage, a warlock or a pastor needs high intelligence and is full of gods. The electorate, the devil's plane, and the other plane's human beings in IQ—from the heart, do not predominate. If you must say that they have something to commend, it is probably another plane that is extremely developed. The universal message of the sea gives them the vision and imagination<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world is not arrogant, nor has it ever produced a greedy heart because the lich leads the power it touches, but he never scorns And the humans and people who look at it casually, it can be said that it is sincerely believed that most of the people they are exposed to can be said to be admirable strong (both physical and spiritual), even It was just Mei Mi, who was only a pastor of Froy. She also had the tough and tenacious vitality like wilderness wildflowers. Even if it was trampled in the mud many times, as long as there is sunshine, breeze and rain, it can When you are not aware of it, you raise your head again and greet the whole world with bright and bright faces. Their companions are surprised that Gülen will actually marry Meimei, after all, especially for them. Pastor Froe’s plum is a very dangerous thing.But the soul of the opposite world always feels that the soul of Mei Mi and Ge Lan may still have such a little light, although it is only a little, like the candle in the wind, it will be extinguished at any time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the love between them, the dispute between Birdwin Don Clay and the daughter Li Naina can only be embarrassing, early in the past Before Devin and Leona died, their love had already withered. The only thing left was the sorrow of death and the pain deep in the soul. If the girl Li Naina buried her love, He can stand up firmly and become the queen behind Norman, supporting his two sons to grow into a king and a duke. Then Baldwin’s escape is obviously a despicable act that cannot be explained except for cowardice. The only place he deserves to agree with may be that he did not appear in Norman Normandy as a Norman after the funeral of Leona, or else everything must be a joke, and Highland Norman The spiritual pillar of man also undoubtedly shakes and collapses<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be why he was more inclined to Gülen from the beginning, and even had the reason to attack his plum with the thief instead of Birdwin. The soul of the alien world bites the tip of the feather pen and thinks that the mineral ink spreads over its tongue, bringing a bitter bitterness - it pulls out the nib and looks back, puts the nib back back, and re-bites it with the teeth.For the problem of the elf, it just shrugged and shrugged. Since there is a super cruise ship, how can it be equipped with enough lifeboats? When planning the Crayfa, it did not intend to make it a symmetrical face of the Titanic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the owner of Créfa, Krimaar knows the atrocities committed by the priests of the Storm God earlier than anyone, he is not surprised, Not horrified, standing in the perspective of the soul of the outside world, Crayfa existed from the beginning to save the lives of the slaves. Its construction saved no less than 30,000 lives, and it can be at the last moment. Rescuing all the residents of Crefa and the Normans on the Longhuo Island can be said to have achieved value beyond its own, it will only be gratified; as for the Lich, his assets have always been like every caster. Within his tower, the black tower is safe and sound, as for Crayfa, under the guidance of Edelna and the help of the elves, and the theory and philosophy of another plane, for the related magic and construction of him It’s already well known, although Crayfa has sunk, but the new Crayfa reappears above the blue waters, which is the problem of time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last instrument was signed by Krimall’s current pseudonym, but as a document passed between mortals, a pseudonym and a badge are sufficient In the past, once the son of a consul, and the director of the pastor’s candidate, Yadell, looked at the instrument, rolled it up, stuffed it into a reel, and placed it in a flat scorpion with its companions.Next, they will be sent to all directions, all the princes and courtiers of the "Falun Empire", the knights will greet the emperor's messenger - a dragon knight - although everyone knows the emperor of Fallon It’s just a beggar, but it’s because they need to erect his flag to destroy the balance that has lasted for nearly a thousand years, attacking their neighbors and enemies, but not as they want. To ridicule and disregard an emperor's messenger, no one knows whether he really brought the emperor's will. Of course, the success or failure of the war mainly lies in food, weapons and soldiers, but with a paper order, they can put an end to many double doubts. Eyes and messy tongue<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the emperor who fell behind him...emmmmmm, of course, if he really wants to come out... or come up with more silver dragon eggs and time... the soul of the outside world suddenly shows a very similar to the lich The smile, as the saying goes, construction is a long and difficult thing, destroying it is faster and more relaxed, no matter what kind of person he launched, when he sat at the highest point of the arrow, sitting When the Emperor of the Fallon is on the throne, it is impossible to not breed ambitions. After all, everything is already in his reach, and the distance that can restrict him is so far away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalal saw this smile, which made him subconsciously think of the first time they met, at that time, he only thought he had encountered one with himself. A friend of equal age, although he later knew that Cremari could be older than his grandfather, but the original image was always lingering, and just in the moment, he was shocked. The wizard of the black hair has also grown up - yes, grow upHe knows that it is a bit ridiculous to use this term to describe the change of the other side, but he himself has grown from a naive child to a reliable elder, even though Rosada has allowed him to maintain the appearance of young people. However, the young outside does not mean that his vicissitudes have regained his youth and are full of vitality.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he met Cremari again in Thunder, he still looked like a child and survived under the protection of the Elf Ranger Kerry. There is nothing wrong with this. The lifespan of a half-elves is much longer than that of human beings. Serving for sixty years in the gray ridge is not so much the power to strengthen the gray ridge, but rather to make these children destined to be displaced. We know more about the outside world and hone our own swords - Krimar is one of them.But after that, they encountered so many things... I don’t know if I’ve thought about it myself. In Kremar’s body, there is always a sense of violation that cannot be ignored. It is reasonable to say that no matter time, Or the great changes they have encountered are enough to make a person change dramatically. Even if there is no change, at least some traces will be left, but the black-haired dragon is always the same. Yadel can’t say that he is cruel and cruel. But he obviously has always stayed out of the way. He has almost no desires, no desires, no ambitions. If he is a refugee without power, no appearance, no blood, no surname, except for his own life and soul, this situation Maybe you can get an explanation, but Krimaar is not<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until now<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you must tell Yadell to describe it, it’s like a person who once wanted to sleep suddenly woke up abruptly. Although he was sleeping, he still listened. Seeing and feeling, just not willing to take the initiative to do something, but now, he made a decision and started the action.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, before the action, the soul of the outside world had a deep conversation with Kerry Ben and Yadel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both Keriben and Yadell, they are trying to build an alliance against the Emperor of France and try to dispel his roots, that is, those ambitious small countries loose When the ally's relationship, the soul of the outside world put forward a new idea - "The long-term must be divided, the long-term must be combined"This is a rumor from another plane, but here it is not necessarily an empty talk."Yes, its idea is different from the former two, even the Lich. If the emperor and his nominal courtier are a sword, then there is no doubt about it. It is easier and easier to deflect the direction - it is not a bad thing to let Falun reproduce this plane.The southern countries were almost all hostile to each other in the millennium of division. It is not goodwill and compassion that makes them calm, but an embarrassing balance. Every country has no enemy. And their in-laws and allies will become hungry wolves at any time. They are treacherous and greedy and violent. The rich output will never satisfy their appetite. It will only make them more coveted to others' inner treasury. Maybe, The plan of the conspiracy god, Sheikh, only gave them a reason.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Falun is a slaveAt that time, Yadell raised his own doubts. In all of them, perhaps only the situation before the ugly chicken can compare with him. He used to be an exiled criminal. His status is similar to that of a slave. He has seen slaves, and They have lived together, and their deep suffering is something that young people like Yadell, before the age of twenty, can’t imagine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then don’t be slave"The soul of the opposite world said: "Slavery was originally a recession."Before it came to this plane, slavery was already at the end of the battle. Except for the Longhuo Islands, Grenada and some remote countries, the power and status of the people no longer kept slaves - now Falun The emperor still wants to rely on slaves to build the glory of the millennium. It is impossible. People who have seen the light will never want to go back to the darkness. In the southern countries, because of slavery, big and small. The riots came one after another, but the emperor’s eyes and ears were temporarily closed, invisible and inaudible, but he must believe in Kremar because only they regarded him as an emperor, not a ridiculous harlequin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Grand Duke, the kings may be willing to recommend an emperor to end the chaos, but if the emperor wants to be the master of the slave and wants them to be a slave, it is simply impossible, even if it is his ancestor. It’s impossible for Edell’s father to return to this plane again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the referral, this is also an interesting idea put forward by the soul of the outside world, it does not want to create a arrogant dictator, in addition, In the countries of the South, there are certainly some bad rulers, but there are also grand princes or kings who are neutral, more tolerant and kind. They are now standing on the stand against Falun, let them change their minds, of course. Not an emperor's messenger, his hands are empty, his tongue can be done like a lotus flower - but if he can become the emperor, even further, become an emperor, I am afraid no one can take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So?” Kerry asked, “How many times do we have to choose?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first soul that appears in the opposite world is a "seven", seven is a magical number on the western continent of another plane, and the seven electors also correspond to religion. The seven sins in the middle, "How about the nine," it said while thinking, "plus three pre-alternative emperors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twelve "Adelaire said: "Is there more people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Dai, a three-bedroom center, and four parties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Except the emperor, the candidate for the election is singular," Kerry said. "You are not prepared to give them too much time to hesitate." The number of emperors is double, so it is very likely In pairs of a draw, the longer the recommended time, problems will increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the emperor willing?" Yadel asked again, and he answered the question himself: "Yes." He said: "Otherwise, wait for those people." When the goal is achieved, he will die in obscurity. No one cares about how the banner ends up. Even on the battlefield, it always flies over people's heads."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then we should probably try to avoid it," Kerry said gently. "I, and Ai Luohe and Lucie, after all, people are still jealous of the elves." What he did not say is that if people are aware Elves are secretly pushed to the whole situation, and their efforts will collapse like an embankment that intercepts floods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I not know that there are elves here," said the soul of the alien world: "There are only half devils with sorcerer blood." Brd/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel smiled and said: "There is also a fallen pastor." He is very familiar with this. In Grenada, he is accompanied by the fallen pastor. Beside Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need your help," the soul of the opposite world said sincerely: "Please look at me, remind me when I am about to go in the wrong direction." Even in another plane, the model of the election of the emperor can only be said to be a glimpse in history. It only finds its record in the broken memory, and no one can guarantee what will eventually change. Look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it wants to give it a try, try it, whether it can end this war with half the continent with the fastest speed and the smallest loss There are black smoke, mourning and blood everywhere on the earth. The plague is in the dark, how beautiful and rich the former countries of the South are, how desolate and desperate the southern countries are now... Their turmoil also directly affects other The price of wheat, rye and rice is rising every day in the country. In some places, there is still no price. The king and the Dagong constantly enact new laws to punish those businessmen who dare to hoard food at this moment. Merchants are stripped. Clothes, put in cages, stuffed with nailed casks, or broken limbs fixed on wheels to eat for crows every day - what it means, maybe ordinary civilians and slaves are not But the elves and humans in this room will not be unclear. If the wars in the southern countries have been more than a year, or just the time of farming, the wheat and other grains have been greatly reduced. Output, it must have a local famine. Merchants have already seen this, so even if the punishment is cruel and the crime is heavy, they will have to pay for the profits of several times, dozens of times, hundreds of times ... in the future - if handled properly, they will not only be able to take advantage of it. Counting money is more likely to become Sir Alex or the Minister... This kind of thing has not happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
