			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just before people wanted to blame or take away the daring priest Fro, she shook her body slightly and fell to the feet of the king without warning. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cockroach goes from the disgusting ground to pull the arm of the plum, her arms are round and the skin is smooth, if it is placed on any day before, this little guy may They will be fascinated by the gods, but now in his heart, except for his mother, no woman can compare with the noble Princess. She is a born-born man who wears a crown. It shouldn't have appeared in a multi-lingual disease, and should not stay here - but she still came here and stayed, because of this, those who want to be more spiritual The dead people in the city and the living people burned all the casters who had burned them, and did not dare to throw even a fireball into the city - and her courtier, the friend of the lord of Thunderbolt, Birdwin, fought the devil. In addition to the root causes of the plague, so that those who have been lucky enough to survive the disease can be healed - and in the process, she is sitting in front of the window where everyone can look up, as she promised Her unselfish love and sincere eyes comfort the people who have been tortured by death and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the black cloak of the god of death is like the dark clouds of winter, then Princess Leona is like a pure one to the people of the multi-spirit The flames brought warmth and light to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in their new lord, Lord Marleno Lorenos asked the knights of the knights (he knows very well that the charges in Baldwin have not yet been eluted) In the past, there would be no knights who would like to be with them.) If you are willing to wear a helmet for the owner of the former Thunderbolt, he can say that he is happy to come out and express his willingness to accept this task - in him When the companions were still hesitant, the latter worried that the deputy of the monarch and the fallen knight in the ceremony might affect their reputation, while the former firmly believed that as the highland Norman The king who values ​​the trust and admiration will not be a despicable villain. The crime on his body will be washed away one day sooner and later, and he will achieve a greater and higher honor than now, and by that time, he will also This story can be written into your family tree as part of your memory. Or talk to your little grandson. He was encouraged by the fact that he was rewarded in advance - after the ceremony, Princess Leona asked about his name, and Sincerely thanked him. Also take off a ring as a reward - the ring is now firmly placed on the middle finger of the right hand, a little disrespectful, Princess Liona is not only more similar to a young man in the face, Even the length of the fingers and the thickness of the joints are almost the same as those of the males, but what about it? In the heart of Otaru, she is as clear and clean as the morning light of summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the priest Fro, who fell to the ground, was like a pile of sludge wrapped in silk clothes. He bent his knees, pulled out the cockroach, and placed it under the nose of Plum, and the surface of the cockroach suddenly covered with a thin mist. "She is alive," he said, he was full of unwillingness to let his beloved weapon touch. Such a rude and vicious woman, but can not let the princess or the caster do this thing: "She just passed out - I will take her to the prison."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." His Royal Highness Princess stopped in a timely manner: "No," she said, her tone firm, so as not to be misunderstood by the meaning: "Get her up and send it. In a clean room, the priest of Ilmot was asked to see her situation," she said. "If she is ill, give her treatment. If it is for other reasons, give her wine and candy. Let She took a good rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she insulted you." Xiao Yan said angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Aona gently shook her head. "I think she was only stunned for a while, so she will make this kind of awkwardness." The behavior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嫉妒?!" Mullen’s uncle said with amazement: "But she is a priest of Fro." She confuses from the wall. Next torch, move it closer. The pure gold bell rolled up between the rosy robes with a thin chain, shining with a fascinating glow: "Did she just hang the symbol of Pastor Fro on her own belt for fun?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is indeed a Froor Pastor." Birdwin said that he suddenly felt a little embarrassed, although he was allowed to share a tent with him and enjoy it. When I was in a pleasant time, I didn't think it would be an embarrassing thing. Everyone knows that Fro's pastor is the most common and favorite way to use it. One of the most primitive desires of humans and humans is their money bags, their jealousy, their swords, their poison and their honey. A Fro's wild priest, the kind of stunner who can't live in a fixed temple, can only wander around without a fixed place, when they need silk fat powder, they are with businessmen; when they need accommodation When eating and drinking, they are in bed with the farmer; when they are on the road, they need to be protected from being caught by the goblin, they are hooked up with the mercenaries; sometimes they meet empty-handed boys, and even if they are not so handsome If they are strong enough, they don't mind spending a warm and wild night with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Plum quickly sneaked into his cloak, Baldwin did not refuse, the matter between men and women was like breathing for Pastor Fro The heartbeat is as natural and ordinary, and he is also very clear that Mei Mi is just to win more chips. In this team, the most useless, probably the most likely to be abandoned is her, of course, she is a pastor, but Her power is not stable, and there is also a caster among them. His spells and reels are also able to perform some of the duties of the pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birdwin sighed involuntarily. He had to thank Mei Mi. When he was lying alone in the room, she had been serving him, but she...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But a Froor Pastor is not, and should not be embarrassed," a voice helped him to say what he was saying. Birdwin was shocked and immediately became Mullen’s uncle, a The stereotyped lady is talking: "It’s also a very ridiculous thing to even have a wife, Froof's pastor," she wore two light brown eyebrows: "They are just godly instruments, no family, no father. There is no husband, no son, this is the rule of Freuding—a pastor cannot violate the doctrines of the gods she follows, unless,” the older lady said with awkwardness: “She is an unbelievers, still a "Personal believer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is only impulsive," Liona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a curse." Mullen’s uncle said, "His Highness. But I am willing to follow your will," she said to her maid: "will She lifted it up and sent it to my husband's room, the room he had never been to. I think that place would be right for her - ask the priest of Ilmot to show her, no matter what she wants to eat Something to satisfy her is satisfying her. Anyway, the food in the city is still very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her maid quickly completed the task assigned by the owner, Mei Mi Was taken away and the torch was reinserted back into the wall. Baldwin, who was originally behind Leona, was unintentionally pushed away by Mullen’s uncle, forced to give up his position. The lord who had violently angered the countless orcs touched the cheeks of the numb, cleverly did not do it. Any action against it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holy Highness," Mullen’s uncle said with respect: "Please forgive me, but can I know what you are planning?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can," Leona said: "I want to stay in Doral for a few days until my uncle, the new king of Norman, Highland. The punishment given came to me, lest his knights and mages madly disturb the entire Highland Norman in search of my trace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mallen The uncle was silent for a while: "After that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will leave with Baldwin to find ways to prove his innocence or redeem his sins. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That may take a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All good eyes will look at us." Leona said: "We will let them See our hearts and souls.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Will you go back to Norman in the Highlands?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes," Leona said categorically: "Yes, we will return to Norman in the Highlands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mulren’s uncle showed a relief Smile: "So," she said, "Do you need me to do something? I know you don't need gold coins or gems, but for example, the priest of Fro..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the turn of Leona’s turn to be puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't think she needs to be well, quiet, long-term rest, my dear His Royal Highness? Let a priest who is mad and physically weak It’s a bit too much to follow you everywhere—yes. Yes, I’m talking to you, Mullen’s uncle is slowing down and walking side by side with Birdwin. A serious question: “I think she needs a rest. Last month, oh no, maybe one year will be better - I have a quiet and affluent manor on the outskirts of Dorin, which is perfect for patients to recuperate, and I promise that she will get the best treatment and care. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin is a little hesitant. After all, Mei Mi is still a witness, although he still does not know how to use this testimony, and Mei Mi is just a Fro priest. Don't say a teacher or a warlock, a thief, a mercenary may put her in a land of eternal glory - and he has promised Mei Mi, he will accept her and protect her.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When she is cured," Mullen’s uncle seems to have seen his thoughts: "I will hire a team of reliable mercenaries and send her to wherever she wants to go. . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will try to contact you," Baldwin decided to give in, he did not want to abandon plum, the problem is that Mei Mi’s behavior is too Rude, and then Leona will surely become an indispensable part of the team. If Mei Mei is still there, the situation between them will be very embarrassing. "If she is willing to go somewhere else, let She went there, if... she is willing to continue to follow us, please bring her to us. "I only hope that time can erase this less pleasant memory - at least to lighten the worst part, or maybe they have arrived at the Dragon Fire Island, then he just needs to find a Fro Temple to stuff her into Just go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Mullen's uncle said with a smile: "I promise that if you can see her again, she will be happy and healthy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking at?" Kerry whispered, and from the time the plum fell to the ground, the black casters began to look at their every move with their eyes wide open, ears too - Although his ears are neither long nor pointed, the elves can still feel that they are high and straight, and maybe they will turn around and not let go of a star and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"House."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is generally only born between women, and occasionally born in men, or between men and women using various coincident drug authorities and public opinion to create a facial reputation for their enemies. A battle with minor or major damage such as life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" There is no doubt that "the soul from another plane has repeated one after another: "No doubt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stayed in Doral for a full twelve days. I don’t know why, the highland Norman’s will is especially slow, but as Dylan expected Liona was deprived of her surname, inheritance and territory. Besides the treasures brought out from Wang Ting, she can say that she has nothing - but the eldest daughter of the old king is ready, even if her heart will still stab it. But she will like her appearance as perseverance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you can accept this," said the owner of the multi-ling, Marleno Lorenos, young man, "His Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not the Princess of Norman Norman," said Leona. "Don't call me my Highness, Mullen, you can call me Leona - just like a friend. That's right, we are friends, and helping a friend doesn't require compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are always my Highness, and, this is not a reward. Mullen said, while taking out a few delicate jewels from the bag: "This is a gift, a gift to a friend - please be careful, they come from a multi-spirited people, and their value may not be as good as yours." A pin, we hope that you bring them, this is a commemoration, but also a token and a sign."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona took the jewels, Mullen didn't lie, the bases were almost all sterling silver or gold-plated, and the gold mixed with impurities, the inlaid gems were not so expensive, the red agate coal fine moonstone, etc. Say something different, that is, their bases are engraved with different names, "Yes," she said softly: "I am very happy to get this gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you need it," Mullen said: "You can call every name - each one, their heart belongs to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Mallen?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some reels and wands." Mullen said calmly, as if just gave a few copies. The identity of the serf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't work," said Leona. "Sorrow loses strength, but still retains wealth. The thief's nose is very sensitive."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't worry about us," Mullen said happily: "My knights are returning from the silver crown jungle, with pints (half liters) Snow honey. As long as there is snow honey, I can always recruit a strong mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you," he continued, his eyes passed A little worry: "Your way forward will be difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Leona still received those scrolls and wands, she knows Mullen’s The idea is correct. The new king has recovered his wanted and rewards, but her aunt Aunt has not recovered the reward and doubled the amount of the reward. Anyway, she not only has a lover who will make money, but also A very profitable son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They separated Dolly at the dawn of the eleventh day, and only sent them to Mullen and his uncle, and his cousins. One of the sisters will become the wife of Mullen one year later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They will be a good couple," Liona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Krimaar is in his heart to admire the means of Uncle Mullen. Since that day, Mei Mi has not appeared again, and no one even mentioned her name. She seems to have never appeared before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
