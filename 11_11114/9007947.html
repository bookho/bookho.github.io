The concave corner, a remote village located about four hundred and thirty miles away from the king's capital; later, in order to avoid the pursuit of Dylan and the wizards, they had to give up the original plan and once again use the unoriented transport reel, magic They were sent to the multi-spirit, the multi-spirit and the concave corner in almost one dimension, that is, the distance from the king is almost the same, except that the concave corner is located on the east side of the Norman Highlands and the Doring is located on the east side of the Norman Highlands. ●⌒,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely because of this that Leona can catch up with them at this critical moment and promptly rescue them from Dylan’s hands. Freedom and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that they will stay in Norman in the Highlands, and the lords and the consuls will not allow Byrdwin, after all, the charges on him have not yet been Washing, no one dares or accepts a sinner of the monarch, except for the lord of the spirit, Mullen, but neither Leona nor Birdwin wants to put a heavy weight on the child’s shoulders. Responsibility for other places, such as the Bibi Dyke, which Kerry is familiar with, its consuls should also consider the exchanges with the Norman Norman and the views of the people. Based on the reputation of the Elf Ranger, they may be able to cast a little goodwill. Allow them to stay in the city for a few days to rest and prepare, but it takes almost a long time to settle down, which is almost impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we still have only the Dragon Fire Island to go," said the thief. "Even if we have one more princess."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I have to remind you," Leona said. "There is no king of Norman in the Highlands. Only if Leona can, I want to be a warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then can I just say your name directly?" Gülen asked boldly, Leona probably was the second one after the caster. A professional and heartfelt companion, she used to be the daughter of a ruler. Only a little bit can she inherit a whole vast expanse of the kingdom. The thieves are very clear about the positions of these noble people. They also control the kind and evil. people. It's like moving white and black pieces on the board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No,” said Leona, who said that when the thieves were annoyed that they had taken a wrong step because of impatience, she continued: “You must call me Ms. Leona.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black caster who is looking through a spell book sneaked out. Sitting cross-legged with his knees, Kerry Ben, who carefully maintained the longbow, shook his head with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are watching." Kerry is holding a string of wax and rubbing it evenly on the bowstring. He inevitably smashes the monster with a bowstring. There was dirty blood and mucus left on it. In the multi-spirit, he only had time to wipe it with a fine cotton cloth. Now he can finally find a little time to take care of it. "It’s in the semi-magic pocket. That spell book?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Kremar closed the whole book. Transferred to the elf to see its cover, the cover of this spell book is framed as a noble and beautiful decoration of a lady's favorite decoration, pure gold characters are inlaid with various precious gems, do not know whether it is the role of magic or The sun shines, and when you look at the elf, you will feel the pain in the eye. The mage points to the lower right corner of the book cover: "Look here," there are two thin cracks: "This is the one that the priest Illmott gave me. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf was slightly surprised: "Is this rune dropped from this spell book?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar nodded, the rune was like a back word. In this quirky and bizarre world, he was the first to see familiar words, feeling very cordial. The runes embellished in the spell book are almost all of this shape. So when he saw the blank, he almost filled the rune block without thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can other spells also cast magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Although the spell The runes on the cover of the book are very similar to this rune, but Kremar feels that they are similar only to appearance, and more correctly, the former is like a poor imitation of the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell me what kind of spells are recorded in this spell book?" The elf asked cautiously. Asking a mage about his spells in his spell book is a rude and dangerous thing, but Kerry believes that Kreima will not lie to him or have a heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact," the soul of the opposite world said with a sorrowful face: "I don't understand what I wrote inside." He carefully opened the spell book and blocked the pages with his sleeves. Only a small horn was left. He didn't seem to have any warnings or threats when he tried to read the spell book, but the undead person reminded him that some spell books would be hidden by the master of the spell book. Magic traps, they will swallow those clumsy domestic servants or arrogant apprentices. There are times when the spells copied on the spellbook are too powerful, thus hurting those mortals or talented casters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry had just turned his head and turned his head quickly. His eyes were like a needle piercing with a venom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry Ben?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Kerry Ben took a deep breath. In his tone, he groped out of the bag of a potion from the priest of Immot, drank two, and the pure magical power and the life of the herb instantly blended into his blood. And as the blood flows to his stinging eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your eyes are bleeding." Leona said that the elf felt like a warm hand was approaching himself, then the soft touch of cotton, he turned to Lee Ao Naji expressed her gratitude. She took the cotton cloth to block her eyes. His eyes were slightly hot. After waiting for a while, Kerry opened his eyes. He saw his companion Bodwin Leona watching with concern. Gülen and Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the spell book?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my pocket," said Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That may be a spellbook written in the Dragon language," said the elf. "Receive it, don't let anyone other than you see it." "He said this, but he was full of doubts before leaving the silver-crowned jungle. They had guessed that the other half of Crimare might come from a dragon, when he read the spells written in the dragon language." He can almost be confirmed without being hurt, but if so, he should have been taught the dragon language, whether it is reading or writing, but Kremar said he can't read the above text... I don't know much about the dragon. People may think that he is an abandoned dragon who can perceive every child of his place, there is no possibility of losing children, but the elves know that they never discard their descendants, if their children are too weak Or clumsy, the dragon will only eat them without hesitation. Kerry remembers that Krimaar mentioned that his father had a servant when he met with Master Alva. Well, it is very likely that his father should be a human with a dragon, a noble person or a lord who loves the Eya spirit, and Kreima never mentioned his mother. Then the black Aya elf may have died before returning to her family before he could remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is this a dragon?” the soul of the alien world said with amazement: “I thought it was a trace of the hen that had overturned the ink and then walked around the book.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf’s eyes still have some pain, but Kreima’s words still make him laugh: “Don’t let any dragon hear this.” He says. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Kerry’s eyes were hurt, they stayed in the woods for a while, and then reappeared after the sun was no longer so glaring. The pedestrian stopped when the sky turned into a soft violet, and Baldwin and Gülen cleared a flat place in the recess connected by the two hillocks. The hills on both sides and the dense grass perfectly blocked it. With the breeze of the night with them, and their horses<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think it will rain?" The thief asked, this place is good, the problem is The rain will turn into a mud filled with water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be no these days." The elf said that he would extend a dry branch to the front of Cremal, "fire." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world is busy pulling a bug that has gotten into his robe. He leans over his body and blows it gently. A section of the branch immediately violently burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry will burn the branches into the small bonfires they have already prepared, and the fire will gradually increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found a few eggs," Leona said. "There are some berries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is the egg of the black-necked pheasant," Gülen took over and looked over for a moment: "It won't leave its nest too far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Isn't this enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The loss of children is too poor, or let them reunite in our stomachs." The thief said, then go far His figure soon disappeared into the dull smog, and the sound was not as loud as a panicked voles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After how long they didn’t wait, they heard footsteps again, and this time the footsteps didn’t know why it was heavier and more dragged than before. "Glan?" asked Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Birdwin stood up alertly, holding the wide sword that Leona gave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not Gülen." Kerry Ben said: "Yes..." At this time, he no longer has to say anything, because they have already seen the one. customer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mei honey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; describes the wolverine priest Froe to open the blade of grass and appear in In front of them. She looked so uneasy and looked dry, she was wearing the rosy silk gown, but only a few tassels were left in the hem, and the robes were torn from the neckline, revealing nearly half of the skin. There are bruises and bite marks on the top, and several bite marks are visible in the bones. The dark red blood is dotted like sweet peas on her soft chest and waist. As long as she is not an idiot, she can guess what she has suffered. Kind of torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry remembers that Krimaar mentioned in his meeting with Master Alva To his father is a servant, then it is very likely that his father should be a human with a dragon, a noble person or lord who loves the Eya spirit, and Kreima never mentioned his Mother, then the black Aya elf may have died before returning to her family before he could remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the dragon language?" The soul of the alien world said with surprise: "I thought it was a hen that overturned the ink and then in this book. The traces left after the book walked around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf’s eyes still have some pain, but Kreima’s words still make him laugh: "Don't let any dragon hear this sentence," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Kerry’s eyes were hurt, they stayed in the woods for a while, and the sun was no longer so glaring, and the group was in the sky. When it turned into a soft violet, it stopped, and Baldwin and Gülen cleared a flat place in the recess connected by the two hillocks. The hills on both sides and the dense grass perfectly blocked the night. The breeze with them, and their horses<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think it will rain?" The thief asked, this place is good, the problem is that it will rain here. Become a muddy pit filled with water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be no these days." The elf said that he would extend a dry branch to the front of Cremal, "fire." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
