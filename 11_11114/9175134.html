			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get rid of the indescribable feeling of exhaustion, the red dragon’s sight fell into the battlefield, and in a large gap, it found those elves and black hair. The caster - the dragon's vision is sharper than the eagle, he saw the elf's squad, the elf should be the head of the elf seems to be talking to the dragon, the red dragon yawned while listening, but The sound on the battlefield was too noisy, and it only barely caught a few words - but the strange thing was that the red dragon thought he should hear the orcs roaring, but where the orcs are - it lifted the body, left and right Zhang Wang, but found that the entire jungle is swinging regularly like the ocean. The dragon's eyes can stare at the most white flame, but the sky is strangely without clouds, only light, monotonous and bright... Red Dragon finds that he is not knowing Feeling low, he shrugged his shoulders, took a deep breath, the smoke made the air turbid, and with a little sweetness, the red dragon confusely opened the outer eyelids that didn’t know when to close, it already Awareness Wrong – when, from when, the light will not change, except for the people who are still killing each other, even the jungle becomes quiet and solidified... It supports the upper body with the tip of the membrane wing, Dive down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest is yelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the orc warriors have already heard nothing, they drank the priest’s potion, the potion that will extract their last strength, they will Become crazy and bloodthirsty, even if it is fatal, you can't stop collision and killing. This kind of potion is strictly forbidden to use in non-essential moments, but isn't it the necessary moment now? The warriors are fighting, and the priests are eagerly converge on materials and sacrifices, ears, nose, teeth, eyes, and scalp attached to the hair, the gaowan of the male elf, the zigong of the female elf... the priest is puzzled, The number of the latter is too small, and it can be said that there are very few - every elf is a warrior, and the proportion of women in their ranks has never been low, just like the orcs fighting with these pointed ears in Thunder Castle. At that time, the elves will try to bring the companion's body back to the jungle, but when there is nothing to do, the priest's potion raw materials and precious sacrifices are mostly obtained from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a small terrace, a female elf has to face dozens of orcs who have fallen into a violent state. They are not afraid of pain and are not afraid of death. She is After casting all the magic, tearing up all the reels, crushing each rune gem, you have to pull out your own mace, but what can a small mace play in front of the orc warrior? The orc warriors rushed on the bodies of their companions (they had formed a small hill with depressions), and after an orc warrior was knocked open by her with a mace, she was also caught by several orcs. They didn't even give her a fatal death, but just grabbed the part and yanked it, tearing her into pieces. No way, they worked for different priests, even if it was It has become the king of the orcs, and the priests are still allowed to have their own warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Dragon is full of suspicion to watch all of this, if the madness of the elves is counter-attacking in its expectation, But their cruelty and temper are beyond its expectation - at least as far as it knows, the elves respect life and respect nature, but what they are doing now is no different from the orc, but it sees a grid. When Reti's priest was shredded by several elves, it could no longer continue to press down. The red dragon swept over the sky above them, spewing dragon fire, and the burning flame suddenly wrapped all the "elf", accompanied by The screams of screaming, the red dragon also sniffed the stench that had been questioned by the Dragon Claw Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Dragon’s chaotic mind suddenly becomes awake. It flaps its wings and quickly lifts its heavy body into the air, leaving itself in the clouds. The location, the cold air poured into its trachea and lungs, it looked down and the part of the jungle was exposed under the dragon's golden eyes, and only a moment, its pupils tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up!" It screamed loudly, calling out to his brother, "Get up!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp And its brother has completely slept in the past. When the red dragon as his younger brother fell to his side and attacked it with his teeth and claws, it angered back and its vision never dispersed. With the emptiness, it is like being controlled by it. If it is not the movement of it, it will become a bit slow. The other red dragon has also been hurt, or even worse. The first thing is to find the wrong red dragon. After two steps back, the dense trees became a natural obstacle. The huge red dragon could not move freely in it, but it did not change into a human form. The human form could not deter a red dragon. It is the clearest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice layer began to creak almost at the next moment. The crack appeared and spread like a branch of lightning. But the younger brother only needed a little bit of time: "We were deceived," he shouted. "We are The orcs fight, not the elves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just as the voice just fell, the red dragon’s brother came out of the broken ice, it His eyes are inconspicuous, but it can be seen that it is not the enemy, but his own brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Dragons may be swayed by established thinking and victory when they are not aware of it. Disorderly cognition, the problem is that once they have doubts, this layer of disability is as fragile as a piece of parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evening, they found that it’s a tough job to regain calm and calm, even if the Greinadas are willing Obeying the Red Dragon’s command of armistice and retreat, the orcs will not, and since they know that the so-called “elfs” are orcs, of course, when the orcs look at the Grenada, they will treat them as elves. Needless to say, the orc's stupid mind can't understand this complicated thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can't even find the king of the orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesh looked at the “elf” and smiled, it’s really one, how to say it, If this smile appears in Rica or his mentor Ostal, Gersh is not surprised at all, but it appears on an elf, this feeling is not surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who used to raise their hands, a powerful spell exploded between them, one of the priests was caught by Gersh, and he was in front of him. I can feel the runes and other things on the priests constantly tremble, bursting out various kinds of magic and spells to fight each other, and the priests are constantly cursing and cursing the wizards of the elves. Cursed Gersh. But Gersh didn't care at all. If he didn't do this, he was afraid to go immediately to the mourning wilderness to see their god Kazun. Geshe didn't pay much respect to the violent god. He might simply listen. Without the summoning sound of Kawu, even if he was summoned, as a guy whose belief is not pious, he is afraid that he will not get any good results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the priest’s hands and feet finally hanged down, Gersh saw another priest running away, stumbling, shaking left and right, but in any case, He finally escaped the paws of Gersh, but the soldiers of Gersh were still by his side. Gersh showed a smile that the orcs could hardly grasp, and then frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he pulled out his long knife in the strange eyes of the soldiers, threw it on the ground, and then unfolded his empty hands high:" I am the king of the orc, Geshe," he shouted. "I surrendered to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw that the other party was not moving, I even made it. When a gesture was cast, Gersh's heart leaped wildly, and his mind turned at an unprecedented high speed: "You are not an elf," he shouted. "Who are you! If it is an elf, they will never kill." A man who is unarmed and knees to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "elf" finally gave Grace a look: "Maybe, but that is probably a thousand Years ago." The elves of Thunderbolt never forgive any orc, even if he is just a baby, because even a baby is sucking human flesh and blood, a good orc? Yes, but it is estimated that they are already starving to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesh’s chest is violently undulating, his nerves are tightened to the point where they will break, and the latter idea is like the spark that breaks when the thread breaks. Then he licks his tongue. "Are you a Grenada?!" He saw that the fingertips of the other person had turned on the magical light. He shouted: "You are a Grenada!" The second time is not a question, but an affirmative sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his enemies only showed a burnout look, the power of magic rushed in, the runes on Gersh burst, and he was thrown into the air, A gray cyclone grabbed him heavily and threw it heavily on the ground. Even the king of the orcs, Gersh could not continue to support him. His eyes were dark and his body was not in a place where he was not in pain. He The ears can't hear the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former undead sighed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The torrential rain is on the verge of death, it is so cold, it is such a violent, between the enemy and the enemy, the orcs, and Gray The Nada people squinted incredulously, they were either pierced by the other's spears, or their wide swords were stuck in the other's ribs, but that was not the elf they saw, but their Allies, at least for now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon’s roar rang through the entire jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all played by the elves. Thoroughly thorough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing the Thunder from the clouds, the brother of the Red Dragon Not too careless, but it immediately heard the brother's whine, can only say that the young male red dragon is more cautious than their sister, at the last moment it is dodged in time, but the magic arrows of the elves are still shooting The root of its tail is less than a foot away from the unspeakable position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon immediately unfolds the membrane wing and jumps into the sky. When they once again overlook the jungle, they are like seeing the river reflecting the stars. Between the silver and the black leaves, there are flashing countless spots, and each light represents a magic arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is said that the Orcs have been fighting the Grinada, and the Grinada people are fighting the orcs, then the elves? Did they preserve every combat power in good condition, just waiting for them to exhaust their power in vain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge king court disappeared, and the place where the orcs and the Grinada people fought was just a stretch of bare slopes, even from the edge of the jungle. Less than three thousand feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the illusion of collapse, the elves who are ready to go, the arrows are pouring down with the rain before their enemies have understood the state of affairs. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that collapsed was the orcs, they couldn’t find their own king, they couldn’t find a priest, they couldn’t find anyone who would shelter them, the Grinada Although they want to control the situation and prepare for the remnants, things always go to the worst side. The escaping beasts have attacked the battlefields and teams they have managed to integrate. They dare not face the arrows of the elves, but they Dare to show the Grinada people a fangs claws - there are many wounded in the latter, and the orcs try to capture the mounts of the dragon claw knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless until the warlocks of Grenada threw the vicious spells that were no less than the Elven Arrows, these brainless guys started to run elsewhere, they were vaguely I can still see the vague trails, but when the orcs once again entered the jungle, the jungle seemed to have lost the original tolerance. They found themselves trapped in the jungle - the trail was inexplicably broken, like a personal dry bread. Wiping off the ink flowing on the parchment, they walked around in the jungle, and the orc with the axe fell down the trees, but he just walked out a few hundred steps and couldn't see him again when he swung back. Made the sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singer elves attacked, and while the Greinadas were still in chaos, the trees put the elves on their shoulders, using The branches and leaves act as their shields, and the activated vines roll up the bundles of arrows and continually hand them over to the elves. At the same time, the roots of the tree must be pulled up from the ground and move slowly and steadily forward. - The height advantage of the Deinonychus is not worth mentioning before these giant trees. They bite the trunk, their teeth are broken on the rough bark, the trees are violently shaking, and the thick branches are like whip. Then whistling from the air, straight to the side of the rat-like dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only threat to the tree is the dragon fire, and the fire of the negative energy summoned by the warlocks, they burn the body of the tree, in the tree It will never go out before it is turned into ash. Even if the priests and wizards of the elves have been trying to rescue, some of the trees are still invaded by the flames. They are handing over the elves to another when things are irreparable. The tree spirits of the fire are rushing toward the Greinada in a big, clumsy footstep, stretching all the branches and leaves that can be controlled. When they are dumped, the bursting and scattering flame can even cover a few hundred feet or less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragons are gliding, their summoners are lion-headed lions, and the dragon-toothed knights are circling in the air like their bats at dusk. The eagle-headed lion is afraid of the arrow of the elf, just like the red dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
