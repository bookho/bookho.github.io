			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the caravan felt a little tricky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has similar ideas with his accomplices, that is, this mission may be the simplest of the tasks they are doing, oh, not Kay Reuben is a good man, and the mage, as long as it is a caster, even if it is only an apprentice who is still between the two levels of spells, mortals must be cautious when facing them; just "bad thorns" In order to complete this work, the guild paid a considerable price. It also carried out a careful planning. They arranged eyeliners on the roads leading to various towns and villages. The group sold them in a town. Two flower ponies, after examining the map, the guild's mage predicted that they wanted to escape to the south through the snow cover swamp. It is quite possible that the genius Kerry is probably the only one except the black foot half-person. A piece of people who come and go in the dead mud covered by tiny white velvet flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they arranged the team that "greeted" these exiles in the snow cover swamp. The black-footed half-person did not escape but was held by other thieves. Once they have completed their work, releasing fireworks and sirens, the accomplices will bring them with the little guys with black hair on their feet to ensure that they are foolproof. The guild will also have some scattered wild mercenaries and several unknowns. The insiders and apprentices are arranged in the team, so that the team looks like a real caravan, so even if there are some small flaws and flaws, they will be quietly covered up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original car owner is an important bargain and should not be placed here. But it has been suggested that if Master Alva mentioned him to the Elf Ranger Kerry, then this disguise will be even more impeccable, but everyone knows it, it is just an excuse to find out to curb his promotion. After all, there are only seven important cadres in the guild. Their number is fixed. If someone goes up, there must be someone who goes on to the caravan. The owner of the caravan has always performed very well in front of the Alva Master. It is kind, elegant, and somewhat unique to the business people. Hey, with a sense of humour, you can't find a disturbing evil in him, arrogance, or humility; for a caster, the last one may be better than any of the previous ones. Everything has to come in order to ensure that he can further win the trust of Master Alva. In the two years, he not only took off the black robes of the Master, but also refused any other tasks. To avoid seeing his face being seen by the victims who escaped, he ruined all his previous efforts and patience. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the leader of the guild did not know why he agreed with someone’s proposal. In the biggest nest of the “bad thorn”, even hundreds of powerful thieves were killed. The important cadres can't disobey the will of the leader. The paradox is that he only took the task, but he was not so willing, so he locked Kerry Ben from the beginning, the only child of the King of the Silver Crown jungle. It is also the highest value prey for the caster in the entire team. Of course, he will also be one of the property of the guild, but there are also unwritten rules in the guild that have never been ignored, that is, the hunter is surrendering the prey. At the time, there will also be some rewards. If the prey is used for extortion and trading, the hunter can make additional requests. For example, if the prey is a beautiful girl, the hunter will have the right to enter her room during the detention; Or, the relatives of the prey, such as the brother or father, have had a hatred with the hunter, and the hunter will ask the family to add a hand or a person’s eye to the ransom. These requirements are generally Association promised, anyway, for "evil thorn", this is what it did not constitute a loss, but also to strengthen subordinates loyal to the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is not a female elf, the caravan owner has no special hobbies, and there is no direct contact with the king of the silver crown jungle, but he is a caster, the specialty of the silver-crowned jungle, snow honey, fine gold, Mithril , cinnabar, galvanized lead, etc. are almost all things that every caster dreams of. He can let the guild attach these conditions before handing over Kerry, as for the new king of Highland Norman to pay or the silver crown jungle Dedication... This is not something he will care about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that Kerry has not lived up to his two hundred years of travel life and outstanding talent, just when the car owner whispered a curse almost Surrounded by a silver flashing magical arrow, he found that the elf was not confused by his rhetoric and performance. The drugs he had given him in the honey wine did not play a role. The fierce battle of the white scorpion did not leave a mark of burnout and pain on him. The unique scimitar of the two silver-crowned jungle elves was like a gust of wind, and every time he wanted to get an unexpected angle, several consecutive spells were They were forcibly interrupted, forcing him to tear a reel and finally get out of the awkward metal vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic sent him out of the narrow tent, he cast a flight to let himself fly, and took a brief look at the situation of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes him sink is that it’s not just the elves who are in the trap, but the lords of Thunder, and the rewards. The top ranked Bywin Donkley is brave and fearless to fight a group of mercenaries. His wide sword shines with moonlight. It is obvious that the thieves in the team have not stolen it quietly as preset. The black iron swords of the mercenaries and the thieves can be said to be vulnerable. Only a few weapons with white steel texture can barely compete with them, but each confrontation will cause a sudden shrinkage of the steel weapon owners, and the white texture is excellent. Steel is also an expensive and rare material for them. The gaps and cracks added to the fine gold wide swords indicate that they may be forced to change the most trustworthy friends and lovers after this battle. I don't know if the bounty given to them by the guild is rich enough to give them a weapon that is comparable to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Byrdwin’s unusually heroic and powerful performance, he has accumulated countless “more than one, many pairs” in Thunder for more than a decade. A "combat experience, he did not retreat or escape, but directly into the mercenary, his wide sword is like a strong peasant waving a sickle to harvest wheat, but it is not golden The rice straw is a body that is divided and split. The air is filled with the fragrance of sunlight and earth, but the rich sweetness of human blood. Although he is not without regrets, he has one arm missing and cannot sneak into him. On the side of his body, he used a dagger and a dagger to stab his short mercenary or assassin to catch a sudden death, or cut off their neck. Fortunately, he still has a pair of equally dangerous legs and feet, and his movements are rapidly changing. It’s impossible to think of him with a height of 6 feet and 11 inches, and a height of 300 pounds. Norman’s princess once laughed at Birdwin’s dancing clumsy like a pumpkin with two wooden poles, but If he is dancing, he can be like a fight. So beautiful, he may have dumped half of the lady of the king's capital. What a beautiful and terrible gesture, it is so precise, stable and contains amazing power, kicked by him. Almost no one can make a mourning again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one or two small fish that missed the net, before their daggers have yet to break through the protection of the Mithril chain armor, I don’t know when the thief Gülen, who appeared next to Birdwin, took on the small task of checking the leaks, his fine gold. The dagger is like a poisonous snake hidden in the darkness. It is not cutting the throat or breaking into the abdomen. When the "stolen" hyenas are screaming and screaming and wanting to take him out and tear it into pieces, He disappeared into the chaotic crowd. His costumes were originally very similar to them. Even if the "bad thorn" soldiers also trained through night vision, they would never match a thief, not to mention that Ge Lan was still among them. The leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some mercenaries who are not affiliated with the "sin" have vaguely gave birth to retreat. Wild mercenaries are not a good word, it means this mercenary They can't even accumulate enough credibility and skills to be accommodated by a certain mercenary group or guild. Their weapons and equipment can only be said to be, and they are only promised a small amount of compensation. At the beginning they Either they don’t know anything about the whole situation, or they don’t know about Baldwin’s situation. As far as they can see, they think that these people are just some lonely aristocrats and in the cognition of wild mercenaries. The roadside beggars are also easy to deal with. They don't have any real skills, they don't know how to hide and hide, they lack the courage and bloodiness to die, and some will be afraid of bleeding and injury. It is just a fat rabbit. The net worth is much richer than the net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two women, one of whom is also hanging a golden bell. Everyone knows that only the priest of Fro will hang the golden bell... Look, this Let the wild mercenaries be both envious and despised. If they are, they will not bring two women on their way to escape, but they say that they have no idea what these two women are. Of course, they never mind to taste some leftovers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but all this is based on the weakness and incompetence of the prey. Once the rabbit becomes a tiger, the wild mercenaries are also the first to want to escape, anyway They are not subject to any restrictions. When they love to leave, they can leave. If they are not surrounded by water marshes, the owners of the caravans may be able to see the little black spots that spread around the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they imaginaryly surrounded the people in the battle, they not only failed to play a role in favoring the "bad thorn", but also became the most thieves The good cover, in the third or fourth time, was confused by a mercenary. The soldier who had to give up tracking could not suppress his anger. He raised his hand and waved a knife. The head of the wild mercenary was strange. To the side, what’s worse is that this wild mercenary is not alone. He has a deep-hearted brother. When the “bad thorn” soldiers open their eyes and look for Gülen’s figure in the crowd, they come from The dagger behind him pierced his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another "stab" soldier found the wild mercenary who wanted to avenge his brother. Although he said that he had nothing to do with the dead soldiers, the "bad" soldiers never looked like this. The wild mercenaries who had no abandoning dogs were in their eyes. They looked down on the poor guys who couldn’t afford even a good leather armor. They used them as slaves and tools. The death of their companions aroused his anger. He stepped forward. The arm of the Avengers was cut, and the mourning before the Avengers’ death was alarmed by the internal struggles of other wild mercenaries and “stolen” soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressures faced by Byrdwin and Gülen are slightly reduced, but this is not to say that they can safely be the leader of the mercenary, right, The leader of the thieves union soldiers is a decisive and decisive person. Once he finds that the situation is chaotic, he immediately and decisively ordered some close subordinates to destroy the wild mercenaries, while he and other most powerful soldiers concentrated on attacking Bo. After Devin’s “scarred” soldiers also included wild mercenaries into the scope of the attack, Gülen’s hiding area was getting smaller and smaller. Finally, his back was finally on Bywin, the “bad thorn” soldiers. Surrounded by them, several soldiers raised their bows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as they were in desperate circumstances, Leona shouted and raised her longbow, a sharp arrow flashing magical light The leader of the soldier, he jumped agilely and escaped, but the purpose of this sharp arrow was not to kill. When it fell to the ground, a thick milky white smoke rose from the bottom up, and everyone They are all surrounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow the voice!" The leader of the soldier shouted in the thick fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they heard a strange and sharp voice, though short, but enough for them to recognize the direction in the thick fog, the soldiers’ orders at the leader Pulling the trigger of the bow, the arrow almost followed the back of Birdwin and the thief Gülen, and some people were yelling, but they were not what they wanted to hear. The leader first rushed out of the fog, and Gülen stood not far from him, smiled and dropped a chubby glass bottle. The glass bottle fell to the ground without breaking, but holding a crossbow. Mei Mei hit it accurately, the broken glass bottle gave off a pungent smell, and the leader just stepped back. The fire-fighting that Gülen sent over ignited the moss that was contaminated by the liquid in the bottle. It burns fiercely and gives off a disgusting smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader felt a dizzy, and someone around him had fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the caravan involuntarily frowned, he waved his arm and threw a spell, and a breeze blows away those weird smells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
