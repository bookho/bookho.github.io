Read a book ww·1kanshu"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The soul of the outside world glances at the people around him. This person remembers that he is one of the most powerful members of the Side Island Chamber of Commerce. He is an unscrupulous and despicable person, like the merchants living on the Longhuo Island. He has no formal wife and children, only slaves, including his son and daughter - he is about 50 years old this year, but unlike other humans, this fat-faced guy does not seem to be keen to have an heir, but also People say that he has already raised a warlock or a necromancer. Every year, he will sacrifice a blood to the devil to seek a healthy life for a year. In the case that the lich is silent, it is difficult for the soul of the outside world to distinguish whether it is a rumor, but this person does have a place that makes him feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he’s right, it’s really good weather for Longhuo Island – the islands were occupied by hurricanes and heavy rains in the past few days. The sky is dark and the rain is like the whole ocean is drawn above the clouds. There are water everywhere. Even the elf Kerry, who is best at meeting nature, feels a little uncomfortable, especially the elves of the silver-crowned jungle. Like the caster, whether it is open or private, it is not very accustomed to the body. The silver silk shirt of the silver crown jungle can defend the sword arrow like the leather armor, but it does not resist the invasion of water vapor. In the end, they are all envious. Bywin and his knights, the soldiers from Norman in the Highlands were even less suited to the hot and humid climate of the Longhu Islands. They took off their clothes from their homeland and changed the width of the locals. Feet pants, um, only wide-leg pants, even the boots were taken off by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate is only a minor problem. At the beginning, soldiers and knights even had unexplained vomiting and diarrhea and anorexia. Yadel replaced several kinds. Herbs have no effect. The eunuch beside Kremar (not Dada, but another eunuch he thought is trustworthy) also raised the need to use "tobacco", but it was a hundred trials, of course, this proposal was severely rejected. In the end, the soul of the outside world thought of the disease he seemed to have heard very similarly. With a try-and-try mentality, Kremar exchanged a box of beet sugar for a box of dirt and water from the Norman Highlands. That, although this in another plane will be dismissed as superstition or psychological comfort, but anyway. This plane is sacred... Anyway, a little dirt and water will not suddenly become poison because of leaving the original place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soil of Norman in the Highlands was mixed with cane sugar and mixed into the bread, and the water of Norman in the Highlands was put into the reservoir of the military camp. So miraculously, the Norman disease quickly eased and no new ones appeared. Patient. A reading book, 1kanshu<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What needs to be mentioned here is that there are about female slaves, who are almost all eliminated by the lord and their son. young. "Tobacco" has not completely taken away their physical strength and beauty, but after knowing that "tobacco" can enter the child's mouth through the mother's milk, and may affect the child, Baldwin's previous thoughts are not allowed. Do not make any changes. Like many Norman men, he is unable to accept children who are born with illness or are destined to be weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can they leave your secret medicine?" Birdwin asked Krimer's eunuch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The eunuch said: "If they stop supplying, they will age and die very quickly, then..." He glanced at his master. . That is, the black hair caster, swallowed the phrase "a little waste", "too poor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That won't work." Birdwin Ruthlessly said: "My soldiers and knights have lost their healthy wives and children. They should return healthy wives and children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not difficult." The eunuch intervened cautiously, although he was a bit unsure whether his master would be willing to buy a new slave. To be honest, he felt that his master was a bit crazy, and his specific performance was his slave to himself. It's as good as your own son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin raised his eyebrows, he didn’t know what to say, but he hoped that his fallen soldiers could get a family, a descendant, if they could The North Sea has gained a lot, so what he envisioned, in ten or twenty years, will be able to return to the highland Norman plan. It will be greatly advanced. In the process, those who are loyal to him may not be able to Going under the wall of the kingdom, their blood should be able to inherit, at least there should be a son who accepts his father's armor and spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This we are suspended." The soul of the opposite world said, then his fingers did not move slightly, the eunuch immediately saw his meaning, he told him The owner and Birdwin made a deep sorrow and took the slaves back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s useless to buy a new slave,” said the soul of the outside world. “They will give those people the secret medicine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I know, "Bedwin walked back and forth a few steps. He now has some understanding of the Dragon Fire Island: "Like people will definitely put a nose ring on the weaned calf, this is how they control these slaves, otherwise there will be The army, they have no way to enslave so many human beings. Can the side island accept more free people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think we can go to Norman Look at it. To read the book ww·1kanshu, the soul of the alien world, remembering the message from the Alva Master of the Bituminburg a few days ago, the new king of Norman in the Highlands has learned that the soldiers of the Thunderbolt were there. When Bibi Dibao was sheltered, he not only issued a warning, but also threatened to launch a war, although this can be said to be a joke - there are several countries and territories between Bibi Dyke and Highland Norman, are these kings and Will the lord agree to let the armed Armed Forces of the Normans pass? But this instrument angered the parliamentarians of Bibi Dibao, they are all businessmen, and a businessman, except for Austal, would probably not be happy to be involved in a war that has no interest for himself. Both Alva Master and the current governor of Bititenberg have received a lot of accusations and impeachment. Fortunately, the soldiers and knights of Thunderbolt have left, and they can't find any practical handles, let alone Alva Master. Not only have their own disciples, a few apprentices, but also the Antonio Master from the White Tower, the power of the caster is unprecedentedly strong in the Beitburg, so the final document will not be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the Master Alva is not the kind of good old man who is reluctant to accept it. He gives back some information to the Klima on the side island in the form of a free gift. - Although Wang Duo has gathered too many wizards and warlocks for the new king and Dylan Don Cray, it is difficult for other casters to peep into it, but the tentacles of the former are still beyond the kingdom, especially It is the Knights of Tyre and Rosada who have always been unfair to Baldwin and the Queen. So he still got a lot of quite detailed information. Among them, some villagers in the villages around Thunderbolt are migrating to other places, compared to the soldiers who are strong with him, and They are familiar with the mage who is no different from the knight except the robe. Those arrogant and dangerous casters seem to be hard to come by. They even cast spells on mortals for various reasons, causing no small panic, and the new lords of Thunderbolt have enacted new laws in order to support them. These casters, their taxes tripled overnight. Farmers and craftsmen are worried when they gather together to drink at night, worrying about themselves, and their families will die of hunger before the orcs arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean let them come here?" Birdwin said: "This is too difficult." There is no army, no caster, and wild animals and orcs are everywhere in the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take it to the merchants." The soul of the outside world said that it read the famous saying - there are three hundred percent of profits. Merchants can trample on all the laws, including of course the Longhuo Islands, given the current situation. He could not release and treat the human beings who were carried by the merchants as cargo to the islands, but like the soldiers of the Thunderbolt, they came to the islands as passengers, as long as the owners of the islands allowed it. They can live here as free people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit expensive, it’s inevitable, they’re going to travel thousands of miles, and Baldwin can’t guarantee that anyone will want to stay away from home. After all, there are places where they have lived for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was silent for a while: "Do you know?" He said: "Krimal, I hope no one wants to follow the merchant."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world nodded, he could understand the meaning of Birdwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about those girls?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just use their place." The soul of the world said. He is not proficient in the allocation of potions, but his cohabitants are just the opposite. These girls will be left as a maid, which is much better than the owner of an island sneaking alone to the place where the slaves gather. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the day before yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Kreima appears here for those girls. To collect these slaves depends on whether the lucky god is willing to smile at you and the network you have. Some temperamental masters will directly kill all the slaves who have been eliminated. Even if they have never seen his face and heard his voice, the eunuchs are not too happy to deal with unfamiliar people before the volcanic eruption. They have Dada, but now Dada is already the owner of the entire East Crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the businessman around Kremar is a sophisticated and intelligent guy who is good at observing and watching. He has already heard that the new owner of the side island has some quirks, or It means arrogance and unnecessary kindness. He never used it to refer to slaves in Kremar, not that she is him, and he also fed them well before sending them, so they watched Going up is very good, he also abandoned the tradition, no longer let the slaves appear naked in front of the seller, but allowed them to wrap a piece of palm cloth, although a bit rough and loose, but at least make them look like individuals, not one Only livestock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it will not be all slaves to the front of Kremar. They are close to two hundred people. Only a few of the most beautiful goods are displayed. The eunuchs will check the quality of other slaves one by one. The soul of the world does not care. He has not had the conscious consciousness of a lord until now. Don’t say that to Kerry Ben, Birdwin and others, even the attitude toward the eunuchs can be called peace, but the eunuchs still I am very afraid of the new owner of this black hair. He is a caster, and all the casters are difficult to figure out and moody. Who knows when he will reveal the most unbearable and fearful side? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even these ten slaves make the souls of the outside world feel uncomfortable, and the soft cushions are like the belly fluffs filled with thorns instead of albatrosses. People who haven’t experienced it are afraid that they can’t imagine the deep chill – when you have a little conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman quickly noticed the pity or boredom of the owner of the side island, he turned his wrist and gestured, and the girls followed his slave back silently , hide yourself in the shadow of the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days and nights of torrential rain let the souls of the outside world get bored in the closed room, so they are in a huge tent, just like they just came At the side of the island, the tent was built on a rock that was flat like a water surface, and the surrounding vegetation was green, as the businessman said. Today's weather is very good, not so hot, not dull, you can see from their position. The sea and sand in the distance, the tiny sand is like gold in the sun, the tide is white, the sea water is from transparent light steel blue, to cornflower blue, then from cornflower blue to sapphire blue, and from sapphire blue to midnight Blue, the reef is grayish brown and dark green, and the place where seaweed and water plants grow is a silky shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their new owner doesn’t look like watching the sea or the sun, so what is he looking at? The businessman guessed, carefully searching the past with the black light caster's gaze from the corner of his eye, aha, see what he found? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Fro, she said that she could not harm them. When they were not very familiar with the new owner’s situation, she actually put herself Disguised as the lover of the lord, the gift they gave her could almost be filled with her little temple. He still remembers the pale gold sea bead chain that the unlucky guy took out. The guy is almost everyone. I have to complain about it because he originally wanted to send this dowry as a daughter. Now it’s good, it can only hang on the knees of a humble and sloppy Pastor, and he even the pastor. The room didn't go in, but I had to buy another necklace that would match it to his daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
