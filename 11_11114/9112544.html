			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal saw the king of Grenada, like Ostal, because of the blood of the dragon, there are countless mortals who are willing to use all Everything to exchange for a beautiful appearance, solid body, long life and powerful power - he sat on the throne, the deep red hair fell from the crown, covering his gloomy face, which is also a lot of Gredi The descendants are angry, he is always dissatisfied, always dissatisfied, always dissatisfied... Although he still maintains respect or devoutness on the surface, no one does not know that he is angering the red dragon. For fun. The strange thing is that their "mother" Greid seems to be willing to condone him. She can be said to be like a mortal mother like him, and does not mind his rudeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes many of the descendants of Gredi feel angry, they dare not disagree with the practice and ideas of Gredi, but they can show the king Some malicious, their unhappiness further restricted the rights of the new king, and Greed seems to be happy, so before Ostal left, those people’s practices were getting more and more excessive, and even angered to new The son and daughter of the king, especially his eldest son, because the new eldest son was born with a human female, which made Greedy very angry, even if the human female was a powerful mage, she was executed. The second son of the new king is born by the new king according to the requirements of Greed and one of her daughters (a female red dragon), and the daughter is the same, but they all know that these children can not be said to be the most beloved of the new king. His favorite is a illegitimate hybrid with at least one of the Elias's illegitimate and a damn hybrid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all Dragon Warlocks have problems with blood stasis, because the blood of the dragon is too strong, and it is strong enough to exclude the other half of the blood. The other half is that the blood of the orcs, giants or humans may still be better, but for the Eya spirits, this can be said to be a creature that always stands in a good camp, unless they fall, or the blood of the dragon and their blood. It can only be ice and fire. Before the Great Holocaust, there were also dragons forcing the elves to breed for themselves, but the latter did not die because of a heart attack, that is, pregnancy failure, so when the new king brought back an egg, everyone was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this egg should be said to be the eldest son of the new king, because this egg was born before all the children, but somehow, it failed after thirty days. Hatching, and gradually lost temperature and reaction, this situation has not been before, but just before a red dragon almost knocked it in the cup, Greed appeared, she once again indulged her The most arrogant of the descendants, looked at the egg - it was hard to say that it was still alive, but she allowed the new king to keep it - soon after, after almost everyone had forgotten the egg, the new king and A human being has a child, and then his human wife is dead. He has a son and a daughter with the Red Dragon daughter of Grein, and then, surprisingly, attending his second son in Gree. When the eldest daughter’s adult ceremony was held, he also gave birth to a baby, who was incubating from the egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, Gretty rebuked the king of Grenada, although she finally gave the baby a name. Although it was extremely contempt and ominous, it was similar to a curse, but it was indeed a dragon name. The baby still got her recognition, which allowed the latter to be protected by the Red Dragon when he was most vulnerable, and the claws that were ready to move had to be collected, although most people’s minds defaulted to the child as a tool. Or a sacrifice. Even if the new king does not think so, he insists that the child is his eldest son, and he is quite unpleasantly placed in his nearest court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s useless, even if Astal, three hundred years ago, knew that this child was not as well taken care of as the new king. With caregiving, he almost got the abhorrence of every Grinada because of his father and mother, not to mention a red dragon lady who was furious because her children were neglected, and perhaps because of the eggshell. In the relationship that has been sleeping for nearly 50 years, his development is very slow, and he is weaker and weaker than the baby born to those who are slaves. If he is only one in the heart of the Greinada people at first, The words of sin, now more like a joke, when he is three years old, but still can not say a coherent words, only the new king is not willing to give up, perhaps plus the occasional emergence of Gredi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ostal was 150, he was allowed to leave the Warlock Tower, after he repaid the debt - the mentor signed with him He agreed to be a real warlock. He heard that the new king’s illegitimate child died. After the latter finally showed something belonging to the dragon’s blood, he died. He is going to step out of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Austal finally remembered why he was familiar with the black-haired caster, after he became a warlock, because he was given a gritty The favored relationship, once served the new king, stood in a place ten feet away from him - the new king and all the descendants of Gredi, with deep red hair, not like bursting from the flames It came out, but the rich red color that came out of the blood vessels and the heart. His eyes were golden and brighter and clearer than Austal’s eyes. These are his blood more than Austal. A symbol of purity, but if you cut the long hair that can be lowered to the knee to the shoulder, and then turn it black with the eyes, then the face of the young mage has the new king of Grenada. Extremely high similarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal was amazed that he would still remember the young mage, who remembered that he had failed because of his mission, so he was punished by Gredi. And was abandoned. After he struggled to escape from the bottomless abyss, the first thing was to find this person. When he found the wizard, he was old, and he could be said to be dying. The half-elf would only be dying. It will only age, his face becomes ugly, full of wrinkles, thin hair, teeth falling, Ostal grabbed him without much effort, cruelly tearing off his limbs, pulling out his soul Chewed, not so willingly swallowed into the stomach, but after doing all this, he still felt the heartfelt emptiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the new king of Grenada, where they were only a few thousand feet away, and Greed was sleeping in her lair, and Ostar could feel the fear and horror she brought to herself. Just like every time before, but his face is gradually blurred and confused, he is no longer a dragon warlock. In the bloody battle, all the weak parts must be removed unless you are willing to become other people's food. It doesn't matter with money. He was originally evil, and he just lost something that didn't matter. But he thought of a problem. After becoming a demon, he has lost his original body. More precisely, in addition to his thoughts, there is no even a gram of flesh in his body that belongs to the original Austal. That is to say, the source of his roots in Griddy’s fear has disappeared, and he has become stronger. He is convinced that he can win in the battle with a red dragon. This is why he dares to return. The reason for going to Grenada, but this feeling tells him that he is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal raised his hands, he should have no hands, only tentacles, but he saw his hands, he gently bent each finger. At the same time, the new king sitting on the throne raised his head and gave a sharp sneer to Austal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes and suddenly understood that the sneer was not a complete illusion, it was the lich who was sitting next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal caster sits on a piece of crushed ice with his jaw down, and this piece of crushed ice has turned him into a nice chair with a chair back Carefully carved men and women who play and play in the vines, those agile bodies are extraordinarily bloated and full of the evil taste of a certain undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome back." Arthur said that his name is simpler and clearer than other gray robes, but this may not be his real name or The name of the variant, but that's okay, because he and Ostal came to this place just because he had to repay the contractual debt he signed with the mentor, which means his relationship hung in the pink half. The lich Edel, not Ostal, and the Red Warlock is not so willing to have a close relationship with a lich. For them, at least for Arthur, the name is really just a name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought I had to use our method to wake you up." Arthur was sorry and glad to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After understanding the meaning that had not been expressed, Austal immediately woke up from a long nightmare. He didn't want to be looked at by a lich, not at all, although he still has some illusion and cannot clearly distinguish it. The boundary between reality and illusion - after all, he spent hundreds of years in the illusion, but even now is a fantasy, he knows what to do, in the face of an eternal undead, ignorance has never been A good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A subtle illusion," Ostal regained his familiarity with his fingers in his large sleeves, and asked unintentionally: " But it doesn't seem to be too much harm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be long enough to drain your life." The Lich said: "Is there any dream of letting? What are you happy about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, of course, Austal said in his heart that he has become a powerful devil, even the dragon Bowing in front of him, he has killed some of his enemies, and returned to Grenada, he will become the most beloved child of Grein, wearing a crown or becoming her heir, in the near future, He may still be the true master of Grenada, his will will spread in every direction with the army of the unprecedented caster, he will become the king of kings - which of course takes more time, but then How, as a devil, his life is infinite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, even Austal had to shudder, if he did not find the small loopholes in this dream, but let himself indulge If you go on, maybe he can still wake up, but even if he is, he can't know what a lich will do in his mind - or what he has done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't do anything." Arthur said: "We have always been cautious - I don't think I can resist the owner of this place, but According to my speculation, this is only a test, and it may come to everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then what about you? Austal asked almost this, and some of him was left in the illusion, as the king of the devil - but a slight tingling from his back promptly recalled his reason - that It was his magic pet, Amonis, who poked him gently with his tip. Maybe Arthur really couldn’t do anything. This kind of attack is aimed at the spirit, not the **, even if he only has one The bone shelf may not be spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
