Come on, you can touch his head when I feed him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Then they came to the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is illogical! Fro's priest said with horror that the vicious and evil thief apprentices can like cats! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Let's adjust the time a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get into the current white tower can be said to be simple or tough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the gnome McGee’s news from the merchants, the current White Tower rarely has serious businesspeople to go, but from some In terms of perspective, it can also be said that it is a city, or a half-black market. All the Bibi dikes or the rulers and managers have not gone mad. The city still stands in the temple of Tyre and other gods. You can see the goods you can buy and sell - evil casting materials, dangerous banned potions, despicable weapons, humans, humanoids... The reason why they still leave half, because Rosada’s pastor still Stay there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disaster caused by the clean water of the Rosada sanctuary has faded in the hearts of the residents of Baita, or more horrible things than at that time. It happened so much that the deep impressions left in the hearts of the residents of Baita were no longer so clear--they were once rich, and now their money is not stolen, and they are robbed by layers of heavy taxes; they used to Beautiful, but the thieves will rush into your house without any scruples, take your daughter and wife away, if you still have a little money, then you may be able to bring them back in a few days. It’s just that the broken souls are the bodies that are broken and bruised, and you may not be able to redeem them for the second time; they have been happy, but who dares to smile on the streets now? There are wolves with sharp eyes and sensitive ears everywhere, they always have to understand the source of your happiness. Then he did not hesitate to take it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not try to escape from the White Tower. They gradually gathered around the sanctuary in Rosada. Without houses, they would feel safe and warm even if they were lying directly on the ground. The priest of Rosada gave them food. And clean water. Protecting them, more than once, repelling the thieves who want to rob children and women, the lord’s soldiers, or the shackles that threaten and intimidate civilians and pastors almost every few days, if not because In the last accident, the pastor sent by the General Hospital of Rosada was more determined than the ordinary pastor, and the relationship between piety and power was strong. The last piece of pure land in Baitali was long gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that the White Tower is dying, and correctly, the White Tower is even more prosperous than before. Even without the goods of the elves, it can still have the temptation to attract merchants to go all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Tower is the most popular one. It is a special kind of tobacco that emits a sweet scent after ignition. Other spices can match it, and it can also relieve pain and treat various diseases. If there is no smoke tube, take a small part and immerse it in water or do it in food. The most regrettable thing is that it is a bit toxic. People who take too much have encountered misfortune, but this is not its fault, is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fields around the hills and white towers are almost always planted. The “fine net” guild controls every line from seed to finished product. They collect tobacco from the serfs and civilians at extremely low prices and then sell them at a price that is also considered cheap, in fact It is not impossible for such tobacco to be more expensive to sell, but their leader has said it very early. The first thing they have to do is to ensure that everyone has tasted the taste of this tobacco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not in a few months. It is in a few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that tasted this kind of tobacco and noticed the benefits was the mercenaries, who had old injuries on their bodies, and it was painful and itchy every rainy day. This kind of tobacco can help them to withstand this torture, and they find that eating a little while hungry is not so obvious as the pain that can split the entire stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then are serfs and some poorly run civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody noticed that the popularity of this tobacco has become more widespread and deeper, and only Ruiyite knows that more and more businessmen are coming to acquire this kind of tobacco. She also provides free tobacco in Fro's temple, and Fro's pastor claims that the tobacco can turn an incompetent man into a wild boar or a bear – look at the last ones who are willing to take away their parents. Young people with coins, but there are too many men obsessed with Pastor Fro, who knows what they are indulging in? Is it the fullness of Pastor Fro, or the tobacco that emits sweet scent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the businessmen who are willing to go to Baita to buy tobacco are welcome. They don't enter the White Tower as planned by Gavin, because their career is really strange. How do you explain that there is a knight and a mage in a caravan? , the priests of the thieves, Rosada and Fro? Mei Mi entered alone as a wandering scorpion. Although she had to taste a little honey for the guard, the whole process was very smooth. The thieves strolling on the streets did have to intercept when they saw her, but it was not doubtful. Her intention, but want to ask her where to settle, he asked Mei Mi to drink a glass of honey, and promised to come to her room at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavalier was dressed as a mercenary, and together with Master Gavin as a merchant with mercenaries to buy tobacco, they changed slightly, see Going up unremarkable, under the hot afternoon sun, the guards hurriedly released after blackmailing two silver coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief Gülen is more complicated, because the white pagoda is already in the nest of the fine net guild, they do not welcome the thieves who do not belong to them, so Gülen from the dragon fire In the pub of the island, he found an identity. The thief had been recruited, but he was wrong. Finally he ran to Longhuo Island to open a pub. The business is still very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave Gülen the name of the person, this person is dead, so Gülen does not have to worry about someone debunking him, he will enter the White Tower Immediately revealed a hand. The name was reported and a room was found outside the guild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing went smoothly and it was a little scary, even though the message left by the female warlock was to let Kreima win the return to his friend in Tari However, in fact, both Leona and Birdwin were detained in the prison of the "fine net" guild. Leona also received special privileges. She had a room. Although the room was only six feet long and had no windows, there was only a wooden door with iron hinges and reinforced strips. The furniture inside was also lacking, whether it was a chair or a table. They were all fixed on the ground, and the only one bed was disturbingly laid with furry bear skin. In addition, there was a bottle of sweet peas on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona has asked for water. If they are feeding a jug or a kettle, it is very dangerous to put them on the king's body, but those who are sent in are actually removing the nuclear peaches. At this time, the peaches cannot be said to have matured, but Leona takes them. The one that arrived is basically ripe, and the degree is almost always in the hand. If you touch it, maybe it will be turned off. The solid food is cheese and bread. The bread is white and delicate. It is not the kind of mixed. With wood chips, you can use it as a black bread for sticks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her room is still a room. Not a dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mei Mei and others first found Leona, the king’s state is very good, but just as they left the room, the scene in front of them suddenly Upside down. Mei Mi and Leona were thrown into a dark passage that smelled of rancid smell. The passages were sticky and slippery. They walked on them and fell a little carelessly. They climbed through a broken road. I found a small door that I could open, but it was just the moment I went out. In the corridor where they were, they walked into two little guys who were still a little childish. Their short robes showed that they were only thieves apprentices. Mei Mi immediately pushed the small door desperately and wanted to return to the dark passage. The gods were On the door, this door can only be opened once. Leona helped Mei Mi to work hard, but her strength was much higher than that of Mei Mei. With a dull sound, the small door was disengaged from the hinge. Mei Mei slammed into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of movement wants to continue to be unknown. It is purely a cover-up, and Mei Mei panicked and learned to call the cat twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are like what we saw at the beginning, the two thieves apprentices came over with the small fish, they couldn’t see the cat, they only saw it. Two stupid women with gray faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought it was a cat." A thief apprentice said with anger that the small fish was taken back by his pocket and replaced by a dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't it a cat?" His companion licked his lips, and his unintentional smile showed that he might no longer be a child: "Let us deal with it." Wildcat..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona’s wooden door hits his face directly. If no good pastor can be found, this thief apprentice may be the second "you-know-who". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief apprentice who prepared the dried fish for the cat was shocked. He reacted agilely to raise the dagger to the plum, but found that the dagger was stabbed anyway. Without going into the soft skin, Fro's priest grinned at him, grabbed his wrist, and violently, the apprentice's dagger immediately stabbed into his own belly, and he shouted sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" Liona shouted, then she said, "Oh, damn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An adult male, a thief is quickly rushing from the other end of the corridor, Leona looked around, the corridor should have been sculptured, but it seems to have been taken away by the thieves, she jumped From the beginning, they caught the chandelier hanging on the top of the gallery. The ceilings here are all candles. The curved branches have the spikes used to insert the candles. She wants to pull it out as a weapon. However, it was installed too firmly, and Leona hangs in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
