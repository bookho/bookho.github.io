			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos stood in a narrow corridor, burning fire in the hallway, rendering everything into a gloomy pine green, with a Only the gargoyle rushed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the dragon thorn danced his fingers, and a group of darkness shrouded him. The gargoyle slammed the ground and the wall, full of doubts that the sinus stopped. - They are only as high as half of Danos, but in this corridor where even the sword is difficult to get, this is an advantage. A gargoyle rushes into the darkness while the other waits. On the outside, they are obviously somewhat wise, so not so much - the gargoyles waiting outside are listening, but only the sound of stone and stone collision, not stone and steel, or stone and flesh, it hangs After walking a few steps on the wall, he suddenly jumped high - a short sword spurted from the wall where it was, almost pierced the belly of the gargoyle, after the absence of the work, before it was discovered I silently took it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gargoyle screamed twice, like calling his companion, before the darkness did not disperse, it didn't want to go inside, but The answer to it is still only the constant touch of ping pong and the simple language of the gargoyle - like rough stones rubbing against each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its companion was entangled, and the gargoyle who left outside carefully stepped back two steps, and then it jumped again and again, a smashing arrow The arrow bends on its abdomen, it looks angrily at its place, but its enemies leave him with only the shadow of the end, the irritated gargoyle suddenly spreads its wings, and its wings are only three feet behind. Like a bat or a seabird, it is light and sensitive. It is so narrow that even a strong adult male walks with caution. The slender corridor is spacious enough for it. It sees the enemy, just at the corner, the gargoyle. The feet were heavily pressed on the wall, and its body was thrown out in the splash of stone, as if it were a fierce and fierce rush to the living person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wears the past. Just like literally, wearing the past, when it realizes that this is not a real form but a phantom, it has already plunged into the stone bricks, and the power of magic turns the stone brick into a sand. Deep in it, when it tried to break free, Danos stopped the spell, and the gargoyle was frozen in the stone bricks, like a strange sculpture. Of course, the thieves did not stupidly wait for it to destroy those who banned it. The stone, he raised the short sword, stood up, broke the gargoyle's body with the heavy tail of the short sword, and the bones and the indistinguishable things fell from the gray-white pieces, and all the gargoyles, this The gargoyle does not need water, air and food, but it is happy to capture humans and swallow them just to appreciate their fear and horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos is just to check if the person who has stayed has become a victim, and he is happy that he has not found any related to the Grenada. Things - they were separated when they encountered a spell trap. Danos met the ghoul, plus the original zombie and the current gargoyle, he was almost certain that the owner of the dying spirit was nothing else. It is a lich, not even a gray robe. He doesn't know if other people who decide to stay will regret it. The red dragon's scroll is obviously not a general greeting and temptation. She may have written the price on the scroll, and the lich has already proved it by action. I am very willing to take this sale. But Danos did not think that the idiot who decided to betray them could walk out of the broken fortress as he imagined. Everyone knows that the cage of the trap is always easy to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos returns to the previous corridor, the darkness has expired, a gargoyle is glued to the ground, this comes from the snail bag The glue is very popular among the Grinada people, and there are many uses, but the most widespread is this. Danos ruined the gargoy in the same way, just as he was attracted by the golden light and leaned over. At that time, there was a vague roar in the distance, followed by a white flame and a tumbling smoke. A house connected to the corridor was opened - not the door, but the wall, and a warlock came out from the inside. I patted my robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What have you encountered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three mummy," the warlock said: "You "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A pair of gargoyles," Danos said. "There are a few cute little baboons."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that the choices we made are correct," the warlock said. "So I feel very good. There is no need for more tricky things to make our nights more colorful." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not something we can decide." Danos said, at the same time, when the warlock failed to respond, his stiletto thorn Wearing the air behind the latter, accompanied by a twisted scream, a group of hiding in the dust, the looming fog suddenly has weight and shape, a young child about five or six years old, or a blood-sucking demon That is, the vampire occasionally creates a residue after the meal is finished - its claws are only three inches from the back of the warlock's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's also possible that I killed you," Danos said. He doesn't know what kind of standard is when His Highness Purimal chooses a subordinate. This warlock is not invited from the Warlock Tower. He originally Is it a dragon tooth, maybe a black-haired dragon who wants to further clean up the power of his brother Mitt in the dragon tooth? Even so, Danos felt that at least this person was not a good candidate. He did not judge how much he had been with him. After the thief’s short sword was recovered, he could not even send a gesture and a spell. . Or he believes that runes and protective spells can block a thief's assassination, but if this is the case, thieves and assassins will not be the second most annoying career for the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know where our Highness is?" Danos really hopes that the Warlock will have some use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" can only confirm the general direction." Warlock said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is fine," Danos said. "Start running."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were chased by vampires, as well as vampires, and ran across half of the main fort, and three knights and another warlock, who met two other knights in a large room with six steel spiders. There is no doubt that there is a coincidence, because those steel spiders are attacking vampires under the confusing spells of the warlocks, and the zombies and lich dogs brought by the three knights and warlocks - the rooms in the main fort one by one Destroyed by these monsters who are in a blind state, there are constantly magic traps triggered. They are centered on the warlock and march in a triangular cone shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing through a room, the headed warlock suddenly raised his hand, and the Grenada stopped immediately, then they saw the warlock immediately. A reel was shredded, and a circular hood that obstructed the sound, light and form shrouded the room. Danos had only had a quick glimpse before, only to see that there was a column in his room that was only about his waist. There was a dangerous and delicate bottle on the column. When they ran far enough, Danos asked: "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red robes that are smarter and sharper than the other two warlocks Take a look at Danos: "It's a summoning, summoning a demon or a demon, but the biggest possibility is a demon, because most demons can summon another demon of the same rank or more, if we don't want to be The endless demon is annihilated, it is best not to move the bottle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they ran to the main fort and connected to the slim suspension bridges of the two rear castles, almost No need to look for the whereabouts of Cremal, or guess the identity of the owner, because they can already feel the fear of the cold - after the lich removes the disguise, this breath is like The dragons in a small cabinet can't be avoided and ignored, not to mention the frost that slowly and firmly climbs along the suspension bridge chain. The warlocks and the knights hesitated, hesitated, they didn't have to make a choice, because the violent shock came from under the feet, numerous bricks and pieces collapsed, and two huge white skeletons climbed from the marsh stucco. Come out... Danos clearly heard someone pumping in his ear, the two cockroaches were almost as high as the main fort, but this was not the last, after the two giant cockroaches stood up, they finally collapsed. Below the main fort, a head that is so familiar to Danos is extended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long and large cheekbones, deep eye sockets, staggered cavities, crooked skulls, long tailbone and shins covered with broken membrane wings Finger bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon." Danos said in his heart, "We can't deal with this." Whether it's the worst dragon lich or bone dragon. He thought that the last sentence was that he slammed it out, but no, the stupid thing was the warlock around him. His eyes were filled with fear and remorse. Obviously he didn’t feel that these people could be like this. A lich and his entourage. Before Danos made something, he fled, or tried to escape, the lich who floated above the bone dragon suddenly saw him, the bone dragon bent his neck, the invisible sac was agitated, a strong A powerful acid ejected from its sloppy teeth, ruining the Warlock's protective spells. He shouted and threw a spell. The flame shrouded the bone dragon, and the grayish bones became black and mottled, but this did not Caused too much damage, the bone dragon erected the wing bone, the tip of the phalanx swept the warlock's legs, he fell from the broken step, the palm of a white bone caught and immediately gripped tightly, before It may be a super-large giant. Danos said that the storm giant who saw only in the book put the warlock into the teeth. He was bitten and the broken body fell. This time no one caught him. Except for a group of lich dogs, they bite it, although they don't actually need any food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember the book said that the storm giant is not eating people." A dragon tooth knight murmurs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
