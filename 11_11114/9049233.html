			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter? Kremar?" Yadel's brown eyes glowed like amber in the golden sunlight, this is The only thing in his body that hasn't changed, even his once gentle voice is ruined in the whistling wind and poor diet, but at this moment, the once undead even has a faint illusion - just Like he is still standing in the Rosada sanctuary in the White Tower, and Yadell is still a young pastor who is deeply loved by his father and the teacher and knows nothing about the darkness and filth of the outside world. Www*xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you will need this." The caster said, show a sub-pocket to Yadel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the outer sea of ​​Bibi Dyke, Gülen "takes" from Drake, but Drake has lost a boat and he The sailor is out, and a pocket is probably not worthy of being too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pocket has a few reels, a rune coat, and a wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this plane, the caster has a wide range of meanings, from the warlock, the mage, or the priest, although the priest’s magic is through them. The gods who prayed and prayed, but those who were expelled and punished by their gods, or the unlucky ones who were not online when they prayed, could also use scrolls, wands, and runes that stored spells. Heraldry - the lich has been curious about this - if the priest who left the shrine is still a caster, then is it that their power is not entirely from the gods but themselves, like a warlock and Master, he even considered whether he would like to collect one or two pastors' apprentices to prove his guess, but he couldn't get it. As for now, he doesn't think it would be a good idea to dig a certain god's corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale shook his head in disapproval: "Now you need these more than I do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The new king of Norman in the Highlands is a narrow-minded man," the lich said slowly. "Maybe he did not notice that you have left Norman in the Highlands. Or he is just waiting for you to be like a dog at home." He died tragically in the demise, but he would never be happy to see the soldier and the prince Liona, who he abandoned, and the rebellion that he claimed to be a prince. And the thieves who killed his son - more than 4,000 People, these can only be said to be a drop in the bucket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel smiled a bit. Simply put away the three gold wires on the edge, and embroider a small bag of the golden lady's small image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You promised to give it to me." Mei Mi said with anger: " That little bag, you know that I need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not for the time being," Gülen said lazily: "Don't be so embarrassed, he will soon Still back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a pocket, you know how much it is worth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"That is Yadel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rosa The former pastor of Da." Gülen grabbed the paws of Plum, they were about to scratch his shirt: "You should know this kind of person, it is very annoying. But the key moment can be believed."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only saw a sinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I saw was a can and the Elf Ranger Kerry Former Thunderbolt lord Bydwin, the prince Leona and our caster become friends, "Glan Long said: "Would you like to bet? The things in the pockets are much more expensive than the pockets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei slammed into his eyes I took a sigh of relief and jumped up and wanted to escape. She should have forgotten that Gülen was a thief. Ordinary people might consciously relax their fingers because of the stinging of their eyes. Gülen could not, though his eyes were because This unexpected stimulus oozes tears. But his fingers not only did not relax but tightened, and the foot was gently hooked at Mei Mi's ankle, and she was forced to fall on the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn." Meimi cursed: "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No What to do," Gülen shrugged: "Tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei had a long, nervous eyes, her eyes were beautiful, It combines three colors, the golden color of the sun, the green of the leaves and the blue of the sky, like the stars and the clear water, changing with the light. It will show different colors and combinations, unpredictable. It is not unreasonable for people to call them "jewel eyes." When Gülen approached her, Mei Mei closed her eyes nervously, lest the thieves come. But Gülen only kissed her eyes gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retaliation is over," he whispered in Mei Mi's ear. "You can open your eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful with the ball."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very generous to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You took my pocket." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will have one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guaranteed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guaranteed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun-dried plum is back hot, but she doesn't want to go back to the tent, Ge Lan lies On the low couch, she squatted on Gülen, her arms and feet draped comfortably, like a cat who wanted to sleep late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only today, she said to herself, Fro’s pastor would also like to have nothing to do for a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day he copied a lot of scrolls, the endless abyss is down, and who is not dead will be interested in sugar beet? No! Unless the sugar beet is suddenly alienated into a magical sunflower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world is very willing to look at the side islands, and their time here may be much more than originally expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the beets, saw the sugar cane, saw the hoe, saw the coconut and the white tumor, saw the tobacco, read And so on! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tobacco," Dada said with respect: "I Dear Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fold one for me." The black-haired caster said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Kerry asked, because Kreima's face became extremely bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
