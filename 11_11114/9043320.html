			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something to do yesterday, it’s too late to pay attention, sorry. Today is still three! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soul of the opposite world originally thought that what he needed was to revitalize the business according to the routine of a certain point, develop science, recruit the army, and overthrow the N mountains that were pressed against the head of the slave... There may be countless flower-like beauty along the way. As a result, he found that the first thing he had to do was to farm... or more correctly, to clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of the island was previously managed by the East Crown lord. The meaning of escrow means that only the manager dispatched by the owner is actually responsible for the matter. The eunuch does not live here. The side island is very close to the main island. It can be used several times a night, and serving the lord is his main business. After seeking the consent of the lord, he still lives on the main island. There is only one elder eunuch who lives in the side island. In a sense, he is much more fortunate than his eunuch in the same year. The eunuch and the slave are no longer young and beautiful, they will be driven away again and again. Come out, if you are lucky, you will be filled into the ranks of "smart hands". If you are unlucky or framed, you will become a "bovine horse" and you will be killed directly. - And he can at least live comfortably. As a eunuch, he can also live in stone-built, roofed houses. Although the house is not allowed to have windows, the length and width are limited to 15 steps, but it is better than the mud house where the "Taro" lives. As for slaves, slaves. How can there be things that belong to them? Don't laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad thing is that the fortress may not be so fast in the Norman or Azores in the Highlands, but it is in damp The sultry southern end, so as long as there are not many servants who have worked hard for a month, all kinds of ferns and vines, parasitic plants find their bodies from every gap they can penetrate - they Walking hard, it’s all green and green, and the cracks hidden under the branches and leaves. Kreima remembers that the Beavis hut in Baita had been complicated, but now they see more Chaos, manic vegetation completely occupied the man's house. Here, the roots are strong, and the branches are stretched out. Under their protection, the insects gather into a military. Birds and rodents attracted by insects and fruits have burrowed holes in beams, walls and floors, and snakes and small carnivores who eat rodents and birds have found their own comfort zone here. After stepping on and kicking one of them more than once, Mei Mi believes that if the fortress has been abandoned for decades instead of years, some people will believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there are also human-induced damage. The sandalwood boards on the walls and the ground were taken away, and the gold ornaments and gemstones on the grounds had long since disappeared. The grounds of the corridors and halls had hundreds of black holes and a cluster of ferns. They exuberantly stretch out their feathery leaves, and the remaining alabaster smashed and twisted. Kerry Benedict squatted over one of them, and the ominous imprint went deep into the slate, as if it had been enchanted, the color was still very bright. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is its original owner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada thought for a moment: "In the dragon fire On the island, if one of the lords’ sons becomes the lord, then his other brothers are not castrated as eunuchs or killed, and it is impossible to retain their power and position.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Norman Norman can also have this law," Gülen said: "Our things are much simpler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Kerry has heard a smile, really, if the Duke of John does not exist, Gülen and Birdwin may have avoided this terrible disaster, but stand on the stand of the elf and Sulun believers, he I hate this so-called law that regards life and dignity as nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may need some slaves too." Dada said that he was behind Cremari, and the pace was brisk and shattered - now he belongs The caster of the black hair. Of course, Amos is very unwilling and angry, but it is not the other person who is the leader of the East Crown who asks him for Dada. His father, Amos, is the weakest of the eight brothers. He is more than others. Need the lord's care. Moreover, on the Longhuo Island, the son was always the slave of the father, including themselves, and belonged to the father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought that Kreima had 100,000 slaves." Gülen interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please allow me," Dada continued after saying that he was convinced: "Most of them are just dull 'bovine horses'. Let them come The job of serving the waiter is like letting the animals go to the kitchen to cook the toast. Some of the 'hands' may be able to be drawn, but they are dumb and dumb..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them sort out a few rooms." The soul from the outside world said that he didn't care much about this. For him, the real home is far away from another plane. The other place that gave him a sense of belonging was the gray ridge of the silver-crowned jungle. Other places were hotels and temporary settlements. He did not consider living in Longhuo Island for a long time. For others. He has no concept of hating the huge wealth, just thinking about getting a gnome to build an arm for Birdwin, and then see if there is any place to put the plum into it. He may then have to spend time with Bedwin and others, both to ensure their safety and to build a solid base for Baldwin - they will have discussed in the future, Leona and Birdwin will A mercenary group will be established. This is also the proper meaning. It is true that Birdwin is going to hit the iron. If so, they only need to press a hammer on Baldwin’s arm, instead of traveling thousands of miles. Looking for a gnome to cast an enchanted arm for Birdwin - what they hope is to see a knight as powerful or stronger as it was before the catastrophe, not a mediocre blacksmith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History and the poet's poems are not without the prestige of the mercenary regiment to become king, and Birdwin has a royal girl, Leona, when their coat of arms and flags are once again erected. When you see the place, there is no doubt that some knights and lords who have doubts and dissatisfaction with the Duke of John will gather to them and become their strength and voice. Of course, this takes time. Fortunately, in this unformed mercenary group, the oldest Bordwin of human beings is only forty years old, and the elf's life water can delay the life of human beings to one hundred and twenty. At the age of Byrd, Birdwin had no doubt that he was able to complete the atonement and fulfill his wish before he was white--to send Leona to the throne of Norman in the Highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When can the gnome come?" The soul of the alien world asks: "Do you need to prepare a room for them?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Dada was a little disappointed. These gnomes were exchanged with thousands of slaves, only the right to use, and they will return to their owners when they finish their work. As far as Dada seems, it can be said to be a stupid waste. "Gnomes are very picky about accommodation and food. As you can ask, a skilled gnome needs 50 slaves to serve... but He hesitated to say, "The sergeant may accompany some slaves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German turned and made a few gestures to Crimal, because the elves also I am used to the relationship of the lingering language. The soul of this simple gesture and the outside world will certainly not understand. Gülen is talking about the "spout". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃." The soul of the opposite world turns its eyes to Kerry Ben, that, it doesn't matter, as far as the age of the elf is, he is still a baby, occasionally Help is not a shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact," Dada has seen the relationship between them, although the caster may be the most powerful of them, but the elf is The mind among them: "Maybe this can be said to be a kind of help," he said. "In the merchants, there will be some trained, but injured because of some minor accidents, or other slaves who have regrets, if they If you can't be a slave to your master, you can only become a 'smart hand' or a 'cow horse'. It may be a long time to become a 'smart hand', but if you become a 'cow horse', they will almost always be in the first quarter. They die because they don't have the strong body and rough stomach needed for 'bovine horses.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like a small fish stranded on the beach," he Say: "Even if they are swallowed by sharks in the next moment, but when they are struggling in the sand, are you not willing to pick them up and throw them back into the sea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
