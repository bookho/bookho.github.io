			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night fades, the morning light comes, and the Grenada people leave like a terrible nightmare like a low tide, the eagle head lion body spreads its wings, sharp edges The tiny fluff trembled in the cold wind of dawn, and the knights of dragon claws and dragon teeth were rarely in vain, but this is not to say that they did not know how to retreat in an orderly manner - the governor of Longshan State stood on the wall Watching them - the red dragon of Grenada is only temporarily frustrated, because the slight victory and the arrogance to take the lead in the game is definitely not a rational ruler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought..." Keou said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the last country, the last obstacle," the soul of the outside world said that the rapid march and devastating blows are only to reduce the courage of enemy organizations to resist. And time, the young red dragon did not hesitate to lose power in order to achieve the goal. This power is only one person, or a red dragon can have it. Only Gredi can squander her precious property: "Just they are not Will give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What will they face?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thousands Count or more, powerful enemies," said the soul of the alien world, the little devil can always steal sporadic intelligence from the darkness, although it is only a word, but with the old man and the gram of Kremar According to the information submitted by Lan’s eyeliner, the vassal regiments who were left behind by the Legion were coming here. The elite part of the Legion opened a road that was nearly completely blank for them. They would not encounter obstacles. Will not be hindered, all supplies can be from the surrounding District get - prey has been pulled teeth and claws, although the rest of the meat is not fat, but still used to fill shriveled stomach can barely make do of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keou heard the companion on his back suddenly sighed slightly, thinking that the dark-haired dragon was still unhappy about what happened last night. But to be honest, they did a lot better than he had imagined. Although he was prepared before, this preparation, telling the truth, or not, is better. Kelmen is an idiot. The leader of the Dragon Thorn seems to be aware. What is wrong, the problem is that he is obviously not prepared to let others pay too much attention to himself, especially the Red Dragon. He is neither the Highness nor the Lord. If the raging red dragon swallows him as a snack, the only thing that will be The only trouble is Ostal. After all, he has to re-send a more awkward subordinate to sit in his seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time, Keou’s back suddenly passed a burst of unclear tingling sensation, probably with a scorpion in a bare back The feeling of crawling on it was almost the same. He shrugged his shoulders less comfortably, and even went up and down with the occupants. "Sorry." The face of the lion is not so careless, then one hand falls. Near the saddle, gently scratched: "Is it here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔唔唔唔唔唔..." Keou picked up, His fur is very thick, and the fingers of the black-haired dragon are shuttled inside. The soft fluffy hair is under the sharp mane, and the bottom of the fine hair is covered with a layer of small fluff. This place is indeed Keou. It’s difficult to scratch or pick it up. Although the attendant will clean and comb his hair, even during the march, there is still no dirt and dust between the hairs, but you know that there is always a place you can’t touch. Feeling itchy, the human face lion is almost comfortable to melt, he is deep To breath, licked his lips meet, will just kind of weird feeling temporarily set aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who once squinted, he knows that the priests will be particularly sensitive to undead or negative energy, but he is the first to know the face lion The beast will also, of course, they are known as the four-legged pastor, but he is not a non-dead now - but the strange smell that he and the soul of the alien world alternated, still caused this The vigilance of the human face lion body beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada, perhaps the Lich himself, once thought that this human face is a fallen lion, after all, he is quite Greiner Wind up, but it seems that this beast is just a bit awkward, evil is still far away from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be these guys," Ke said. "I think there are some places that are weird."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich looked at the sight of the human face lion beast. He saw the gray robes that he missed. Under the escort of the dragon tooth knight, several necromancers raised their hands in the sun. They cast their spells—the negative energy slowly falls from the sky to the ground, the wind becomes biting, and the land is covered with a thin layer of frost, facing the dead, or seriously injured to the fearless dragon and the knight without treatment. They spread, they can see, and the voices of the Greinada people are all mourning and cursing - but they have no choice, the Necromancer will not care about the hatred of the dying, covered with frost and The touched limbs become dark under the erosion of negative energy, and then become gray. When the wind passes, the bodies are like the statues of dust accumulated, and they fly in an instant—and those trapped in the mud And soon swallowed up by dirty mud, with it As a whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They won't leave the body for people to look for the weakness of Grenada." The Lich said that his fingers gently stroked the head of Keou. "We should go back.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the young red dragon is also a troublesome guy, she has a psychic warrior around her, but whoever does not know, after all, if that person is the same as the soul of the alien world, The acquaintance of the psychic warlock, then when he wants to disguise himself, unless he is closely related to him, it is impossible to distinguish him from other warlocks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But he always has a way to find this person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you looking at? "Perant asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where to see the jungle. Kerry turned and asked, standing on a tall silver crest, as he once shared it with Kremar, the silver-crowned jungle was rolled over at their feet like a wave, from black It turns into silver, and it turns from silver to black, and it progresses and fades in layers. It is still autumn, but the wind has become cold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want To leave. Pelant said: "It is not impossible." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my father, the king of the jungle has fallen into sleep now?" "Kerry said: "Evil is approaching, I will not leave the jungle at this time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about Kremar? Perant asked: "Is he in danger? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," said Kerry Ben. "After that time, he never gave me any news." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Red Dragon's Legion has approached the Longshan State. "Pelant said: "Maybe they will bring us information about Cremal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I shouldn't expect it," Kerry's smile with a little bitterness: "I can't be sure what message I want to hear— - If he is safe, then he must be in the army of Grenada. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is not to say that he will do evil," Perant said. "You know who he is." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the case of countless eyes watching him?" "The Elf Ranger said: "Perant, I am most worried about this. If he does not do evil, then he will be suspected, punished or executed - I even expect him to be a little," he said. The index finger is closed with the thumb, leaving an almost invisible gap: "Slightly evil." "At least not because of your own persistence, you lose your life and even your soul.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this sentence, even Kerry himself was taken aback, he was surprised Different from himself, he will make irrational judgments for emotions, but he can't find the emotion of remorse from inside, maybe he has made a rational but wrong judgment - he looks at Perant, I found him smiling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't been there for a long time. "Pelant said: "When was the last time, because of the smell of honey wine on the Ingwi, the skunk was introduced into the wine cellar? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the gentleness and said: "You are such a young, Kerry Ben, child, there is still a lot of responsibility for taking over your father from you." Years - you may feel that you should share some hard work for him, but believe me, you have done a good job, even if it is an elf, the good times of youth are still gone, the jungle is your home, It's your anchor, not the shackles and chains that are added to you - do it, no matter what, your mind will not direct your body and soul in the wrong direction. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked outside the jungle, before the heavens and the earth, there was a flawless white, that is the snow cover swamp, and the friends that Kerry’s family missed were The other side of the swamp.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————— —————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesh gasps, he is from the fur He got up and walked out of the tent. He had a dream, but this dream he didn't want to talk to anyone, including the priest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the key. The beasts of the beasts and the red dragons of Grenada are all alliances. This has been confirmed, but he can't believe a red dragon. Everyone knows, red. The dragon is a symbol of evil - although it is a bit ridiculous, when choosing an ally, an evil guy will undoubtedly cause more trouble. He would rather drink with the giant or dance with the goblin, not willing And the red dragon's messenger coexisted with one place - last time, this red robe called Austal shamelessly teased the orcs once, dozens of tribes were young, and young men were all damaged in Thunderbolt, although they It was died under the collapsed rocks and wood, but Gersh knew that even if they were lucky enough to escape, they could not live longer than a human slave. They grew very fast and aging quickly. The Marsh tribe escaped because of his discretion, and later annexed the tribes who became weak because of the lack of men. He also became the king of the orcs, not the leader of a tribe, but Geshe did not. Because of this, I am grateful to humans, or dragons. He is more willing to put the Austal on the fire and slowly roast it to the outside. It may also apply a little honey to it, and then accompany the spicy winter wine. Eat clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can’t, this guy is the agent of Gredi, and is said to be the commander of one of the three Grenada triads, but Gersh doesn’t feel at all This guy is a warrior, he is a businessman, an annoying hybrid, just like every businessman Geshe meets, or worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesh twitched his nose, spit on the hairless thumb, and then stretched his thumb into the air, the wind from the northernmost place was strong After a warm westerly wind, winter is coming soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, the king of the respected orc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is another An annoying but unreasonable or ate guy, he is the agent of the Gree's agent. It is said that Austal is currently busy with a very important thing in Grenada, important to him. I must temporarily abandon the various things of the orc here. His disciple, a name that is a bit sissy, and a little like a dragon, temporarily replaced his position, but Gersh suspected that he would greet himself every day to complete Aosta. I distributed the constipation face that I once liked to watch you don’t like me and can’t kill me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about Thunder Castle?" Gersh asked routinely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's as usual," Rica said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesh reveals a sardonic smile. In the past, the lord of Thunderbolt only left the Thunderbolt when the lilacs were in full bloom. At that time, if the orcs did not Being able to cross the Thunderbolt, then only the Wuthering Plain will be withdrawn. When the spring comes, the horns and the argali will give birth to the little scorpion every day, the orcs will not attack the human defense line tribes - and how long the lord has disappeared ? Winter is coming, and he is still playing with his fingers in the king. Maybe he thinks his own law can make the Thunder Castle cast like steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I must leave,” Dylan said with anxiousness: "Winter is coming, the orcs may attack at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there no soldiers and knights in Thunder Castle?" Unhappy to say: "Not to mention there are so many mages..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am the lord of Thunderbolt."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Thunder Castle go to hell," Princess Anan’s eyes sparkled with exuberant light: "My son, you will have the entire Highland Norman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John King will also have heirs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A baby that can die at any time!"黛Princess An Chang said: "And his body is declining day by day, he Maybe tomorrow will die - you should stay in the kingdom... I have already given you an excuse, Dylan, you should have a marriage contract with a beautiful and noble girl."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough!" Dylan shouted: "I don't want my wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think you are!?" Princess Ang Chang followed and shouted: "Do you think you are a Don Cray?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
