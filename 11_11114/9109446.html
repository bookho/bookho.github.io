			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames and magma spewed out of an obsidian dish and poured from it into the smooth ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining a goal, rather than continuing to walk aimlessly on the ice sheet gave the adventurers great encouragement, they only used one-half The daylight went to the scheduled position, the mage re-calculated once, and then summoned his own fire element waiter there - the eight-legged spider slaps the cheeks, and is somewhat dissatisfied with this place full of water and cold, satisfied The caster (especially a master who is not very close to the owner) did not stay too much in the main material plane, and almost only a few breaths disappeared - it was last time than people Seeing the strong and dazzling, the legs covered with fine steel hair, and the body inlaid with blue and white eyes are golden, making it look like an expensive gemstone with gold A beautifully crafted accessory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a bit stronger - perhaps because of the last big meal, or something else, but the lich doesn’t want too much The inquiry, this spider who prefers another owner is not loyal to him, it doesn't matter, anyway, all he needs is a tool, not a loyal heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let others retreat to more than a thousand feet, and then recited the last spell, the "gate" of the fire element plane was The rune placed in the center of the obsidian disk opens, and the spider waiter is responsible for guiding, ensuring that the junction of the main material plane and the fire element plane falls into the lava river instead of other places - people and elves other than the wizard are watching with surprise This rare and spectacular sight... Of course, at first it was not so "magnificent", the obsidian plate is certainly larger than the platter with beans and meat, but it is no smaller than Birdwin. The arm is longer, and the magma that falls from it is just a bunch of fingers. It falls on the ice and instantly condenses into a crisp rock by the cold chill, but soon, the diameter of the magma The thickness of the hands of McGee's hands was amplified, and the black of the rock that was originally able to spread upward was immediately suppressed. The flaming new magma melted the solidified rock, and a large amount of water vapor rose from the sky. The onlookers were brought by the wind. Small crystal hit Cheeks, they heard a roar like thunder, but also like a bird or a cub Jicha continuous sound, but who can not find the source of this sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the Lich has already flown by flying, he fell into his companion, watching the lava more step by step with a more professional eye The ground violates the territories that are cold and snowy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's under the ice?" asked Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice." Birdwin said: "Kerry and I mentioned that there was a boring silver dragon that had been excavating on the ice for hundreds of years. The result is still ice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all is." The Lich said that he once glanced at the former paladin with a strange look: "The North Although 90% of the land is composed of ice, the ice layer may not be as solid as we are, pure ice, here is the same as the mainland, in the earth. In the depths of the same, there are countless secrets, faults, squeezing, empty holes, and groundwater flow..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Obviously our silver dragon did not make one The turtle is holding its secret," Gülen said. "It has a stronger, stronger, and longer-lasting helper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A huge The sea vortex," said the Lich. "Maybe it is just a gap that appears during the melting and collapse of the ice. The sea of ​​the night sea rushes into the gap and loops between the ice and the ice. After swaying, and after accumulating enough seawater, the space appeared another due to excessive pressure, or several slits, and the seawater flowed out from the other side of the gap, and a miraculous balance appeared throughout the process. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do they not freeze?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The speed of seawater is fast enough not to Yes,” said Kerry Ben, just as the Starlight River will only condense a thin layer of ice floes in the coldest winter of the Grey Ridge. The faster the water flows, the less likely it is to freeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How fast?" This is what Birdwin asked. This question is quite critical. "Is it like a horse?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly slower than the running horse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do we catch it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't need to catch it," the lich smiled awkwardly. "We can't catch it. It may be as big as an island." Since it was silver dragon Nest, then it won't be small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..." The thief stared at the heat of the plane of the fire element and expanded it to a cave about 15 feet in diameter, which is more correct. Said, it is a lake, a bizarre, lake that allows him, Leona and Birdwin to jump in, with flames and steam on top, boiling water in the middle, and heavy rocks and ice below. The magma continuously flows into the water, causing dazzling light in the water. The heat contained in the melted rock and the weight of the ice push down the ice layer, and the ice layer is overwhelmed with a harsh, squeaky sound. This process continues for several times. A small cell, during which they simply ate a little food, the lich asked them to take off all the clothes, and applied each other with a cream that he mixed with the drug powder and the seal oil. The cream immediately rubbed on the body. Infiltrated into the skin, causing a slight tingling sensation. "What is this?" McGee asked, after he took off his clothes, he was not so much like a child. Birdwin was glad that Leona had already walked with a woman of love. Going behind the ice mound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A drug that guarantees you won't lose your temperature.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But we have runes,” said the gnome. “We haven’t been before. "Do you do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's because we don't have to deal with the worse situation." The thief said: "If you really have more magic symbols Wen, I think a lot of people here will need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome immediately closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It also has other effects," the Lich said. "Although I hope we don't use this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bydwin?" Leona poked her head out of a icicle that looked like a floating gauze: "Can you look after the back?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Birdwin said that several men can help each other, but it is very polite to let the girl of love not let Liona serve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you?" Gülen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't need it." Kerry Ben said: "We are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Elf." The gnome McGee complemented him and put on his underwear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes..." Gülen said: "I really admire them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The darling of Angris." Birdwin said that the scenery behind the ice hills is not so embarrassing, except for the daughter of love, and the fear and tension that human beings will inevitably face when they are unknown. Oona just gave him a quick kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you ready?" The Lich said, raising his hand once again to lift the spell with the fire elemental plane, and the last pour suddenly stopped, gray The black color spreads rapidly at a speed that can be recognized by the naked eye, and people can feel that the ground beneath the foot suddenly starts to violently slam, like a beast buried under the ice is waking up, it is struggling and is about to penetrate. The ice layer, returning to this peaceful world, brought endless disasters and disasters to the world. Their heartbeats suddenly stopped, and they jumped up and ribs were faintly painful, like being a huge piece. The stone hit - after that, in the twinkling of an eye, the rock that shook out of the ice sank without warning. With only one time that could not be breathed, they could only see the vortex remaining on the water. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, remember that there is not much time left for us," the former undead said: "Also remember, you must wait for my orders, or you may fall into the dark waters that are rushing, and you are above and below. It’s a hard ice layer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they came to the new lake, they saw the turbulent water surface, the vortex has disappeared, but there seems to be more More things are affecting it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan touched the silver rope around his waist, his body was hot, I don’t know if it was because of the drug or other reasons, his blood flow noise With his ears roaring, he was a little worried about whether he could normally hear the caster's command—the gnome grabbed his shoulder, and like everyone else, he put the fur and coat in the pocket. And their weapons, they have to sneak into the water, these things will only become their burden. McGee stared at the surface of the water, his scattered shadow on the water, he had taken a fake beard, but the shadow in the water made him look like a black beard, he grinned and smiled, he used to be so Fear of death, but when he noticed that it was close at hand, he felt that he was not so scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona and Birdwin hold hands and lean against each other, they are the only daughters of love, her unprecedented radiance, blushing cheeks and The waves of the eyes may make the stars of the stars bend their knees and offer everything, but unfortunately Baldwin never looked away from Leona, and the elves and wizards are making the final preparations. They are This group of people really depend on and guide, but the daughter of love is indeed beautiful, but beauty is not what they need most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are we going to encounter?" Gülen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A snowy island." The Lich said, "When we jump into the water, the sun will give us some light through the clear water, and we What you need is dive, remember not to breathe with your mouth and nose. My medicine will give you the air you need through water. Then, if you find that you can't sink, you can take whatever you think is heavy enough. Things to speed up, but don't be too fast, touch the rocks around you, don't leave it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then," the undead continue, "You You will see an island. Of course, in the sea, your view may not be so clear," he paused for a moment: "But you just have to make sure you see a huge stop."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when the lich told me that the snowy island came, no one doubted what it was seeing—there was a sudden reflection of the water surface, the ice was shattering, and the sea water spewed from the new lake. Out, and involved everything in it, even if it was expected, Gülen heard the scream of horror, perhaps his own, and he saw the gnome swaying past him, but he did nothing. When he arrived, he was wrapped in sea water and could not control his hands and feet. The salty water poured into his nose and mouth. The thieves curled up, just like when they were hiding from the mentor’s fists when they were young, they would hide them, just like the lich. Said, the drugs on the skin can help them breathe in the water. When he hits a rock or ice, he barely finds some autonomy. He tries to open his eyes. Fortunately, the sea in the night sea is not as good as other places. The salt in the sea is high and the stimulation to the eyes is small. He looks up and can see the shaking sky. Looking down, the thief’s line of sight is frozen. Yes, he imagined that he would To anything but his nightmare has never been this strange and beautiful scenes appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not an island, it’s a city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge city, it is at his feet, it is blocked by the new stone pillars, although this can only retain it but a breath of time, Even if a stone tower like a tall tower has been broken, the beauty it waits for is just a casual spin, and it restarts its fixed journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief has no thoughts, he sinks into deeper water, and the huge city seems to pass slowly under his feet, no matter what language or how The dexterous tongue can't describe Gülen's anxiety at this time. He flutters like a moth that perceives the flame.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————— ————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fast!" Ostal shouted, he had already vaguely guessed a bit, but he did not expect the secret to rely on the underground sea vortex to move. After all, the Frost Giants can't be too close to the adventurers, especially when there is a Master among them. Austal once scorned this little guy and thought that they would not be spared if they fell into the Silver Falls, but he was wrong. . After that, he has been paying attention to them, from the Dragon Fire Island to the Snow Covered Marsh, especially the black-haired wizard, or he still does not let Austal be jealous, but the Red Robes Warlock is hesitant, In them, he can feel that there is a greater force that dominates his destiny. They are like a whirlpool. Easy contact may make them uncontrollable and involved, difficult to get rid of or worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
