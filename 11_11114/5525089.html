			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar placed a black ochre bottle with only one layer of dry ink for the servants to clean, roll the reel and tie the rope into the pocket When he took off his white robe and prepared to go back to bed and comfortably sleep, a bunch of half-wilted fragrant aconite fell out from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory it brings is not very good, but the memory of this thing has never been controlled--the boy without hands and feet swayed, the pale light, the shaking Subway cars, dirty hands, golden coins, roads, elevators, corridors, red-hot security doors, keys slamming, home, ä people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot, sharp sting hit his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will never see them again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flame climbed over its back, swept the whole body, and it was a sting, first the knee, then the kidney. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No parents, no friends, no help, no countless enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will die at any time, and die badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limbs were torn and the mouth was filled with melted lead and nailed to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a nightmare? No, the soul of the outside world has had a nightmare, it knows how to break free from the nightmare - as long as you know you are in reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a thought, sharp and cold thoughts, like a whip or a blade, too real, maybe it’s real, it’s a soul of the opposite world. The deepest fear and the most secretive expectation, so vividly appearing, sticking out the claws to dig its heart, the soul of the outside world grasps the curled chest, which is empty and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It learns spells, kills monsters, jokes with the lich, tastes food, and sings with sailors. It seems to have forgotten that it used to be an ordinary human being - no, it has not forgotten, although the memory is already incomplete, but the memory is already incomplete, but It remembers it, its parents, its home, its world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wants to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can! - The soul of the outside world shouted, it trembled and tried its best to resist this desperate feeling of almost irresistible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandon it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need to rest, rest well, rest forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud noise awakened everyone in the smog hut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Alva Master, who first arrived, hurriedly glanced at him and said, "I knew that I should play that gamble with Cobbert." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Kerry asked, the Ranger was comfortable and light, until the robes on the feet, no belts, shallow mouth shoes, he gently left the left hand machete Throw it up and let it merge with the companion of the right hand, and the silver-blue blade flows in the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caubert told me that on the little bird, our little friend cast a spell that would allow him to lift a killer whale," the wizard entered into the room. The Snake Mang is closely followed: "I listened to his narrative and thought it was impossible. This power should come from you, Master Kremar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; His last sentence is to say that the young black-haired mage standing in the corner of the room is pale, not a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't look very good," the older mage said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," said Kremar’s voice weakly: "I copied a reel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mica stone's giant head was involuntarily replaced by a position, upside down, and a broken bone posture; before the magic set in it has not disappeared, the water it spits out ruined the floor of the entire room, the silver ship and The cute birds are torn apart, and the scent of their storage melts in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people." He shook his head and said, but there was not much harsh ingredient in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please remind me when you want to copy the scrolls later," Kerry said softly: "I will be far away."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must." Kremar guarantees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you another room," said Master Alva. "Child, go to meditate, go to sleep, and tomorrow you will join me with this room." Reverted to the original state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar was grieved and gratefully bowed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What is that? Asked by the soul of the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new room is as comfortable and quiet as the original one, but his original sleepiness has long been tormented with pain and fear. He thought it was an attack against him or the lich, but the lich told him that it was not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The bloody rebellion - it will dig into your fears, ridicule your weaknesses, and force you to fall into the pessimistic and negative mud until you can't extricate yourself - also It is dead, the lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You···, the soul of the outside world did not ask with enthusiasm, forget to say it to me, is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- After it became undead, it disappeared, and the lich was calm and honest, and it didn’t have much impact on me when it existed. , can be ignored, and it only appears at a fixed time - every 30 days, that is, the time required for the Magic Galaxy to rotate one week. Each time you postpone one, you can easily avoid its influence with a little estimation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Uh? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Nothing, then say that you have this every month? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We, the undead who once asked, why are you so funny? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I laughed very normal, the soul of the opposite world said that the blood of the self will not come from the elf, your mother, then say, father ? Is your father not human? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich remains silent until the questioner realizes how stupid he is - he lazily stretches his body and drills into the Alva Mage for his guests. The camel blanket wrapped in silk, it is cool and smooth, smells fragrant, and the soul of the outside world can't help but take a deep breath when sliding into it. The lich told him that their body was supported by positive energy and would not feel tired. He felt that the guy who had been away from the living for too long was releasing nitrogen and carbon dioxide, probably methane or something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to take a good night's sleep, in the sea of ​​knowledge, not floating in the sky and lying on the bed, wrapped in a soft blanket is completely different, but once The undead obviously does not think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You surprised me, the lich did not shy away from saying that you can actually get rid of it, in such a short time, relying on yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Don’t you say that it’s just a slight discomfort? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- That is for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world does not care to shrug in consciousness - perhaps it should not say that I will not return home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you want to go home? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Why not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s a boring world, the Lich says, and you’re not worth mentioning, ordinary looks, poor minds, small homes, meager The income can only be said to be a healthy body, the longest life of 120 years - but in this world, you can have more - just like what I have seen in your memory, wealth , women, men, honor, powerful strength and lofty status, and youth and life that can not be measured for a long time... If you can go to the last step, you can even be unscrupulous and free to do whatever you want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- But that's not mine. The soul of the outside world sleeps but swears firmly. Maybe it will be good for you. It smiles, but the mediocrity of me, it has no fault, it should not be killed by itself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soul of the alien world wakes up again, he finds himself sitting On the chair, holding a silver ball in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster opens the palm of his hand, the ball is hollow, and the thin shell of Mithril is engraved with magic symbols and words inside and outside, which can be opened and has a smooth inside. The colorless tourmaline, with a ruby ​​inlaid on the outer shell - he blinked his eyes, and a small piece of paper wrapped around the ball, which was simply written in the general language: "Once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the soul of the opposite world grinned: "I owe you once." It said to the guy in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some small letters on the back of the note that outline the use and type of such water polo - this is a coveted Three feet of small things - how much water can be purified by the water polo depends on the quality and volume of its contents. The most common is alum. The colorless quartz can purify water five times as much as the same volume. The colorless crystal is Ten times that of quartz, colorless tourmaline is ten times that of crystal, and stone is the best, but no one is so wasteful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small water pistol he holds in his hand can purify about one whale oil drum, that is, eight beer barrels, two hundred and eighty-eight gallons of water. Ruby inlaid in the outer shell can boil water while purifying the water. It almost cleared half of their savings, hey, half of the lich's savings, the soul of the outside world shyly thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a small reminder to prevent any "human accident", the water polo is not easy to damage, it is made by Mithril, who is the problem? It can be used, it is a magical product, it does not need magic when it works, and it is very easy to get rid of it. In addition to the voyager, it is also very popular among the aristocrats and wizards who like to enjoy it. Even if it is stolen, it can be exchanged enough. The family has a wealth of ten years of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the note, he also indicated that he had agreed with Kerry to get off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world hurriedly grabbed the magic pendant, the jewel on the pendant was in the seventh grid, only about an hour away from the departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
