			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keou landed in front of the city gate and caused some trouble, but since he is a member of the royal family of this country, the final result is It was a slight riot, and a small loss suffered by a businessman - there were a few winged snake eggs in his cargo box. Although the packaging was very tight, he was still smelled by the male lion, and he stretched his claws. Grab one of the boxes, flip it over, find the eggs and eat them thick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you also eat eggs?" The soul of the outside world asked curiously, throwing a jewel at random, which was a surprise to the businessman. You know that even if a dragon knight's mount eats all his goods, he may not be compensated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to reduce the number of winged snakes." Keou explained: "They will also steal our eggs. Of course, their eggs are also very good to eat." It is like a salty fish with a unique taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the less respectful, the soul of the opposite world feels that the human face of the lion is also like a wonderful Pulling weird creatures, they have human face and wisdom, the body of the lion, the wings of the bird, and the variety of viviparous products. It is reasonable to say that in terms of gene proportion, they should also give birth to small babies or lions. But they are born with eggs - and they need to hatch, the soul of the outside world is very regrettable, although the human face lion beast is willing to believe it, but still did not believe that it is willing to let it look at their eggs, but listen The female lions and beasts chatted and said that their eggs are not big, that is, the human hands are embracing the size, and the hatching of the cubs is even smaller than the children of the human face lion beasts - imagine it. Female lions and beasts can carry them in carrying their children. Take away, male lions and hens can sometimes even have two or three, but this opportunity is rare, unless it is a strong enemy, and even in normal times, the male lion is not Allowing close to your own children - because the male lions and beasts are inevitably a little rough, and because they have a mane relationship, once the cubs climb in, it is difficult to find them again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably like a panda of giant pandas and giant pandas, the soul of the outside world thinks, its heart is itchy, he really wants to see eggs and young We, but since the human face of the lion and the beast has decided to migrate, there is always one day it can no longer be the identity of the Prince of Grenada, but only to visit them as a half-elf mage, a friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The lich thinks that this is nothing strange, not to mention that the succubus can still give birth to their children in a few breaths, and then treat them as rare. The nightingales are eaten, even the dragons, like the new king, Mitt, Kelmen and Kelsey, and the bloody guys, their descendants are also born in this world in the form of eggs, The same needs to be hatched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keou’s dark-haired dragons are swaying on the streets,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd is like The water waves are generally separated, sheltered from the promenade, hidden in the shadows, and there are no warlocks, but no one will go to the side of a strangely-faced lion beast, front or back, it is so huge, no You need to lift your body and you can stand on the second floor. No, there may be more people who face each other. They don't want to be a good meal because of their curiosity. Although the small discussion is inevitable. In the ear of Keou. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are saying," Keo said: "I am a rather perfect work, what do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It means you are very beautiful," of course the soul of the alien world knows that the warlocks mean that the gram is the male lion body beast polluted by magic alienation, the warlocks, and the necromancers often It will do so, even if the chances of success are not high, but like the temptation of a paladin, the ability to make a good or neutral creature become evil will also make them proud for a long time, "humans often say, a beautiful The creature is a masterpiece of heaven - you really have no flaws, Keou."dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you are cheating on me," Keou Say: "But it doesn't matter, I like this kind of deception, deceive me as much as possible, three times a day, or four times, many times I will not mind very much."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world curls up under the cover of the mane, he shakes his head slightly, for the first time for his own sense of decision Fortunately, if you do change tenable son, he would probably have to look for other ways - he can not be so stiff a boy band 入格瑞纳达, that he put an end to direct and what difference did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I fly?" Keou said: "Let them see my wings?" He intentionally raised his wings, and his wings and body suddenly occupied the whole In the street, several warlocks have already made gestures of defense, but Keou did not do anything. He just wanted to scare these people around and run around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen them, it is really a group of pretty rude guys." Keou said, what he did not say is that he once thought that when a red dragon fell asleep... he might taste the dragon blood The taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expelled male lion beast will feel lonely, sometimes he sits on the sand dunes, watching the sunset like the flowing sea of ​​flames in the boundless The sky is flowing, the wind is blowing through his ears, only the sound of the sand is blown when there is no wife, no children, only gerbils and worms can play, even if this life continues once again How about a hundred years, he imagined that he could not move because of aging, he was buried by quicksand, and the gerbils he had eaten and played would be surrounded by unwillingness, biting his skin and unplugging his cockroaches. Mao, dug his eyes, and at that time he might still feel that he couldn’t help but tremble when he thought of it - just before he noticed the change of Grenada, he was still thinking about finding the one. The red dragon is the child of Grein or the Griffith. It is said that the human form of Gredi is an impeccable beauty. Yes, she is evil, but Keou thinks that if she must do it for herself. What are you unable to resist?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he knows that the bigger possibility is that he will be burned into a pile of grayish white ashes by the flame of the red dragon, the flowing air will take them away, they are The wind scatters and falls into the sand and clay, but at least it is better to be the nutrient and poop of the gerbil. At least the bard will write that he is being angered when he records the legend of him or Greed. The red dragon kills, instead of being anonymously dumped in the desert, becoming a food for the pests - but if so, he must first find a bard, oh, the bard is not in Grenada. Rarely, the problem is that they are not the masterpiece of the dragon thorns, but the masterpieces of other forces. Keou thought about whether to fly to find a far one, but he just fell into a small town, where people ran away without a trace. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut, he is not a red dragon, don't anyone tell them that the male lion body is warm and lovely like a white rabbit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road back to the mansion is not short-lived, but even if it is not possible to fly, Keao runs very fast, when he runs on the street, The wind that is brought up can even blow down the people in the corridor. Some fixed and not very secure accessories have fallen from the wall. The thieves are also stealing, robbing and stealing when it is difficult for everyone to open their eyes. The murder, the resulting small fluctuations and curses have come and gone, but the initiators have been far away thousands of feet away, and it is impossible to hear their complaints. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it doesn’t matter, people walking on the street, one hundred, no, one thousand may not pick one Good people who have good intentions, after all, in Grenada, goodness and kindness are used as a derogatory term, or even slaves walking under the slabs of the street are not necessarily sinful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like it here." Keou said: "Look at those beautiful people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Those who are not female lions and beasts." The soul of the opposite world said that while sliding down from his back, it praised Keou's beauty and may not be overstated. Keou has a bright black hair like the night fur, and the red color on the tail end. Like a jumping flame, the face is not as correct as other male lions and beasts - it means that this face looks a bit awkward, but it can be said that it has a different kind of charm, and it is power. In other words, he can make any female feel drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Keou said with amazement: "But how cute they are, so small! Hey!" He shouted at the female winged beasts. Road: "Would you like me to fly with you? I promise that it will be very comfortable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no flight here." A bold woman The beastly person said, then she saw the dark-haired dragon, their master, so she immediately squatted and let her forehead touch the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think there will be a lot of opportunities for you to fly in the future," said the soul of the outside world, raising his hand and letting the beasts stand up. "But you don't Do you think we are closer to the Red Dragons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keou swears what I hate 哔-哔, but he is very careful, no Immediately close to those malformed humans - he is wise to see that these human wings are not normal, they are different from other human beings, like the children's mud, which is hard to be pinched on the body - - Keou turned his head and glanced at his friend: "Is it a gift?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have not doubted that this is what I did?" Most people think so. Well, after all, these human beings are in his courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
