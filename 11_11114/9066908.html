The first lord of the East Crown built its own fortress and palace nearly a thousand years ago, in order to ensure that it will not The natural invasion was damaged or even destroyed. He did something that would cause most mortals and casters to panic--with the help of a powerful caster, he fooled Talos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Temple of Talos on the main island is only a small scale. After all, the original Longhuo Island is not a place of human preference. There are only two towers in the temple. Pastor of Los. The first, or the second lord, built his own fortress elsewhere, but they soon discovered that the place where the Longhuo Islands were not considered to be livable was justified, hurricanes, ground movements, lava and even damp salty The hustle and bustle of the sea breeze can destroy any wood and stone. They are envious of the seemingly simple but unconstrained temple of Talos. At first, they tried to ask the pastors whether they were from building materials or artisans. Hands, but the priests just laughed. Later they learned from a caster that the temple of Talos was taken care of by the god of the storm, and the power of nature could not destroy them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mortals, they are not allowed to stay in the temple for a while, let alone live in it, but the bold caster proposes a Calling the arrogant thoughts - if the believers of Talos are harmed by other people or forces, then they can ask the priest of Talos to destroy the enemy for himself. After careful planning, the only two remaining in the Temple of Talos The priest disappeared silently into the violent hurricane. When the main hall of Talos received news, the new priest of Taros came and the lord told them that the temple of Talos was not built on a separate island. On the other hand, it is impossible to show the greatness of this respectable god. For this reason, he deliberately built a gray temple on the island with dark brown sand and dense vegetation. And sincerely said that he will give up all the benefits of this island - the income of this island is not too thin for a lord, but for the owner of the East Crown who holds dozens of large and small islands He said that in order to achieve the ultimate goal, he and his descendants are also tolerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he blurs the existence of this temple. The new priests of Talos were somewhat confused at the beginning because they could not sense the vague details, but the gold and intelligence of the lord quickly erased the confusion. After all, the temple was too It’s too remote, and there’s a little longer without a pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not Talos, it is Rosada or Fro. Or it is not the Longhuo Islands that still maintain the ancient system. This strategy may be difficult to implement. But compared to people's respect for Talos, they are more eager to get people's fears, and he and his pastor have always held a contemptuous and indifferent attitude towards mortals, otherwise the priest of Talos will not destroy the village or overturn the fleet. As a routine that must be carried out every ten days; plus there are very few people with free bodies on the Longhuo Island, very few, very few, they are only a few tenths or even a hundredth of a slave. And slaves even belong to their masters, how can they be allowed to have their own beliefs? Therefore, even the most frequently seen in the poor people, Ilmot also failed to establish his own temple in the Longhuo Islands, even if the Lord of the Dragon Fire Island allowed it. What if you stand up, the temple without believers is an empty shell, not only can not bring faith to the gods but will consume their power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talos is also a rude god, his temple is almost exclusively made of gray rough rock, if his followers are willing to decorate them He will be happy if he is brilliant, but he will not be too angry if he is not. He is more concerned about his strength and prestige. It is spread and spread in this plane. So from beginning to end, no one knows that there are actually two in the East Crown. The Temple of Talos - but one of them uses countless expensive casting materials. It is not the priest of Talos, or even his followers, but a group of humble mortals who attempt to steal his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now. This false temple was destroyed, just as the priest of Talos destroyed a tower, its pedestal is the altar of sin and sorrow, Rosada has always been the deadly enemy of Talos, purifying At the time of his altar, no matter whether the priest of Rosada or the holy emblem of the power of the morning sun had no intention of enthusiasm, the power from the initial light hit the altar. It was shattered, and since the base was broken, the temple of the building on which it was built naturally collapsed. The temple, which was no longer protected by Talos, turned into a real ruin in several breaths, while the priest of Talos The second impact that came out of the call completely achieved the effect that the priest wanted to see. Just like every time before, they came to the sea and would block everything that went on their way and swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord wants to yell, he grabs the jewel pin on his chest, and his mage blocks him before it is crushed: "Keep it," said the wizard. "Someone casts spells that hinder transmission here." Otherwise why don't we leave your heavy, useless fat pig right away? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will take you out of here with flying," although the lord's weight is amazing, the Masters still have considerable rewards. To collect it, the two mages looked at each other and determined that their ideas were the same. Gold coins, gems and casting materials were of course good, but if the uncommon tsunami (they almost can confirm) is a summoner. Strong priests or mages, they will not hesitate to abandon the lord and retreat - now it is necessary to see their movements fast enough, the size of the spell that limits the transmission of the control is as small as they hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They move very fast, but the size of the spell limit is larger than they think, and after leaving the dome, they see those calls with the help of spells. Hurricanes and tides, a group of guys in black robes, but not masters but pastors, especially two of them wearing blue and white clothes embroidered with red lightning patterns - the high-level priest of Talos, and the lord When the mage saw them, they looked down at the lord's costumes subconsciously. Please forgive them for not seeing them at the beginning. The fat body of the lord makes the golden lightning look like a multi-corner. The stripes don't look exactly like the one you should have. But now they understand it with a little association - the mage who grabbed the arm of the lord let go of his hand without warning, and his companion was dragged by the sudden weight, almost falling into the tumbling water from midair, but fortunately he Responsively released his hand immediately. When the lord grabbed his robes, he cast a spell and cut his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord screamed and fell into the sea, and the two mages watched indifferently, and they did not want to face such a group of priests of Talos - one of them was disgusting The ground pulls the lord's hand from his robes and wipes the ring on the finger (both are magical rune rings. Unfortunately, as a mortal, casting spells is not their first reaction), as for that piece The useless piece of meat is thrown into the sea to accompany its owner, and then the second reel is torn open. The previous flight has reached the time when it will be lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his companion satisfactorily pinched the pin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Talos noticed them, after all, the lord was originally "carryed" by the two casters, seeing them throwing the lords into the sea, Talos The followers did not want to be pursued. In any case, their main task was to destroy this gorgeous fortress and the people inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they have tongues. They also have fingers." A pastor said viciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Compared to us, the caster who once served a mortal who smashed my god needs to gain the compassion and tolerance of Talos." The main - the mage who can be with the lord may not be unusually strong, but it will be very difficult to deal with. He kept staring at the two mages, and the two mages were suspended in the air. When they discovered that the pastors did not intend to add the names of the two to the list of destruction, they bowed deeply to the pastors and quickly fled. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we going?" asked the Master who took the Lord's Ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going high...the higher the better." Flying is time-limited. In order to escape the tsunami, they must rush to the spell before it disappears. The highest place they can reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think that's a good idea," said the Master of the question. Point to the "highest position". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest place in the East Coast Island is the crater. The lava that was previously unable to spit out is piled up in the bowl basin, forming a small conical tower, and now Almost all of this small tower is surrounded by bright red cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor of Talos does not simply drive a disaster when focusing on and destroying a place. The deepest layers are disturbed and torn by the gods they prayed to Talos. The rock formation collides with the rock formation, and the soft lava is pushed into the fragile faults and fissures. If the rock layer is broken, it flows in the rock formation. The icy groundwater rushed into the lava, causing the burst to once again shake the overwhelmed surface. Once again, the energy that was taken away by the fire elemental creatures gathered together, crushed each other, and assimilated each other, but in a blink of an eye, the huge and scorching wind wrapped in the ashes and pieces rushed into the air, the mages shouted, Gu It is not allowed to leave the restricted transmission range, and the rune seal is crushed. One of them is unfortunate because the lord’s transmission rune is transmitted back to the place he thinks is the safest, that is, his inner library. The most solid walls and the most dangerous traps, the problem is that they can't isolate the sea water and can't resist the magma. Fortunately, the Master still keeps a few cards, and he finally counts all his spells, reels, wands, and potions before he exhausts all his spells, reels, wands, and potions. Get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is hiding in a shadow, the sea is running under his feet, the most floating on it is the body, he saw the Naga, she is no longer Keeping the state of the giant lizard, clinging to a piece of ebony (probably the roof beam), the mage immediately hides himself better, but he does not want to see Naga, but he knows too much about what Naga is. Do - if she is as weak as it seems, you can't see her at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
