In the Evil's Wanweilin, there is indeed an undead creature recorded. Even a lich will repent and be deeply remorseful and willing to make good atonement for his previous actions, but that may be small and small. It didn't happen, they didn't expect to see this miracle in a rough martyrdom city that wasn't worthy of being written by the bard, so even most of the adventurers couldn't understand what was happening. However, they still tried their own way to interrupt this ceremony. Leona took the lead to cast a rune, but she was not a caster, so the chosen spell was completely wrong. The flame that broke out of the rune was suddenly swallowed up by the whirlpool of cold negative energy. A little effect; Baldwin waved a wide sword, trying to destroy the squad, but he couldn't get anything but the ear bleeds caused by the scream of resentment. The thieves saw the two arrows. The arrow has fallen off the cold ground before leaving his shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelante glanced at Kremar before casting the spell, the black-haired caster looks dignified, with a bit of contempt and arrogance, his hands Putting it in the sleeves, not even chanting a spell, this made the Druid also suspend the action as a druid who had wandered the outside world for hundreds of years. Of course he knew that the action before this gray robe was the most complete one. Evil and poisonous rituals, if this ritual is successful, they will find a small life in this huge and complicated martyrdom, or more distant places, or they will face a lich one after seven days. The lich, which can be said to be the king of undead, is a completely different concept from a gray robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be people who think that this young mage just ended the battle early because of the shallow experience or negligence, but Perant learned from Kerry Ben, Although Rimal can only say that he has just grown up (in human standards), he has a half-round, that is, six years of time, following his mentor, Beavis, chasing a lich with madness. The way they spent, they even entered the seventy-seven islands that the stalkers were afraid of, which led to the lack of common sense, but had a deep understanding of the lich and his undead. He I am willing to believe in my own children. In returning 10,000 steps, the Druid also believes that he is not the first time he meets a lich. More correctly, in the long wandering years, there are no less than three. The lich died completely under his bow and arrow, along with their fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is your foot?" the lich lowered his head and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not very good." Kerry Ben said that the little devil's claws are highly toxic, and the negative energy hovering in the entire room is like Like the vultures attracted by the fat meat, he rushed to the elves' wounds. He cut his boots and drank the healing potions, but the wounds continued to flow out of the black blood, and they continued to fester and expand. Like his time at Fort Rebecca. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be patient." The Lich said: "This room cannot be healed until the end of the ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," Leona stared at the unspeakable, cold and dark air mass that said there was fluorite lighting in the room, but the strange thing was that it glowed brighter than the clouds covered by clouds. To be weak, the king knows that it is a bit stupid to describe an invisible air mass in black, but she can't find other more suitable adjectives. The gray robe is looming in the air, and her feet are off the ground. He seems to be dead and like It’s not dead, it’s like being swallowed, but it’s like being filled. The strange scene may be mourning the wasteland. Leona may not be able to forget: “Do we just look at it... look...”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The birth of a lich, maybe not," said the Lich. "But it’s pretty unusual anyway, take a look, when you drink in the pub later. When people chat, they can be used as an appetizer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;There is almost a woman who laughs for this mean-spirited statement: "Can we not do something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need," said the Lich "Do you think that a gray robes made of gnome-made synthetic spices to smudge mummies can really succeed in this... ritual?" And he used the idiots of the elves' flesh and blood, not to mention unextracted Full of vital flesh and blood will only make the vortex of negative energy turbulent and skewed. There is still an elf here. Didn't he think that negative energy will be more attracted to this larger piece of sweet bait? The lich doesn’t think that he will be a lich or a disciple of gray robes. It’s very likely that this guy is just a victim of a malicious joke. There are many such guys in the seventy-seven islands. When we are bored, we will seduce and lure the living creatures with plausible things. When they are on the wrong path, they will slap their upper and lower jaw bones and teeth. Not to mention, he actually chose the arrow of the elf as the last blow to consume his own vitality. If there is a mentor around him who can make up for it in time, maybe he still has a little hope of saving, but now, I am sorry, no matter what he will become, it will never become a lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he may become a zombie, or he may become a half lich, no, not a half-devil lich, the most undead in the undead, a brain-dead undead, only the body, the mind is born again. As his first body smouldering, an ugly monster, like the corpse or other undead creatures he had driven, the greatest value could be a daring trophy but there is a great possibility that it is completely If you have prepared a mental container in advance, he may still be able to store his mind in a container after the failure of the soul-connected spell. Then he can still obtain eternal life, just as a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But do you think Lev will prepare a mental container? The gods are on, it is very expensive, only a little bit cheaper than life, poor Lev, after making his life, he is afraid that even a gold coin can not be obtained. The lich knows why he is so Crazy to attack them at this critical moment, the flesh of the elf can be a substitute for many casting materials, or as a sacrifice, and a deal with the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Leona and others have retired to the end of the room and sat down. The strong negative energy will not only make them cold, but also let them It became weak and painful. Fortunately, the duration of this ritual was not long. The negative energy extracted from the four undead creatures enclosed in the statue was completely integrated into the body, and his body was transformed. The gray-black ash fell into the room, without the lich reminding, everyone else pulled up the hood, covering the eyes and nose and mouth, and the fluorite light seemed to become normal, the temperature in the room was obvious. As the ground rises, the lich throws a tiny fireball at random, it sways in the air, but does not extinguish immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich lets Kerry to move to the knee of the statue, tear a reel, then chanting a spell, casting another spell, taking care of it Immediately after the situation has improved, the blood is no longer black, but auburn, then dark red, followed by bright vermilion, then the blood will no longer seep, the wound is also gathering, and finally only left A grayish scar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plants that Perant promoted flourished from the depths of the earth, exploring and growing around with enthusiasm. Nothing is stronger and more resistant than they are. The thick stems have penetrated into every gap and every ramp. The feedback is like a wave. The druid is swallowed up and many of them are swallowed by insects (actually a pudding monster). Some have been corroded by the acid in the trap or bitten by the black rat, but more have become the only occupier and owner of the place. The adventurers only had to wait in the sun for less than a morning, and the druid got a strange scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich who has returned to knowing the sea simply doesn't want to say anything more. He suspects that Lev, like some of the most embarrassing businessmen, hides his most precious treasure directly under the pillow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate is as empty as the Lich expected, but Perant will crush the life, because the life is inlaid with gems, and the material itself is It was the relationship between Mithril and Jingjin. He also deliberately found a mud and lost all the debris. Gülen could not help but feel sorry, but he also knew that this was not something he could take. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They left after they had done all this, and Lev’s brutal rule over the territory gave the adventurers a lot of help, and the castle was deserted, even When the burning flame illuminates half of the night sky, no one carries a wooden barrel to fight the fire, let alone now. After a day of adventure, the adventurers managed to find a run-down village. There was not even a pastor. According to several serfs who had not starved to death, their lord’s wife thought that the pastor would only consume food unnecessarily. They forced them away, and the young people were called by the ladies to be servants, grooms, or knights. In short, they never returned after they left, nor did they go to the castle to find them, but even the people they were looking for. Did not come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have quietly escaped, leaving only some old people and young children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar and others rested in the village for one night, in order to thank the sweet potatoes brought by these adventurers (Pérant’s) The people gave them the best room, and the Druid promised to return the situation to them once they saw the priest or other lord's knight, which made them even more happy. "Maybe Dagong is willing to marry here..." An old man said, "He is the master of our master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The idiots in this world are still very few. Gülen groaned, and he got into the fur with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he feels cold (even if Perant and Kreima have dispelled the negative energy that lingers in their bodies, but now it’s deep winter, isn’t it? ?), and can not contain the Meimi, the priest of Froe is full and hot, sweet and sweet like honey, he misses her, and misses the days of lazily curling up in her fur with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey walks on the rugged rock, even if the mountain is windy, the rock is covered with heavy frost, she is still bare feet, like walking On the warm sea sand, her feet are white like shells, no blood and no dust. She is wrapped around the thin silk, pulled by the wind to the back, revealing the feminine curves of the female body and the flat belly. And a pair of slender legs like a doe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
