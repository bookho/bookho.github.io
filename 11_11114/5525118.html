			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Tower is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madness that spread only among a few people suddenly spread, and most people were sick when they were all over, and the consul was forced by his second son. When you wake up, things have been corrupted to the point where they are almost irreparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is the outer city where servants and civilians live, the inner city where wealthy businessmen and nobles gather, and even the bureaucrats of the consuls have people who have committed madness Their work is without warning, but suddenly they get angry. When they are having dinner, when they fall asleep, when they are walking... Their eyes become blood red, their mouths are spitting, and they can be used every time. Attacking someone else's things, waving and tapping, or directly using your fists and body to attack the first living thing they can see, they are even more terrible than the beasts who have lost their senses and acted in full accordance with their original **. How to say that the latter's attacks are always purposeful, and they are not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing they love is torture and killing - the son kills his father, the grandmother kills the grandson, and the close friend pierces the short sword into each other's abdomen, sweet The lover suddenly snapped the other's throat... Some women and young children were raped by their blood relatives or other trusted people before being killed - a servant who lost his hand when he resisted the owner of the madman He, after a moment of fear, the humble character decided to flee in a decisive manner. Before he fled, he took the owner's purse and accessories. In order to cover up his crimes, he also lit the owner's house; his actions Like an example, more people have joined the ranks of looting, and every time they leave a place, that place will be covered with blood and swallowed by flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling officer summoned his garrison captain, and the result was his second deputy. His first two bosses were already crazy, even the first The second deputy was also injured. From his eyes to his lips, there was a deep wound. It was so deep that he could see the white teeth and the squid-colored gums. He treated himself for himself, but the effect was not good, the blood was from his chin. Flow to the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain?" The Archon frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, they have been assassinated and died when I arrived" - the second deputy said that he talked as short as possible because the wound was very painful and leaked: "It's my wife." There was a bit of pain in his eyes: "And my daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor licked his lips, and the lines between the brows became deep and severe. He had seen a madman and knew what it was like. More likely, they were all dead: "Guard..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fifty-two," said the second deputy: "Being able to act, still sensible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You are now the captain of my garrison, let them take all the weapons," the consul said to the young man who had changed dramatically but remained calm and strong: "First clean up the inner city, one family, Collecting their escorts and servants from safers, giving them weapons, and then cleaning up the outer city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new garrison captain to the governing officer, Demon He stopped him and handed him two bottles of potion. "One bottle of refreshment, one bottle of treatment." He said: "You can treat your injuries first and then do things, so that you can be effective."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guard Captain glanced at the Archon, and the Archon swayed up and down invisibly His head, he took the medicine, gratefully bowed to de-Monts, in this chaotic and dangerous at night, a bottle of medicine treatment and refreshing how important it is simply beyond doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about your brother?" the consul asked when he stepped onto the inner wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He rushed to the sanctuary of Rosada."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He did very well Yes, we are in need of the help of Pastor Rosada," the consul officer said, and he glanced at his second son. The tone suddenly became harsh and harsh: "So what do you want to do now? Do you still have to Did I personally inform Antonio Master to ask him for help from Gray Ridge?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon’s face was a little bit unchanged: “But you have no bodyguards,” He said: "They are all crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you had passed the age of being indistinguishable from the importance of the matter," the consul said coldly: And your brother will come back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," Demon said: "As you wish."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos made a vicious and harsh laugh in the shadow cast by his master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't like you," he said sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is nothing new, it has been going on for almost twenty-four years," Demon said, he pressed his chest. I am glad that it has not felt as painful as every time in the past: "Every day, just face me - he hates me, I know," he whispered: "I may not be his son, my brother is, My brother is, but I am not, I am not his son, he is not my father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and looked up at the faint torch In the tall figure, he is the most like father of the three sons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't feel sad for you again, father." Demon said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos was left behind by Demon. His excuse was that the Antonio Master he was going to meet was a seasoned and experienced caster. Will detect that it is not right - one of your magic pets can be a viper, a cockroach, a beetle, but if it is a little devil - usually only a gray robe and a red robe will raise a little devil as a magic pet Therefore, according to Demon, it is best not to appear in front of Antonio Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil thinks this is a revenge. It doesn’t think that the old man’s mage can crack his invisibility, it will record it and expect to be able to return it to it one day. Temporary owner, but these do not prevent it from finding interesting things to make yourself happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It soon found a family destroyed by Demon’s poison – a small house with three rooms, the owner is a cobbler, at When the madness caused by holy water containing evil drugs was made, he swayed the round knife that cut the leather and separated his apprentice, that is, his son's chin and the part above his chin. His sister was cut off by his throat. And his wife, after flusteringly hiding her little daughter in the storage box of the bedroom, was drawn into a broken skin that could not be done with his belt. Fortunately, the brain of a mad person would become dull. Without going to check the box, he staggered out and then was killed by another person outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure the safety of the younger daughter, the mother even locked the outside of the box, which was dark and stuffy, only a little bit in the gap left by the top of the box. Air and light - she curled up and knew nothing about what was born outside. She just wanted to go to the bathroom, but her body was under her parents' clothes, which was meticulous, bright and bright, only Going to the sanctuary in Rosada to receive the holy water, or the silk clothes that will be worn at the wedding, she touched them, hoping to find a place for the cloth, but touched a group of furry things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cried, but most of her voice was locked in the box. Her father wrapped a thick cotton sheepskin on the inside to make the inside of the box not scratch the precious clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos waited patiently, waiting for her to finally stop, only slowly crawling on her knees, the little girl’s hands tight Tightly clasped, she thought it was a mouse, and later it was, oh, a mouse, but it was more beautiful and fat than the mouse she had seen before... The light that fell in the gap just shrouded it. It is only as big as her fist, black and shiny, like the sly skin she had seen in one of her father's robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t look as ferocious as other mice, it’s like talking to people, not screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must be locked in because of naughty tricks." Demon's magic pet said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I didn't," the little girl argued: "I am the mother's baby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Then your mother is not good." Asmodeos said maliciously: "It doesn't matter, she can't do it anymore, no matter what you don't want, because she is dead." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl was frightened, and she stared at the hairballs on her knees, her eyes full of confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what is dead?" Asmodeos said: "I just don't move, don't talk, can't play with you anymore." Baby, can't give you food and water, won't hug you - your father is dead, your father's sister is dead, and your brother is dead," said it. "It will smell, it will be black. The president will grow the bug." The little girl sobbed slightly, no, not enough, Asmodeos thought. He likes the seasonings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will die, but not so fast," the little devil waved the tail hidden in his body, which looked like a thicker one. Long hair, it is hollow, it contains venom, Asmodeos will determine the amount of venom injected according to his own mind, more is death, and less is paralysis: "I want to eat some fresh today. "It said, pulling the tail out of the girl's skin, slowly moving from the knee to the abdomen, climbing from the arm to the shoulder, and finally sitting down at the nose: "I will leave your eyes to the end, so you Can see how I eat your ears, nose, lips and fingers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pleasant to see that the eyes were finally full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill’s raised his sword and blocked an ogre The lower axe, then let it slide down the axe blade and push the axe to the side. At the same time, the short sword held by the other hand draws an arc through the gap of the ogre defense. In the middle of his ribs - the ogre made a violent roar and turned to face the opponent he didn't care much about. He was taller than Il, and his weight was Ilva. Twice, he was covered with a bulging scorpion - he did not hesitate to tighten his arm and caught the short sword that Ilva pierced his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female elf gave up her short sword, and the second enemy rushed over at this moment, and his body clearly showed the dirty blood of the orc, the body Not surprising, but the thighs are extraordinarily thick, the nails of the hands and feet are like curved claws, the cracks of the lips are extraordinarily large, the tongue is slender, with barbs, surrounded by small, dense teeth - shaking A heavy steel flail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I've already danced "swimming dance", one of the common martial arts used by the elves, the key is how to properly dance your two arms and try to Turn your body quickly, when you face more enemies than you - Kerry Ben and Ilva are the leaders of this dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rotates, jumps, twists her waist, rises and hangs her shoulders, her footsteps are lighter and more elusive than the wind in the mountains, although she only has one long The sword, but the weapons intersected, the crisp sound of the metal continued, the ogre and the half-orcs began to confuse, they only saw an enemy, but she was like six arms and twelve legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no third enemy to join, the victory will definitely belong to Ilva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a sly half-ogre, as thin as the half-orc (compared to his accomplices), he crept up and lifted His crossbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as he prepares to release his finger, a dazzling light shines into his eyes, and he screams and throws a crossbow, fainting and reflexive Rushed into the burning maple forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Il妲 hit the half-orc, an accurate and fierce sniper, opened the leather armor, rips from his shoulders to his chest, and Turning his body through the inertia for half a week, once again facing the ogre, in the previous battle, the elf is five feet long, the slightly curved sword has cut off the hand he has not held the axe, and in his The abdomen left a few wounds - she kicked a branch still with a dark red ember, let it burn the enemy's face, and when the ogre lifted the only arm to block, she waved the sword and took it Cut it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
