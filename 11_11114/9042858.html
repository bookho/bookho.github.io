			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you all a happy, full-bodied, well-being, and hopeful. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From today, my side island will be Beavis's disciple, his only heir to manage, he has the right to enact his own laws, enjoy any rights to the side island, buy and sell and kill his slaves, hire soldiers and craftsmen, he will have his power, It is like the obligation he will bear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruler of the East Crown, the master and father of his son, is so indifferent, with a mouth full of sweet scarlet The juice said the sentence and gave his side island to an outsider who had no blood relationship with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first thought that appears in the minds of all his sons, but even if their lords and fathers really become a madman, his soldiers are still loyal. For him, as well as those who cast the spell, the female warlock who has not touched the curly hair of the East Crown lord alone has already gotten hundreds of well-trained and well-equipped soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of his eight sons, such as the Master, generally guessed the attempt of their old father, but this is useless to quell the raging fire. It's like throwing a piece of fresh flesh and blood into a group of beasts that are hungry and willing to survive. Even if there is no shortage of wisdom among them, this may be a means of weakening and provoking, but what about it? The beast that grabbed the meat will be able to fill the stomach that it is about to digest, and he will become stronger and more agile, able to grab more food in the battle afterwards, he can live, but they It’s not so bad to die, but it’s not what they hate most. What they hate most is that they are not one of them, but one who knows nothing about the Longhuo Islands and the Longhuo Islands. The East Crown has no inheritance of the outsiders, it is like a person who is already very full, and then can get enough food, but they must take this critical meat from their teeth, if they can, they can now The haircaster who shreds his hair with his own teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" The owner of the East Crown did not feel the dark tide of the raging underneath: "My child," he said kindly. Are you willing to replace Beavis as the owner of the side island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the undead person stood up and gave the lord a slight glimpse: "I would like to express my gratitude and gratitude to me for replacing the 120,000 points. I think he will pray to all the gods to repay you. The glory that was given before and after."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is annoyance to the arrogant lord of the caster because he did not hear the caster willing to express his gratitude and commitment to himself. For him, but the same does not care. After all, he did not give the island to the person because of the real emotions. The young blackcaster has no foundation in the Dragon Fire Island, no friends, only enemies around. When the situation subsides, his return to the side island is as simple and easy as he gave the side island, and even his son will replace him to complete the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord took back his sight, and a person who had not lived for a long time did not need to win too much attention. He stood by his arms and embraced him. The eyes of the eunuch who looked at the master’s every move and then raised their hands and took a shot. The slaves who brought joy to them returned to the hall again, but this time they did not come to dance or sing. But they are bare-handed, fighting each other or saying that they are women, they are all beautiful and young, but the slaves of Longhuo Island are too many, even if their owners stay up all night, they can only take possession of the day. A very small part of it; a girl born of a slave, unless it has extraordinary charm, skill, or favored by the god of destiny, or has the blood of the lord, otherwise it will only become a consumable or breed. The "mud embryo" used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slave who served the lord was one of his daughters. She was honored to have a name after she came to the lord, called Jier, and Jier was wonderful. Inheriting a series of characteristics of the father, but synthesizing them into a special beauty, her hair is yellow like the lord, but the color is slightly lighter, and it is also tightly wound, fluffy and soft, so that each People who see it can't help but want to touch it; the lord has a pair of earthy eyes, which can be said to be a cosmetic disadvantage in both men and women, but her eyes are always shrouded. A layer of smoky water vapor makes them look like sapphire in the water. The light-colored lashes are dense and long, and they always hang down, like a timid deer or a horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rich creamy yellow hair against her light brown complexion, as well as her small and exquisite, bumpy body, these have become her for a while The only weapon that was invincible in a short period of time was the one that the lord bought from Captain Drake a few days ago. He had the same black long hair and green eyes as the new owner of the side island, but because Need to meet the relationship between an elf and a half-elf, she was killed by the lord without hesitation, Emerald's Eya never regards the half-elves as the same kind, but the elves of the silver-crowned jungle still hold a copy of their tribes. Pity, and the disciples of Beavis also have the general Eya blood, so in order to be cautious, it is best not to let them find that the lord still has such a precious collection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord's warlock also imprisoned her soul into a gem, burned her body into ash, condensed into the coral base, and sank into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man lying on her belly has closed his eyes and fell asleep. He is only 52 years old this year, but he has an extravagant enjoyment and a day after day. The day's thoughts are like a sharp blade that has gone to his energy and health. He is easy to fall asleep, and it is easy to wake up. Jier calms her breathing and heartbeat. Now she can't move (no matter how slight). Nor can the body become stiff because of tension. Sometimes the rulers of the East Crown just make a sudden nightmare, and they will order the eunuchs to pull out the slaves who are used as quilts and soft pillows. Fortunately, they are directly hanged. Unfortunately, he was tied to the hands and feet by the cowhide, and he was slowly dying in the sun because of the extreme **. The paradox was that he failed to get a short and sweet sleep because of the slave's dereliction of duty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her eyes are free, the deer-like eyelashes are the best cover, and she easily finds Dada among the eunuchs who come and go. In any case, he has exactly the same face as the owner he wants to serve. He stands behind the ninth, like a shadow of color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jier’s footsteps pass lightly through the dark shroud The people of Longhuo Island prefer white, red and gold. The walls of alabaster are covered with sandalwood retaining walls. The walls are painted with red cinnabar, and then various lines and portraits are painted with gold lines. The center of the flowers, the beast The stars of the human eye and the stars of the sky are inlaid with cut and polished gems, which flash under the faint light of the sky, guiding the beautiful young women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regular footsteps came, and Jier grabbed the raised gems on the wall and climbed up the dome of the promenade like a lizard. This is a special skill that belongs only to her and her brother. She and Dada’s mother are outsiders. Before being robbed to Longhuo Island, she was the daughter of a well-known juggling artist who followed her when she was very young. His father wandered around, giving wonderful performances to the powers of all parties, throwing oranges, turning his head, head and foot upside down, bending back and forth, manipulating birds, taming hungry wolves, nothing they would not and would not be good at, becoming the lord After the slave, she also gained favor with this for a period of time, and gave birth to three children. Although she was hanged by the eunuch when she was five or six years old, she still most The precious property was left to Ji Er. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind Jier’s body is a pair of eunuchs, the lord’s inner court does not allow men other than him to appear, and the last eunuch pauses for a moment. Then continue to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the children turned over the corner of the promenade, Jier gently fell. After that, there would be no more patrolling eunuchs. She slammed her toes and jumped into a courtyard that was not too strange. In a few years ago, she was still here with hundreds of half-sisters like a cocker-like bite. With the help of her brother, she got the attention of her grandfather, and the slaves around her master once again rotated. When cleaning, the eunuch sent her to the ruler of the East Crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She untied the spun yarn around her waist to wrap the curls and the parts below the eyes that are too obvious. This is the most common dress for a woman in the court. Anyone's attention, she just walked over the courtyard calmly, through the inner gallery, into a huge room, with a long ivory scented boat in the middle of the room, white smoke rising from the middle, a few In a graceful and tempting gesture, a woman is trapped in a mountain of cushions and soft pillows, indulging in a sweet and rich and strange atmosphere, and Jier does not catch her breath in a perceptible way. She didn't know what these were, but both her mother and her brother severely warned her to stay away from them. Fortunately, Jier now has a separate small room. She collects spices from the sergeant like everyone else, and then puts the clothes. Baked on it, he covered his mouth and nose with a cotton cloth soaked in ice water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She curled up into the thinnest corner of the smoke, waiting anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, she only waited for a short while, and the man came in from the door. There were other eunuchs around him. They came to serve these young people. Female, carrying a huge silver plate, the silver plate contains fresh fruit and warm honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada went to Jier’s side, squatted down and offered a glass of honey, and Jier found it was just a cup of clean ice water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Asia..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada puts his finger on his lips, but no one pays attention They, the eunuchs can only see Dada’s back and Ji’s ankles. Soon, other eunuchs left, an eunuch searched for Dada, but he found out what Dada was wiping, in this room, This kind of situation is unusual. They are not sweating or vomiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the eunuch, there are only women who are in numbness and madness, as well as Jill and Dada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amos." Jier hurriedly yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Dada." Dada said: "My main talent is Amos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that is what he grabbed from you," said Jier forcibly suppressing anger: "He took your identity, snatched your name, and took away the power that belongs to you." And the territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada shook his head. "Everything is a foregone conclusion," he said. "Don't change things that cannot be changed, Jier, we There is not much time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is your plan unchanged?" Jier asked: "Do you want to go back to him?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am his eunuch." Dada said, while looking at the face of Jier, on the one hand, because of deep thoughts, and on the other hand, No one knows who has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't go back," said Jier. "He has decided not to keep your life, just wait for you to go back, he will immediately cut your head. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ji'er closed his eyes, "大宦官The news of the servants sent you the wrong person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So I can't go to our eldest brother. Is it a deal or..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a transaction," said Jier. "He ridiculed...Amos, use you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada’s throat has a bitter bitterness. He knows that Amos will not keep himself for a long time. After satisfying his vanity and cruelty, he will kill himself to avoid trouble, but Dada has no The person who thinks that he has chosen will be stupid to this point, or, just because of contempt and unnecessaryness, an eunuch may not be heavier than a piece of dust in the heart of the lord's son. But he knows he has to make a decision as soon as possible but he doesn't think anyone can help him. He has lost the only value, and a request can always be exchanged for something. Even if it is a negligible eunuch, who will be He paid the price? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe someone else is here, they will ask Jier to go and beg their master and father, but Dada is very clear that this behavior will only be another A person drags into the endless abyss, although many people will do it under the pressure of death and torture, just to reduce the fear and pain that will come, but it will not be Dada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
