			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gredi's residence in Grenada has the largest dome and the largest number of vaults on the continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it can also be said to be a sanctuary, or a temple, where the most beloved maids of Greed are living, they are the priests of Gredi. Inheriting her blood, glamorous and cruel, their loyalty to Greed is impeccable, they are not afraid of pain, nor fear of death, because the two are honors and praises for them - No one knows the number of these maids, because they are changing all the time, some die before the same kind, some become sacrifices or sacrifices, and some are suspected that the faith is not pious enough to be easily dealt with - there are The four maid leaders who have the right to make this trial will not hesitate. If the children are devout enough, they will hear the call of Gredi on the mourning wasteland, then the harsh punishment is just ahead of them. Returning to the time around Gree, they should not have any complaints about this; if not, they are false believers, so they are naturally punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knicks are the oldest of the four maids, and her great-grandson is the red robe warlock Austal, who now controls the dragon thorns and their derivatives— - The thief union called "fine net" (the one that Kelsey once intervened but failed to succeed). She has spent six times as much life as an ordinary human, but because of her love, her face and body still look like a slender young girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked carefully at the huge throne that took up almost one-third of the hall, and the Threat of Greed was pieced together by a myriad of keels. Overall, the most is the Mori white fangs that roll inward like a tidal wave and the cranium like a rock. Although Greed never said it explicitly, everyone is guessing that these may be red dragons. Ruidi’s former spoils. Above the messy tongue, piled with gold coins and large gems, pearls hang on the ribs, the gaps are filled with secret silver and fine gold sand, and the surface of the spine depicts the magic lines and totems - there are also doubts Whether these criss-crossing nicks are left by a powerful lich, perhaps the soul of the defeated dragon is still in these broken bones, as long as Grydy makes a call, it will re-grow the scales. With flesh and blood, he fights for her in front of the red dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very likely, Grenada has an alliance with the Seventy-seven Islands, and the Lich is not covered by the red smog in this year-round. Rarely, it is often recruited by the army of Grenada, and the priests of Grydy are honored to receive a half-god lich... Although the impression he left for the Knicks is not at all difficult to describe... ... For some time, the Knicks even thought that their beliefs were shaking, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in view of his acceptance of the invitation of Grydy - the Knicks cursed their own ideas , while quickly annihilating that terrible idea. She took the scarlet velvet from the waitress behind her. The velvet color is so bright and pure, exuding the rich sulphur and myrrh--the fabric that only the pure child's blood can be dyed. It will fade due to moisture, sunlight and dust. About 30 pounds of velvet is covered by the Knicks on the keel throne. In the fire and smoke, they look like blood flowing from the keel. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A footstep sounded behind the maid, the Knicks turned and the Dragons of Grenada used to embed on their boots. Precious metals - gold, fine gold or secret silver, so when they hit the stone, their footsteps will become extraordinarily disturbing, but if necessary, they will also be like spiders walking in spiders Silent and silent on the silk - in this solemn hall, only one person dares and can do this. The Knicks bowed to him: "Your Majesty," she said. "I didn't expect you to be the first to arrive here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Because today is very important to me.” Grenada’s “New King” said that he was dressed in a grand costume, wearing a long sword and a dagger, and holding a fine gold staff in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ensuing is his eldest son, Mitt, who is different from other dragon-like styles, wearing Mithril as if walking in the army. The whole body chain, even the back of the hand and the ankle are covered, the chain on the chest is adorned with red dragon scales, the scales are from a young red dragon, the red color is bright and bright, maybe... The third or fourth child of the Red Dragon's children, which fell during the war in the expansion of Grenada, greeted him, but did not waste the good materials that were rare. - The new king turned his head, lest he smiled with sarcasm. He immediately saw Kelmen and Kelsey. They were also his children, but the two sides never concealed their dislike and hatred towards each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
