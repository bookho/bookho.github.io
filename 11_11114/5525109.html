			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pig Intestines" walked alone on the way home, with a squeaky copper coin in his pocket, licking his mouth, reminiscing about the generous home His glass of ale - he is not like other porters, he is eager to put into the casks of the pub or the chest of his own when he gets the money. He has a wife, a daughter, and a few months in his wife. Pregnancy (how long they can't figure out), for the three of them, he stubbornly resisted all the temptations from the outside world - how many times did he swallow his mouth through the pub door? Before he had a wife, he was a frequent visitor. He had a cool ale and drank the blood wine that the crew loved. Even the expensive honey was used to reward him. He also knew that. The fried pork intestines of the pub are the best to eat. He likes to eat the most. He likes it since he was a child, so people have forgotten his name and changed his name to "pigs". He also thinks this name is better than his original. The name is nice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat and nourishment, oily and bright, biting a mouthful of mouth is the smell of the scent, the fragrance is very good. Although it is only a cheap whale black fried, but a plate can be worth a basket of thick bread, since the birth of the little daughter - a cute little mouth, to eat, to drink - he I have never enjoyed this bite again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wife of "Pig Intestines" cooked wheat porridge, coarse bread, salted fish and shrimps, and then put them on to prevent being ignited by the stove. The blackened long skirt, surrounded by the black shabby shawl, also combed the hair with her fingers. When she was young, she could be said to be beautiful, but unfortunately, her former husband was drunk. The goblin took out the internal organs, and her son kept diarrhea because she drank unclean water, and then she was so thirsty. At that time, she was already in her thirties, her teeth were loose, her skin was slack, and there was no property. The body is not so good, no one wants to marry such a wife---------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people say that "pig intestine" is a fool, he can't count the number of more than twelve, but it doesn't matter, then the capable porters can't earn one every day. He used less than twelve figures for copper coins above the wheel. Moreover, she felt that the "pig intestines" was no better than that. He didn't like **. After living with her, he didn't drink much. The best thing is that he never beats his wife, maybe because he is stupid. I have to understand how to play a wife and determine his authority in the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, can I have some bread?" Her daughter asked, holding the door frame, and she remembered that her mother's clothes could not be caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, that's your father's." The wife of "Pig Intestines" said, "Would you like the bay leaf? Dear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little girl is used to With such disappointment, she bit her finger and took a small leaf that her mother tore with her nails to put it into her mouth. This bay leaf was taken from the sanctuary of Rosafa, where the laurel tree was deeply received by God. Well, the leaves will never be exhausted and dying - the civilians will use the opportunity to drink holy water to sift on a few leaves and sell them to the tour traders. The dried bay leaf is a rich smell of spice, which is used to hide the smell of spoiled meat. The taste is right, but the priests of Rosada know it well, but no one has been stopped or threatened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbors of the "pig intestines" will not do this because children who can only eat and drink but not work are not eligible for any bread and wine. Something, they maliciously called the wife of "Pig Intestines" as their wife, to laugh at her pet's love for her daughter - she knows, but she is still doing her own thing, her daughter is very beautiful, even more beautiful than when she was a child, she has fantasized about this small The guy may be able to become a real "lady" in the future. Who knows, it is said that the lord of somewhere once married a farm girl seen in his carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom..." the little girl cried, but her father had returned, and the woman put all her attention on her husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pig intestines" did not hurry to eat, the ale was just unexpectedly fierce, his chest was hot, his head was a little dizzy, he took out the copper coins from his pocket On the table, count carefully, "Ten." He said happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirteen." His wife said with amazement: "Have you done a lot of work today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten." "Pig intestine" emphasizes that his wife shrugged and did not argue with him. She put away twelve copper coins and put a copper coin back into the pocket of the "pig intestine" in preparation for Needs from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten!" "Pig intestines" said to her daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the little girl and put it on his lap, the little girl smiled because she knew that her dad would soon "carelessly" I lost a lot of bread crumbs and the bread crumbs that fell on the table. She could eat it without licking her mother's cockroaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pig intestines" first drank wheat porridge, wheat porridge with a burnt taste, it is normal, they can not afford iron pan, and the pottery pot is always very It was easy to stick to the bottom; he ate salted fish again, and the thorn in the salted fish stabbed his throat. The white eyes made him involuntarily think of something floating on the water; the shrimp was mixed with sand, and It’s too salty, these are normal, but he is irritated without cause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was absent-mindedly eating bread. The thick bread was mixed with the small stones falling off the plate. There was a very large piece of tooth decay that broke his teeth. The pain and blood filled the mouth. He spit all the things out. The dark bread crumbs were covered with white saliva and a little blood. His daughter thought it was for her, and immediately reached out and grabbed it and put it in her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pig intestine" made an angry scream, he did not know if he was worried that his daughter was stoned off his teeth or was taken away from food, he only knew himself I am about to reach the apex - anger, sadness, dissatisfaction. He heard his wife screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed at her blankly, dropped the little girl who was almost torn in half by him, rushed to his wife, and twitched her, She bounced on her stomach and sang a song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A laundry woman with an empty basket passed through the tragedy, and she slammed her mouth openly, calling the guard or Luo Pastor of Sada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take a record," after a masked camouflage The black robe mage said that the green flame jewel on the collar is like a cat blinking in the dark: "We have to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell on the barrier is in them It didn't take long after the departure, and a Rosah's white robe looked at it with a puzzled look. It looked like a broken banner. It might have been used in the merchant ship or caravan of the White Tower. They like to embroider. The silk of the sacred emblem is used to mark, and the silk is not gold or silver, but now it is not qualified for making a piece of cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the guards and white robes were busy in uniforming the "pig intestines" and saving the poor pregnant woman, the initiator had already taken his subordinates away from the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They returned to the inner city, dressed neatly, with a beautiful face and a calm look, and could not see what terrible evils had just been done - among them A “bone intestine” and other workers were hired with a strange face and generous salary, and poured into the ale of the drink – those who had turned the rabbits of the hills into bloodthirsty monsters. The "pig intestine" has extraordinarily more weight. He is the first to attack, and others will delay one or two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fantastic, Master Demon," the mage who had taken back his face whispered, though he was not worried about someone hearing what they were saying. The spell that blocks the spread of sound still plays a role: "Your work - it's so wonderful, it's wonderful, howling, the endless abyss is on, listen to those few shouts -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
