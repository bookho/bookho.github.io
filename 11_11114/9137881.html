If there is a gray robe that draws out his soul and makes a soul gem, you can definitely taste the deep bitter taste, and the teachers who were exiled together The suffering and the tragic death made him more difficult to let go. Sometimes, he woke up in his sleep, and the tears flowed more than Badwin’s envy that he could get Rosada’s forgiveness in such a short time, but It will only make Yadel more painful. If he still does not believe in Rosada, he may question whether his god made a mistake in his affairs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that his temperament is not as good as people’s. After leaving Baita, he is full of hatred for himself, not even himself. How can people who cherish it go to open their arms and embrace the light? In the face of those humble mortals, sad slaves and refugees who have no place to return, his innermost feelings have never produced mercy and compassion. In a sense, it is a condescending emotion. Rich people have mercy on poor people, healthy people have compassion for sick people, noble people have compassion for low-lying people, but can he, a true sinner, really stand in such a lofty position? They haven’t killed their brothers, they haven’t touched their mentor, and they haven’t let a city fall into epidemics and riots, let alone the gods they serve are smashed and despised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel doesn’t need anything, power, reputation, love and respect, he doesn’t want it, these are the kimono for others, but for him It is a whip that always whipes the conscience. He only needs to constantly, constantly, and constantly work hard, not for anyone, nor for the gods, just to make himself no longer subject to long and sharp tortures. He is such a selfish. PersonSo as soon as he heard about Krimaar, he almost agreed to the request of the Elf Ranger Kerry Ben, although this request would make many people hesitate. After all, Grenada is a well-known, cruel and cruel. The country that the ruthless red dragon ruled, Master Alva once said ridiculously, every Grinada, even if he is still a baby, he is probably not innocent because he is in the belly of his mother. I tasted the flesh and blood of others.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially he will see, and the person who is helping is also a member of the royal family of Grenada, the youngest son of King Grenada, maybe that black hair The caster deceived everyone, and Yadel thought that if it was, then he might look for opportunities to let his former companions and comrades die silently, he might not, even if it did, Rosada The priest is only dead or worse, but he can see that Kerry is still hopeful that he does not want this hope to become a dagger in the back of the elf.Fortunately, the worst plan he has made has not become a reality, but the existing situation has become more difficult because they are simply in the mud. They must also ensure that their feet are clean and their strength is too weak. Yadel thinks more than once after coming here, but really, he doesn’t really want such help, although for the Greinada people. In fact, the powerful succubus and gray robes are almost the treasures that everyone dreams of.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe for them...the two are indeed extraordinary...the guests, especially in the red dragon’s daughter, Kelsey, invaded the palace, almost When Yadel, together with the beastly slaves who were included in the wing by the black-haired dragons, was wiped out by a warlock, the warlock was clearly dead in the hands of the succubus, and the other, although Yadel, let the poor and weak children believe, They killed a warlock, or a weak warlock, but he also vaguely felt an indelible sense of violation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the gray robes from Kyle Ribbon are obviously biased towards them. Yadel can't find a reason, but under the threat of life, these It can only be said that it is a trivial little thing, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what he didn’t think was that the gray robe was uninvited again the next day, and greeted him. It’s not someone else who is called the female succubus of Ferry Hill... Although it belongs to Crimal, it is said from the bottom of the heart that even if the black-haired dragon is present, he may not be able to Defend your sovereignty<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One side by side with evil, and the other can make the evil bend back, Yadel does not feel that a Rosada priest can simultaneously Rejected, not to mention the succubus Ferrer Hill is summoned by Kremar and used as a card for this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what makes Yadel’s peace of mind and disappointment is that the two incarnations of the bottomless abyss are so happily occupying the palace of the black-haired dragon And the courtyard, after he had been busy all day, when he returned to the palace, he saw that this succubus and gray robes lay comfortably on the soft fur, looking up at the night sky covered by fog, maybe it made The succubus remembers the sky of the endless abyss, the sky of the endless abyss has never appeared clear blue or the galaxy, but this posture is too humanized two non-human (not with a Rosa Dad’s pastor said that the gray robe is also a human.) When he made a gesture that belongs to human beings, he will only let the sub-Dale, who knows the nature of the two, shudder.dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Yatel of Baita is still strange to this kind of thing, the pastor of Rosada who has been displaced from the past years has been able to identify these things with little effort, even if he is uncertain at the moment, he can Seeing that they are taken away by the claws and tentacles that are twisted like shadows, they are sure that they are the fragments of the soul gems. The complete soul gems can be used as currency and food for trading with demons, demons and other evil forces. But there are also some indulgences of gray robes that will crush them and throw them in the dark, just like a fisherman’s nest before fishing, gray robes, or other casters, who need to find or capture ghosts and This is also the case when the weak abyss creatures do, but there is no doubt that this is much more luxurious than throwing some dip in the wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Yadel approached them, the servant leader had retired from the gray robes, but her fingers were already gripped and seemed to have been rewarded or It was a bait, and when the priest of Rosada wanted to pretend that he had not seen it, he was caught by an invisible finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a visitor," Gray said, his slender eyes tilting down slightly and then rising with an unbridled smile: " A very important guest, I think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know who he is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "A person who is not so strange." Gray robe said with a finger on his cheek. "He may bring you some surprising suggestions, but you should know me and Ferrik." Hill is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for Yadel, this person is strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you have heard my name," said the tall warlock in red robe, "I am Ostall."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel tried to crush his own surprise and fear. He certainly heard the name, the dragon claw, the dragon head and the dragon thorn leader, although the dragon thorn The name of the leader of the legion is rarely known to outsiders, but his companion is Kremar. This semi-open secret certainly does not hide from Yadel: "It’s a great honor," he bowed. "My The owner once mentioned your name, you, you are a powerful and wise warlock, and like him, he works for the respectable Grein..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Austal smiled, he did not think that this awkward pastor would forget the black hand that manipulated Demon: "I thought that His Highness Kremar is not your master, Yadel, he should be your companion. Or a friend."dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no companion or friend in Grenada, lord Yadel said carefully: "I am looking for a master who can give me glory and power, not a mortal who is unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We His Royal Highness is certainly not a mortal," said Austal. "He should have been above most people, including the Dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalal remained silent . Then he saw that Aostall opened a reel and tore it, and the magic sprang from the missing lines, disappearing in the air. "A spell that guarantees that our next conversation will not be recorded and eavesdropped, very reliable." Red robe said, then he went to a chair in the room and sat down, making a gesture, like the owner of the room. Invite Yadel to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale is of course good at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should already know," after Yadel cautiously fell silent again, Austal said: "The lady who tried to destroy you completely is not someone else." It is you...the master, if you insist, the sister of His Royal Highness, although she never admits, they do have a blood relationship between them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is really amazing." Yadel said perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very common in Grenada, because children need to compete for resources from their parents, every brother and sister is an enemy, they may become allies, then It is also when the threat from the outside is greater than the inside." Austal said: "Now, His Highness Kreima is unfortunately a threat to the outside world and the inside." Ostal crossed his fingers: "Kelmen and Kelsey is an egg in the nest, and they... never mind becoming lovers of each other, so for the time being, the relationship between them is closer than anyone else, and they still have a red dragon mother. She is the daughter of Grein, a dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
