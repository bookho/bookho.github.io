			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the girls slid like a deer in front of the sailor of the little bird, holding his wet skirt with his hands, revealing a pair of feet, not shy Staring at Crimall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quick," the sailors yelled: "Ker, throw some money into her skirt!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship doctor seized Kremar’s hand, “Don’t,” he said. “She will entangle you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailor They issued unacceptable drum noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are the daughters of tour operators and jugglers," said the ship doctor with Kreima walking away. "It’s better than a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to see the market more." The soul of the outside world said that this is true, he has been completely attracted to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vendors in the market built their tents with cowhide, a little whale skin, and Crimmar saw a half-length trader selling barrels with him. The neighbors disputed, he pointed to the ground, the dance of the dance, the lingua franca of the alien soul has been much better than a month ago, but like this with a strong accent is still a little difficult to understand, he pays attention to listen for a while, Understand that the venue on the square is based on the number of stones to calculate the rental price. Each stone is one foot square, one copper coin per day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbor of the vendor is making a ribbon, his ribbon is wet with honey, he has to clean and dry them, and the bamboo plaque with the ribbon crossed him. The stone hangs over the wooden barrel, and the water drops from the ribbon, with a dye that is not very reliable. As a result, the merchant's goods are dyed in ugly blue, which looks like mold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of quarrel was quickly led to the wine merchant, who broke his honey wine barrel, but fortunately the guards developed into mutual fights Before intervening, the honey merchant was ordered to buy the dyed wooden barrel. As compensation, the silk merchant bought a pot of honey (actually just the syrup mixed with cider, only a little honey added) . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creimal noticed that each of the three individuals each paid a copper coin to the guards. Perhaps this is a mediation fee? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailor took the sailor to the side of the halfling and examined his wooden barrel. In the dispute just now, the halfling’s loud voice, more than once mentioned how strong and tight his barrel was. How secure the hoops on the outside are, as well as shiny rivets, fragrant gum and wood. He swears to the sailors that if the barrels are used to store light wine, the light wine will become more mellow; if used to store apples and oranges, even if they are taken out after three months, they will keep the peel bright and rich in juice; Would you like to put some bacon cheese inside, you will find that the smell of wood will penetrate into it, just like adding the most expensive spices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worth mentioning that these wooden barrels are equipped with iron rings for fixing ropes, which are rare on wooden barrels used by civilians. These buckles, which are not cheap, are only needed on board ships. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only this halfling, the entire market, the smart people who trade for sailors account for the vast majority, although they seem to be with other places It doesn't make much difference, but just look at their products - thin, breathable linen sleeveless shirts, cowhide boots, loafers (with tacks), handles with handles, wooden cups, horns, sturdy and wide Belts, wide-brimmed hats, ribbons (said sailors firmly believe that these ribbons with a sacred emblem are tied to the head to resist disease), three-finger wide silver bracelets, pegs of various gemstones (stones), inlaid with them Pins, straps (used to tie the trousers and sleeves), ground into powdered herbs made of meatballs... they are almost all prepared for a voyager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bears, sea lions, monkeys danced under the command of a gnome impersonating a human child, colorful parrots screamed, and a group of people gathered The poet is eagerly awaiting the next chapter, so that they know how the beautiful beauty is torn into pieces by the ogres, but as the python is wrapped around the body, the almost naked dancers sway When the limbs walked out of the tent, their attention was drawn to the real ** and temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few shallow sea fish with dense white scales and cockroaches are selling "water purification medicine", Kremar went over and found that it was Dark green, slimy seaweed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This seaweed grows very quickly and must be cleaned regularly. Otherwise, it will be able to drink all the water in a wooden bucket and drink it in a day or two. More people are more likely to cause diarrhea," said the ship doctor. The fisher who disregarded the sale of the drug was glaring at him. "We used the secret silver ball that applied the magic of clean water," said the ship doctor. "It can be used repeatedly, that is, every voyage. Both need to re-apply magic and remove the filth from inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic water purification equipment, Kremar thinks of the sweet water that he drinks on the boat every day and the clean water in the morning and evening for a personal cleaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Food and water are not necessary for this body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——But I will still be thirsty and hungry, the soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- That is the illusion of old memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I want this, the soul of the outside world insists that we almost hollowed out the money bag of the Thieves Guild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We? The lich asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the soul also has color, then the other guest must be pink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-No, the Lich said, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those with Mithril and Magic can certainly not be bought at this market. The clock tower on the west side of the square rings three times, the sun is slanting, Some merchants who are about to clear their goods are beginning to take a leisurely pick-up, but more people still decide to stick to the last moment, maybe there will be such a hurrying buyer? The chief officer commissioned by the captain had bought all the things and agreed to send them to the dock. The sailors’ belts were full, and then they went to the steam bath. It was a good place to relax and have many pairs. A soft little hand is waiting to massage every tight muscle on your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only left the boat doctor and Crimmar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought they would invite me," said Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, they know that you are not the type that likes to meet people naked," the ship doctor said with a smile: "And it is hot and humid, There is something stinking. You might be more willing to go to the pharmacy with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar is of course willing, but in the eyes of the outside world, To say that it is a pharmacy, it is better to say that it is a spice shop - after the leaves of the bay leaves are ground into pieces, they can be used as a spice. In medicine, it can treat colds, headaches and bloating; the cured meat can be added with rosemary. Aroma, but it can also be refreshing, fennel is best for cooking fish soup, it is also a wonderful recipe for treating eye pain; there are garlic, pepper, hawthorn, basil... most of the spices (medicine) are Dried and stored in wax-sealed clay pots, some of which are expensive and prone to deterioration, such as myrrh and agarwood, are carefully wrapped in wax paper and hidden in the emblem of Ilmot (a drop of gray tears) In the silver box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
