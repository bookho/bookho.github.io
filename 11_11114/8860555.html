			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author has something to say - very important, don't skip, new book friends especially -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is the late Sanjiang testimony - thanks to the old and new friends who have always supported me, the editors of Sanjiang, my editors and rappers, my readers - if you don't have your support, Jiuyu is absolutely impossible to go all the way here. And got so much praise and help. Yan()kuai<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the signing authors who have become the starting point have been in the past ten years, every time they receive a notification of all kinds of recommended text messages, they will still be excited and happy. But I am also deeply apologetic, because my work is busy and tired, and because of the more attention to detail, my writing speed is not so ideal, I would like to ask you to forgive me - every chapter I wrote Every section, every word is my child, my work, I don't want it to be so unadorned, unprepared to be pushed to the starting point of the publishing platform - I hope it can be true, can Beautiful, can bring joy and happiness to those who watch them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because of the recent recommendation for more frequent relationships, some new friends are also coming to see my text - I have to say, welcome! Also welcome your corrections and comments! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because Jiuyu’s style of writing has a much different relationship with other texts of the starting point, I recently saw a book review that repeatedly asked questions, so here is simply A unified reply: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the article has a total of eight volumes, and so far, just the first volume, a little spoiler, the first volume is only the characters and background, Embed the foreshadowing and open a corner of this beautiful world, so don't be too anxious to see the end of this person or that person or make a final conclusion on someone, but believe me, at least in the Holy One, Good and evil are reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, my habit is that all characters are gray, more correctly, they have their own ideas, their beliefs, their needs, they are not Perfect, they will be impulsive, they will be smart, they will make irreparable stupid things - don't overestimate them, they are not great, sometimes their minds are still very simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the world I set is a high-magic plane--there is no omnipotent god here, nor can God of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the gods is limited - for example, Rosada can know anything about an hour before and after each sunrise, because that moment is the strongest time for him, so the red robe and his accomplices have chosen without exception. Acting at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god is strong and weak, and whether human beings respect him/her is also related to his/her priesthood, and Fro is despised because she The clerics now in control are only yankuai and very weak – so, as the lich says, her priest can save some herbal money at the most – but there is a reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beliefs of humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, and orcs are basically voluntary—although there are gods of their own races other than human races. But they are also free to believe in other gods, but if their god of race or once believed in a god who favors evil, and he believes in the god that is opposite to the original god, then he will Was expelled or chased by the priest of the original god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the two gods are the good gods, they can still compromise each other, give a chestnut, and Kerry is to believe in the life of the elves at the same time. The god Angris and the goddess of the moon, Su Lun, but if he becomes one of the voters, he must make a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some readers are questioning Rosada so swallowing up? ... um, sorry, this, I can't give you all the content that is connected with several volumes in the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, there are settings about the elves and subsequent races - which, I will simply say the elves - are they smart? clever. Are they strong? Strong. Are they kind, pro, that is absolute, so they always start with good people, that is, when they face someone, they will not preempt him on the side of sin - so they Will accept the self-respecting, ability to always keep in mind, Kreima, and Fenway's father has almost led to the destruction of the gray ridge and regarded him as a sinner's son to beware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five, finally, if you can, can you please the readers to read the text carefully? I, I, my... my description, my details, my foreshadowing--(tears), please don’t just go through it all the time. Many adults’ doubts are like this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
