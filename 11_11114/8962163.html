He will press two new branches of the smashing fire on the charcoal fire. Suppressed into a dying state, stimulating the light of the eyes that are more suitable for survival in the dark, and disappeared. The moths and other worms that had been around the flames turned around and fled in confusion after losing the target of chasing. A few of them almost hit the thief's face, and the thief's fingertips caught them easily - these worms brought a little bit of fun to his bored vigil, thieves like a poor child. They tore off their wings and then pushed them to the dark but still hot charcoal pile with their toes. The moths screamed by humans, and the temperature of the charcoal remnants kept them alive. Blanch, emitting a more attractive than the fish and mushroom aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German cast his eyes on the village after burning all the moths, and the creek gathered in a low-lying depression into a small lake, and then from The lake stretched out and continued to move forward. The village was less than three miles from the small lake. The thieves estimated why they didn't rely on the village and the lake closer, not just for water. The fish in the lake is the property of the lord of the land, but it is limited to some precious fish like squid. If you just sneak into the lake and take away one or two small fish by the night, the more lenient lord is It won't be a big deal with a civilian – perhaps because the small lake is also adjacent to the woods, a brown bear with a bear in the woods, and other beasts they have never seen before, they are likely to go to the lake to drink Water, in order not to let even the hungry beasts rise to the thoughts of the nightingale after drinking the water, the distance should be a more sensible idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the village will not continue to work in the dark, even the inferior black oil is a great asset to the civilians in this place. The public opinion candle; and there are no roads trimmed around the village, which means that businessmen rarely come here. Of course, no one will sell them, and they won’t buy their women’s spinning lines and embroidery jobs – these are common in villages and cities with more than 200 people, so the nights in those places are often There are one or two houses with lights on, and the women work there all night. And the young men will join them with food and wine. They are half-truthful and flirtatious, playful and playful... At that time, Ge Lan was not as tall as the doorknob, and his fingers could not hold the door opener. Even an apprentice can't be called. What the guild wants him to do is simple—mixed in the children's group, with his head down to the woman's skirt—it's very warm—to listen to their conversations and count the number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the guild is to check whether the village has deliberately misrepresented their income in order to reduce the "taxes" they have to hand over to the guild; sometimes it is because the guild leader has been impatient with their deception, so they want to erect a bloody The symbol is that no one else is lucky; but more is for looting. After the cubs like Gülen give them enough information, the thieves will sneak into the village one night, killing men and stealing them. Their money and women, sometimes children. The demand for children in the red robe has always been great - the child who was squeezed in a room with Gülen, if not caught, not beaten to death or sent to the gallows, but because it is too stupid or It's too smart - they don't end up with tasks or want to ask for help or escape, they will be given to the red robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little boy and Gülen sharing a blanket that was only as wide as the elbow. The thief still remembers that he had hair like gold, though dirty. It became tangled and gray, full of scorpions and fleas, but it was still beautiful after he had scrubbed with snow - Gülen guessed that he might have been abducted or swept away as a warning. The thieves' guild often uses this to punish those who dare to confront them because he can read and write. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem lies in reading and writing. He uses sharp stones to write on the leaves that fall in from the iron bars of the window, and then put those leaves out of hope. Can be seen by people. At first, the children didn't understand what he was doing. He only knew that after he had done these things, he would become very happy and hopeful. A big child secretly told the matter before Gülen made the decision. The thief took the one. Boys, a few days later they were led into a beautifully decorated room with the boy's head on a table. Only his head, his hair was shaved, and it was hollowed out, but after their leader poured whale oil into it, broke into a wick and ignited it, the face that was scrubbed and thus looked extraordinarily beautiful Screaming and crying in pain - not the tears in the eyes but the whale oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, no child has dared to try to escape and ask for help. The older child stupidly declared in public that he will be taken away by a thief and he will become an apprentice. And will become a full member of the guild in the near future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan and he waited for him to fall asleep, and the pointed stone that the boy wrote to smashed his head - the part before the end of the eye and the hair, He didn't know what it was, but he once saw a thief show off his dagger in a position of a strong man. The man fell down and died. The person who killed him said that it is the whole skull. The weakest part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't the big boy who was taken away the next day. He didn't die, but he lost the ability to speak and act. The thief took Gülen away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German went to the boy after he became a full member, and the head was still "alive", and he would cry wildly as soon as he lit the wick. There will be fluctuations when I see Gülen - it recognizes Gülen, his soul is confined to this strange lampstand - his lips are creeping, like begging his former companion to end his pain. But Gülen just stepped back and then closed the door. The red robe's spell would not end easily with a dagger, and why should he do this, can he bring him even a drop of benefit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief sticks out his tongue and flexibly turns a corner in the air. The sweet peas are already open, but the air at night is still very cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also smelled the smell of cloves. It is said that when Lord Boldwin entered the kingdom, the purple, purple and white lilacs fell in the air. - He naturally remembered some of the gossip he had heard - the guards of the prison were almost unobtrusive in front of him, perhaps they thought that he could not hear them in the iron box, but the thieves could indeed hear And he is listening anytime, anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clove is the only daughter of Norman. It was the favorite flower of Princess Leona who almost became Norman’s new ruler. It was her who made this decision. The guards talked about Princess Leona’s concern about Baldwin, not that she was learning as a heir. The power available to control is blind worship. Birdwin is the owner of Thunder, the hero of the entire northern continent against the orcs and deeply loved by Tyre - many girls are willing to cheer for him - they are unclear, and the things that can be chewed are so little, after all, Birdwin returned to Wang Duo once a year to resign and reunite with his family, but the thief still thought he had a glimpse of something exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rescue of Kerry Ben and the caster is very timely. Timely is like a rehearsed comedy. Who told them? The thieves don’t feel that someone is willing to risk the anger of the new king only for the lowest level of civilians, but climbs to the despicable person on the king’s long table—and he grasps this when everyone is asleep The deadly news - whether or not Baldwin really killed Pharaoh, the new king will not be willing to let it go before he completely controls the overall situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the thief thought of this, he smiled involuntarily, more real than the previous smile, and more gloomy. He can only hear it by breathing. Only Bydwin and Mei Mi hiding behind him are really immersed in sleep, the caster is meditating, and the elf is just closing his eyes - the female's breathing is light and shallow. . Mixed with ambiguous low-pitched, her meat has grown, but this is not to say that she is not hurting. Birdwin will bite his teeth from time to time, making a crisp sound like a broken rock. The thief remembers that he is During the day, how to pull the triangular compound bow about one hundred pounds by the teeth, it is just a crocodile-like tooth, the same white and powerful - his slight tongue, if it really wants to be with Birdwin As an enemy, he can be taken care of by him. This huge greyhound only dared to be a beast of a heavily armed knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the arrow on the hand of Birdwin is also very fast. It is not like the cumbersome oysters in the imagination. Maybe he has practiced this, but who will practice the single-handed arrow? Known by thieves. The weapons used by the Paladin include the bow and arrow, but usually they specialize in hammers and wide swords. This may be related to his experience as a knight, a hunter? perhaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what he is, he needs to rest well in the next few days, and he has to have enough food and clean water. The caster's healing potion is very useful, and Gülen has tried it himself, but like the healing, what is needed for some major traumas is still time - the thieves pressed the chest and the ribs that have been re-engaged faintly hurt. He considered whether he should leave for a while, or wait until the elf came to replace the vigil. He could say that he wanted to take a shower or something - to find the suffocation of the mother bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief insists that he was previously sitting under the butt by the mother bear just because of the moment, and that he could not kill the animal he had just traded in front of an elf. Although the silver crown jungle's elf's recipe includes animals, who knows what they think? He doesn't feel that he can escape the night of Norman's new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to grab the bear and hang it on a branch. The mother bear can’t touch the place that he can’t climb. He can almost watch it. Get the fat bear that is covered in turpentine feces and scream around a tree, anxiously - just imagine it makes him happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this imagination is a bit too real, real – oh, the endless abyss is down, it’s really calling, full of anxiety and tension – the thief is straight The body exchanged a look with Kerry Ben across from him. "I am going to see?" he suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am with you," said the elf, and then he looked down at the caster who was escaping from meditation: "Kremar took care of Baldwin and Mei Mi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-eyed caster nodded and reached out. His little spider climbed out of his sleeve and fell on the fire. I slammed it up, and the hot wave of the wind rushed open the cold evening wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gura was rushing over him at the moment he stepped into the dark woods, without waiting for warnings, the thieves rolling sideways Dodging, and Kerry's arrow followed a sharp whistling spur to the sudden attacking enemy - almost immediately, Gülen heard a loud rat-like snoring, a round, furry thing descending from the sky Almost in his head, the thief escaped agilely and grabbed its back neck. The rather loose flesh, exudes his familiar smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
