			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Norman does not know that while she is giving this will, Leona and Birdwin have left the Dragonfire Islands to the Highlands. Norman marched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not originally in Leona’s plan. Her previous idea was to find the old man who made the Norman, her father died unfortunately. The dominance of the great conspiracy, thus clarifying the crimes of Birdwin, regaining his family name and inheritance rights, and then, together with Birdwin, as a ruler of the future and respect of the Norman people, openly and gloriously returned to the Highlands Man. But things have changed too fast. First of all, it is very ironic. Pharaoh’s plans for his life were not fulfilled. The fact that he added women to the list of heirs was actually dead, and the heir he hoped for left the king. After that, I got the support of most people, and then the threatened King of John was similarly madly squandering the money and power gathered by the first kings. In the eyes of the public, he dragged Norman into the abyss of destruction, and then, King John. He died humblely on a night, no one went to investigate the source of death. Obviously this ending made many people feel satisfied, just like when the pharaoh died. The king died, the king lived, according to the modified inheritance law, It is ridiculous that Mann’s first female heir was pushed to the throne. They are not willing to let Leona inherit the throne, but they must be more tolerant of Diane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because she has Dylan," Birdwin said: "And it is the only son she loves."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They received information from the side of the island, and Baldwin and Leona did not doubt the correctness because they were familiar with the manufacture of plant fibers. The paper and the writings of the sorcerer Kerry Ben, they asked the thieves of Gülen’s stay on the Dragon Fire Island, confirming that Dylan Donkley did not leave the king, and now the Thunder Castle was replaced by a greedy and short-sighted guy. Managed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin sits by the fire, and the light orange light illuminates his correct face. He once drastically lost on the way to escape, then On the Longhuo Island, because of enough food and undisturbed sleep, it became strong again, but in just ten days, the wrinkles that gathered in his eyes and eyebrows deepened, his The beard stretches out of the skin, forms a shovel shape under the lips, and then connects with the raised part of the lip. This new feature makes him look bigger and more majestic and awesome than the actual age. At least Leona didn't care about it at all. No matter what Baldwin looks like, she likes and accepts it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He shouldn't do this," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Li Oona asked, and she immediately thought of a person: "Dylan? Why not, it is Highland Norman."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a Don Cray."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be no," really, Leona has been very Strange why Baldwin always has a ridiculous sweet fantasy for his unrelated brother, even though Dylan Don Cray has never shown his love and respect for his elder brother (even if it is only formal), he hates and swears. Byrdwin, Leona thought, this is something that everyone can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Birdwin said: "Dylan may have hoped that he has never been my brother," he took a deep breath, Li Oona saw a glittering flash in his eyes, and her heart softened at once: "Morton Don Clay and I said," Baldwin said: "He knows that Dylan has a child to his father. The deepest desire, but he hates his wife, and this child, so although he knows that this is unfair to Dylan, he still can't accept him - even seeing him Morton will feel the heart being sword Throughout."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know that Dylan didn't inherit the blood of Morton Donkley," Liona said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't know." Bydwin said: "But now..." He was forced to flee the king of Norman and found himself in the past. Blindfolded around the name of the stone mill called Thunderbolt, the non-stop stupidity, when Dekrimar managed the side island, countless intelligence was handed over to his hands, like Dylan’s true identity. Of course, this important and not secretive thing is also in the list. He even knows Dylan’s father, and Fukai’s mother is likely to come from Grenada. After the two are linked, he can’t help but creep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you are still holding this..." Leona barely swallowed a bad adjective: "Holding expectations?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I know that Dylan always hopes that his father can be proud of him," Birdwin said. "Do you know? I once thought that if Dylan can really prove it He can be a credible and respectable lord. I don't mind returning to the kingdom, or returning to my village, and my wife..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"But you won't, right?" Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Liona said, "I won't, never will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The former owner of Thunderbolt extended her hand to her, and Leona walked over and sat down next to Baldwin. The man’s powerful arm hugged her shoulders wider than other women, they were like that. The fit is like casting for each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dylan wants to be the king of Norman." Liona whispered, she remembered her father, after confirming that she would not have another son. Lao Wang took her daughter's hand and let her sit on the black iron throne, with a fine gold crown and a scepter, telling Norman that she would belong to her one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of Norman can only be Leona, and it must be Leona." Birdwin said, and at this time, he is like The night-like thoughts suddenly flashed through a picture. It was like a luxurious silk carpet. Although time was so short, Birdwin did not effortlessly recognize that it was an illusion. In the waters of the Northern Land, they accepted the test of the dragons, and he never mentioned it to others because he thought it was ridiculous, it was impossible - he didn't feel this at all. It was the strongest craving in his heart, only as a dream of ridiculous and ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will only be you," he said. "It can only be you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ———<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the information that Dylan Donkley is about to add will also fall on the whistling plain like a bird, falling on Gersh’s arm. He listened and then crushed the eye with his teeth and tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a magical appliance," Rica said seriously: "If it is damaged, it will be compensated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Highland Norman's King Dudu is a magical appliance," Geshe said generously: "You can walk in and pick one at will." He squinted at the red robe: "Or you Mentor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think we don't have to think about this issue for the time being, sire," Rica said. "We are still whistling in the plains? Norman There is still a distance between the kings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not far away," said Gersh, as he walked over and opened the tent, the cold wind immediately from the outside. Infused with it - the most abundant pyroxene produced in the Wuthering Plain, as the king of the orcs (also the first one), of course, there is no shortage of these strange ores in the tent of Gersh, and his tent can be said to be warm as spring. This made Rica unhappy to roll his lips. He put his hands in his sleeves and followed Gersh out of the tent. The orc's ruler has the right to build the tent in the highest place. From here, you can see the beast's "penfold". A few days ago, the "Sheep" gave birth to the last batch of monsters, even those slaves. Without death, they lost their greatest use. The small monsters squatted on their bodies with warmth, swallowed the mother's flesh and blood, and grew at the speed visible to the naked eye. The orcs did not dare to approach them because they never Reject the food on the lips, anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should not make the last mistake again?" Gersh asked: "But I think that may not be a mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pharmaceuticals need to be tested and optimized," Rica said frankly: "At least this time your people will not have extra damage."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesh makes a sardonic laughter from his nose, he won’t worry about those stupid guys, but if he says that these monsters can be as thorough as the red robe described The earth destroys the lines and will of mankind, instead of letting the latter further wear the orc's knives that are not heavy enough—he certainly wants to see this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were watched by thousands of eyes as they walked through the "penfolds", those who might not be called small monsters swallowed With the wreckage of human beings, hunger and thirst with the red eyes of the devil to capture the traces of the fresh prey, if there is no magic to imprison and shock them, no matter what identity of Gersh and Rica, They will also take them over and eat them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you control these things?" Gersh said rudely: "What I think is a piece of meat in their eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
