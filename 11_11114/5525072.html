			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm swept over half of the Azores, and the lead-like clouds covered the sky, and the rain that it was engulfed was so cold and full, sharp Everyone in the port, every dog ​​and every mouse, trembles, gasps, tries to run at the fastest speed that can be achieved, and jumps into any roofed building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the blunt pub pulled down the brass latch to isolate the frenzied storm and other unwelcome things from the thick oak board, one of his The guest, Fro's priest was taking off the dripping wool cloak in front of the flame of the hearth jumping. The iron bed was set up on the hearth, and the white steam constantly emerged, emitting the scent of goose and nutmeg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sharing the goose and half a bottle of turbid blood red wine, the pub owner and his guests comfortably lie on the hearth of the front room, the hearth The flame heats the surrounding slate, the slate is covered with fresh hay, the soft arms surround his neck, his lips sink in the rich shoulders and the full chest - the person who dares to disturb this wonderful moment is a bit The sin is unforgivable, but the guy standing outside is obviously very stubborn. The owner of the pub screams in anger and oppressively, and he can helplessly get rid of the sweet noose. Before he climbs up to open the door, he does not forget to pick up his coat and throw it. To the priest of Fro, "cover yourself," he muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tawny spearfish fur coat is heavy, sucking greasy, heavy fishy smell, swearing tobacco, wine, and man-specific The goat's stinky, thick and wide, but short, only enough to cover the part of the priest's buttocks, Fro's priest crossed his arms under his coat and held his legs, folded his legs, and did not mind deeply sucking With a sigh of relief, listening quietly in the darkness of the coat, the person who came here was not a savage person who knew nothing about the port of Point, he knew how people here would knock a door that they didn't want to open and succeeded. The owner of the blunt pub still maintains a valuable silence after involuntarily opening the door, instead of cursing, driving, or a sharp dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no room," said the owner of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He usually advises the Stables and the Corridor. It seems that this uninvited guest is not a person who is at a loss or is too big to accept those two places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coins collide with each other, copper coins, silver coins or gold coins? Gold coins, only gold coins, can make dissatisfaction and malicious moments disappear, only these yellow cans are full of lovable friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you are willing to live with someone else, then there is still a room,” said the tavern owner. “But you will love her.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fo Luo’s pastor opened the coat, and she only had time to capture a small piece of white and transparent skin like sea ice floes; black hair wrapped in silver string, dark gray leather cloak, knee-length boots – The back of the person is elegant and slender, the pace is light, and the stairs are steep and narrow. Even a large cat walks through the creaking stairs without making a sound. The saddle brown travel cane and skin are raised. Hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub owner was also silently and quickly slid down the stairs he knew, and found that Fro’s pastor was looking thoughtfully at where they disappeared. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can try later to get a little gift that is more precious than a goose," the tavern said with tolerance: "But now - he In your room, you have to give me my reward first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's pastor made a clear answer with the stretched body . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pub owner and Fro’s pastor are eager to return to those hot and sticky shakes, the former new guests are carefully Exploring this tall and narrow room, the whole space looks like a chisel that stands up. The black wooden beams are not necessarily touched even if three men stand on their shoulders. The door is facing a simple one. The wooden windows and the gap between the wooden boards are filled with sharp cold wind and rain. The traces of the water flow down the gap and sneak into the white mud wall and the table. The table, more correctly, is a dark brown pine box. There is no ink and paper on the table. There is only a clay lamp holder and a drinking pot in the shape of a bad sea animal. The drinking pot is filled with deep red and small. Goose yellow sweet peas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Fro's pastor. The lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Sweet peas are the sacred objects of Fro. Only the priests of 娼妓 and Fro will offer the sweet peas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--So she may also be awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The difference between Fro's pastor and the priest is probably that the priest can still save some medical money. The lich commented faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights are stinky, and it is obviously cheap whale oil instead of expensive whale skull wax. A chair that is lacking in all respects is like a decoration only. The four legs are stubbornly of their own length, and the engraving on the backrest is half-faced. The thin slate floor is better than the scattered lavender on the ground. The bed is next to the two walls. There are no pillows and no blankets. The reeds and wicks are as thick as the knees, but it can be smelled without touching. How wet it is, the wool felt wrapped around them is as thin as dried seaweed, the color is rich and abnormal, and the cracks and gaps at the end of the bed are especially high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several round-shell bugs are rushing through the wounds of large and small, a cockroach with a human palm that is quietly chasing Behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new guest snorted subtly, and he did not expect to see another bio-documentary in the documentary channel in another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Don’t make a fuss about one or two bugs, the Lich says they won’t kill you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——There are at least 50 gold coins in the bag, and the souls of the opposite world protest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We all know that it is not the price of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Include this room-Do you think it is possible for him to change rooms for us? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——For a stranger, this is probably the best room in Point Harbor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Strange? I thought you chose this because you are familiar with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I am really familiar with this, the lich is impatient, and it is the weakest and most chaotic one in the transmission anchor that I am familiar with. Given our current state, this decision is very correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——...The last time you appeared in Jiangan Port was a few years ago? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--96 years - human life and memory are too short, fortunately, there are always things that have been preserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--In 1996, the soul of the opposite world repeated, trying to control itself not to sigh - well, what should we do next? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Wait, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub owner ended very quickly, but Fro’s pastor still showed A warm and not exaggerated satisfaction, the ingenious compliment allowed her to take a small bowl of hot water from the pot that had been stewed in the goose to wipe the body, and the spiced sheep oil for her to moisturize the skin and relax the muscles. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stepped up the stairs with a clean but cool body and a cetyl candle with only a knuckle length, squatting on the golden bell on the thin belt The sound rang through the dark corridor, and she tried to push the door and found that the door was not bolted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest walked into the room and saw her living in the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you sleep? Even if you just go to bed," she asked briskly. "Is that chair better than a bed?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up from the chair and walked into the light range of the candle, and the priest was alert to discover that this person was not as weak or ugly as she had imagined. Or, to say it is exactly the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you need a little wine," the priest raised the candle, letting more light illuminate his face, and the empty right hand took it out like a trick. A flat silver wine bottle, it's small like a toy, it's only about four or five mouths. "I have a little honey, a gift from a smuggling businessman, real honey, not the apples in the alley." The fakes mixed with wine and grape juice have not been mixed with water, and have not been added with sugar - the purest honey is brewed and the 40-year-old Chen Mijiu is hidden." She is sweetly tempted to make people suspicious. Does the wine have a taste of her tongue: "Come on," she urged. "A small mouth, as long as you have a small mouth, you can know what is the real human bliss."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She unscrewed the bottle cap with her thumb, and a rich honey aroma proved her utterance. But what frustrated her was that the tempted object was still indifferent. He just looked at her with a bit of exploration and curiosity in a disturbing way. Have you seen the first child who saw the butterfly? They will be attracted and tempted by it, and then they will grab it and tear its wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you don't like honey wine," she said, with the disappointment of making steel bends, but still as soft as it was. The breeze in the ear, "So," she stretched out a small finger, hooked the leather cord tied to the mouth, and the coral-colored silk slipped to the sides, revealing a soft chest with rounded protrusions, not at all Exaggeratedly, they are as beautiful as the dewdrops hanging on the tip of the leaves in the morning light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
