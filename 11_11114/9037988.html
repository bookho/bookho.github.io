			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ninth son of the East Crown owner stood on the tower and watched the adventurers go far away - said to be a tall tower, in fact it only has a tower on the mainland at most One third of it looks like a tall fortress rather than a tower. It is not that the lords are not willing to make them more beautiful. The problem is that the Dragon Fire Island is no matter how rich it is or an island, although it is located on the ridge of the island. The center of the ridge can avoid the direct impact of the tide, but the hurricane is inevitable, so the base of the tower is always nearly twice as large as the land tower, and it is reinforced with magic-producing plants, and before the pedestal is hit, Spread the bones of thousands of young and beautiful slaves. Www*xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This practice has been around for a long time, no one can tell that the master’s whim, anyway, whether you dig every dragon A building, you can find a lot of bones under the pedestal, like the lord or the lord's son's fortress and the palace, except for the bones and the grievances, they hired the gray robe, the Necromancer can ensure that these slaves are even dead They can also be ignorant and uselessly for their masters until "they" consume all the meager energy, turning into a vague shadow and smashing and dissipating in the vague cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think they have found out my little jokes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ninth son is full of enthusiasm Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person he asked was standing very straight, and his questioning was only slightly, and he was better than nowhere: "Of course, they There is a caster. If a caster doesn't even notice this detail, he should die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ninth son smiled at his lips Laugh, in fact, a thief also found out that his face is a little worse than others; but he did not say anything, why bother, the caster always prefers his own kind, this is all that can be with the caster The consensus reached by the people we contacted, don't look at the guys wearing white, black, red and grey robes. It can be said that the king is not seeing the king - but in their subconscious, even an apprentice is more worthy of respect than a mortal. And this caster is not his - only four lords on the Dragonfire Island can have a mage, a warlock or a priest, and the lord's son and other small lords can only hire them for a short time. And you need to ask the lord for permission, otherwise it will be considered rebellious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what if a lord’s son is a mage? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of his seventh brother, the ninth son of the lord could not help but reveal a trace of embarrassment. Beavis is the first caster to have the identity of the lord in the past hundreds of years. His talent was discovered early, so he didn't have to compete with others for his ranking. His brother and brother changed and didn't know how many. Only he always sits in the position of the seventh child and does not move. And their father always loves him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this kind of petting has changed slightly in the later period, perhaps because the casters are both dangerous and noble in the mortal relationship, although Beavis He has the identity of the seventh son, but even if he is an adult, he can not live on his own island like other lords, but he is left in the East Crown, his own palace, which can be said to be a glory. It can also be said to be surveillance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ninth son returns to the East Crown every year, and when he goes to the palace to see his father and his master, he often sees Beavis, and he and the East Crown lord are very Similar, but only on the outside. He is a weak and stupid person, rarely punishes slaves, and even does not want to "game" with them. Perhaps this is the source, so that no one feels after he escaped with a half-elf slave who took a new to the fire island. Strange, including the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ninth child must admit that Beavis is indeed a lucky guy, how much interest his caster has brought him - know The laws on the four major islands of Longhuo Island are made by their lords, and the details are different, but only a few about slavery are absolutely unchanged. For the people of Longhuo Island, these laws are like the fact that the sun always appears in the daylight and the stars always rise in the night. The most familiar one is that the slaves of the Dragon Fire Island are always the Dragon Fire Island. The slaves, they are not allowed to leave the islands, if they escape alone, the lords will hire and send soldiers and even the caster to catch them. Waiting for them is a long and horrible torture and insult; if someone helps them, even if they only see them or find their tracks without warning, then that person will become a slave like that, no matter who It is a civilian, a businessman or a son of a lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the lord who made this law, since someone is willing to sympathize with and help a slave, he can of course become a slave. Since he is willing to be so self-satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one who escaped this law was Beavis, and his slave wife, and the ninth son knew that their master and father had given this The son who should have been a slave sent a considerable amount of wealth. The seventh island that should have been delivered to him was not handed over to any of the lords, but was managed by the owner of the East Crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
