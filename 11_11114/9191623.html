			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snowy, the salt river that shines with crystal light is like a river of weeping. It runs through three levels. As the name implies, the salt river slowly flows with high purity. The salt crystallizes. If a creature falls, it takes only a few breaths to get the water out of the body. The rough surface will cover the crystal salt crystals. As the river moves slowly, it seems to stand on the river. This artwork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reminds the lich of the starlight rivers of the elves, they are equally bright and flashing, but the Starlight River breeds life, and the Salt River devours life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out from the devil's back, you can see the hustle and bustle of the city, the Zlata mentioned before, each with the existence of eyes I can see it, but it is not an easy task to enter it. The subordinates of the Wuhuan prince follow his will and set the entrance of the transmission on all levels. The most common is the burning of the corpse towards the sky. The black bush that stretched out, or the turquoise flame that jumped in the rock, when the lich was overlooking, he saw a traveler who was being chased by the demon. He daringly jumped into one of the flames, thinking it could He was brought into Zelata, but the flame suddenly rose, and he swallowed him all at once. The screams of the travelers caused the attention of their mounts. He laughed and was obviously very happy for their kings. If they can continue watching, they can see that after the green flame is extinguished, the gray-green shoots are taken from the ashes, the shoots are stretched, thriving, solidified into black bushes, in fresh blood. The formation of a new entrance - which can be regarded as a black, almost humorous, but very very cruel joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying demons began to dive, and in an instant they seemed to have thousands of feet of city suddenly pulled closer to their eyes. In a flash, they rushed in. Zelata, the gorgeous cobalt blue sun covering these outsiders, brings a gloomy chill, their mounts gliding in a deformed building, a gargoyle suddenly grows a few inches away from the lich. The mouth, screaming, maybe this is its usual method - if someone is really frightened and falls off the flying demons, then they can eat too much, but even with the heartbeat to describe it will be long, extremely In a short time, an invisible hand grabbed the gargoyle and dragged it down the sharp corner of the building. The gargoyle's body fell and shattered in an uncontrollable fall, and the flying devil under them There are pink ripples on the grayish body, and dozens of soft tentacles are also elated from the bottom of the skin, just like a little girl who covers the lich's wrist.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that some of us are very popular." The red robe warlock couldn't help but say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who once gave him a strange contempt, the demons also fell, he said to the cohabitation, it can be said that a little hungry - he is not Didn't understand that it is very unwise to show your hostility to a person who is favored by demons in the bottomless abyss? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next moment, the warlock, who was obviously too much mouth, fell down without warning, and the empty holes in the bottom squirmed countless white teeth, he was big Cried, the flame wraps him up, and there are other runes that are working. Anyway, after a few breaths, he is spit out. The cloak has been eroded by acid, revealing the robes below. Several of the gemstones above have become bleak. Obviously, although he was not eaten by the devil, he was also hurt and scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spit out of the empty hole spit a few black smoke and healed, as if it had never appeared. The red robe warrior held a reel in resentment and wanted to give the demon a lesson, but he looked up at Ferry Hill, and the succubus sat comfortably in front of him, gracefully on the seat surrounded by tentacles. Stroking my hair and being indifferent to what happened behind me. He took another look at the other two people, one of whom was his two ironic guys. He didn't quite understand. Isn't this a fallen pastor? In the bottomless abyss, a white robe can be really conspicuous. Is he innocent or innocent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock is not stupid enough to provoke a guy who can't see the details of the third time. He will look down on the third person. He is as lenient as the warlock. The cloak wrapped around the whole body, and the color of the robes could not be seen. The warlock suddenly annoyed his own smashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s really a dangerous guy. The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Can you feel it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Well, the soul of the alien world says that he is influencing us—perhaps a potion that will slowly evaporate, or a rune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unlucky gargoyle just met an unpleasant lich. He spent only one day on the counter-attack day. After being influenced by the third man's spell, he became extraordinarily violent, just because of his temper, because he knows the sea. There is also a relationship of the soul, you can get a reminder, but another candidate seems to have no such good luck, I hope he can find out early, the soul of the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He is also our enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Compared with a sly and veteran enemy, the soul of the opposite world does not hesitate to say that I will of course choose a less threatening one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Very good, the Lich said, very Grenada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe the red robe The warlock also found that his emotions were not right. He cast two spells on himself. Before the flying demon landed on a bright mirror door, he recovered his original appearance. He could not see that he was almost eaten by the devil. The wolverine looks like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Hall of Mirrors Image." Ferry Hill said, "Follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Hall of Mirrors is the vestibule of the Grazite Palace. Although it is a million mirrors, in fact no one knows how many mirrors there are, as well as the entrance, behind the mirror door, guarding two temptations. They have dark brown skin, black stripes and plaques, and thorns and sharp corners on the forehead and back, each with a height of fifteen feet or more, but in conflict with the appearance of the monks, they With a pair of gentle violet eyes, when they stare at someone, they can't help but believe in them - there are many people with weak consciousness who become the bait and currency of the temptation, but their favorite Or by promising rights and wealth, those who have a strong will will be led to the ultimate destruction. After all, the easily acquired soul is not good or too fragile. But when I saw a dragon looking at them intently, one of the temptations was still a bit curious. In any case, it would not be a weak person to be brought directly by Ferry Hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his sight seems to fall on... their arms, these pliers that can easily sever a giant may be strong, but when it comes to temptation, at least It's not like the succubus's ass, look at the other two, hey, they don't want to welcome Ferry Hill's embarrassment - because the face can't be said to be the best in the succubus, Felix Hill Always worried about his prey, the temptation does not want to die for this ridiculous reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the dragons quickly took their eyes back and they entered the hall of the Wanjing Image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the mirror, it is the mirror, at least in their view. Ferry Hill is just three steps away from them, but it seems to be just a turn, she disappears, and the moment the game falls, the red robe warlock and the lich turn back, a left turn It was also hidden in countless mirrors, and the third person sighed with regret, let go of his fingers, and revoked the spells that were ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road here is like endless, quiet everywhere. It is said that there should be a random arrival of Boda, but at least for the third person, his The distance is lonely and monotonous. The mirror is attached to the mirror, the mirror is looked up, the mirror is under the foot, and the image in the mirror is continuous. If a mortal comes, he will go crazy in a while, and the third person only thinks Uninteresting, he stopped in the mirror and mirror and began to calculate the distance he had traveled and the chance of mirror transformation. As a great mage said, there is nothing in this world that can't be calculated. He continues to move forward after the calculation is completed. Like this, after repeated rounds of twenty-seven times, he saw different things in the mirror. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;——What did you see in the mirror? The soul of the opposite world asked with enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I saw my bone shelf and my black robe. The Lich said, what about you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I think you are lying to me, not sincere. The soul of the alien world is a little sad, this kind of scribble is flying to the perfunctory - do you know that you will lose your baby? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
