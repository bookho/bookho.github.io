			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not everyone will think that gold coins are the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a knight came to them, Kreima made a gesture to let him fall and slipped ten feet away, and he was tired of his side. The two companions; Kerry’s body jumped up and fell like a big cat into the other knights. The distance between them could not even put a elbow on them. They couldn’t help but be surprised. . Before they could react, Kerry had raised his knees and kicked one of the skeletons. Of course, the knights who stayed in the prison tower could not wear the entire armor. The only thing that could protect them was the leather and the chain armor. The cheekbone is exactly where the two can't be considered. The knight immediately kneels down; their companions shouted after Kerry itself, reminding this unfamiliar enemy, Kerry did not return, waving "starlight" The backhand pushed off a heavy wide sword, and his "silver crown" was pierced from the gap of another stiletto, accurately stabbing the owner's elbow joint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight whose bones may have been broken throws his dagger to the elf. The elf rotates his wrist, hits it and gently picks it up, and shoots it to another A knight who rushed in, the short sword cut through his forehead, and the blood flowed down to cover his eyes, so he couldn't guard against the elf's make up - the secret silver chopper's hard handle knocked him. In the back of the head, he fainted, and his friends and companions stepped into the same nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A side of the corridor suddenly heard an ominous short scream, the elf spins his body, swings his cloak, and a smashing arrow aimed at his heart is He was firmly caught in it - the sneak attacker was caught immediately. Surprisingly, he was just a jester. He thought that the darkness would give him a hint of shadyness and give him some glory for the exchange of gold coins and names. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranger pulled a hand-held short cymbal from his side. This delicate scorpion bow often flows into the court, the arrow is short and sharp, with barbs Once it is shot, it is difficult to pull out unless a large piece of meat is dug up. The elf sniffs the sniffer arrow and determines that there is no suffocation after the poison is applied. He installed the arrow with only one hand. . In turn, the two knights lost the ability to fight. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guard rushed over to the Ranger, the body is almost too big to think that he has orc blood, Kerry has stepped back, a lightning strike Guarded. His hair, eyebrows and beard were burnt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranger made a thankful gesture to Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like him, the caster is not able to fight one-on-one calmly, and it is inevitable that some of the enemies from the outside world will feel some Hard, especially he doesn't want to use too many spells that will inevitably lead to irreparable consequences. These knights are only devoted to their duties. It’s not a help---it should be that he ignores the sneer of the Lich, just throwing them together or letting their heads creak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child with a childish gaze slammed the bronze door of the prison tower when they were busy stunning his master and cut off the key, as they looked When he was, he opened the whole body like a small hedgehog that was threatened. He was not qualified to carry a long sword, and he did not even have a decent leather armor. The gorgeous silk jacket did not protect it. The role of the hand-held spear is no more threatening to the Ranger and the caster than a rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was lifted openly, and Crimmar stepped forward, flexing his index finger and tapping it, the lock opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lobby at the bottom of the prison tower is empty. The entrance to the bottom is open, and the light is extinguished, and the deepest darkness is greeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is the first to jump into it, the steep ladder suddenly disappears in the seventh or eighth step, and the pre-prepared Cremal is in time. Grabbing him, the elf jumped up and took the "starlight" into the gap in the top stone of the ramp, hanging the whole person on it. The micro-light of the Mithril weapon lit his face and upper body, but Cray Mar immediately extended his finger. The precious light suddenly disappeared, and several arrows hit the original position of the elf, not the sound of squeaking but the crisp crash of Kaka. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar floats in the air, neither touching the wall nor touching the top. Kerry is holding his back, and the elf is not as heavy as a slightly larger cat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Flame. The lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar immediately cast a flame, surrounded by white, and in front of them less than five feet, the flame suddenly more violently It burned up - something creaked in the flames, a large group of transparent threads with mucus. Even so, it is still difficult to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The line of the sea spider, the Lich explained that the only thing that can stick to a whale is that it can't withstand high temperature burns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a flame, and Kremar can glimpse the opposite situation. The ladder under the foot has been restored to its original shape, and the end of the ladder is a circular room with three passages. , as Leona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are guarded by armed guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei put his finger into his mouth, lest he yell out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought she was enough to be knowledgeable, but even in the most ridiculous nightmare she had never seen such a distorted monster - his body It's like an obese man. If anyone can be obese enough to fill a room - there are as many legs as spiders, not spider legs, but human legs, but in terms of plum, it's not as good as spider legs. The length, skin color and shape of each leg are different, just like grabbing it from many people and then installing it on this body. Besides that, it is the arm, the arm that is hit, like a branch, which is probably the chest. And the place on the shoulders - the heads are almost squeezed by them and there is no place to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It moves like a worm and a piece of melted grease, it grabs a person, gray hair, seems to have completely fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budwin Ferguson, Maymi said in her heart, she heard a few strange voices that were negligible compared to her small body. Humming and raspy, if Meimi’s fingers are not in her mouth, she will push them into her ears—and then, surely, a few black shadows creep out from the wall. The odor that they bring, and the monsters that are comparable to the monster, almost makes Meimi want to give birth to more hands--two ears, two mouths, and two noses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look like lizards, dark in color, a hundred times larger than ordinary lizards, and their saliva drops on Baldwin's body. No matter where it is, it is a deep, smoke-filled hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster is full of love (don't ask Mei Mi how to see it! She forgot, she should pray again to give birth to the fourth opponent. So block my own Eyes) I touched the heads of the lizards: "Look at this human being," he said in an abyss: "Once you hear my orders, you eat this human hand and feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemies in the round room are all human beings. As long as they are human, Kerry and Kremar will not have any big problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not a human problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry's shoulder was bitten by a black lizard who didn't know where to come from. His wound immediately rotted, stinks, and expanded—even if the Ranger immediately poured the healing potion on his wound, but the effect was not as good as it should be – Krimamar cast an invisible machete Almost at the same time, he transferred the other two lizards that had just come out of their heads into the iron chair full of small spikes, and the lizards made a strange roar. Shaking his tail and his paws, but he really couldn't break free until their yellow blood dissolved the chair and they fell. died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potion was sprinkled on the wound, the tendency to spread was immediately suppressed, and the red blood quickly flowed out, after enduring some pain and itching, It has healed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good syrup." Kerry said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably because of the more expensive relationship." The soul of the opposite world replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They heard a strange snoring from a passage, and then a creepy gray object appeared on the left side of the passage, and Kremar thought I didn't want to cast a flame, and the flame slammed out after hitting the solidified fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several arms stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Ghost lizard, the Lich said, and...oh. Attached to the demon, the endless abyss is down, this is right, a king's prison should not be so shabby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Ghost lizards who can move in the rocks. They live on the same path as their distant relatives, but they have to eat more food. They only eat rotten humans or humanoid bodies. As for the appendages, the Lich says that compared with the real devil. Said to be a little cute, they can attach to humans and pretend to be that person. In addition to the fact that you like to dress yourself up with human limbs, it is hard to kill and there is nothing special about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I think it is enough to have such a piece, the soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster left, the black lizard is not ill at Bywin Repeatedly walking, when he unconsciously earned, they would stick out a forked pink tongue and lick his body. Every time he would take a long strip of flesh, like someone in that pale body. Use the cinnabar to draw a deep impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lizard climbed into the cage of Plum, and the priest of Froo sobbed and climbed to a piece that could stand two big fingers On the stone, looking down in horror - the lizard's saliva drips down and drops on her blanket, perhaps the blanket is wool gives it a illusion, it bites a blanket - the moment Mei Mi really hoped that it could change the taste, but it quickly threw away the blanket and climbed straight up, which is the direction of plum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei closed her eyes desperately, but soon she opened again because her ears could hear the lizard sticking, more than anything else Terrible footsteps. In such a short period of time, the long-legged four-legged monster had climbed to her ankle - Mei Mei screamed as she saw the pink tongue, and she tried to step on it and kick it. The lizard stretched out her tongue, and her ankle was taken up by a large piece, and even the white bones could be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attached demon, of course, we can also call him a hyena, screaming when I heard the scream, to be honest, Birdwin is not It was placed in the prison on the left side, but the middle and right prisons were built with two iron gates and a stone gate. They needed keys and spells to open. He didn’t have much time – the dog remembered it. There is only one thief and a priest of Fro in the prison on the left. The thief is the Duke who told him to leave it. It doesn't matter. It is an iron box that is closed. The ghost lizard can't go in. As for the cockroach, she is useless. So, occasionally let his little pets eat soft rots can not be overemphasized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he didn’t know was that Plum was praying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey prayed, to her god, weak Fro, she had never prayed for such a spell before, not treatment and confusion, but expulsion And punishment, she never did, and never saw other Fro priests can do it, she thought she would not need such a spell - she thought... she thought that as long as there was a male existence, she would She can be safe and happy, even if she is put into this terrible prison, she believes so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
