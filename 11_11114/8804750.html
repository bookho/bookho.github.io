			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exiled people have not slept so well for a long time, they are mostly the second generation of nobles before they become the serve of Rosada. Or the nephew, or the son of a wealthy businessman, after becoming a pastor, Rosada does not ban the enjoyment of meat. They are used to warm honey, white bread, salt and spices. Or boiled meat, full of sweet fruit, clean cotton cloth sheets, goose down pillows instead of streams mixed with mud blades, long hairy mice (they can only catch these before Crimmar arrives) ), with spiked sour berry, mud-like caves and omnipresent, trying to get into all the holes in any hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new home that was fired by Cremari's flame was very dry, the bugs were burned, and the walls and the ground were warm, except for a bit hard. There is simply no bad place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that this dream is not so long, it quickly becomes a nightmare, a wet, cold nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel shuddered and woke up from his dreams. His cheeks on the side of the ground were a little cold, too big clothes. It was already soaked, exuding the smell of dirt, and the cave was dark. He groped and climbed up, found the stone that blocked the hole, pushed it away, and the faint blue light illumined the cave. He and Their place of residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and his companions stunned at the criss-crossed ditches that were forcibly plucked by the ground that had been repeatedly ploughed by dozens of heavy iron ploughs. Covered here, and the other end of the ditch is connected to the excavated stream. I don’t know why the rising water flows along the ditch and fills the cave below the ground. All the people are from the destroyed house. Climbed out, the body is full of sewage, numb and irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reserved charcoal fire was also extinguished, leaving only the blackened cracked stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel’s teacher picked up a small, curved thing from the loose soil. He wiped it with his palm. It was gray-black and mixed in the dirt. I couldn't find it with my eyes. He found it when he stepped on it. The break was gray and white, and it was very fresh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a wild boar?" A sinner who used to be a fat man said that he was a jazz son who had replaced him many times before becoming a pastor of Rosada. His father and his brother, who were busy with the war, patrolled the Grange. He saw the beet fields and sweet potato fields that had been smashed by wild boars. It was almost like this. "We should have a little weapon," he muttered, bending over and trying to get back. In his own cave, there is a stone tied to the branch in his cave, which looks like a pointed hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge black shadow jumped on his back at this time. He threw himself into the mud, his teeth hit a stone, and the pain made him black. He heard someone shouting and screaming. It’s louder than they were when they branded it, it’s ridiculous, he just fell – he thought it was until four sharp teeth pierced his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tilted his head, he smelled the smell of blood, his nose and mouth drowned in his blood, he saw the shadow of blurry and trembling, bright The light spot, very light yellow or orange, more than two, he wants to count clearly, but his blood is flowing away from the torn artery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small wolf group. There are only three adult wolves, one of which is a female wolf. This may be why the male wolf without one eye is not the ethnic group. The reason for the expulsion was that their leader was a physically strong gray wolf. The whole body was longer than seven feet and had a weight of one hundred and ten pounds. It first jumped to the unsuspecting human body and bite. Broke his throat; its companion, a female wolf with a darker coat than other wolves pounced on another tall human, and the male wolf with a disability moved quietly from the black grass. Behind the chosen victim, it was also a relatively young human. When he was knocked down by a giant wolf, he raised his hand to block his neck, thinking that he could escape, but this is only going to be old, experience The rich male wolf did not attack his neck at all. Its teeth did not hesitate to pierce the soft belly of human beings, scorned the head, split the skin and fat, and buried its long kiss in the most delicious intestines and liver. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five young wolves, almost the same size as adult wolves, entangled the rest of the people, they don’t have much hunting experience, but how to panic The prey is forced to return to the encirclement and they are still very experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only attack those who want to escape and want to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past priest who insisted on his innocence finally found the opportunity to drill back into his own cave, but he had no time or opportunity to move the stone to block the hole. The female wolf dropped the opponent agilely and drilled in, followed by the horror of the nickname and the tweaking voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people are brought together by wolves, they are very weak, young or old, although they still have several sticks and sticks. The stick is the chief pastor. He can't walk when he leaves it, but at least he can stand still. The sticks are the branches that the priests who want to catch rabbits get into the woods to pick up the mushroom berries, even the bark. Can be peeled off, there is a natural stone scorpion, it is a stone, the middle is slightly sunken, the person who put it away is originally intended to use it to smash something, he held it in his hand, ten fingers forced Whitening is like holding your own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they left the cave, they came out with care and cherish. After all, they all took a lot of effort to get these things. Now these miscellaneous things that others have dismissed have become their last life. straw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-legged killers are not in a hurry. The reason why they attacked the prey in the prey group is because they are different from their usual hunting methods. They are not going to let go of which one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc wolf is comfortably lying in the grass not far away, the stream flowing from less than a foot to him, spotted mosquitoes, mites and cockroaches The worms are drilling on his skin, but the stucco that has accumulated for decades and will continue to pile up in the future is like a solid armor that blocks their attacks. They try to find His mouth, ears and nostrils, but the lips and ears of the wolf toe are covered by thick, thick black hair. The nostrils are the only fragile, so the wolf will jet from time to time, and the strong airflow will put the nose in the nose. The dirt and the worms wash away together, then inhale deeply, sucking the cold air and the thick bloody smell into your nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He erected his ears and listened to those tragic screams and terrible chewings. His employer appreciated his plan and gave nearly half of the deposit (not too In accordance with the rules, but asked him to get a large group, that is, a community of forty or fifty wolves, the wolf toe on the surface agrees that the heart is quite disapproving, even human mercenaries will be under too low salary Take the initiative to ask for more returns, the wolves are the same, you call them, let them run from the side of the storm to the side, they have to guarantee enough meat for them, and here only a few people, very thin, wolf toe I didn't want to touch the gold coins from my pocket to satisfy the big appetite of the wolves, so he eventually found a small wolf group, which may be a new wolf group after grouping, and only three heads left because of accidents or disasters. Adult wolf and five young wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother of the wolf toe is the human slave of the orc, and his father is the priest of the tribe, who could have been in this same humble and low-lying half-orc I got a better position, but it is a pity that his tribe was engulfed by another tribe. His father and all his children were chosen as sacrifices. If he is not beautiful, he is willing. The mother who gave her life to help her child escape, he is already dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He escaped, indecent, only a strong body with human and orc blood, his head closer to the orc, so that he could not mix In the human country, he had to live in places where humans rarely traveled, using his father's ability to survive. He could talk to wolves, bears, and leopards, trying to deceive their power and horror, rabbits, wild boars. Deer, and some adventurers who are stupid enough to take shortcuts or are too curious are his favorite prey. He also likes human wine, women and other ways of enjoying, so he occasionally attacks the village. Soon after, he caught the attention of the guild. They found him. He naturally did not hesitate in the two-choice proposition of pledge allegiance to the guild and death. The land was chosen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the guild, the wolf toe is very good, at least he feels like this, although his status is only a little higher than the slaves and servants - because he is too embarrassed, he never appears in front of the victim, even He is nearly half as tall as an ordinary human being, nearly twice as wide, and his claws are sharp like a knife. He is not willing. He only lets his tools, that is, the fierce birds and beasts, complete the task assigned to him by the guild. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are also a lot of ways that the patrons like him, because such a murder looks like an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's like this one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His employer reminded him that these people might get the elves’ care, and the wolf toes observed them and the surrounding for a long time – except for a suspicious He didn't find anything outside, but today he came to a mage who cast a cave for the wolf's prey and gave them food and medicine. He was worried that he would bring weapons and even reels to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caves that are reinforced by flames are a bit tricky, but half of the wolf toes are humans. He lets the wolves plan the creeks, create ditches, and let the water Flowing into the cave, it is not surprising that those who lack vigilance climbed out of the secure shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he just has to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's words: This is the 20th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the adults for their reward! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can such a good article not support it?
