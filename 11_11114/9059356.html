The idea, no one will care. w?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it’s a soft guy who controls the body, another flat life like a honey jar can’t be in his body From any spike, for the rudeness of the gnomes, he did not think that he thought for a while: "The things are complicated," he said frankly: "But Wendwin is not a bad person."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," McGee said rudely. "We don't care about this, but we can't accept treatment. We will be very inconvenient. - Early detection and later debugging need to be increased. More than three times the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But in the process of testing we can do other work at the same time," said the soul of the outside world, "I want these jobs The time it takes is also amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe." McGee said reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing the lich wanted was sent to him in five days, a set of twenty-four elegant and delicate Mithril instruments, including a fang Hammer and chisel, and a hand saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to check and detect, daytime lichs and gnomes check Badwin together, and at night (no need to rest as a normal human can really Fortunately, the Lich is alone in the "milling field". Even the eunuchs rarely appear here. Only the "Shantou" and "Niu Ma" are managed here. The job of "Niu Ma" is to put those The bodies of slaves piled up in one place are transported to the "milling field", and the shells are scraped off with their shells (avoiding the stone grinding by the excessive hair of the head), and then they are cut into pieces, piece by piece. Throwing into the huge stone mills like a house, the slaves who pushed these stone mills were walking silently around the stone, only the whip creaked. Or there is the horrible snoring of the bones being milled into pulp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat slurry flowing out of the slot of the stone mill is contained in a wooden barrel that can be moved by two people. Because the long-term use is not cleaned, the wooden barrel is rancid. It is like a stomach of a living thing, wrapped in thick and soft unknown materials inside and outside. The color is deep like the ocean at the time of the red tide - these barrels are neatly arranged on the side of the "grinding field", and next to them are the tan powder stacked in the open air, even if they are not seen It is made, but the lich can also guess that the powder will be mixed with the meat, made into dough and placed on a slate to dry them by the heat of the red sun. It is the “hands-on” and the young “bovine horses” who can eat the most delicious and nutritious food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, the Lich also needed to impose a hidden figure on himself, but after a few days he saved the "milling field" - the slaves didn't care if there were strangers around them, they occasionally I will stand and stare at Kremar, and now he can walk on his own. When he stands, he will walk away. I don’t know if it is an illusion. The lich even feels a regretful smell - "milling field" The slaves have special treatment, they can eat the broken dough and raw materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any living person is standing here, he may be crazy. At least he will flee and flee, but as a former undead, the Lich is like a treasure trove of a dragon's secrets - he regrets that he did not come to Longhuo Island earlier. He has heard of it. There was some scandal in Longhuo Island, but at that time he was busy taking a foothold from the Master’s Master Tower. He had no time or energy to care for an archipelago that was thousands of miles away. After leaving the Master Tower, He devoted himself wholeheartedly to the difficult and long work of becoming an undead. When he finally became a bone shelf wrapped in a gray robe or a black robe, his first trip to the astral world was unfortunate. Encountered a plane storm, then. As you know, the little thief from another plane, given by Tyre, who has never changed in the middle of the year, and the God of God of Alzheimer's, he became a redemption lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that one should be cursed into the alien soul of the endless abyss. Now he can't even directly grab a living person to open his head to observe the changes he wants to see. The slaves sent to the "milling field" almost have reached the point where the lights are dry, they are the parcels. With a layer of skin on the bone shelf, after opening the head, the lich is now drying their brains like coconut kernels that have been sunburned for a few days. The contents are not only reduced to the original one-third, but also black and The phenomenon of fibrosis - young and strong. That is the slave killed by the pirates, his brain is full, but the end of the nerve bundle can still find traces of corruption; after a few days, he waited for a younger and healthier slave, but his The skull was knocked out. Even so, his situation was better than the last two. After the lich waited for ten days, he finally got the body of a slave child. The brain of the child is almost complete. However, color and texture are inevitably changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dada said, this secret medicine is obviously able to accumulate in the human body and gradually use it. The lich will extract some of his organization. The words are placed in the shallow mouth of the mercury plate, and the difference between them is studied. The least affected is the meditation of the so-called basic activities of life such as heartbeat, breathing, digestion, etc., and the most serious damage is those that are used. In the part of thinking and memory, the lich remembers that he has seen from the memory of the alien soul that when people are not completely controlled by the ignorant belief of science, they will make some social unrest and cannot end directly. The people whose lives are judged to be insane, make holes in their heads, destroy a part of the brain, some patients die, some patients are alive, but they become unruly, meek and obedient, you let them do what they do What to do, and the secret medicine of Longhuo Island seems to have the same effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the slaves, only the eunuchs and the slaves around the masters with rational and complete thinking ability, the "shoutou" are second, the "smart hand" is better than the "cow and horse", and the children in the "cow horse" are better than the young ones. Young people are better than seniors, although those who are not so 20 do not know that they should not be called seniors, but in the Lich’s observation, those "elders" who are about to be eliminated can also Shows the power of the same adult yak, and the older it is. The more indifferent, the more rigid and fixed the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret medicines were also carefully examined by the lich, and he seems to have configured similar potions in his memory, but the key parts are absolutely It is different. Something was added later, he had to extract the various ingredients in the same way, so that you can see what the rest is. This work procedure is numerous, the failure rate is high and you can't invite others to come. help. So the progress is very slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun passed through the entire island, the lich returned to his home, handing over the body and something about Baldwin to another soul, So far, the companions will still share the first meal of the day together. The undead who used to be here need to thank Dada, or a series of unwritten laws on the island of Longhuo - as the owner of the side island, although he may be People are in a vast mansion, but his room is surrounded by a u-shaped building in the middle of the o, can be said to be completely independent. Although it has a gallery connected to the surrounding buildings, it will be closed at night. This kind of closure is not an obstacle for Kerry Ben, Gülen or Birdwin, but they defaulted to this practice. Although Krimal is still their companion, it is already an entire island. With the owner of 100,000 slaves, he should have his own dignity and authority. As a companion, although he does not need to bow to him, but the least, they can not make him embarrassed, even if Kremar does not have this conscious. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Kerry is still returning to his side, and he is placed on the big tree next to the room in Cremari. If there is a case, Gossula will give the warning as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the plum blossoms all day is a little weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After late at night, she had a lazy and cozy happy time with Gülen, and the thief reached out with a bit of maliciousness and scratched her. Light bare back. "What happened to you today? Don't tell me that you have an elf among us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not," Maymi said: "Just he is right. Kreima's attitude... Gülen, don't you think it's a bit creepy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just a little overprotection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gods are on, that one is already twenty years old, he is already an adult!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For humans, yes. But for an elf, he is still a baby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The expression on Meimi’s face is really worth a gold coin to look at: “The bottomless abyss is down,” she said dryly. “That is a powerful mage. Since I saw him, he killed no less than you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you have to go to Kerry Ben," said Gülen: "The elves are all ghosts, in fact, their bows and arrows." No more amiable than the orc's axe, but they always feel that they are the little white flowers swaying in the breeze..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meme turned a white eye "I am not kidding you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the elves, it’s only sixty years old to be an adult," said Gülen, so the half-elves are Be strong Sixty years of service was only allowed to leave the gray Ridge is for this reason, rather than as human imagination - elves never enslave any intelligent life, not to be treated as their tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I want to say is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Gülen made a Gestures, hidden behind his fingers, are his faces that don’t know when they are no longer smiling: "Don’t pay attention to them, whether it’s Cremari or Kerry, they are not us and can be qualified "Object," he put his hand on the hip of Mei Mi, and the cold fingers made Fro's pastor shudder. "I think, maybe we are leaving?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The escape is over, at least temporarily, we should leave, Mei Mi, we are not with them all the way." Now, it is a good time to part ways."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to go back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Of course, it is still on the side of the island," Gülen said. "It’s not yet completely out of the wing, and for us, the side island may also be a good starting point." The thief’s look Become dignified: "Honey," he said. "You should have already seen it. There is no temple of Fro on the side island, and Kremar, the owner of the side island has allowed you to be the first Fro Temple of the island." Presiding over the pastor, dear, you will be high, understand? You stood at a higher position than others at the beginning, and you still have a solid foundation, although not with Kerry Ben or Birdwin, or Compared with the Norwegian king of the Highlands, but an alien Pastor, even if she is more beautiful, younger and more Froe than you, but who can win the trust of Cremal? Will he believe that a stranger is better than you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
