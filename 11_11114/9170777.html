			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Danos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich raised her head and took a look His own temporary companion, the young red dragon unexpectedly generous, he got an assistant who was the leader of the dragon thorns, but this is not worthy of being happy. When a red dragon is unusually kind, it may be Contrast you with a dead person: "I know your name." The undead who once said that he repeatedly recited the name in ideology, language, elf language, and abyss language several times: "in This is the meaning of red in the abyss," said the Lich. "Do you inherit the blood of the devil or the devil?" He turned and looked at Danos, the body of Danos and many thieves, thin and fine, and big Some of the Grenada people have an evil but glamorous face. This is the first time he has presented such a clear face in front of another person. He may have some kind of magical equipment to blur himself. The lich wants to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just thought we need to reconsider," Danos said, being sent by the Red Dragon to the side of the Black Dragon is not a good thing. At least when he left the red dragon's tent, Kelmen smiled quite happily. It seems that the previous incident has angered this narrow-minded idiot. Obviously, maintaining neutrality is a kind of betrayal and contempt for Kelmen: "Given that we may not be so calm in the next few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" The lich sat down behind the large desk with his hands on the open reel Top: "I always think that the so-called calm, peace, or order is not what a Grinada wants to see. We love chaos and love it. We are hurricanes, rainstorms, swords and flames. And death - this is one of the destined axes of fate, and no one can change or correct it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must say this is My mistake, Your Highness," Danos complimented angrily, his eyes. After losing the camouflage, it slightly infiltrated the heart-rending red color. Perhaps this is the origin of his name: "I just want to know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a Dangerous, it may be fatal," the Lich said. "And what is greeted by us is not what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since you know... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think I should do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We know, Your Highness, you deep Loved by Gredith," Danos said: "If you like - I have a lover, she is one of the pastors of Greedy, this time, she is also among the dozens of pastors, and she They also have their own friends. They are very willing to work for you. Of course, they only need a little little reward. Nothing can make people more silent than the interests. What do you say?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pastors are willing to call Greedy for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A hidden sacrifice Danos said: "I know that there are some slaves in your hands, as long as you are willing to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich’s words all blocked Danos’s words in the throat, and the dark-haired dragons stunned the dragon’s generation’s generation, only At first glance, Danos’s mouth stabbed. He did not inherit many demons, but he had two dominant inheritances, one was his eyes and the other was his teeth—his teeth were in peacetime and deliberate. When concealing, it is just like the human teeth, except for the extra small size; but if necessary, the shark's triangular sawtooth will be born from the gums, instantly replacing those harmless teeth - sometimes They gave Danos a lot of help, but now, when faced with a warlock or a wizard's dragon, this change does not play a decisive role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to control, but the black-haired dragon’s throwing power on him was too heavy, he tightened his body, then grabbed the chair and slowly squatted Then, lest your spine suddenly break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The temptation of the teeth." The lich whispered: "You don't need such fear at all, I mean, I don't think your wisdom and ability are enough." I can't get away - if only you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be punished." Danos said in a lower voice: "I admit that I am not only Just for you, I am also for myself, it is a trap that has no return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
