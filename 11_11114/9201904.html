			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft prevention section, change tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, Franciscans voluntarily bury themselves in the Hill of Hell, originally used to bury criminals and corpses, which is a humble and self-made act. It is a pity that the deceased did not have a voice. After he was buried for a few years, he dug out from the hills that were renamed the mountain of heaven. He was reburied in the lower church of the Franciscan Church. It was a magnificent hall. From the wall to the top, there are beautiful murals. Above the sage's tomb, stands a jeweled gold-colored lodge - and underground, according to the conventions, beliefs and laws of the time, has a promenade-like mausoleum. In the semi-circular white marble arch is a shackled tomb with a sarcophagus carved with saints, angels and flowers. The sarcophagus is mostly empty, but some people have been gloriously and sacred forever. Sleeping in a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, very few people are allowed, or willing to come in, although some will clean it regularly, but in such late nights, even if it is called "death" The "Sister" of the Franciscans of the Franciscans will not be happy to come here with the dark ears of darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Lard Skin” is a mercenary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, twenty-six years ago, when he was strong and young, ambitious, as a bohemian, he was not willing Caring for the fields, and not willing to look after the cattle and sheep, the Hungarian king Hungarian Jane Mashash I decided to recruit a standing army that was independent of the great aristocracy (people called them because of the Knights and soldiers of the Legion wearing black armor) When he was a black army, he did not hesitate to sign up and became a soldier. Think about how proud and happy he was at that time, even if he could not wear the black armor like a knight. But as a leader among the soldiers, he not only has a pair of steel shackles, a large shield, and a arquebus. It is a pity that the good times are not long. In a fierce battle, he was pierced by a spear on his left shoulder, and then he could not return to the "Black Army." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the injury healed, he also worked for other mercenaries. The nickname "Lard Skin" was from that time, with a bit of ridicule. It means that “lard skin” knows that some stupid people think that they are not brave enough, but where is the brave person, they have long been a meal for wild dogs; then he was occasionally hired by a bishop, but this adult does not need The soldier was an assassin. After completing a few jobs, the "luck skin" was surprised to find that the assassin was the best career for him - he liked to quietly put the silk rope on the neck of the prey and grab the wooden ball. Look down and listen to the last snoring from the teeth. In the process of working, he will cling to the victim's body and feel the last powerful but futile struggle, just like being able to taste from their body. Take precious anger. He knows that this kind of thought and behavior is almost similar to the devil, so carefully not let anyone know about this unique little hobby<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at the cross behind him," In the name of God." He whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assassin waited less than a quarter of the time for the candle, and a slight snoring came from above, like "Lard Skin". The people took off their shoes. After all, whether it was the bottom of the wood or the bottom of the cowhide, it would make a very loud sound on the stone floor. He held his breath and waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua is very cold, chill tonight It seems to be extraordinarily strong. The cold is like an awl. It is placed on the sole of his foot. He puts a lantern on his chest and blocks it with a cloak. It is like the holy lady holding a lantern when the Virgin worships the baby. His mood is the same. It’s anxious, like a thirsty traveler who can’t wait to go to Ganquan. At the moment of entering the mausoleum, the oncoming darkness makes the child shudder and shudders. He walks down, the ladder is missing. The corner cut his toes, but he still walked down unconsciously. The lantern could only illuminate less than a foot beside him. He was like walking into a big mouth opened by a giant beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "luck skin" has lit the candle, and the candle is on the altar of St. Francis, in a dry stone raft, which is stored The sulphur-small firewood, carrying the flint with him, gently slammed it with the handle of the dagger, the Mars smashed out, lit the velvet, and the velvet ignited the firewood. He lit the wood with one left. One third of the candles, the quality of the candles is not very good, the light is dim but it is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came from the orders of the adults." "Lard skin" said that while lifting the waist robes, let the children see the coat of arms drawn on the long underwear: "I am on his behalf, and your mother will visit you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to Joao?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you talking about my predecessor?" "Lard skin" said: "He broke his leg, and he is not called Joao, he is Bart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua’s eyes are missing Tension, "How is the situation of adults?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little tired, but besides these, he is like a bull." "Lard skin" replied, while Recalling that before he left Rome, he heard that his master had a banquet with fifty deer and twice the shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joshua’s description of the “luck skin” was slightly sympathetic, but his desire for his father quickly made him move this little thing aside: “ Does the adult have a letter to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I officially came for this." "Lard skin" said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua put down the lantern and hurriedly took the brass cylinder. He unscrewed the cylinder and poured out a roll of parchment. The frills of the parchment curled up with a bright red lacquer on it, a unique seal on it. When Joshua saw the familiar seal, he finally put down the last trace of doubts - in his concentrated and hungry reading of the letters. When the words came, "Lard Skin" went behind him: "It’s too dark," the Assassin seemed to inadvertently say, "Let another candle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the very beginning, Joshua didn't even understand what he was saying. He heard the sound of a flint tapping, and then the light in front of him suddenly swayed. It was entirely instinct. He raised his hand and grabbed his throat. Even before the letter was dropped, the silk thread passed over the boy's nose, slipped down his jaw, and tightened at the position of the knot that had not yet been raised. The child's feet slammed violently, and the lantern on the floor rolled over and extinguished in a crisp squeak. The assassin arched his back and covered him with his own body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua’s ears creaked, and the eyes were covered with a gray haze. He heard the murderer recite a poem in the Bible. His voice is greasy and calm: "God, please bless me, because I trust you," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My heart, you said to the Lord, You are my Lord. My advantage is not outside of you.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the saints of the world, they are beautiful and good, and I am most pleased..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lard skin" The clucking sound he is familiar with, hey, whether it is a child or an old man, always seems to have endless strength in the face of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the other gods replacing the Lord, their sorrows will increase. I will not offer the blood that they have poured, and my lips will not mention the name of other gods." No..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord is my inheritance, the part of my cup. I am holding you for me.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amount of rope given to me, it is located in the beautiful place. My industry is really beautiful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will praise the Lord who taught me My heart is also alerting me at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, this is his only prayer that can be coherently reconciled. Funnyly, this is not for the sake of Praise or confession, but to determine how long it will take to complete the work on hand - this is one of the tricks that the assassin who taught him how to use the wire noose to give him a slap in the face of a child should be prayed continuously. More than two times, strangling a woman with a full chest, it takes four times, a strong man, five times, the old man needs six times or seven , Although they are aging, weak flavor, but compared to the young but requires less air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will put the Lord in front of me. Because he is on my right, I will not shake.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So my heart is happy, my spirit is happy. My body is also to live in peace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you will not leave my soul in the underworld Nor does it mean that your saints will see corruption.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lard skin" continually recited three prayers before putting down his hands and untied the silk rope, letting the boy lie flat on the cold rocky ground like a sleep. He pulled the dagger out and moved it under the child's nose. There was no fog that symbolized life. He wanted to open the boy's mask to see his dead face, but his fingers stopped at the edge of the mask. "Lard skin" picked up the boy, put him in an empty stone sarcophagus he had observed and selected before, and then moved the heavy cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-lighted the lantern, extinguished the candle, picked up the fallen letter, and the parchment wrinkled very badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valencia Caesar of Borgia, firmly in the mouth of Julio, fortunately, the impulse of Little Medici was fleeting, they slowed down and hid themselves in the shadow of the pillars, the assassin When Joshua Bo himself, the black shadows stretched by the light of the candles were less than a foot away from them, and they swayed like a devil coming out of hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They listened in silence, just as the priest of Valencia wanted to go out, Julio suddenly took him and they heard the danger The sound of breathing - the assassin went back and forth, he stood between the columns, quietly, the dagger reflected a faint glow on his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may have been standing for as long as a hundred years - at least juveniles and boys think so, just as quietly and silently as they did last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Julio first ran out of hiding place, Caesar hesitated and followed, but what surprised him was that Julio did not I fled in a panic, but rushed to the stone sarcophagus and began to push the lid hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dead!" Caesar whispered, the Borgia family also supported the assassin, and he also saw the punishment, men, women Yes, an adult who has been stranded for so long will certainly not escape, and Joshua is still only a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me! Fast!" Julio said breathlessly, he is only six years old, although he is very healthy, but the height of the cover has crossed him. On the top of his head, he can't use his strength even if he is kicking his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caesar sighed in a short sigh, just as Julio thought he had refused, Caesar pulled a flat head from the back of the altar. The iron rod, inserted into the gap of the lid, exhausted it to force it up, then pushed it back, rubbing the lid and the stone squeaking, giving a squeaky squeak, but in the next moment, a terrible bang Shake the entire mausoleum, cover it on the ground, and split it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Caesar’s more stunned things happened, and Medici’s Julio jumped like a rabbit with his tail cut. Into the sarcophagus, I made some movements that Caesar could not understand, but could understand: "I said he was dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me some light !" Julio hurriedly ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caesar paused for a moment, or ran over to light the candle. He turned the candle to the side of the stone and saw that Julio had opened the mask of Joshua. Although it is known that Joshua has always used a linen mask to hide his face, it is because his face has a major flaw, but Caesar is also the first time to see his face so clearly - this is a terrible face Ah, if you paint this face on a mural, or in a relief picture, people will see that they will scream at the devil and run away - it is a bloated formation caused by countless reddish tumors. Occupy the entire forehead and the left face, because of their encroachment, even the intact right face was pulled to the deformation, so that Joshua's face looked like a semi-melted wax head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julio has no time to think too much, thanks to the tradition of the monks not wearing any underwear and buttons, a thin loose robes is perfect for first aid . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows why Caesar insists that Joshua is dead, he almost thinks so, but he soon discovered that Joshua’s jaw and neck The location of the connection also spreads the tumor group, perhaps because it is warm and humid, and often rubs against each other. The tumor there is not so much a tumor, but rather a fat creature. Under the candlelight, you can I clearly saw that there was a deep and awkward wound there, and the blood flowed out from it, but it was because of the traces left by the devil’s kiss that the silk rope was not completely cut off as the mercenary hoped. Joshua's breathing - Julio is not sure if Joshua really has a chance to be saved, but before he becomes Julio di Giuliano de Medici... or afterwards, he can't Let an innocent person die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
