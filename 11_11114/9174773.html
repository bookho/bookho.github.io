			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gülen walked through the courtyard, he saw the Baroness, they did not see each other, or that their intelligence was in the other’s Hands. No compliments, no smiles, no dialogue, no need, they all know what kind of person they are facing, Gülen thinks, maybe between Leona and Birdwin, the kind of tension that always exists. It was because of the Baroness, after all, no one knows more about things between men and women than her. In this matter, Gülen admits that she has a small advantage, but Gülen can make it difficult for the Baroness. The things that are done, after all, the latter are mostly "birdies" with feathers and soft claws. To be exact, Gülen and the Baroness can actually stagger the scope of their services. It does not improve the situation in which they can only be described as tit-for-tat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They passed by, Gülen’s hand on the rune, and his dagger, like the second heart of Gülen But the thieves still went out calmly. No, he can no longer find a second owner, such as Leona, who has a prominent identity and surname. The thieves' guild has existed in this world for thousands of years. Every grand prince, king or family has their own trust. Except for the princes of Norman Norman, no one will accept the self-recommendation of a strange thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, maybe he still has a master who can work for it, Gülen grin and smile, ignoring the Cavaliers’ castful, questioning look, he thinks The black hair caster of Grenada, if there is any regret, it is that Grenada is completely a chaotic and cruel country. A man who has been on the throne for three hundred years will still be called For the new king, and his wife is a red dragon, Kremar is his illegitimate child - the black-haired dragon is far from that position, and there is a saying that it has become a god. The supreme ruler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German tentatively bet on some of the power in the kingdom of Grenada, if there is something in Leona that he doesn’t want to see, then He still has at least one retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Gülen could not help but shake his head slightly. In the previous glimpse, the Princess Li Ona did not mention Crimdale and Kerry. Even without the black hair caster and the Elf Ranger, Birdwin Don Cray may have turned into a monster's poop, but now they seem to have been completely forgotten - if, say, Kremar because The relationship between blood and identity makes these two adults think that they have been deceived and holding a broken heart and crying at the corner, then the elf Kerry Ben? He didn't have a child who suddenly became a red dragon, and Gülen knew that the army of Grenada and the warriors of the orcs had turned to the silver-crowned jungle. This is something that cannot be covered at all, not to mention him, or The Baroness, this was originally the fact that the most ordinary scout knight could detect it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is deliberately avoiding it, then, is it to avoid him or to avoid this problem? It seems that the latter is mostly, and Gülen narrows his eyes and hides his own contempt. It is not surprising to say that Leona made this decision - even if she is in love, she is also a Norman. The heir to the throne and the trained heir to the throne, this can be seen from several decisions she made. Gülen never thought that on the island of Longhuo, she refused Bydwin to take Crimdale for justice because of justice and justice. If Birdwin did that, he would not only lose his honor and pride. It is also possible to fall into the vassal of the lord, just like the rusted sword cloaks in the various ports of the Dragon Fire Island, except for the exiles who have nowhere to go in the pubs and beds. How did Leona allow her lover to fall to this irreparable point? Even the location of the thundering lord she felt that she was not honored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he, when the blood of the Norman’s royal family in the Highlands has not withered to this point, she is determined to reach an agreement with a humble thief, though Even the agreement can blow it away, but now she has used the baroness for her own sake, completely ignoring the seductive lady who has worked for her enemies and has the death of Norman Pharaoh. A little bit involved, she is like a businessman, as long as she thinks you have this value, then no matter how dirty or stinking you are, or biting her hand, she will not hesitate to reach out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relatively, if you lose your original value, or if you have to pay too much, the king will exclude you from her without thinking. Beyond the field of vision, it must be said that there is a difference, like the Baroness, or Gülen, she will not have even a sigh of apology and shame - of course, even if it is Kerry, sorry. Since the orcs have suspended the deepening of Norman in the Highlands, they have turned to the coronation of the silver-crowned jungle. As the king of Norman or the future, Leona will not give up Norman and rescue the silver. The decision of the crown jungle, even if it is a paper covenant between them can not be said to have completely torn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
