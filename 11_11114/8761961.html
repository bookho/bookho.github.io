			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author has something to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to see the lich, this thing he also has big The part of the show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who saw Pastor Fro and Monroe was just an assistant The priest, as a fifteen-year-old boy, was involuntarily attracted to the beautiful woman, and he peeked at them as Monroe and her lying under the laurels, but fortunately, he clearly remembered the woman’s face. And her golden bell hanging over her waist, only Fro's priest will bring such a small ornament, not allowed, and the good woman will do it unless she is crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Master immediately wrote a short note to the apprentice, and the apprentice quickly left and quickly returned, and brought the lord’s seal. Letters with four armed guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took a carriage and went to the temple of Fro to handle the matter, and the guards followed the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Master did not put the letter in his pocket - perhaps considering that it will soon be used, he noticed the black hair caster The line of sight has been spinning around it—so, out of an older wizard's love for the young and the concealed gratitude (the water), Kremar got the important letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a square, well-made suede paper, folded diagonally, that is, the paper is still a small square after folding, four The corners are together, sealed by red lacquer, and only a small part of the middle has no creases after being taken apart. The above is abbreviated briefly: as the owner of the hill and the white tower, she temporarily gave it before sunset. Part of the original belongs to her right - just to find a sinful sinister person, he is not only her eyes, but also her mouthpiece, therefore, I hope he can get the respect and help he deserves, etc. , and so on - mineral-containing inks sparkle with metallic luster, sprinkled with pearl powder that causes the ink to dry quickly, and the bottom signature is consistent with the content of the letter, with naive arcs and too strong pauses. Every place has been poked out of a small hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date was written on the crease. According to the convention, it should be at the beginning of the whole letter, and it can be seen that it was forgotten and rewritten. At the end of the signature, in addition to the cinnabar seal left by the lion's claw seal, and the administrative chapter of the catching axe lion on the tower, it shows that it is not only the will of the lord, but also the ruling of the white tower. Official support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima read the letter repeatedly several times, from which he couldn’t find a hint of fear and humbleness. He only saw the politeness and aggressiveness that he barely maintained. In the memory of the alien soul, there is still something left. The memory of the priests of his world - in the middle ages when science is still not so developed, human beings are almost faith-based food, no matter the East or the West, those who serve the gods can always gain a little privilege and extra respect, even their The deity never really appeared before the world, nor did he give any tangible grace and punishment... He thought that this kind of situation would be intensified here. You know, the god here is like the air is real and omnipresent. But as far as he is concerned, it seems that this is not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The laws of different regions are different - the Lich says that you will only appear in countries and regions that are considered to be owned by God. In the case of thinking, they usually only worship a god, and the godly servicemen reach out to every corner, from the most noble royal family to the most low-lying slaves. They only allow one voice, one color. And a symbol, they are not the law but the law, everything is born around the needs of the gods, those who believe in other gods will be mercilessly expelled and killed - naturally, as the only belief The status of the pastor and the priest will also be elevated to the point where he can serve as both a judge and an executor - they certainly will not allow the knife they are holding to stab their bodies, unless they are internal to the battle and battle, otherwise They can be said to be completely above the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the White Tower, its owner is a lord under the lord of the princes, and his territory is full of palaces and sanctuaries that do not have a god. He will never allow anyone to share his power - this is true in most parts of the continent - if the law is violated, even the pastor or the priest can't easily escape the punishment, and As long as they can submit conclusive evidence or witnesses with identity, it is difficult for the pastor and the chief priest to shake their final judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the undead who used to continue said that the status of the pastor and the priest depends on whether the authority of the gods they serve is close enough to the needs of the mortal— - Like Fro, her maid may even be lower than a civilian at some point, only because the gods they serve only control love and **, except for sluts and sluts, and their enemies. Who will need to be blessed with the lover? As for punishment, they can't curse someone's loss of fertility or undermine the established marriage, because it will attract the anger of Gerdi - she is the powerful god in charge of production and marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is irrelevant to sin a priest of one or a few Fro. If we are visiting the temple of Gredi or the sanctuary of Woking today, then I believe that the lord of the White Tower will be more cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world seems to want to ask something, but at this time they have arrived at the destination, Kerry Ben gently patted the Cremal The shoulders interrupted the conversation in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's Temple is beautiful and delicate, with eight pillars at the east and west ends, and twelve pillars on each side, with a huge porch, walls and The floor is covered with a strange material with a fine texture. It is like a young girl's skin. It is pink in the white, not as cold and hard as other stones. In other places where the temple and the sanctuary stand the statue of the god, there is only one side. The embossed walls with this stone as the main material - the fierce look is just a few irregularities, the lines are rounded and bulging, but as long as you look at it for a while, it will change - arms, legs , feet, chest, buttocks, beautiful face, men and women, smooth skin, naked, they live, turn, like a snake tightly intertwined, whispering touching words, posing all kinds of people Unbelievable ** gesture...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has lifted a palm to block Kremar’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro’s chief pastor ridiculed the newspaper with sarcasm. She seems to be only about twenty years old, but she has the style of a forty-year-old woman. Mature, or, there is still the tiredness and weakness of the 80-year-old daddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are talking about Rossi, she is dead," she said hoarsely. "Not crazy, it is fever, we burned her." After she finished, she stopped paying attention to Antonio. She had dealt with this wizard. He was an old stubborn who had been subjected to petrification and frozen rays, and the Ranger Kerry Ben, if she had the chance, she would cut him by hand. She is only interested in that strange new face, he is still a child, the black eyes are beautiful and indescribable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do she have anything left?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some clothes." Fro's The chief pastor, boringly twirling the bell on his waist, let it linger as a non-stop, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are accessories." Antonio Master knows a Fro The things that are most lacking around the pastor are those things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, some accessories," said Fro's chief pastor, slouching, and she stared at Kremar: "Let the dark-eyed little guy come with me, otherwise nothing."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar just blinked, "Okay," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a time of lunch, Cremari and Fro’s chief pastor walked down the stairs leading to the second floor corridor. Kremar carries a heavy box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't forget what you said," said Fro's chief pastor: "You have to send all the same things back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you can't send it back." Kremar said: "I will also send back coins of the same value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good boy," Fro's chief pastor said softly: "I know that you will not make me sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She What to do?” On the return carriage, Antonio Master asked, he also wanted to cast a spell, which was stopped by Kremar in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She didn't do anything," Kreima said helplessly: "Those things were placed in the first room of the second floor cloister, she Just let me sit with her for a while, there is a full-length mirror, from which I can see the entire hall, she is there to laugh at you with a restless, irritated appearance... just like this."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony screwed his beard, and Kerry suddenly shook his head with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disappointing them, Pastor Fro’s box has nothing but some aromas of silk clothes and jewels, no badges, no letters, No reels. Master Antonio cast a detection spell and failed to find any magical gear from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima keeps his promise and puts everything back in the box and sends it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro’s chief pastor is receiving an important “friend”, another pastor has taken over her work, she looks strange after counting for a while Raised his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
