			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce, unrelenting whip woke up Austal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no stranger to him, but he is a little so familiar. The red robe warlock is a bit embarrassed. He looks up and then slams his whistle. The whip was whipped from his left forehead to his right corner. Although he closed his eyes in time, he was still scratched, tears and blood rushed out. "Not allowed to look up," said an indifferent voice. "Sinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal obediently bowed his head, even if only for one moment, he already Seeing his environment, this is Grenada's prison for warlocks and mages. The walls, the ground and the top are covered with black iron. He is twisted to the back with heavy heels on his fingers and ankles. The material is made of chrome-plated steel, which is a rare metal. It won't make the steel rust, shiny, it can increase the strength of the steel and the inertia to magic - maybe some people will feel strange, after all, it is justifiable to wear it on the ankle, but why is it here? Wear it on your finger? Of course not because their price is almost equal to gold. When a mortal or warrior's hands are caught by ordinary people, it may be difficult for him to make any rebellious actions. A caster may not, unless it is like This special guide for the caster, it looks like a small set of five small rings that are fixed together, and the fingers are forced to pinch after the fingers are inserted into it. Gestures can't be done, and you can't crush rune gems or tear open scrolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was full of blood, his tongue was pierced between the upper and lower jaws by a small thorny iron ball, it was uneasily swollen, but still, this cognition Let Austal breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The executioner continued to give him dozens of whip and walked away. Austal waited patiently, expecting the executioner to leave the prison and let him Get some short-term freedom, he needs to know what happened to him - he remembers that he seemed to be still in the far north, with stinking elves, gnomes and humans, and a group of stupid frosts The Giants competed for the secrets left by the Silver Dragon, along with the disciples of the half-lich Lidra of the Seventy-seven Islands. The latter made some dead frost giants walk into the cave, and perhaps the incomplete winter wolf and the ogre - Austal did not doubt that he could win the final victory, although it may be only a part, but he looked What happened? He has always been curious as to why those people would allow a priest of Fro to become their burden. Now he can finally understand that even a dragon can not resist a god, although "she" can not Not confined to a human body, Austal must admit that they may not be as ignorant as he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that this woman may be quite respectable in terms of strength, but it is not so commendable in her mind. She failed to control the key to the lock, but it made her angry and disordered. All of them were Involved in the dark black vortex, after which Austal did not know how other people were doing, but he did lose consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how long has he lost consciousness? One day, two days, one month, one year? Who brought me back? "Fantasy," Ostal said in his heart, he recalled the conversation between him and Eddie's disciple before the vortex appeared. "This is the fantasy of the silver dragon." He repeated to himself, but he was not at all Dare to take it lightly, nothing can understand the horror of the illusion more than the red robe mage who loves to play with the body and soul. The mentors of Austal once tied a mortal in a dark room, then made a mystery and made some on the finger. Flash, telling him that there will be a few little devils who bite his wrist and drink his blood. In fact, he just put a few harmless bats inside, and after one night, open the door, the mortal is dead. It’s wonderful to die from fear and excessive blood loss. The only damage he receives is the light traces left by the bat on the bare skin; or they will hold the red soldering iron near the prisoner’s invisible The place, then replaced with a cold soldering iron, but the place that is touched will also smother redness and ulceration, giving off a smell of smell; Austal also used to be in an ancient The book has seen a vicious thief leader with four magic daggers. When they are thrown out, they look like a dozen or so. Some are real, some are just illusions, but each of his enemies will be Can't distinguish them and get hurt or die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If what he is experiencing is that everything is an illusion, then Austal must show the guardian of this place a tribute to the caster only, it Too real, true to the fact that he can smell the rust of metal and blood, and can feel the light and slight wind. As for pain and itching, there is no need to repeat it. He also feels thirst and hunger, which lasts a lot. The Heavenly Dragon Warlock has a tougher and stronger body than the mortal. They are also very patient, and this kind of image can swallow a dragon at any time, like the whole stomach can not wait to digest their feelings, only It can take up to ten days or even twenty days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there many days? Ostal reminded himself, no, this is just an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restricted freedom did not last long, and several pastors dressed in red robes came in and they took Austal out of jail. Putting him in the sun, the burning sun shone on his body, his eyes could not be opened. After a performance whip, he was smeared with a stimulating drug and pushed to the street—not a slap in the face, he heard people cheering and shouting, full of malice – someone put him on a horse With a stick, hit his knee, let him kneel, and then force him to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ostar knows what kind of punishment this is, although he has never accepted it. When he felt that the chain attached to him was dragging a very heavy object, he was almost certain that the penalty was used for those who made mistakes, but because they were useful, they would not be executed or It is the caster of Grenada who was sent to the altar and dissection table. Compared with the pain, it focuses on depriving the prisoner of his dignity and status. Those who are subject to such punishment, whether he is a warlock or a mage, Nothing is likely to be trusted and valued by Gredith. Everything he has will be taken away, and he will still be unable to become a currency or food after being squeezed clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he is pulling is a statue of Griffith's obsidian stone, which is as heavy as a few thousand pounds, and he must be around the king of Grenada for a whole week, In the process of hard crawling, it is accompanied by countless curses and whiplashes - when he involuntarily stops and his lips touch the cold ground in an attempt to extract a little water from it. After he was deprived of his name, he was replaced by a humiliating nickname. He was charged into the ranks of the trade and became a bloody battle between the devil and the demon in the bottomless abyss. One of the consumables that must appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal, please allow us to continue to call him this way, if he can firmly believe that this is a fantasy in one day, two days or one year. In the past fifty years, he has become uncertain in the bloody battle. Everything around him is so clear and credible, but as Ostal knows, all the illusions are essentially Almost all of them are based on the memory of the legal person, because no matter how sophisticated the spell is, it is only a spell, but the place where there are conflicts and omissions is often repaired by the memory of the subject - just like human beings are dreaming. It is often difficult to know that I am dreaming, even if the dreams are ridiculously ridiculous, they can always make all sorts of plausible explanations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Austal’s itinerary continues, he is lucky to return to the main material plane from the bottomless abyss, although at that time he could not say that it was a The descendants of humans or dragons can only be said to be a distorted monster, but this is the price he has to pay, but Austal feels that the price is not too expensive - he once again saw the grid The bright white sky, the reddish-brown land and the gray-black rock, saw the black robe, red robe and gray robe walking in the king's capital, and saw the towering red peaks - a steep and sharp mountain. The red dragon, the largest of them, is called "the shackles of death" and belongs to the Gree, which is their "mother". Under the "death of death", it is a building that stretches for thousands of miles. Group - the king of Grenada. Just like the king he saw in the northernmost place, the silver dragon is shaped like a king in the illusion. In the kingdom of Grenada, each building can also allow the dragon to enter and exit in the original form. When taking off and landing, the streets are more spacious and flatter than those in other countries. Nothing can make Aostal more familiar than this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal saw his disciple Rica, his situation is not very good, it is normal, in Grenada, lost the mentor, especially if the mentor was punished for crime or dereliction of duty, then Unless his disciple can show a strong and unique talent, he will be the first to be sacrificed or sacrificed in all conspiracy and traps. For this, Ostal said that he was very reassured to see that he had not been good; then he carefully "visited" his former colleagues and subordinates and found that his familiar faces were few - the last is his Blood relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People outside of Grenada often confuse the relationship between the Greinadas, especially their aristocrats and royals, perhaps because The dragons and their descendants are always less concerned with the relationship between them and the things that are only minor. Human aging is very rapid, and choosing a spouse among close relatives may breed stupid or ugly offspring, but the dragon and the person who inherited its blood are completely without this concern. The dragon can do so even if it is too ancient. It transforms into a young human form, and their descendants rarely age, and their life span can be compared with elves or dwarves. Even if they get married with the closest blood relatives, the children they give will only become healthier and stronger because the blood is thicker and purer, and there will be no abnormalities or miscarriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some bottom-line people’s guesses are wrong. Although Greedy is called “mother” by many warlocks or priests with her blood, It’s just a concealed and respected pronoun. It’s not that she gave birth to so many descendants in a thousand years—Gredi is a dragon, not a rabbit. As far as Austal knows, there are only seven red dragons among the descendants of Grydy. Yes, the last egg she gave birth is male - the first king of Grenada, is Gray. With the descendants of a mage, Greedy probably had about 300 descendants with other humans, giants, and orcs, but most of them died or died during the expansion of Grenada, including three. Only red dragons. It is now the most recent and most trusted by Gredith. In addition to the Red Dragon, there are only three descendants with the strongest blood, one of them is the great-grandmother of Austal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the rest, Greedy needs more power - her dragon descendants never mind and powerful humans under her instigation or command Happy. A dragon may take tens of hundreds of years from pregnancy to hatching, but the dragon and human descendants are about the same time as humans, although it is an egg and takes 30 days of incubation time. But they are much more efficient than the dragon eggs, and Gerdi soon has a large number of human descendants, each born to be a good caster, and at the request of Greed, they are married to each other. With the birth of more children, the original pedestal of Grenada was established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
