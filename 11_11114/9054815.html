			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of steam is a preset signal, and with the help of thieves Gülen, the syrup sneaked into the darkness and swallowed a cold, salty air. Open the black hair of the caster and hand it to her scroll - the magical flash is covered by thick steam, and those who are blocked will only think that it is the shell in the sand or the quartz in the d cave under the torch The brilliance of the singer--in their group, only her and Kremar's two casters, in the case that Kremar could not be separated, the only thing that could use the reel was the plum. Www*xshuotxt/com She tried to concentrate her thoughts, prayed to her god Fro and hoped she was looking at her, then torely and resolutely tear the reel, the closed magic line was opened artificially, hidden inside The magical energy spurted out and the spell fell on the heavy rocks. The priest of Froo watched the magic light infiltrated into the hard rock, and the thieves greeted two people who didn’t know how to say lucky or unfortunately rushed from the deadly steam. To their pirates, one of the pirates has a good eye - he always has a single eye mask, but if you see the pirates doing this dress, don't think they are missing one eye, sometimes they Just to confuse the enemy, to make them become light enemy, and sometimes to jump into the dark cabin, not to be slow due to sudden changes in light and dark - we all know that humans fall into the dark from bright places At that time, there will be no such thing as a short period of time, but if there is an eye that has been hidden under the eye mask, this small problem will be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this pirate is wearing a leather eye mask, no direct steaming steam and lucky enough to keep one eye, but his face and arm skin is still I was burned, especially on my left face, maybe because I had collided with other pirates or fell, the skin r was dug out a lot, bloody, and fragmented skin hanging on it, it looked very scary. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother," he shouted. "To the southeast!" The pirate who lost his eyes immediately rushed in the direction he had indicated. When the thief's dagger pierced the chest of the poor worm, the former secretly wanted to slip away, if not Leona. He was hopeful and successful. The king of Norman in the Highlands was anxiously close to his eyebrows, and a sword cut the head of a monocular pirate. After finishing the work, she stepped back and slightly turned her head and glanced at the rock that had been cast a spell: "How is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know "Mei honey said tightly. She stretched her finger to push the stone, only to find that it collapsed immediately. Her fingers were covered with sand: "Great," she said with joy. "The spell is in effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Oona stretched out the long sword, and the long sword barely received a little resistance. The large rocks fell into the subtle sounds after being turned into black gravel, mixed with the white gravel. After a few breaths, they saw a light, very subtle light. The king did not hesitate to put down her knees and put her eyes together. After an instant she stood up: "It's outside." She said she saw the sea of ​​stars and fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the effect of the spell seems to stop here. In fact, the scroll from the Lich's hand has exceeded his existing strength. It is more necessary to thank the god of luck than the god of magic. It has a d on the rock wall of the Black Rock, although this d can only allow the Mole to drill out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there still?" The thief asked: "Similar to this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Only this." Mei Mi reluctantly spread his hands. Open the scroll that has turned into waste and show it to Gülen: "To tell the truth, that...the adults will actually prepare for such a scroll, which is beyond my expectation." Fossil is a middle-up spell. But only those who are going to dive into the dwarf's pit d or go to a cemetery x will prepare this, so as not to accidentally bury the companion inside. If it is just for themselves, they will be more prepared to send a reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German glanced at the torn scroll, the wind from the outside wind blowing his eyes, taking away the heat and thick steam, between them and the pirates The barrier has become very thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me try." Liona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reel or wand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said Leona. There are indeed some scrolls and wands in her pocket, but the spells contained in them are either not very useful for them now, or they are too useful. The king is not a caster, not sure if it should be taken out. Use, but she has a better solution - after she reached out and touched the little d mouth and checked it, she raised a hammer from the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mi can be said to be panicked to avoid, the hammer of this hammer is as big as her head, and exudes the unique silver blue The color of the light, engraved with beautiful patterns and magic runes, the handle and the hammer body are integrated, there is no trace of welding and fixation on the top, the top of the hammer body is inlaid with the stone and sapphire like starlight, according to the thief It is estimated that this beautifully decorated hammer may be able to buy a half of the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity that Leona took it out for use as a hammer. She waved the hammer without a slam, and the hammer hit the rock wall, easily expanding the mouth of D - Liona's guess is correct, the spell The rock wall has been almost eroded, the remaining rock wall is only half the thickness of the palm, and the texture has become crisp and soft. Leona has expanded the small d to a person's bend without much effort. The waist can climb out, but the king does not stop. She turns her body and knocks the fragile rock wall again and again until she, Mei Mi, Gülen and Dada and slaves can see Go to the sea and the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan wanted to say something when she finished the first step but didn’t stop, but he stopped quickly and his eyes flashed. The thief stepped back and hid himself into the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dada." Kremar said that he had just broken a wand from the generous Alva Master, and the spell in the wand generated a The huge magical palm, between him and the female warlock, but a burst of lightning-like impact immediately shows that this spell can not last too long, "You take them away."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can let them..." Dada said, then swallowed back the words that had not been spoken when he came into contact with the mage's eyes. "Yes, obey, my master." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The farther away we are, the better." Kremar said that he can only say that the number of enemies far exceeds expectations. He can't guarantee that so many people are safe and sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will take them away," Dada said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has made a secret decision. If the new owner dies, then even if he will not be buried, he will be taken back by his twin brothers. At that time, it is not the stone mill that is waiting for him. Dada was trying to get rid of this end of the game and became a slave to Kremar. He did not hesitate to lose three contacts. He didn't want to fall short here. After he left, he would find the nearest one. In a field, the command "Shantou" gathers all the "bovine horses" that can be called. Of course, the "cow and horse" will not fight, and there will be no weapons, but they can at least use the body to block and interfere with those terrible enemies, even if only for a while, Dada is convinced that when things get to the worst, there will be a turn. Like he took back his life from Amos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the pirates on the sea have already seen them. They shouted and waved the torches. Drake and the sea magic who had not yet entered the d cave saw it. I also heard that the sea magic spit on the ground and spit a yellow-green spit to express the disdain for Ruiyite. Even Drake couldn’t help but sigh deeply. It’s all time urgency, otherwise he can go It is said that the red robe is full of the ground, the Master is not as good as the dog's Gretelal looking for a satisfactory one - he will not admit that at the beginning he had considered having to go with the glamorous warlock. Touching and moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shale rock, as its name suggests, looks like a black, rounded snail shell placed on the coast, surrounding it. It is a flat, wide sand. Only on one side of the island, there are palm forests and coconut groves with dense needles. The edge of the forest is covered with dense ferns. The humans and elves behind the rock wall can't find any barrier worth mentioning. The slaves ran into the palm forest under the leadership of Dada. Perhaps because they are too worthless, the warlocks and pirates did not put them in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Lich's point, the soul of the outside world casts a reel, and the spells in the scrolls begin to tremble on the ground between them and the pirates. And shaking, this spell, if applied to solid land or rock, will form bumps and fissures like small earthquakes, but on soft sand. It will only cause collapse, and the first few pirates are deeply in the sand. They are screaming in horror, but their companions are far away, and the warlocks suspended in the air cast. A spell that completely freezes the large piece of sand under her body, freezing it to the point where even the heavy sea devil walks on it without any problem, the pirates are slowing down on the frozen rough ground. Step closer to their prey, they have nearly a hundred people, and these people can basically say that they are unharmed - those pirates burnt by steam are like pirates whose body is frozen in the frozen They are ruthlessly abandoned. If the battle is over, they are still fortunate to be alive. There are brothers or their captains who feel it is necessary. They will be brought back to the ship. If the captain feels that it is not worth saving, or his popularity is not very good. In this case, they will be cut directly from the throat, and then they will be taken away from all the valuable plants, and the body will be burned to ashes or just left in place, waiting for the hermit crab to They eat clean. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates are entangled with people outside of Cremal, and mortals are unable to confront the caster. This is common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the female warlock wearing a deep red silk gown landed in front of the black hair caster with a sweet smile. "We can finally "Yes, isn't it?" She squinted at Crimall: "But I don't think we need to be so serious. I serve Drake, but if necessary, the contract between us can be modified. For example... If you are willing to give up enemies with us, I am very willing to meet a young and beautiful mage in my room, of course," she said, seemingly inadvertently glanced at his body circumference. "You may not want to abandon your friends, but this is not something you can control. I think we can talk about it. As far as I know, Drake does not want to kill them, or to judge them." The rights are not on Drake - well, I can make a guarantee that they will not be tortured or cause permanent disability. How do you see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
