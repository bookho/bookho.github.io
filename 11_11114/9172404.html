			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gredi has seven children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One was killed by a swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One was shot by the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One was frozen by ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One son is dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A daughter conquers her four parties...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two more, and two more Dear friends, there are two more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gredi has two children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has heard his father, the king of the jungle, Ingwi, the moment he woke up, Hesitantly jumped out of the silver crown wood and ran into the royal court of the elves. Of course, before that, he did not forget to hand over the water to his face in Berlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are really weird," said Bolin, bowing his head and saying, "Isn't the otter not afraid of heights?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white face screamed twice, and the otter did not really get used to living on the tree tip like a bird, but from there, you can see the Starlight River and the Flying Wing. They always look together, as if they can see a personal shadow appearing in a place they are familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is leaping between silver crowns, light as a breeze, lightning fast, he almost forgot everything - the king of the jungle is in all the elves After the nest, he went to sleep. After a few days or ten days, he occasionally woke up, but the time was extremely short. Even if Kerry was in the next room, he couldn’t see the twin eyes like stars. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so eagerly, when the young Elf Ranger falls from the tall silver crown to the terrace, his movements are still as soft as the petals fall on the water. Then he saw that the long window on the floor had been opened, and the cockroach was provoked. His father was sitting in a light silver dark robes sitting at the round table, next to Perant, seeing some disorder in his breathing, and still on his hair. Kerry Ben, who had a broken twig, they laughed and Perant shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you..." Kerry asked, with a vague fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not sleeping because of illness or curse," Ingeway said with some helplessness, "but because my strength is so large that this body can’t Hey, I think you should know, my child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the result is the same, the young elf said in my heart. Although Kerry knew that his father would eventually be expelled from this plane, he would not enter the mourning wilderness, and the god of life, Angris, would come to meet him personally, and the king of the jungle would enter the Kingdom of God. Become a god and enjoy eternal glory and life. But Kerry Ben, perhaps most of the Elfs in the jungle, can't accept their king and leave them, at least not so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's tighten the line of time," Ingway said, he stood up, and Perant raised the cloak on the side, this cloak Unlike the king of the jungle, which can be used to replace the armor, and the thick cloak of Mithril and the gossamer, it is as white, soft and fluffy as a cloud, even if it is not a baby, but by countless evil people. The king of the jungle and the fear of the jungle is also somewhat lovely when it is wrapped in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this stolen from your daughter Kellebril?" The King of the jungle apparently noticed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said her daughter, Perant’s implied eyes showed a real smile: "She is very willing to work with the jungle." Wang shared her blanket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the cloak really belongs to a baby... Kerry said in his heart, while following him Father, when the king of the jungle moves, there will be a weak spot of light flying from the body. It is the solidification of power. It is a symbol that cannot be carried after overflowing. When the light falls to the ground, it will be delicate. The young shoots rise from the ground - such traces are all the way, until they come to the surface like the water flowing through the entire silver-crowned jungle, the thick mist slams the cloaks and faces of the elves, moistens their hair The king of the jungle raised a hand, and the water curtain slowly opened for two weeks. The narrow suspension bridge that was seen and passed by Kreima came back again. The suspension bridge was dry and clean, and at the other end of the suspension bridge, A silver threshold that constantly changes shape, can't see the end, see also See the bottom of this king of Faerie with Kerry and Pelant went inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you worried about Perant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not the real sea." Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But only Perant can get that kind of thing," said the king of the jungle: "Because at that time he just put it down, except him, who is I can't find it anymore, even me." He sighed a little: "No, probably I can, but the whole Wanweilin will be subverted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same thing that is important for some existence." King of the jungle said: "So things, I will put It is handed over to you, and then, at the moment you know, give it to someone you think you should get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is speechless Looking at his father, the king of the jungle, Ingeway, is a majestic and even cruel king, but he will sometimes be quite... right, bad taste, "Why can't you just tell me when I should put it? Who is it handed over to it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Because of this,” the king of the jungle from Kellebril’s blanket Reaching out: "Things lose the unpredictability that it should have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I may make the wrong choice."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's also a kind... um, the direction of the wheel of fortune," the king of the jungle said irresponsibly, putting his hand on Kerry's shoulder. On the other hand, I found that the bundled shackles were chaotic because of previous scams: "Listen to your heart, Kerry, any decision you make will not be wrong, believe this."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Pelant **, and tiredly turned up from the ship's side, he saw that the King of the jungle was combing his son's nephew - but saw him Ingwi immediately walked over to him, holding his hand, and after a few breaths, Perant immediately held the hand of Ingway: "Don't use too much power," he said: "If you fall asleep You may have to wake up until the snow melts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait until then everything will probably end." Ingway said, reaching out a little, the remaining forces immediately opened a series of small flowers on Perant's long hair: "Bring this to Kellebriel." This is the crystallization of his power for an elf child. It is like a sun and rain dew for a young shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, my friend, your blessing will illuminate her night like a star." Perant said, no rejection, no fear, He and Ingewei are not only ministers and kings, but also friends for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingwei smiled and took the things that Perant had brought up. It was an ordinary bone scorpion. It was as rough as it was without any carving. There is no magic protection, traps, or organs. Kerry has opened it with a light hand, and then he saw a dark, dark color that looked like it was folded. Cloth, he reached out and picked it up and found it unusually light, "Open it," Ingway said, "My child." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kerry’s imagination, but his palm-sized things, even if they are thin and light, open from the hands to the feet, Seris Textile, a yarn that can be stacked seven times and still see the size of a bug through them, can only do this, but he is wrong, so that when it is fully unfolded, it covers the entire fore deck, and It is not regular, it looks like an oval, and it looks like the shape of a shell. Even the surface has the same bumpy texture as the shell, but the texture is as slender as a spider's silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will not tell me what this is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guess "It’s right." Ingway said that after seeing the child’s distressed look again hundreds of years later, he almost felt soft, but Perant coughed very promptly, and the king of the jungle cast a vote on the former guard. "Good job!" The eyes, handed the bones to Kerry Ben: "Put it up," he said. "Only this can make others discover it before you make a decision."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is this." Ingway said that the second thing he gave was that Kerry knew. In fact, this was originally given to him by Kerry. - The fragment of the rune plate that he returned from the far north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you will need it," said the King of the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
