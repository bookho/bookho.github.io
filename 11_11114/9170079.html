			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Mrs. Lorenos who came under the escort of the Doring Knight. She lost her life and lost her mother when she was young. One year her father married a new wife. Her stepmother can't be said to be the most vicious than other women in this position, but she has to consider for her children, even if they are still not in her. Growing in the belly - although there was no female heir in Norman’s inheritance law at the time, a daughter’s dowry would undoubtedly be stripped from the property that her child would inherit, and only a few The old lady of Lorenos was sent to Doring, and she was married to the second son of the Dorsett City. A guy who was useless in any way, perhaps for this reason, his father was able to marry the new bride. It doesn't matter how much assets are carried, but Mullen's uncle doesn't think so. He is jealous of his brother, because his wife is both beautiful and rich, and he gave birth to a male heir, and his wife, though young. , but Mrs. Lunnuo Si face can only say that the dignified, old-fashioned and strict nature very flattering, but only gave birth to a daughter, he will soon have a lover, and the lover and have illegitimate children. After the stagnation of the plague, Mullen’s uncle, based on the despicable and vicious nature, wanted to rob him on fire, but he did not expect that Princess Leona, who was looking for Birdwin, could be said to be out of everyone. Unexpectedly, but it made people feel the joy of directly killing this guy. For this matter alone, Mrs. Lorenos would also offer her loyalty to this brave and decisive princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she saw Princess Leona standing up from the long thatched grass, she couldn’t help but smile, she wanted to ask immediately before, but she was The pastor around me stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me," the priest said. "I need to release a spell to make sure you are not a morph."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are not calm here." Princess Leona said that after receiving the approval of Antonio Master, Birdwin accepted the test of the pastor, and after getting the correct answer, the pastor’s look Slightly relaxed a little, then Mrs. Lorenos stepped forward and accepted similar spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was just a few days ago," said Mrs. Lorenos. "Solo is lucky enough to receive a deformed monster and a orc who drank a deformed potion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope they have not caused too terrible consequences." Princess Leona said worriedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their goal is me." Mrs. Lorenos said: "After Mullen left Dorothy, I temporarily managed the city and him for him. The territory of the elderly woman. The old woman’s eyes are filled with perseverance and a hint of unpredictable anxiety. After all, her daughter is the wife of Mullen, and she knows that Mullen is going to do something very dangerous. I am anxious about the day and night, but I dare not explore it casually, lest it bring irreparable danger to Mullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona paused for a moment, about Mullen, they, or Leona knows more than Mrs. Lorenos, but some She did not hand over to Baldwin, nor allowed others to tell him that Baldwin was her lover. In the arms of Leona, he was as hot and bright as the scorching sun hanging on the dome of the sky, but she also Knowing that the stronger the light, the darker the shadow, and Bywin is not without its drawbacks. Leona’s father, uncle, Princess Ang’an, Fukai and Wang have the honor to embroider the surnames on the tapestry. They have never climbed this from the despicable hunters to the lord of Thunderbolt. The vulgar people they sit side by side in their eyes, they despise him, mock him, or insult him explicitly or secretly - Leona can see that they have not seen it, or they don’t care Baldwin's excellence, but she also knows that Baldwin does have shortcomings and weaknesses, just like his stubbornness, or stubbornness. When he is the leader of an army and the lord of a fortress, he is black and white. A distinct view of right and wrong may not cause any unsatisfactory consequences. After all, what he has to face is not the orc who is his people. But when he was no longer the lord of Thunder and became an exile, his stubbornness brought a lot of trouble to his companions, just as he had always resolutely excluded the thief Gülen from the queue. Even though Gülen is quite competent as a companion, Leona doesn't need Baldwin to trust Gülen as much as he trusts Kerry, but his attitude toward Gülen makes Gülen unable to take his hand from time to time. The dagger was removed. If it wasn't for Cremari, and he himself, he might have lost his life in the hands of the thief - even Leona could confirm it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, their dark-haired companions, after the real identity of Crimall, the behavior of Birdwin also made Leona somewhat disheartened She couldn't believe that this was what Badwin had done, even though she still believed in Bedwin, and believed that he had repented and changed. But she knows that the mustard in Bedwin's heart is not completely open. Maybe he doesn't think he is doing it wrong. After all, Krimaar's identity is urgently discussed, so Leona doesn't dare let him see every one. The information sent by Gülen’s thieves, lest he make what he thinks is correct, but in fact the mistake can not be wrong again, just like Mullen’s current identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
