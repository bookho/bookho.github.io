Made into thin ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the transparent glass windows of the café near the Scotland Yard, the clear Thames has been restored, the exquisite Lambeth Palace and the opposite parliament building It is faintly visible, surrounded by shimmering orange lights... Even if the gas lamps are no longer used, the residents of this city still prefer warm lights, perhaps to add a little psychological comfort to this season with the lowest temperature and the least sunshine hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was drowsy, Mr. Black moved in and sneaked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s rare that he has always been elegant and elegant, his clothes are broken, his face is shackled, and there are still a few traces of blood left on the cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing me, he set his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time, life-saving!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf looks like a refreshing, I laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Helping you? You are in the wrong place, this place is a jewelry store, looking for the hospital to go 100 steps east, it is St. John's Hospital, many white angels inside Beautiful, pro-medical and noble, technically competent... Hey, yes, you are so embarrassed, can you run into your old family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Black screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still have a joke!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the black shadow flashing outside the door, I have already added four or five barriers, um, maybe in the future, so as not to let the idlers and others wait for themselves, when my store is a playground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think it’s the lovely Mr. White, they are paying attention to the light, and they’re not just fragrant flowers, they’re warm, and your bedroom is full of damn light. Although you don't need this at 3 am. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He showed a sly look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the soul of my signing contract. I have fulfilled my promise to get compensation now, but I am going crazy with the damn bat!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an interest. These days are really boring to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Black took out a diamond ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the soul of the wonderful woman, the prisoner is quiet and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even I rarely see such a cute little prison, 24 diamonds, the grain is flawless, about the size of the grain, round, according to human The latest evaluation standard belongs to the colorless net rhinestone class, which is completely clean (Flawless), referred to as FL. That is, there are no defects inside and outside the diamond. Crystal clear, sparkling, ring to make a small circle, meaning for eternal love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing is that it has existed in this world for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chill in the store is bulging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pale, slender hand slowly breaks through the invisible barrier, thereby making every effort to break through, a man emerges from the air, shoulders black hair Micro-hook nose tip, deep sputum blue eyelids, blood red line thin lips, pale complexion, lead gray velvet long sputum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard of your name, Miss Time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly looks away Turned to the diamond ring in my hand and then turned to Mr. Black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at Mr. Black, he makes a helpless expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the Earl of the Lord not know what a contract is? She has signed a contract with me, I have completed her commission, and now is the time for her to fulfill her promise. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who was called the count showed a firm look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been looking for her for so long, this time I will never let go... at any cost!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am lazy to gather my fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is too crazy to make me unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a subtle vibration in the ring. I suddenly felt a bit, and I couldn’t help but cast a strange look at Mr. Black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately bowed his head, the hat cast a dark shadow, I can't see his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so sure she is the person you are looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Black is low ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past few hundred years, my love for her has not been cut off for a while... OK? I don't want to be sure, no matter what she is, her soul. I will never forget the unique purity of the atmosphere!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count looked intently at the ring I held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Black has touched his wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For hundreds of years, it’s not a short time for a bloody family who can’t die forever. Besides, as a human being, I’m afraid that it’s gone through countless cycles. ...you are really confident!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She will not change, she will always be Louise who puts me on the eternal ring... I am willing to compensate You, cancel the contract!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compensation...ah..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seems to be giving up Mr. Black smiled and found out the snowy contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I closed my eyes, even the blood race, tearing up the devil and the human contract will be the most terrible counterattack, a finger aging for hundreds of years The body is a visual devastating for me who only loves beautiful things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring between the fingers slowly reduces the weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes again, the count has disappeared and satisfied, Mr. Black is holding his hands and standing in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The soul is actually yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My words made him tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really a time... Yes, this is a way of demon signing up except for very few people... I am with her... ... exchanged each other's souls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Black clothes smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I found him, but he found her... Time, what can I say? He loves Louise so infatuated... I already It’s not Louise.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to help you once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ignored his horror and I leaned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am time, I can smash all the so-called taboos, come on, let me say, I can help you reach your wishes!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is almost unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but finally...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regained his calm and steadily walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, time, it’s a very tempting proposal! Even the devil is so excited. But... it’s not needed anymore."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Black took off his hat in a dance-like graceful manner and performed a fairly classical knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw his full face for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very handsome five senses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(End)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The price of amber <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1850, Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country of the country, as if it were gold and flowers everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge canopy, spiral gold-plated copper column, corrugated baubles, vine branches and cassia twigs climbed countless little angels, clever and delicate mosaics And the glass window, even if walking under the roof of the church hall, the devout characters of the black and white dresses are all faintly with a fascinating color... Can this huge luxury deformed pearl 不 make me happy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small fish at the door rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest who came in was a girl, wearing a colorful and distressed clothes, thin and reed, wearing a pair of translucent sunglasses on her little face. tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not like the guests in my store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have to wait until I see the characters behind her, I really raised my eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a gentle and elegant man with a beautiful face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he came in, he couldn’t help but look around. It seems that there is no temperature in the store where there is no temperature rises a few degrees, and there are special conditions such as strange aromas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laughed awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no longer concerned about this store, holding the girl slowly to come to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for an amber."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is also very soft and moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Amber in the world is like gravel, are you looking for that one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6 thousand Ten thousand years ago, a golden butterfly was sealed and it was as big as a human eye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amber, originally a resin of the ancient Pinus sylvestris, was accidentally buried in the stratum, and evolved over a long period of time to form fossils. Transparent crystal, bright as pearl, beautiful color like agate. If there is a worm that dissolves into the thick turpentine before it can't get out of it, it will be buried in the stratum with the turpentine, and finally become fossil. After a thousand generations, amber is mined from the ground, and sometimes the image of insects struggling is seen in transparent crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden rosin, wrapped in the miniature butterfly for 60 million years, has a thin tentacles, almost invisible to the naked eye, slightly broken wings, and dry abdomen, but still repeatedly bounces the body at an extremely small angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pointed to hold this amber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need human wealth, time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That has nothing to do with you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to close the amber, but it is blocked by the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at her, I realized that there was a pair of crystal-clear eyes composed of 12,000-17,000 small eyes under the sunglasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the same family with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She searched for 60 million years, please be merciful...time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Make a gesture of pleading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t bargain with me, this money is impossible for mortals, it’s not difficult for you, and no matter what your prominent The boss is yours. As long as you walk out of this door, you will see that you are in the midst of a real light. Naturally, there are countless believers who come to donate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are disciplined ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That has nothing to do with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hate cheap sympathy, strong but not only to be a gentle appearance... I want to get my jewelry in vain for the beautiful reason, that is In vain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See him and her still want to talk, I With a terrible smile and a slight finger movement, they have been kicked out of the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deal made me feel exhausted, and I went to the store one day and one night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t think that Mr. White was waiting for the Locke armchair sitting at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you can make things here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't wait for me to order, Be the first to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See what you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I responded lazily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will love it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very confident and confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a hand and took amber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he was handed over to him, he shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please also ask for the time to release it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, even after-sales service is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, amber has returned 60 million years in the narrow range of my hands, gradually brightening, soft, liquefied, slowly rising, it is inside The prisoner flew up and flew freely in my shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
