			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Havi’s Grand Duke looks at the pedestrians who are about to enter Bibi Dibao, a huge island like a cloud that suddenly appears in the outer sea. The ships rushed to avoid it, and the sailors thought it was a miracle created by the gods - "It's a demon." Dagong whispered, his previous plans had to be postponed, and he could not refuse them. Perhaps the civilians are not very clear, but his name for the Grand Dragon of Grenada is simply a slap in the face, and on the road where all the countries and territories that have been destroyed in the land of Grenada, like the rushing river, The banner is the shadow that covers people's minds and is a prelude to the signs and tragedies of death. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, if, as Yadel said, these minions are now owned by His Royal Highness, Hispanic Krymall, then he and Alva The good relationship of the Master - Harvey Dagong had to express his heartfelt gratitude to Master Alva for always being so understanding and compassionate. When the young caster was still empty, the gift of Alva Master was undoubtedly In the snow, if he is not a purely Grinada, then he will at least have a little gratitude, and what Bibi Dibao needs is only a meager relationship, it must not be a vassal of any power. Whether it is a grand prince, a prince or a king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avra is the first time to see a city outside the kingdom of Grenada, walking civilians, merchants and guards on the streets, and occasionally Seeing one or two casters, although they are cautious in speech, they are ruddy, strong in footsteps, neatly dressed, and it seems that the rulers here are not so harsh and greedy. The only uncoordinated place is probably the cages hanging on the wall. There are four or five dry bones in each cage, but it seems to be a long time ago. What's more, as they walked through a lively laneway, a ragged guy suddenly rushed out of the shadows, shouting the name of the false god Griffith, waving a knife - but he still couldn't do it. Before that, the guards who were rushed to the scene immediately collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentice of the former Pastor of Gredith opened his eyes curiously, and she did not expect to hear the name of the false god here, one of the guards to them Apologize and ask if they were scared (somewhat routine) and then took the person away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man who greeted (supervised) Grenada’s group by the orders of General Harvey showed some mourning look, that person was his best friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young girl passed by them, embroidered with a vivid blue butterfly on the sleeves, they once swept the entire tourmaline for the clouds, but In the summer of the following year, their number has suddenly decreased. Even this year, even seeing them has become a difficult thing, but for humans, it is a good thing, no matter what happened. Because these butterflies can only survive on the endless poisonous "tobacco", their disappearance also means that "tobacco" is about to disappear. It is now possible that only a few druids still keep their eggs in dormancy. - But in contrast, the most important raw materials have been lost, and the drugs that the so-called believers are crazy about have naturally stopped supplying. In a short moment, the medicine of the shrine is raised to a very high price. - In order to get this medicine, believers are willing to follow the instructions of the pastors to do anything. If it wasn’t for Harvey’s Dagong who had been isolated by harsh means to indiscriminately spread the drug in Bibi Dibao, perhaps Bibi Dibao would be completely destroyed in these people, no, “monsters” riots, even so, There are still dozens of families who have been destroyed by this drug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master and his disciples, as well as several druids, elf spells have been studying countermeasures to curb this drug, but even drinking it It can make a giant fainting the slurp syrup of the past, and the person controlled by this drug can jump from the bed, he will become powerful, sinister and insidious, and the lie will come at hand - and even if there is magic With the gods to remove their addiction, they will still go out, go to the place where there is medicine, and then once again fall into the poisonous network of the priests of the Gredi, his friend is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must have walked out of Bibi Dibao, thinking that he could find the drug as he did every time, but no, after the fall of the false god Gedi, her temple It is also passively shaken, the wall collapses, the beam and column break, the priests can't get the god's response, they can't use the magic, they have to run away, and the raw materials of the medicine, the plants with bright flowers are bitten by the blue-winged butterfly. Where can he go to find medicines? His body is no longer lured by drugs, but his soul has already fallen into the bottomless abyss—he is not the first—those who are mastered by Gerdi’s drugs are discovering that they can’t find it anymore. When they are drugs, they will completely collapse, they will become cruel beasts, even friends and relatives can not escape their claws, or dear people are the first and most vulnerable, young People know that the garrison captain will soon go to that person's home, only hope that his friend can still retain the last trace of reason, but he also knows hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house of Harvey’s Grand Duke is in fact the original The governor’s residence, some members of the parliament carefully asked whether to expand or re-decorate this somewhat decaying building, which was rejected by Harvey’s grandfather—the old man who has been smashed with white and wrinkles Smile: "Nothing is necessary," he said quietly. "It's mission is coming to an end soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are frightened, Harvey There is no heir. Is he going to adopt a adopted child and let him inherit the position of the Grand Duke? It is very likely that the new Dagong may not look at the original governor's residence, but want to rebuild a palace. If they return home, they will start preparing for the money, and some people will begin to hoard the essential alabaster. , ebony and glass and other essentials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the highland Norman, His Royal Highness is waiting for someone in a sun room in the House of the Archon. This sun room was left by the wife of Harvard’s former governor, and the top is inlaid with a huge shell-cut Mingwa. Of course, the transparency of Mingwa is much worse than that of glass, but the opposite is cast. The light is also softer, and the pattern of the Mingwa is as beautiful as the flowing clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two attendants around him, and Antonio Master is accompanying him. After all, if Leizhe had an accident, he was the only survivor of the Norman’s Hayman family in the Highlands. - Their mother, Leona died a few months ago, her funeral is much thinner than that of Birdwin Don Clay, but the tears that flow when everyone goes off for her are real. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the light and rhythmic footsteps were uploaded in the hallway, Lehman’s long-awaited person appeared, and what surprised him was that it was only A girl, behind her is Yadel, and the priest of Rosada smiled when she saw Lehman. Lehman guessed his identity at once, because his father and mother once mentioned this person, but the brand on his face has disappeared. He looks young and beautiful, like any Rosada. The darling is so enviable. Lehman suddenly fortunately, if his father is still alive, how dazzling he will be when he sees this scene, although Lehman is still a child when Birdwin leaves, but he is as delicate as his mother. He was aware of his father's incompetence - perhaps Birdwin Donkre committed an unforgivable mistake, but he was Lehman's father after all, and Lehman could not bear to see him become ugly because of jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lehman stood up, Afula stopped, and the teenager and the girl looked at each other. One of them was the second heir of Highland Norman, and the other was The owner of Refa, who is not willing to take the lead - the old master laughed at the right time, and Lehman took a breath, perhaps not as a prince of Norman in the Highlands, but as a male, he seems to be Following the etiquette, he nodded to Afula and walked behind a seat, and Afula also bowed his head and sat down gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next thing." Afra is too lazy to talk to such a mortal: "I hope only two of us know - maybe," she paused A moment: "You will hope so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony glanced at Lehman, Lehman put his hands together and let the wizard see his character The ring, with two protective runes hanging on his chest, an aggressive rune that was released by the impact of the flame - Afra also noticed, but she didn't care, if she wanted to kill A weak chicken (this is also the term she learned from the black-haired dragon), and these runes are not a hindrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone, except for Afra and Lehman, Afula closed his eyes and felt the old The barrier spells released by the mage - at least here is the secret that no one can peep and eavesdrop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the third son of King Grenada, the Lord of Cree, the ruler of the black hair, the command of His Highness Kremar , human." Afra said seriously, of course, as a child between girls and girls to make such a demeanor, can be said to be a little cute - she is really not very beautiful, but also lacks girls Innocent or feminine, the outline can be described as sharp, thin as a bloody lip, making people almost sigh the waste of the gemstones like the blue sky, the sea and the morning light. But this kind of regrettable combination, but Lehman's resentment is not so strong, she reminded him of the mother who passed away, Leona is also a woman who is more suitable for sword than flowers, but she is a Countless men are ashamed of their warriors, wise, tenacious and tough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
