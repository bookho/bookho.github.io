			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical energy released by Kreima is fiercely hitting the monster from the head of the village, and it hits the wall with the sheepskin. The white mud clods fell from the wall, and it fell off its head. The monster screamed and rushed to the second innocent it selected. It didn’t want to kill him or It is to seize him, but to confuse the identity of the two (?), so that the adventurers will be helpless in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the village chief had already been dragged a distance by a slender silver rope. He sat in a stupid position, his eyes were sluggish, and he could not see anything. I could only hear the sound, and he suddenly woke up when he touched the hot hearth when he was groping around—this is not a nightmare but a terrible reality. "The gods are on!" He wailed: "All God is on! Abby, Abby!" He called his daughter's name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his shoulder was caught by a powerful hand: "Don’t go," said a calm voice. "It's dangerous here - with me." Come, let's go outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abby!" The village chief struggled: "What about my Abby?!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is dead." Gülen ruthlessly added to the side: "The deformed monster will only keep the person who will be replaced by it in very few cases, in general," he Satisfied: "They will swallow them directly to avoid accidents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no!" The poor man shouted, he Desperately squinting, trying to drive the dark mist from his eyes: "Abby! Abby! Abby!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo Na sighed and raised her fist to give him a look. The father who lost his daughter fainted again. "Glan?" She looked at the thief hesitantly: "Which girl...when was it exchanged?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least in that bucket of milk porridge After that.” The thief said: “The evil creatures are like the bacon in the elves, and they don’t dare to be too close to Kerry’s.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is probably the worst description I have ever heard," said the Queen, who said, "Is it possible to hide the girl?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief shook his head. This awkward bastard is more docile to Leona than to Bydwin: "You also saw that the girl lives in the same room as her father, and her father is firmly in charge. She is like a bag of gold coins – most likely, she was attacked and replaced by a morphing monster when she went to the stream to fetch water. Then, as these ignorant people saw... Damn, not it. It’s them!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He refocused his attention on the monster that first became the girl Abby and then became her father. On the body, after being unable to continue to pretend to be a human man, the deformation is changed back to its original appearance, while maintaining the original shape. This monster can be as powerful as an orc, and can easily penetrate a rammed earth wall, but he is faced with a mage and the help of the elves, so when Leona talks with Gülen, It was caught even if it didn't get the chance to escape. It is well known that the deformed monsters will change shape and escape from the ropes and the shackles, but now it is not tied to it. The enchanted rope, which will stretch or shorten with the change of the deformation monster, the unlucky monster can not find even a gap if he turns himself into a bare meatball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The daughter of the village chief is one." Kerry Ben said: "There is one, it becomes the state of Gülen."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are more than 300 people in this village." Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not hard to find them as long as they can be brought together," said the elf. "The morph is not so impeccable."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it possible that only Gülen is fake?" asked Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is after that," the caster said: "It will show that it can hardly find a chance - she has been accompanied by her side." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they heard the shouts, and then a torch was thrown in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is a bit like a deja vu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" The thief shouted: "Do you want to kill your village head?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house suddenly rioted, and Birdwin bent down, grabbed the deformed monster and put it in his hand, pushed the door out and went out - but at the moment it was exposed to the light of the torch, it was deformed. It’s strange to change back to the look of the girl Abby. And screamed desperately, accusing them of killing her father. The former paladin punched the girl's face with a sharp fist before the villagers lifted the iron fork again, and the face filled with tears collapsed. The people around them were first angry and then difficult. Containing confusion and fear. Because no human face will look like that - the deformed monster can make wounds and blood when it is ready, but Birdwin’s son is coming too suddenly, and it’s like a broken nose, a cheek tear, eyes It takes time to highlight this change in detail, so what they see is a kind of yeast dough that has been beaten into a bowl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the girl's nose and mouth are still close to the smooth and soft skin - no one knows who is the first to scream. The people in front went back frantically, and the people behind them were unclear. So they fell into chaos and several people fell because they were unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet!" Boldwin shouted: "Nothing to panic, we have caught this monster! Before it kills your village chief!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what about our village chief?" asked a trembling voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is here," Liona said, the village chief is still comatose and chunky, but the king of Norman in the Highlands lifted him. Not tough: "Although it was hurt, as long as you take a good rest for a while, you can recover as you have - except his heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abby? Polly asked in panic: "If this is not her, where is she?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This we don't know," Li Aona paused. Here: "The only thing we know is that this monster changes into Abby's way to make you believe that we are a group of despicable gangsters - so that you can kill us, at least to expel us - because our companions One is an elf, and their camouflage is unable to escape the elf's eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"They," Gülen said: "At least two, one is in front of you, and the other - who told you that we are "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Checked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is he, where?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is Abby’s brother," Polly said. "He is not here!" Several other people shouted, they almost believed the words of these outsiders, because Chad told them that their father and sister had been brutally killed, and that they were a son and brother. He should not disappear at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the village chief woke up, "Where is it?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are silent, only the torch has a slight snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abby?" He stood up with the help of Baldwin and took the torch from the hands of a villager. Put it in a place very close to the deformation monster, Mars fell on the head of "Abby", showing a bad smell, the fire is the familiar, beautiful and pure face. "Abby?" he asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not here?" The singer sneered and replied: "Father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The village chief’s response was to poke the torch to its face. The place where the flame touched melted like a candle. The monster was just a sizzling sizzle. The torch was removed and the grayish translucent material began to squirm. Reverted to the original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They don't care about this," said the elf. "It takes a more subtle means to let them reveal things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please let me help you," the young man named Polly hurried out of the crowd, regardless of his mother's blockade: "Do you need a soldering iron, or something else?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." The elf suddenly unplugged his machete without warning, but one stretched out from Poli’s chest. The tentacles are faster than him. It sucked Kerry's right arm like a thick-handed whip, and even the elf couldn't bear it. The "Starlight" crossed a bright arc in the darkness and fell into a certain An unknown corner - almost at the same time, the villagers screamed more frightened, their relatives and friends and children suddenly became a terrible monster, some like a giant with scales Snakes, some like savage with a dog's head, and some have bat-like wings that jump out of the crowd. Pounce on the adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their goal is to have a mage and two women, the mage is because of his threat and women tend to be a good hostage or weakness, or they It can also become them, even if they know they are counterfeiters. But there are also a handful of people who can't wave their weapons in the face of their companions (especially women). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dazzling wall of lightning blocks the attack of a winged deformed monster, which screams like a human being, when it falls to the ground, ready to put away its own On the wings, Leona's flame-shaped sword passed over its back, and the two had no feathers. The film wings all over the cyan blood vessels slammed on the ground, and the morphous blood of the deformed splattered the king. It stood up and fiercely raised the claws to Leona, but the other one of Kremar The Thunderbolt arrow hit its chest after a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Baldwin is fighting the transgender who has changed into a gnoll, and it is as violent and dirty as a real gnoll. The former paladin had only one arm, but it did not prevent him from becoming the strongest caster. One of the barriers, his eyes are stunned, his pace is steady, his arm's muscles are beautifully bulging - he knows his flaws and skillfully uses it to set a trap that cannot be said to be unclear. The morphing monster is not stupid in the monster, it can even be said to be awkward, but it also has the common problem of evil creatures - greed, it knows that it is likely to be just a sweet bait, but it can't be rushed through several times. After Jin Wenjian's interweaving of the net, it became anxious, so when it saw a sharp flaw, it could not control itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It left a deep wound on the face that Badwin had not healed, but at the cost it left an arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worth mentioning that before this, another feature of Kremar was shrouded in the villagers who wanted to escape, invisible spiritual power hits. Their minds made them faint, and a deformed grotesque that continued to be mixed in the crowd was exposed. The monster's magic resistance is much better than that of humans, and the caster's third spell immediately catches up. This is him. The most powerful spell that can be used now - the head of the deformed monster exploded at once, and the debris splashes everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transformation that changed into a snake man fell between the thief and plum, and the priest of Fro screamed and cast a sacred impact. The white light like a knife cut off the snake's tail, which is too much of it, and the thief's surprise - so that the latter did not make up for it in time, so that the heart is entangled with plum Together, fell into a dark corner, and after the thief threw a torch there, he found two plums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look no different, even the burnt rolls are in the same position, of course, mirrored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to burn me?" A plum yelled at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill it!" shouted another plum, waving a pointed hammer with a curved tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief glanced at the previous plum, and she immediately pulled out a similar pointed hammer from her waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask me the secret that we only know!" cried after seeing Meime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
