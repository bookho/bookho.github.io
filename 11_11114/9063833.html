It’s the sky, and finally it’s not in the blue sky. Today is the last day of the spell. Every caster is exhausted. The fire elements they summoned are not as bright and bright as they were a few days ago. One or two of them are almost already with smoke. The same color, only in the position of the eyes and the claws, there is a flash of light like a charcoal fire - they are eagerly gazing at the huge obsidian disk, its center has shown a deep purple, temperature forced casting The people must retreat to a hundred feet to make themselves not burn, and its brightness can almost match the sun in the sky. The light that humans and humans can't directly look at has no effect on the fire elemental creatures. The burning energy contained in it is the most important thing for the fire elemental creatures, but they are even away from the surface pool connected to the fire element plane before their owners have cast them. Distance fingers, they can not return to their homeland, only dragged the struggling body, then draw a little bit of life energy from those that have not been swallowed Elemental Plane pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two wizards who wave their wrists, and the fire element creatures they summoned are released from the contract, which is like jumping into the fire elemental pool. But when the third mage wanted something to move, he heard a sneer, and then the two mages who still had such a little pity showed some uneasiness and remorse. If they were on the mainland, they did not act. They will be questioned and may be praised, but on the chaotic Longhuo Island, this only shows that their hearts are weak, which may lead them to become the prey of others first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third mage put his hand back into the sleeve, and the fire element creature he summoned is only a scorpion, summoned by the mage who likes the young female slave. It’s bigger, but it’s now dying. It’s just a few steps away from the obsidian disk, when Kreima’s eight-eyed spider climbed over it. It just snorted with a weak voice, and let everyone be a little surprised, I do not know when the spiders who have grown to the height of the human waist and half slammed up, and opened the mouthpiece very incomparably. I swallowed it into my stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third mage screamed, but before he did something, the spider’s eight feet stepped on the ground, leaving eight small Glossy imprint, a light blue flame spurted out at the end of the abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two masters face each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... um. Has it been lifted by you?" The owner of the cockroach asked uneasily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The soul of the opposite world said: "That is my magical pet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The fire elemental creatures that the wizard and the warlock summoned are also called magic pets, but they know that this is just to avoid the spell failure, but since this young brunette mage says this, it means that this fire elemental creature is The real one is not summoned to make sacrifices, nor is it a consumable that is used as a test material or a shield dagger, but a loyal slave who is indeed true and has a glimpse of the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world thinks about it. The current situation is probably that the two halves raised by themselves suddenly burst into the wild and swallowed the little hamsters raised by the family. Although the little hamsters are raised to run the wheel to generate electricity, they don’t mean to be friends or relatives, but you can’t say that you’re not at fault, and your second child is still yelling at him. Open the ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-eyed caster explores the Dimensional Bag in the gaze of the Master's alert, grabs a jewel and hands it to the other party - he used to be from the White Tower The gems and gold coins inherited by the Beavis mentor disappeared with the sneak of Asmodois. These are the new things that the merchants dedication, and they are the best of the purple jade in his place. The surface is called the stone or the stone of Alexander. It is like sea water in the sun, but it is like the lips of a girl under the candle at night. This gem is often used by wizards to create a rune seal that gives luck, favor, or protection. The greater the individual, the more magical energy it can contain, and the purple jade that the soul of the alien world has. The palm is so big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the "hamster" sees the hunter, and this jewel is not always available to the caster around the lord. He couldn't wait to reach out and suddenly paused in the air, like thinking of something, instead putting his hand on his lips and coughing, casting a spell to release the unlucky fire elemental creature, and then A helpless look from the black hair caster's palm jewel: "We are both clear. Lord," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world nodded, and his spider jumped into the obsidian disk almost at the same time, returning to the familiar fire element. Plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire element plane is one of the most unfriendly planes of all inner planes, but it is also extremely lively and popular, where there is no flame It’s not there, it’s different in color because of the different temperatures. It’s hard to distinguish the ground or the sky, because the whole plane is like a burning fire – if you must divide it in the conventional sense. On the ground, perhaps you can think of those gently flowing flames as so-called landing points, they show a rich blood red, that is, the kind of flame that can melt aluminum, which is the temperature in the fire element plane The lowest one, and those brighter, like a misty, like a stream of water flowing in a dark red plane and hills with a cherry red or orange flame, the temperature melts gold, silver and copper, this "water flow" In the middle, there are often shiny golden fish. Of course, they are not real fish, but a more hot flame. This kind of flame has always been the favorite of dwarves and gnomes, because cast iron and steel only have this kind of Color fire Can be cast - there are also hawthorns in the fire element plane, they are dark red at the bottom, golden in the middle, and the peak is the same as the edge of the scorpio of the plane, like white snow, no impurities in white, just look at the color, you may I thought it was cold, but unfortunately, on the contrary, its temperature is higher than the one we saw before. The edge of the sky of the fire element plane is pearl white, but most of the sky is dazzling cyan or purple. With a few slight longitudinal traces in between, it’s like someone who wiped a few times after finishing the painting... Only a few travellers will know that the flames floating in the sky can Melt the most stubborn Mithril and fine gold. The colorless parts are said to be unable to withstand the burning of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little spider vomited as soon as he jumped into the fire elemental plane. He was almost assimilated by it in a cherry red "water mooring". Its limbs have melted, and even the eyes and mouth have lost their originality. In some shapes, the little spider looked at it with concern, and waited for a long time before he heard a lazy. Slowly: "呱..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s fine, it waited for a while at that entrance, but let it down, no other Fire elemental creatures are released by their owners. It quickly walked around the lap and saw that the flame was reshaping the shape of the latter, and once again expanded the body - in the fire element plane, it does not need to be as cautious as in the main plane, now Its body has become a bit thin. But the size of the foot is thousands of feet, which makes it travel a lot faster. It took only a small amount of time to find the "person."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire element plane will gradually form various shapes of fire elemental creatures, they have the shape of the main plane creature, but the inside is still a violent element, but the temperament is simple, Straightforward and simple. If you say that you have seen a cunning or changeable fire element elf, it is very likely that it has a master. After signing a contract with a human or a humanoid, the fire elemental creature obtains the element from its owner. The most precious wisdom and experience of biology. Personality will gradually tend to their owners as time goes by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sorcerer’s fire creatures summoned by the souls of the aliens have been more and more stupid, the little spiders don’t think so, it loves Your own master, and proud of him, seriously learn every place that he feels needs to study hard, for example, other fire elemental creatures can not pretend to swallow the same kind of belly - the fire elemental creature is occasionally Will assimilate each other, sometimes a powerful one will completely devour that weak, and continue to maintain the original appearance. Where is it if the power of the two is similar, then. After assimilation, it basically changes to the appearance of another creature, but you say that you have already spit out in your stomach - this is extremely rare even in the countless years after the birth of the fire element plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain in the plane is very pocket-sized when viewed from a distance, as if it can be picked up at hand and held in the palm of your hand, but in fact. It is much larger than any mountain in the main plane. After all, the main plane has gravity. When the mountain reaches a certain height, it will collapse due to the traction of gravity. The plane of the fire element has gravity, but gravity does not affect the mountains of the flame. It has an impact, so it can stretch to the height it wants. The hills that the little spiders arrived in are still the smaller ones, but they are like a sand in the desert compared to the little spiders, but our little eight feet don’t have to worry about finding the object they are looking for. After confirming that it was probably here, the little spiders waved their cheeks and squeaked them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably only the time required to burn a city, the "person" appears. In the fire element plane, except for the fire giants and fire dwarves who are outside creatures, it is difficult to see humanoid fire elemental creatures, but if you When you see it, you'd better maintain a respect of it for 120,000 points, and don't even want to sign a contract with it. This kind of fire elemental creature can be said to be the darling of the entire fire element plane, or even one of its Incarnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world is very fortunate, the eight-footed fire creature he summoned can be said to be the best in their ethnic group, from which it can Keep yourself in the normal red flame state, and you can see one or two of the violet flame when the owner needs it, but it can't be compared with the humanoid flame. If necessary, the latter can even Extract (rather than assimilate) the energy in its body and let it completely dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it also exists much longer than the little spider, long enough to see through all the disguise and lies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember you," "She" (this is an incarnation of a beautiful female body) said: "Your master has invited me - we Dance in the starry sky of the main plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little spider agreed to knock the cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is very cold, but his heart is as warm as we are." The fire element avatar said that the sound of the elemental creatures is like a beggar or Hearing, but when the little spider heard it, the voice of the avatar was as beautiful as the scorpio, so it unconsciously took a veritable big face and almost forgot the master's entrustment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the avatar of the fire element did not forget, "Are you injured? Or too tired?" She explored a slender, shiny finger at the little spider The body was a little bit, the golden light spot infiltrated into the body of the little spider, and several pieces of fallen carapace were repaired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little spider thinks of what Creimaar wants it to do: "Hey." It said, lifting the cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a gem that has been applied with protective energy spells. The Fire Elemental creature curiously looks at it and gently pushes it with your fingertips, applying it to the gem The magic on it immediately passed a message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," the fire element avatar said: "Is your master asking you to come and report the request is this thing?" Although his request is a bit off-fire The nature of elemental creatures, but... "Even to thank that happy evening," said the Fire Elemental avatar, "Tell your master, if you can, I hope there will be opportunities to dance with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
