			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon also has a gift for Anzhen, a rocking chair that has been magically applied. When someone sits on it and touches the grape engraving of the left hand, it will shake slowly and regularly, and will play the music. Of course, it is not Demon's own method, unless he wants his son and wife to die together now, given that his spell success rate is always in a dangerous low-altitude zone. Anzhen’s father, the former lord, also had a similar chair, but its engravings were sweet peas – almost nothing related to Fro’s escaping and swaying, this seemingly ordinary The reason why magical tools are made is simply to add more convenience and fun to men and women who want to have fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a little girl’s ampoule used it as a grotesque wooden horse until the owner of the hill and the white tower was only shining I found her in the dusty attic, and he was rarely red with the cheeks covered with thick beards, and since then Ampo has never seen the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the use of the chair or after Anzhen became Demon’s wife, An Zhen showed a sneer laugh, Demon’s father and brother went After mourning the plains for less than a year, Demon seems to have completely forgotten them. He can't wait to reach a marriage contract with Anzhen, sworn to be a husband and wife, then raped her and her maid, and let the consul within ten days. The bureaucracy became the honey nest of the priests and the priests of Fro, who suspected that his chair was only occasionally attached when he customized the chair that was often used as a bed for him - if she was still a few months ago Anzhen, she will not hesitate to refuse, maybe she will smash the chair and throw it on Demon’s face, but now she just smiles with tenderness and gratitude accepts this shameful Gifts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that hard to kill the former one, it’s not too painful, the ampoules are sitting in the chair, the fingers are crossed and the protrusions are not too obvious. On the abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the shadow of a statue suddenly changes, she is not surprised at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bronze statue with twice the height and four times the width of an adult man - it is shaped by the craftsman who shaped it to give the shape of the appendage demon, the name Craftsmanship is superb, and many of the heads of the appendages are vivid, especially those human heads that have been robbed and pressed around the body of the monster. They are squinting, open their mouths, and their faces are distorted, as if they are always giving a sharp and mournful mourning. - Demon's pets sit on one of their ears, put away their tails and wings, it looks nothing, the body shrinks into a small group, dark, furry, if you don't know its true Identity, Anzhen may be willing to touch it and give it a piece of maple sugar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good evening," Asmodeos said, bowing to Angola: "My mistress and little master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen almost I can't help but smile: "Good evening," she knows, no matter what, you better not to offend a devil, so she hangs it before raising her mouth: "Amosdeos, Demon wants you What is the critical message to convey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the little devil turned its tail: "I came to see you, my mistress - - There is a deal about the last time we talked about..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never knew what we could be able to achieve between us," An Zhen said. In the case that Demon has already got your real name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," said the little devil, "Does he tell you this?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should know that Demon is not a person who is good at secrecy. It is a wonderful, wonderful, and rare experience that can demonstrate the power and wisdom of the new White Tower Archon." "Opportunity," said An Zhen. "In fact, he did not order the poet to turn this thing into a song and sing around. It is enough to surprise me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little devil skillfully cursed in the abyss, and the coldness and viciousness contained in it made An Zhen reluctantly retreat. Her hand grasped the armrest of the chair, the chair misunderstood her meaning, and the shaking stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was silent and silent, only the sound of a slight breathing of the ampoule and the sliding of her fingers on the silk skirt and fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to tell you something," Asmodeos said, "My mistress."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My real name..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thunderbolt made the first snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar and Kerry are walking side by side in the inner city of Thunderburg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still wear equipment belonging to the elves, but Kerry has set a robe of the Thunder Knights outside - silver and cyan two-color clothing Embroidered with two sideways grizzly bears on the chest, he said that he is one of the ally of Thunderbolt. Fortunately, the incomparable beauty of the elf makes him not ridiculous when wearing this wide coat, but a bit Cute; Kreima’s robe is much better, because he is a mage, his robe is pure cyan, the neckline is a secret silver badge, and the pattern is two clams surrounded by broken stone rings. Grizzly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparations for the Thunderbolt are nearing completion, and there are only a handful of stoves and fires that have been temporarily erected in the square. The men and women who are counting on the wheel are busy picking up an extraordinarily huge horn deer and split it into adults. The various parts required by the class, its internal organs were pulled out and exposed on the surface of the gray rock. The water from the well was poured onto them, the water washed away the residual blood and mucus, the liver intestines and the lungs were women. Take away, the children took away its four stomachs, its bladder and other unskilled internal organs and minced meat that could not be made into dried meat were mixed with wine and salt, stirred with blood and stuffed into a cleaned The stomach, then cooked, is also a very good meat dish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cleaning of the stomach wrapped in digestive juice and weeds is the children. They take off their shoes and pants like adults and pull the sleeves of their shirts to their shoulders. The hot work is done, the white mist that is simmering emerges from the top of their heads, body and mouth, and every inch of skin that is exposed is not able to be called normal dark red or blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smallest of them is not going well, and the biggest one is just into the chest of the people. The soul of the outside world moves his fingers - he It can make this warmer, but can he always stand here and give them the warmth that will disappear without any supplement? Obviously, no, sudden warmth may even cause damage. Although the memory is not complete, he remembers that he was only hurt by the cold at a very young age. He knew that the frostbite fingers could not be immediately put into the hot water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their father and brother? Men who work in the square have disabilities or are extremely thin. Strong men are either incorporated into the army or sent to dig trenches or add arrows and other weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This work is hard," Kerry said. "But it’s safe, and Birdwin counts the two children’s service as an adult. Rather than being neglected by other lords - they can take away hooves, claws and piecemeal fur, which is a big surprise for their families."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," said Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you like," Kerry Ben said: "I can still make them happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the souls of the outside world to ask their own questions, and the group of bloody children have answered - with their actions, they are excited when they see the wizard’s robes. I ran over, and after you pushed me for a while, the cutest little girl I chose was both shy and eager to ask if this strange mage could give them a trick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
