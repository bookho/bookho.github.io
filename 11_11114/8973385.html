			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German conceived a lot before leaving the village, for example, the caster might threaten what he did for him, or when he was in danger Being used as a barrier or bait, it is a warning to him that he is the most likely person in this team to threaten others like Mei Mei. ● Hey, the thief knows why she is going again and again, and repeatedly tries to irritate him, or wants to get rid of him by someone else’s hand. When she was in the port of Point, Gülen saw many people like her. Pastor Luo, they are not the most beautiful, youngest, most skillful and special, not qualified to go to the king, the lord or the consul; they are not willing to mix with small businessmen, civilians and craftsmen, The offering of sweet peas instead of gold gems as a sacrifice to the goddess of Fro will be rejected by the goddess. Occasionally, some of the ignorant priests are more willing to dress up with their precious jewelry silks. Will age overnight, the original healthy and beautiful teeth and hair will fall, and the skin wrinkles like a crack in the dry land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they have to find another way to accomplice with thieves is one of their usual means, they have reached a tacit agreement with the owner of the hotel, they are responsible for knocking on the door of the occupants, mixed with Mixed with the mandala's honey and himself let them fall asleep, and then open the door to let the thieves come in. Fro's pastor does not have to worry that Mask's eyes will catch them, and the thieves can save more than half of the effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few people who can refuse them. Imagine, in a dimly lit room, you are exhausted and stinking for a few days or even I haven't seen your wife and lover for months. It's not dirty and reckless homosexuality with you. It's a more disgusting and ugly animal than the former. The ears that are filled with your ears are as rough as sandpaper. Your eyes are yelling, your eyes are rusted with iron, like fishing nets or roof tiles, heavy linen clothes, unkempt beards, yellow-black teeth and curly hair on the chest. Elbows or fists fall on your nose and head, no matter who you are, when a soft, sweet voice calls you, asks you to open the door. Then he is willing to spend a good time with you. The merchants know that Fro's pastor is basically not much different from those who make a living by their bodies. They almost all welcome the face beautifully and gracefully. The leader of the death thief will never leave the victim's life tolerant unless he has the value of claiming a ransom. Or there is a red robe or a gray robe that requires experimental materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before falling into the trap of Drake and several other thieves’ guild members, Gülen also thought about collecting intelligence to see how many Fro priests Working with his subordinates Since the resources of the guild are used, the beautiful people should also give some gold coins to the guild and Mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Gülen is quite familiar with the group of youngsters with bright red tails. He believes that Mei Mi knows him as well. He is the only person in the entire team who may not be protecting but will abandon or kill her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, plum is also a hypocrite for Gülen, and the elf is always very respectful of life, and the black-haired caster Cray Mar, he is a man that Gülen can't understand, but he doesn't seem to want to kill him, and the three people have no reason to do that. Glan has been doing very well since he jumped from the wall of Thunder Castle. He thought he could wear a white robe, but Fro's pastor would not consider this when he wanted to do it. There is no reason why she should wait, she is a selfish ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan is the same, but he is not ready to kill Mei Mi for the time being, because she is so ridiculous, really, too interesting, Gülen thinks Then look at it and you may see something more memorable... Of course, after he persuaded the elf and others that he did not kill the black hair caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," he said aloud. "I don't really have it." This is something that even the thieves did not expect. He always felt that the guy in Kremar was the lucky one who survived the story of the bard, and his friend might Dead, his lover may die. His brother may die, his child (if any) may die, even his cat may die, but he certainly will not die, he will live for a long time, on a sunny afternoon. Write his adventure story with parchment and ink in a glass-encrusted copying room, or in his tower, tell the whole story to the bright-eyed elementary schoolers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves also arranged their death order, he will be after the plum, this is inevitable, even if the hypocritical former Paladin is willing to protect her, This damn world has never been protected by who you want to protect; then it is Byrdwin, a paladin who has lost the grace of God, a rebellious monarch, a value (according to the thief’s estimate) of tens of thousands of gold coins. Rewarding the goal, he is like a never-falling star that attracts everyone's attention; after that, he is not sure if he is still Kerry, if the black hair caster really loves his friend as seen on the surface, Then the death must be a thief, and vice versa, but the Master should be the last step into the mourning of the wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that he is so gone, disappeared, how do you want the thieves to deal with the current situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gülen runs along the edge of the swamp, and the deadly poisonous mist is as gentle as the female's arm, entangled in his ankles, and as soon as he stops, they will swarm, but the swamp is not tight. Not expanding slowly, regardless of whether Gülen is looking forward or backwards, only the duckweeds that are as thick as silk carpets are seen, they will be slightly ups and downs, and sometimes, with the sharp eyes of thieves He could also find a trace of broken pieces, and the black cockroaches spread slowly. He didn't want to know what kind of creatures were hidden inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves gave him little to drink, and Gülen didn’t want to use his body to test whether the toxicity of the fog was strong enough to kill an agile The thief, he poured the last bit of honey into his throat, carefully sealed the bottle into his own skin, and set foot on his way back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, how do you want to deal with the current situation?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thousands of miles away, the same person asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am prepared to negotiate with the fine network." An Zhen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants whispered a question in amazement, but Anzhen just waved his hand. "I have thought about it for a long time. Only this method can give us a chance to breathe." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand," said the leader of the former silk guild, who is the most desperate of several people. He has nothing at all, and he doesn't care what he loses any more: "Your husband Demon is the collaborator of the guild. He is just sweet about the guild. They will never negotiate with you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s right." The leader of the wine guild echoed: "They want to replace us all. Only Demon can do it. Do you want to give up on us?" "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to give up anyone," said An Zhen. "But if you really want to fight atrocities with atrocities, the White Tower will usher again. A catastrophe and, everyone. I can wait, until Demon is dead, I already have a heir, can you? You can still stand the squeeze, your caravan can still be at yours How long does it take to master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So is the result not the same?" The leader of the wine guild said unhappy: "I am so funny. I don't want to hear this here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We should probably listen to the views of the lord," said the leader of the jewellery guild, his brows were as tight as wrinkles, but his situation did not make him too chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go your egg," the leader of the wine guild retorted angrily: "Yes, you still have a son in the fine net guild In preparation for becoming a thief, your nephew is still full, but my warehouse is empty and can host a contest in it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Antonio Master raised his hand and made a gesture, so none of the three could speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Talk about it," said the highly respected old mage and said, "Your thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I need them to make concessions," An Zhen said. "I don't think they want a crushing white tower. I will show my strength. Maybe they are not enough to fight a thief who has planned. The guild, but I promise that they will suffer a lot of damage. The person in charge of the White Tower will be responsible for the heavy burden he can't afford."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "They will assassinate you," Rosada’s chief pastor said: "And then Demon can inherit all your powers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I The territory will belong to my son, Demon is only my husband. The consul of Baita."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the child reaches adulthood, his power belongs to Father's," said Master Antonio. "And if Demon wants to get everything faster, he will kill his son, he will be the only one. "Man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can't do it." An Zhen said with confidence: "My child will be protected by a reliable and powerful hand. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who's?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and Rosada's followers." Ann I watched the old mage, then the chief pastor dressed in a white robe: "If they really kill you as you expected, then you will be in the name of the real master of the White Tower and the Hill." I am calling the Avengers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the jewellery guild swayed his hands, and the Master took a snap and lifted the little spell. He took a heavy breath. I can’t wait to ask: “Don’t we ask for help from Tell or other respectable gods now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Tyre respects laws and decrees,” said the Master. “The White Tower’s governor is Demon, and even Anzhen cannot veto his orders.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chief priest of Rosada agreed that the white robes of Tyre and Rosada often work together. They are familiar with each other. The followers of Rosada have the same concerns, so they can only open. The sanctuary, making potions, distributing food, sheltering the helpless civilians and slaves as much as possible, but not directly arguing with the thieves' guild. If they find conclusive evidence of their blasphemy, or they are mixed with evil. The gray robe and the red robe are another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really ridiculous." The leader of the wine guild said slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But as far as I know," Rosada’s chief pastor said: "Your son is under strict protection." He euphemistically said, but everyone Demon, of course, would not know nothing about it. He allowed An Zhen to be with the children, but he also sent a small devil, Asmodeos, to monitor her every move, and live in Anzhen. In and out of the tower, the thieves of the guild also peeked at the freedom that he gave Anzhen to a certain extent, allowing her to walk in the White Tower, but the child's territory was confined to the tower, in his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An芮 smiled and picked up his sleeve from the south, and the cumbersome lace cuffs covered almost half of the skirt, which also made her well hidden. A puppies? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first response was Antonio Master: "The gods are on," he shouted in a rage: "You used this spell in one." Baby! He doesn't have the wisdom of an adult. Do you know how much chance he will have a dog for the rest of his life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan knows he will be suspected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that's the truth." He spread his hands and said with a wry smile: "The swamp swallowed him all at once, and I didn't even have a chance to hug him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar is a young man." Birdwin said: "For the elf, it is just a child, but he is not the first straight "Danger," he said solemnly. "Is it. Kerry Ben?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
