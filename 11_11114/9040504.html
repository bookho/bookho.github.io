Thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honor," the gnome said with respect: "We have checked this arm in detail, but we need to know that your guests need What kind of arm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ninth son cast his gaze to the black hair caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It depends on how much you can do." Kerry Ben said that the soul of the outside world nodded, and the gnomes, dwarves and elves were good at it. Exquisite and ingenious production, but the elves' production is biased towards nature and harmony. They use stone, vines and fallen trees to build houses, furniture and other supplies, or use their own hair and bird feathers. But almost all of these leathers come from aging and demonized beasts. The jewels and weapons they create are exquisite and simple, like a clear water or a moonlight; the dwarves live in thick mountains. All day long and hard and rough rocks and flames of the melting furnace, their works are naturally also closely related to their breath - their jewelry style, rough lines, weapons are thick and solid, and occasionally there will be women Dwarves forge beautiful bows or short swords, but as long as they can observe and touch, they will not confuse them from the elf products anyway, even if there are no dwarfs. All kinds of engraving, because the dwarves' weapons are almost all metal, including the string of the bow. In some places where silk and fur are needed, they use a wire that is thinner than a hair and thin as morning light. The foil is replaced - the gnome has the same preferences, no one will mistake the gnome's products as dwarfs, and the gnome's products always tend to be luxuriant without restriction. The things that go out through their hands are even small. Jewelry, also engraved with complex patterns, set with precious stones (cheap or expensive, if allowed), has the maker's figure in the secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They differ from the dwarves in that they create tiny bodies that the dwarves disdain and those that are used for everyday purposes. They are keen to combine their products with magic, the most well known of which is the rune plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are many, adults." The gnome, who has three full laps of necklaces than his companions, said, "Look at what you need. The easiest - We can use hollow steel @≦style_txt; make an arm for him, or use wood to engrave it, and use leather arm sleeves to fix it on him, so that as long as he puts on his clothes, put on Gloves, no one will find that he has lost one hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Baldwin responded, the soul of the opposite world shook his head first. If it's just this, they don't have to run to Longhuo Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So." The gnome said: "We may also use silver to make this arm, which has several reels and bearings installed, just open the switch, wrist The joints can be turned and the fingers can be opened or clenched," he grabbed Baldwin's arm and rudely squeezed it like the end of an albino dolphin's head, cured by healing potions and time. The skin has already wrapped the bare bones and muscles. It was smooth, like never having ever grown a hand, the gnome slid up and shouted his nose to sniff the smell. With a snoring voice, while he couldn't understand anyone, Baldwin frowned slightly, resisting the urge to throw the guy who couldn't reach his navel from the head of the hall to the other end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But when the arm is fixed, it hurts a bit." The gnome said, "Because we have to make holes in the bones and nail them together." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing better?" Leona asked - what they expected was that Baldwin could still be a knight. Rather than a craftsman who swings a hammer and axe by force alone or a farmer who sways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said the gnome: "The secret silver arm of the Mithril, constant magic, it will stretch out from the inside and the part that has not completely died." Connected - If the material is pure enough and the magic applied to it is strong enough, you can even feel the slightest change of whatever is passed to that arm, from temperature to stress, you can post it Any command, use it as you like, wield a sword or pick up a spoon, even if you let it sculpt a cheese rose, you will find it more than a real, fleshy arm. With your heart, but you don't worry that it will be poisoned, injured or cut off again - at least not as fragile as your original arm." He lifted his body again and held Baldwin with nothing to do. Broken arm, "Of course, when you connect them together, you will feel very painful, unlike ordinary silver arms, which hurt deep into the bone marrow and are very long."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can build This arm? "Asked Liao Na, she does not look warm Byrd knew he would choose that kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," said the gnome, a faint glow in his eyes: "But it's not me, it's us, you need the East Crown." The most refined and intelligent gnomes on the island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honor," the gnome said with respect: "We have checked this arm in detail, but we need to know, your guests.

In some places where silk and fur are needed, they use a wire that is thinner than a hairline and a foil that is as thin as a morning light. The gnome also has the same preferences. No one will misidentify the gnome's products. Dwarf, gnome products are always infinitely inclined to luxury, even if they are just a small ornament, they will be engraved with complicated patterns, inlaid with precious stones (cheap or expensive, if Allowed), there is a builder's drawing number in the secret place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are different from the dwarves, and they will create tiny organs that the dwarves disdain with those items that are used for everyday life, and are keen to bring them The product is combined with magic.

The gnome slid up, shouted his nose and sniffed the smell, snoring, and while he couldn’t understand, Birdwin frowned slightly, resisting the guy who couldn’t get his navel from the column. The impulse of the head of the hall was thrown at that end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this kind of arm will hurt when it is fixed," said the gnome.

At the end of the department, after healing the potion and time, the skin has already wrapped the bare bones and muscles. It is smooth, just like never having ever grown a hand.
