The gnolls in the cold highlands of Norman indeed Not common, but they will appear in every place with fresh flesh and blood. In the spring after the end of the battle with the orcs, the soldiers of the Thunderbolt should be alert to whether the werewolves will plunder the villages and settlements while they are recuperating. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or forced to come over." The pastor around them said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much can you see?" A knight asked, the priest was still young, not long after leaving the mentor, but the god she followed was not someone else. Su Lun, and today is the full moon, Su Lun's pastor can pray to the ancient goddess to gain Superman's vision, insight and intuition, which allows her to still see the fire in the Blizzard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not less than three hundred." The priest said calmly: "It’s just a sentinel and a striker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I have smelled the troll and the orc's stench." The Cavaliers said, "Prepare to raise the fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf will not fear the glare But the bright light does not match their preferences. The Normans entangled the flannel and fine cotton on the pine branches, and then immersed them in the thick grease. Once lit, the light of the torch can shine to two. A hundred steps away, like the sun-like light spread on the snow-covered wasteland, illuminating the shadows that could only be said to be shadows. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolves are taller than humans, but their bodies look very thin, their heads are a dog head full of grayish yellow or earthy gray hair. The eyes are full of red blood red, and most of the wolf's mouths are not close together. The saliva condenses in the lower jaw and freezes into a turbid small icicle. When walking, they habitually stalk the front and bend their backs. The animal's femur or stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the fire was shining, all the Normans shouted, not only yelling, but also slamming their feet, the hail of the werewolf Quite simply, if the number of enemies far exceeds them, they will escape. Now there are more than 6,000 Normans and only three hundred relatives. The problem is that these disgusting guys just hesitated for a while. And he rushed up in desperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them there are things that are more terrible than humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of humans is far more than them, but they don’t have too many weapons. The spears and daggers are the only ones they can’t throw them out. Killing the enemy, the soldiers climbed the top of the car with their spears - they all have the experience of dealing with the gnolls, the gnolls will use weapons like humans, but because few gnolls know how to buy and sell, they won’t Using swords, so their weapons are very simple, but the strength of the gnolls can make up for this disadvantage, and when they lose their weapons and are unarmed, some fledgling mercenaries and adventurers will think they have lost their damage. The power of others has become negligent, but I don’t know if this is the most dangerous time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gnoll man bites its weapon, a femur that does not know what animal, in the mouth, sticking out the limbs with long, curved nails Just one jump jumped onto the axle of the carriage, its claws were deeply embedded in the carriage of the carriage, and the cowhide of the carriage was immediately torn open, revealing the thick and heavy snow and ice - this is the Urman emergency collection and stacking If you get up, otherwise, the jackal can easily get into a carriage, then wear it out and jump into the crowd. A sharp spear descends from the sky, from behind its ear roots - here is almost the weakness of all creatures, it stabbed straight in, and when it was pulled out, the stinky blood smashed into the gray snow and formed a A bizarre and uncomfortable picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier greeted another gnoll with almost no breathing time. This gnoll was taller than its counterpart and looked not so thin. Thin, and wearing iron armor - although incomplete, but also shows that it has a certain position in the ethnic group - the soldiers and his companions work together against it, its weapons are just a stone, and even a leader it It was also a gnoll who did not understand martial arts. When it screamed that he wanted to knock out the bone marrow of one of the soldiers, the second spear pierced its claws, and its weapon fell from the top of the carriage, but this It’s not the end. The gnolling roars and lowers the body. The forelimbs are almost close to the top of the car. The hind paws catch deep marks on the ice and snow. It licks their teeth and slams and tears like a real beast. The bite and scratching, the soldier who pierced its claws was only negligently rolled up by the carriage and fell to the ground. He thought that he would have to die this time, but he could not trace his life as legendary. All his attention focused on the stench of dirty mouth goes, he will be able to see which one half of the missing teeth Gnoll shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the next moment, the light suddenly returned to his vision, the dog’s head kept his mouth open and flew out, pressing his paw Suddenly, the power was lost. A foot in a steel shoe kicked the corpse of the gnoll from the soldier. The soldier was thanked in the future and was pulled in by his companion from the open gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights were allowed to take their swords and chains, but in the battle with the gnolls, they were not the main force, because they knew that there were enough 5,000 wolves to swallow their bodies behind the gnolls. The driver and the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizards checked their own pockets, and the cast materials were almost monopolized by Dylan’s mages. They could only be themselves before they swore allegiance to Dylan. Collecting the cast materials, on the verge of winter, they are hard to get even rose petals and cobwebs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is your spell preparation?" an orc asks, he has been mingling with humans all the year round, and he is very close to humans in dressing and terminology. The priest's attitude was not as respectful as the people on the whistling plain. The priest glanced at him viciously. "You can see it right away." He stopped talking, but kneeled down and prayed earnestly, and he leaned his thin arms toward him. When it’s dark, it’s like coming from a mourning wilderness, or a more cold and sharp wind that makes the former orc can’t help but take a step back, but it’s a small step, but it’s already made a big error. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp arrow pierced the priest’s eyes, and an arrow of magical light shone from his hindbrain, but the orcs did not have to worry about being mistaken for this error. The living sacrifice, because the arrow almost violently exploded when the priest returned to the beast, the scope of the explosion spread to the surrounding 20 feet, even the land under the snow was smashed, together with the dirty The flesh and blood splashes are everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as humans don’t know when the wolves and orcs arrived, the gnolls and orcs don’t know when the elves and the white robes arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of the reinforcements is far better than the quantity. The elves of the silver-crowned jungle are not the young children who have just returned from the tour, but the old people who have attacked the orcs with Baldwin and Kerry, and even two of them have gone through a thousand years ago. The violent baptism of the Holocaust, those white robes - not Tyre, the priests and paladins of Rosada, and the human rangers who often wandered in Norman and the whistling plains, except for the elves, they all should be Leo Na’s invitation came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope we didn't come too late!" an elf shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are late from the future!" A knight answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People burst into laughter, they have to fight against countless enemies, but then how they know they must be able to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We lost three hundred twenty-four soldiers, "Ya Daier said:." there are fifteen knights and six hundred civilians "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" once compared with the previous, this ratio It’s already very low.” Xiu said, took a small piece of paper rolled up from Yadel’s hand and burned it on a whale candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale sighed, "Fortunately, we have three more mages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; & nbsp; "how much is left now Fort Thunder soldiers, knights and mages?" <br /> <br & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "there are seven Master - if what you say is our Master , but they have already sworn allegiance to Dylan," said Yadel. "As for the soldiers, there are only about 10,000 people. The knight... I don't know the exact number, but if they want to stay, they must also be to Di. .. London's knees "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" maybe that's good, "Xiu said:" I can hardly imagine the double walls of the Fort Thunder Master floated only a few . stupid scene "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; even if Ya Daier nearly a thousand hearts being heavy pressure of life, can not help but to this virtual scene to reveal a brief smile:" Di It will not be allowed, and it is too ugly. It is said that even Grenada has millions of soldiers and knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The idea of ​​Dylan Donkley might be to let Norman, at least Reyenburg become the second Grenada," said Shu, and then they were silent for this terrible idea. For a moment: "I think we need to pray, I hope he can seriously study their practices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repair may be to make the atmosphere a little lighter, but Apparently his words had the opposite effect. Yadel smiled. He walked behind the table and sat down. His fingers touched the table. A translucent miniature side island appeared in front of them. "We are going to accept 5,000 people. . "he said:" let's see, we should put them somewhere "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" I would think this is a good opportunity, "came to repair. Staring at the model of the side island: "I mean your nephew, now we can't send him back to the Temple of Fro, but we can hand him over to a new Norman family. A family who also has blonde hair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbs;"The key is that his facial features are too refined." Yadel said with distress, the Normans certainly have blonde hair, but when they were children, they already showed the roughness of the northern clan, putting the son of An Zhen Inside, it was like putting an egg in the kiwifruit, which was too conspicuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The boy certainly can't," said the repairer: "But the girl can, let him get more sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He will hate you," said Yadel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just made a suggestion," said a serious man. "The final decision is of course you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the anti-theft section - modify the update within an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We lost 324 soldiers," Yadel said. "There are fifteen knights and six hundred civilians."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ratio is already very low compared to the previous one." Xiu said, took the rolled up small note from Yadel's hand and placed it in the cetyl wax. Burn it on the candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale sighed, "Fortunately, we have three more mages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; & nbsp; "how much is left now Fort Thunder soldiers, knights and mages?" <br /> <br & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "there are seven Master - if what you say is our Master , but they have already sworn allegiance to Dylan," said Yadel.
