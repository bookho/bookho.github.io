			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Menro Priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man asked in astonishment, as if he did not expect I will meet a Rosada priest here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menro smiled slyly, this street is full of pubs and hustle and bustle, Rosada’s pastor just can’t get married, but don’t need to guard, but rarely Need to use money in exchange for this service - many girls or women are willing to have a little affair with Rosada's pastor, if a Rosada priest goes to call *妓, it is undoubtedly to announce everyone He has lost the charm that makes women convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a pastor will not only be ridiculed by everyone, but also be despised by his companions, and may be suspected of his lack of piety about Rosada’s faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monroe vaguely finds an excuse, like to treat a poor cockroach for free or to teach the rotten drunkards, and that The man did not listen to what he was saying. He grabbed the priest's vain arms and took him into a pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and held a gold coin between his fingers. The pub owner immediately pushed the person around and ran over: "Sir," he bowed. "Respectable gentleman, what do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood wine, honey wine," the man said: "Give us a big plate Roast lamb or beef, the sooner the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monroe’s eyes are always staring at the gold coin, when it disappears in the hands of the boss The priest involuntarily reveals the feeling of regret: "The wine and the meat can't be used so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the gold coin," the gentleman said: "I still have A lot." He threw a heavy bag, and the crisp crash made Monroe take a deep breath, as if he could smell the lovable metal smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, please," he stammered and asked, "Who are you?" He suspects that there is another priest named Monroe. And that person just admits the wrong person, otherwise, like a mediocre and incompetent guy, how is it worth the wine and meat of a gold coin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Adel's brother Demon." Demon said, his eyes flashed in the shadow of the hood: "I just want to ask my brother. In the sanctuary, because I can't go in and see him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," Monroe nodded disappointingly, and he didn't want to hear Yadel's name a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine and the roast lamb are coming up, the honey is very sweet, very pure, the tavern owner sees no sugar and apple on the gold coin. The fake mixed wine, the lamb with the hoof, said that it is not pretending to be a cat or a dog. Monroe has not tasted such a delicious food for a long time, he took a big drink from the wooden cup, and then could not wait The fingers were inserted into the muttonous mutton, and the skinned strips burned his teeth, but he had no idea of ​​waiting. What a sweet and tender barbecue, with the unique smell of mutton Children, sprinkled with powder of black pepper and red pepper, each bite has a rich fat into the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menro made up his mind, no matter what Yadel’s brother wants to ask, he has to think slowly and slowly answer, so he has to drag the time to him. I can't eat it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Master called Demon does not seem to be in a hurry. He is drinking a cup of honey tea leisurely. The question asked is very simple, and there is nothing for outsiders. Knowing the content, such as the recent physical condition of Yadell, where his holy book is recited, or has already sang a few songs and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After drinking the fifth glass of honey, the roast lamb is also eating behind the 708, Monroe can't help but ask a stupid question: "Why don't you go?" Ask your brother? The answer to these questions, he may be much clearer than I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He refused to say," the Master made a gesture: "Maybe it's a bit shy, it's something else. He thinks his beliefs are not pious enough, so he refuses to provide any information about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faith? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my father is going to let him become the chief pastor within five years." The Master said in an understatement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Monroe, even a blue sky beating on the head won’t make him even more shocked: “Director Pastor!” He stood up Up, the raised belly flipped over the wooden table, the slag of the mutton was sprinkled everywhere, the wooden cup flew out and turned over to a mercenary, and Monroe did not pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Director Pastor!" He repeated it again: "He is only 19 years old and only twenty-four years old after five years!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rosada likes young people," Demon said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menro still wants to say something, but the mercenary who was splashed with a honey wine has come over and fiercely patted his own scabbard The priest's back - this move can be said to be very polite, Monroe put on a black cloak when he came out, covering the white robes belonging to the priest, if no one is sitting next to him, used to beat His possibility is not the scabbard but the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apologize to my friend," the Master said in a timely manner, once again throwing a gold coin into the busy tavern boss, "please drink alcohol, The drunken man added a plate of lamb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who heard this sentence all cheered, the mercenary looked up and down the mage Retract the scabbard and return to its position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menro found out that he was in trouble, Rosada’s pastor lost his soul and sat back on his chair. The meat he just ate was like alive. Twisted in his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he does not want to be the chief pastor. If he can, he can sit in that position as early as ten years ago, but he still can’t help but want Hey, Yadell, this favorite teacher, young, beautiful, full of charm, the girls around him, he will become the chief pastor in five years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too unfair, Monroe bit his teeth, his eyes are hot and wet, he thought it was the wine splashing inside, rubbing with his fingers It was only when I found out that it was tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new honey wine comes up, too sweet, sweet bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry, I am surprised," he heard the brother of Yadel said: "I thought this thing is well known - especially in Rosada. "The sanctuary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't know." When he said this, Monroe's heart was like being shackled. "So, this is a foregone conclusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be no more accidents," Demon said. "My father loves him." Son, he looks as heavy as an eyeball."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monroe swallowed and tried to make his voice no longer so dry: "So say... then," he snorted: "He is really lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master sighed: "Yes, he is very lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menro can’t remember that after that he How much wine he drank, he wanted to forget everything, forget the wrinkled face, forget Yadel, forget the sanctuary, forget Rosada, forget all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least tonight..." He sobbed, and soon the priest found himself lying in the clouds, and he attributed it to honey. - The cloud with a fragrant scent, and a soft arm, holding a cold silk to wipe his forehead - Monroe opened his eyes sharply, he did not lie on the dirty and damp street like him, he I saw the rosy silk crepe, layered on top of his head, in the middle of a pink fluorite inlaid in a silver bracket, giving the whole room a ray of light - the wall covered with cedar There is also a silk carpet - the ground is covered with bearskin and sheepskin, and fresh sweet peas are scattered everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this?" He asked, he had to say that he had met in this room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fro's Temple." A sweet voice rang behind him, and Monroe discovered that he was not lying in the clouds, but a young woman. , flexible chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Monroe almost climbed up in panic: "The god of morning light is on," he shouted. "I only have two silver coins!" According to Fro's teachings, only one silver coin is needed for every fun, but as long as it is a man, there is no expensive little gift and other rewards, and Fro's look will not look at you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice stopped when he saw the woman - she was so beautiful, her skin was like a flashing alabaster, and she rolled up The long brown hair is dotted with vermilion sweet peas and carved brown wood combs. The neck is like a swan, and the slender limbs are like deer or horses. The eyes are like round and big amber. The indigo-eyed eyes are full. Provocatively provoked, almost no shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought it was the place of the cloud, and her hips were so full, smooth, and flawless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
