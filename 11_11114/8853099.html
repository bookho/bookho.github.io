			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bison that the buffalo, the horn deer and the orc drag together looks more like a hill made of rough wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trailer stopped at a distance of about five hundred feet from the wall of Thunder, and the orc and human artisans began assembling the wood of various shapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can let our soldiers go to war." Birdwin said that he is not talking about the soldiers of Thunder, but those who are kings and other places. The prisoner sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were removed from the collar and shackles in the past few days, eating meat, onion soup and less black bread, and Bydwin took it out. Their own savings, equipped them with clothes, armor and long swords - although many people think that this is not necessary, but for Baldwin, they are also his soldiers, even if they are not willing will not be grateful he. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A commander read the Order of the King’s Order in accordance with this syllabus, as we said before, as long as they can complete their tasks, they can Was pardoned of past sins. Even if they die, their families can get a small pension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoners’ faces are not very happy, and some of them may not be so sinful, but more often they have been involved in theft, robbery and The murderous thieves and assassins, some of them are members of the guild. They certainly don’t know anything about the brutality of the orcs and the half-orcs, and they have only faced one or two, at most ten orcs, but now they are There are hundreds of them to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they have no chance or ability to resist or escape. Although they have weapons, the real soldiers have been closely monitoring them with their crossbows. Every move, they grabbed the ropes hanging from the mouth of the chest wall and slid down the walls one by one. There were many smart guys who wanted to win the last trace of life with pleadings and lies, but the soldiers were already familiar with it, so when they were brown-haired When the prisoner screamed hoarsely that he saw a person who could prove his innocence, they just silently pointed the spear of his spear to his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Gülen!" he shouted as he was pushed down the wall, shouting desperately: "Mage, I am Gülen! Thieves Gülen ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not snow, he will be broken, and the thief Gülen will climb up hard, and the "companion" around him will sneer, his chest is pouring Moving with burning resentment and hatred. But he soon didn't have time to think too much—the soldiers on the wall dropped the torches and fired arrows, silently urging them to embark on the road to death as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mixed hybrid with obvious orc descent picked up the torch. It was a bundle of soaked pine branches. Even if it was thrown into the snow, it still didn't go out. He picked it up and ran forward, shouting loudly. In the Orc language, when he approached them, he also dropped the sword and the torch on the ground. He kneeled down to his own people and extended his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you are at the forefront are some adult orcs, they are shorter than adult orcs, and they are thinner. After all, they are only humans in the tribe. The slaves are a little better - they have been hungry for a while, and they used the broth and the blood of the winter wine to temporarily deceive their stomachs before the battle, but now it is preparing to provoke the riots. They did not hesitate to pounce on the self-disarming hybrid, the poor ghost, he is taller than the two half-orcs, but his wildness has long been washed clean in the human soft wine bedroom. He also wore shirts and trousers like humans, and he wore boots. When the Orc soldiers rushed over to him, he just widened his eyes in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His encounters caused several prisoners who had fantasies about the orcs to lose their last hope. They turned and cried and slammed the walls until they were The human arrow shoots through, "Death as a human being." Thunderbolt soldiers screamed coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoners were forced to return to face the orcs - under the pressure of humanity, they waved their torches and pulled out their swords, which is better than ordinary people. They almost all have the experience of using weapons and killing people. The equipment of the half-orcs is slightly inferior—they have no clothes and armor, they can only resist the sharp blade by wrapping the fur-coated fur. Their weapons are varied. From the bone spear to the rusted dagger, there are only a few pieces that can pierce the hard armor - its outer layer is linen and cotton, and the inner layer is inlaid with iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the half-orcs also have the advantage that prisoners do not have, that is their strength and claws, they throw off the broken weapons, just like the wasteland The wild wolf jumped up and threw the enemy, then let his teeth penetrate his neck or use his hind paws to tear their stomachs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German inserted the torch directly into the throat of a half-orc, but his back was attacked by another half-orc, and his claws pierced him. Skin and muscles - as a thief, he is good at daggers and noose, but he can also let a long sword taste enough blood - he reverses the sword, pricks out from under his arm, in the sword When the tip encountered obstacles, he pressed the long sword's lead-throwing ball and let it go up. "Continue, baby, continue." He groaned in his heart, while exhausting his body's strength to arch his back - half-orc before death Crazy scratching and biting, his entire upper body became bloody, but no fatal wounds, no, he endured, not screaming to attract the attention of other orcs, while holding his tight The enemy, rolling, like the warm body, can still fight with him, and finally he let the dead half-orcs cover him, like a layer of stinky blanket - he is The dead half-orc eagerly stretched out his hands to dig snow and dirt Until himself completely buried inside - thanks guild taught him everything he ever thought this skill quite useless, but fortunately he eventually studied very carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not foolproof. The orcs have sharper eyes and noses than humans, or there are orcs and humans who still see him in chaos. Gülen doesn’t feel that the so-called “companions” will allow him to live alone. But he can only do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow and mud surrounded Gülen, his skin is so painful in every inch of his skin, he reserved a small nest for himself, which is stored The air on which humans depend, but this does not last long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lives of two hundred prisoners were exchanged for two small slings and one The destruction of the drills, they were burnt - the battle between the sinners and the half-orcs continued. Although Baldwin did not agree with the practice of the king, he must admit that he loves his people more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the orcs still assembled two giant trebuchets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the wheels," Birdwin said: "I saw the trebuchet with wheels for the first time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two mage apprentices stand on the busy orc side, holding cardboard and pen in their hands, they are not responsible for labor and combat, only responsible for testing and recording, after all, this giant trebuchet is still the first Once they are officially put into the battlefield, they must write down each of its merits and shortcomings that need to be improved, as well as the areas to be aware of when assembling and using it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bracket of this giant trebuchet looks like two equilateral trapezoids, the strips are x-shaped cross-supported, and an a-shaped pulley frame stands on Above the throwing arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if a pulley is used, it takes 40 orcs to work together to lift the throwing arm to pull up the balance of 13,000 pounds - It is a lead block that is fixed at the rear end of the throwing arm. They are combined with a throwing arm cut from a whole masson pine, like a wooden pen with a weird nut - throwing arm and x-shaped The joints of the brackets are specially added with huge wooden blocks sandwiching them, and the outer layers are wrapped with iron hoops and rivets, so that the weakened trunks are folded into two halves after the first throw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc human craftsmen carved hundreds of two hundred and fifty pounds to three hundred pounds of stone balls, they rolled to the ground, the color is gray, like It is a skull of a personal class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
