			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro is dead, Gülen is saying this to himself, and this is what he said to Mei Mi, but there is still a certain uncertainty in the depths of their hearts. But not long after, a happy news broke away the clouds that hovered in their hearts - Mei Mi had their children, he was still small, and the plum abdomen was still flat and smooth, but Mei Mi could I feel that there is a new life hidden there. His heartbeat is like the tides sweeping her mind. Is this the feeling of happiness? She thought, it tasted like honey, and that sweetness is so pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not continue to reject Gülen’s proposal, they must form a marriage contract to ensure that the child will not be born out of wedlock, Gülen and Plum In the same way, they are not born under the orthodox marriage. Their births are sinful and superfluous, but they will never let their children fall to this point. They have considered it for a long time. Fro once had a marriage priest, but How, they will not choose the goddess that has been scorned by people, and Fro has ceased to exist, she can not bless their marriage, even if it is more, it will only be a curse of anger; then, Perhaps the only thing that can be considered is the god of the earth, and the god of the birth and marriage, but others may not know, can Glan and Plum still not know the mystery? They wanted to pray and sacrifice to the wide-ranging Jammu, but the priests of the greek priests had long noticed them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, I want to congratulate you." Drake said that he poured a glass of blood wine on Gülen, I don’t know when, even Azores It started to pop up this stinky drink, and Gülen rubbed his eyebrows and pushed the glass away: "You can say what you want to say, Drake," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you are very strong now," Drake said. "But based on a friend’s position, I think I still want to remind you that there is something about you. Some thoughts, Gridy's red robe pastors are very upset, dear, they are even annoyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just a small marriage covenant. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly the case," Drake said bitterly. "So why not put your hands on the altar of Grei?" The red-breasted daughter-in-law will be pleased. They are not the priests like the serfs in the sanctuary. They are power, wealth, intelligence, and Gülen, who have lost their favor, my dear friend, even you. If you can beat the wizard, the warlock or the whole army, you will still find it difficult, but with their help, you will find that it is as easy as you can cut the butter with a red knife, and they No need for your soul or unborn child, just one Ceremony, get the ewe's ewe or the doe, the horses can, they are not picky - you know how many women on the island of Azores got one or more children in front of the respected goddess Don't tell me that you don't want it, I know that you love your wife, then you should know that all the mothers who sacrificed to Greedy will not be dystocia or give birth to a disabled or dead baby?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan’s heart slammed a bit. If you want to say that he and Mei Mi have anything to worry about, this is probably the case. Like other Fro priests, plum honey has a body that is not suitable for pregnancy and production. Her slender waist and narrow pelvis are destined to be difficult for her to give birth as easily as the thick peasant women. Before being driven out of the Temple of Fro, I have seen several unfortunate pastors of Froo dying because of production. Sometimes their children can survive and sometimes die in their mother's stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to think about it." Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be like this," Drake said. "You know who I am talking to. They don't face you directly. I don't want to get an ambiguous answer. They just want to let you know that Greed's patience has always been very fragile, and your wife, the future wife, is now just a pregnant woman, and you should not let her face the dangers that should not be there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan's submission is in Drake's expectation. To be honest, the captain of the Golden Lady does not understand why Gülen is so worried. The power of Grein is obviously stronger than other gods. When women want children, they can ask for help to nourish everything, but the process is very slow and long. Many poor women do not get results. Dead or abandoned, but Gree is not, as long as you offer enough sacrifices, good enough, the process of sacrifice is cruel enough - for example, the ewe is less effective than the doe, the effectiveness of the doe It is lower than the cow, but if it is a pregnancy Woman, then her effect is greater than the sum of the first three; you can ask the priest to cut the neck of the sacrifice directly with a knife, but if you can dig their own heart sacrifice, it is better, or you can The mother's child dug out, pinched its eyes, and placed it on the plate with her mother. This wonderful scene will undoubtedly greatly please the beautiful belly goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Gülen and Mei Mei didn't want was to be related to the goddess, even if Gülen is now establishing a secret covenant relationship with her descendants, but as Drake said, he already has Choosing Jianjian Port means that his life cannot be calm and gentle. His enemies are too many. They don’t need to add the priests of Gredi. They are more dangerous than any assassin, and since Griffith It can be said that other women can give birth to children smoothly, and it is hard to say whether she will be furious because of the contempt of Gülen and Mei Mi. They are worried not only about children but also Mei Mi’s life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————————————————————<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Meimei and Gülen joined forces to kill the first ewes on the altar of Grei, on the other island, they also bear the children and A woman who lives her own life sits quietly in a room built by the Normans of the Highlands. Unlike the houses of the Dragon Fire Island, their walls and roofs are made of sea sand and gum. Made of brickwork, this building material looks extremely rough and does not fit well in the hot climate of the Dragon Fire Island because its doors and windows are narrow, but the original intention of it was not for comfort, but It is for safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ji’s eyes closed, like praying, but they didn’t believe in any gods for a long time, she just listened to the outside voice, In the first few days, she couldn’t hear anything except the waves slamming the rocks, the insects screaming, the birds flapping their wings and the footsteps of the servants, but when she crossed the seventh trace of the disappearance of the sun, She heard a different footstep, which was lighter than the male, but stable like a meteorite, like the heart and soul of its owner - the door was opened, and the highland Norman's daughter, Leona, stood Outside the door, the faint orange glow is combined with the light blue light of the Milky Way, giving her red hair a magnificent purple glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can come out, Jier." Liona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it over?" asked Jier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's over." Leona said: "Come out, it's not a good place for babies and pregnant women."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it can protect us, Ji Er said in her heart, but she will not raise any objections to Leona's words, given her identity is so sensitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to go home first," Leona asked: "still..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is my husband?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the war room." Leona said: "Bedwin, and your brother Amos also ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jier knows why she said this: "If you can, I will go with you, I don't want to hear my brother's from someone else's mouth." The final outcome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not good for your child." Leona gave a slight condemnation to see Jier, and Jier smiled: "He is half a Highland Norman, even if he is still in his mother's stomach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona shook her head. "If you like, okay. "she says. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The War Hall is the largest building built by the Normans on the side of the Highlands, just like the main hall of the Norman Kings, just to be rougher And Jane, no carvings, no gold, no beautiful lamps, even a torch instead of a candle on the pillars, but for the Normans, it is sacred and solemn - when Bedwin is not sober enough He handled the affairs in the fortress of the lake belonging to Kremar, where he was like a tyrant who was on the verge of madness, but he finally woke up, he was unbelievable and deep in his previous actions. Feeling ashamed, he immediately left the fortress in the lake and lived in the hot flashing house with the Norman. When he needed a trial or a prize, he came to the battle hall. He asked Leona to sit in the battle hall. The only chair in the room, and he stood with other fighters and guarded her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off the delicate Mithril chain armor and removed the delicate scabbard (which the gnomes gave him), no longer wearing Silk long underwear changed to linen, he no longer carefully modified his appearance, each meal must be filled with sweet wine and delicate food until vomiting, he returned to the long table, dressed in leather, moderately Using clear water, ale, barbecue and thick bread, and the knights are joking and competing, just like in Thunder, the reason and calmness returned to him again, when he did, the closer to them The Manns are all relieved, this is the lord they are familiar with - he was almost unfamiliar to let them not recognize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
