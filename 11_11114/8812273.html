			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Ranger stood up, and the stand guardrail at his waist could not be said to be an obstacle. He raised his body with one hand and climbed over it. The movement on the ground is smaller than the one that can be caused by an oak fruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar looked around and another game started, excited hands waving, shiny eyes, shouting loudly The mouth and the forgotten head, he does not think that they will notice that someone is in need of a passage to leave the place, he followed the practice of the Ranger, jumped directly into the field from his seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the jumping off the stands, at the same level as the knight, Kremar discovered that he was tall and tall, just like a muscular half-ogre. Of course, his face is human, a praiseworthy face, but it is a rough and tough beauty, his skin is light brown, his eyes are gray, but lighter than the hair, With a transparent texture, he has a beard, a style called "short box" - an iron-gray short beard that extends from the lower jaw to the lower jaw, the tip is flattened, only about an inch in length, except for the middle depression below the lips. The place was completely cleaned, with a thin beard on the top of the lips and a tail with two beards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shoulders and chest are especially wide and thick. When he embraces the Elf Ranger, Krimall feels like a giant bear is hugging. A slender unicorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, you brought a little friend." Gray Knight said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shouts of people were deafening, and almost completely overshadowed his voice - the horses driven by the challenged knights were less than five feet beside them. Falling, the dust raised is enough to engulf a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if we walk around the court?" Kreima stared at the red horse that was screaming and wanted to stand up but was dragged by her stupid owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can do whatever you want, but you can't disturb the Cavaliers' game, and they are not responsible for protecting your life." Gray-haired Knight explained. <br /><br />################################################################################################## In the camp, it was safe, it was a bit noisy, the blacksmith was busy repairing the weapons and armor that were broken in the game; the servants ran to serve the knight to put on and take off the armor, burqa, put away the weapons, and took the hay. The horses who came to the barbecue and the water to feed the hungry and thirsty horses and their masters - physicians and pastors - were busy treating them. Some knights insisted that their injuries were irrelevant, but those who were responsible for governing them always thought they would not be treated again. To die, the two opposite opinions led to constant quarrels and even fights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captive knights are dissatisfied with the amount of ransom they need to pay, and some feel that it is more – just like the one that the gray-haired knight has captured, which is better solved because most knights focus on reputation over gold coins; some feel Less, not in line with his honorable identity, and the knight who captured him insisted on asking for more ransom for the above reasons... The bard in bright costumes praised this noble beside them. Behavior, they hit the castanets, knocking on the snare, playing the banjo and the Solitli - the latter instrument consists of fifteen strings and an isosceles trapezoidal shape of wood, because of its high sharpness like a weapon The sound of mutual impact is deeply favored by the knights. But it's not easy to play it well. After all, its string is not used to slap but to hit it, otherwise you can't hear it at all - the aristocratic girls often play it. Need to use a small hammer or similar equipment, and the bards who are much stronger than them can avoid the pain and exhaustion of their fingers after playing too many songs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, they will take out the flute and the clarinet and blow a little or two witty pieces to get a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, their hard work is always rewarded, and the winning knights will not be afraid to show their generosity, silver coins, gold coins, or being filled Part of the ransom knight's gear will be treated as a reward or a gift. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the contest was contested, the knight’s camp was a place where you could quarrel and live and die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Knight is the leader of these knights. His tent is the largest. It is located in the center of the camp. The flagpole stands in front of the tent and hangs his flag. Black and red on the two backgrounds embroidered with an upright, raised palms, side to a large sword, the Grizzlies, above the Grizzlies and the Great Sword, is the sacred emblem of Tyre, broken on both sides Coveted, they are surrounded by shield-shaped thorns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tent is made of wild cowhide, thick and strong, but not so good in sound insulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the young man with the dark hair came in, the tent suddenly became quiet, and the sound outside became weak and unified, just like the night wind The rustling sound of the woods blowing through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope you don't mind my self-assertion," said the Ranger. "Otherwise we will have to find another place to talk."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is good," said the Gray Knight, "The caster?" he said to Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Krimall," Kerry Ben introduced to each other: "And Bodwin of Thunderbolt...Bedwin, I noticed yours The coat of arms has changed - should I still call you Birdwin of Thunderbolt? Or should I call you Lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't make fun of I am," said the Gray Knight. "Oh, I must admit that this is a gift that makes me often restless. I just did my duty, and the one who pledges allegiance to me is always so tolerant. Generous, he would not allow me to reject this honor - what do you want me to do? He puts a cloak with a new coat of arms on my body, and lets me drink a golden cup with a new coat of arms... But my fief is still Thunder Castle, and this is like our friendship must be eternal," he said, giving Kremar a slight glimpse. "Let's make friends' courtesy, I am already very It’s hard to find a place where I can relax and speak freely.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said so, so He Leilei yo called to his attendants helped him take off the cumbersome armor, their weapons aside, called them brought food and wine in salute after Martha Crane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine brought by the attendant is blue-violet, and Cremari takes a bite, sweet and spicy, and mellow is like it has been stored for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you need to add a little water or light wine, this wine is very easy to get drunk," Birdwin said: "Because it is like Honey is so sweet, but it is ten times more or more than it is. Some people who are not good at drinking will even swallow enough to kill because of the sweetness of their greed." There is only one in his tent. Zhang Kuanping’s low couch, without a chair, so he simply sat down with his guests and leaned against his servant’s velvet cushion from other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, this wine is only produced in the North," Kerry said: "And the output is very low."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you want to make this wine not only requires skill, grapes and oak barrels," Baldwin said: "You still need the green eyes of fate - my people have started to Europe now. Ruhr prayed, hoping she would bring frost and low temperatures to their vineyards in a timely manner - what do you think? Kerry Ben? I know that the elves are quite sensitive to airflow and temperature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
