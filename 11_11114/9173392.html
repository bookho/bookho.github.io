			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei was upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she knows that it is absolutely unfair to him to let Gülen give up this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to leave you," Gülen glanced at her raised belly: "especially at this time." He hesitated for a moment, two One of the block rune fragments was handed over to Mei Mi. This rune can guarantee that the person around her is only her life: "With this, I will be at ease."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei refused, "Bring it," she said, "I have my runes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope you don't want Use it." Gülen said: "It is too dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of danger," Mei Mi said: "So no one will act rashly." Stepping forward, Gülen looked down at her and had to say that Mei Mei’s mother’s curse was always around them. Gülen and Mei Mi had been hesitant and worried, but they were in the priest of Greety. The divination results obtained indicate that they will have a healthy son, and Mei Mei is not as bloated as the average pregnant woman, look stunned, she looks very Better than before, her beauty is like an explosion. Everyone who sees her, both men and women, can stop involuntarily. Gülen suspects that this is because the goddess Fro finally came to this physical relationship. It’s not good or bad, but Mei Mi has indeed won the respect and admiration of many people. Even without the help of Rune, she has gained a pivotal position in Jianjian Port: “With it, your power will be It’s my most reliable shield,” said Pastor Fro, who leaned on Gülen’s arms. “No one dares to plunder its treasure from the dragon’s claws because they know that the dragon’s angry flame will They burned out and they didn't dare touch me because you would be more terrible than the dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will come back soon." Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that you can come back with the trust and power of your Majesty." "Silver Fingers" thieves union in the Azores, mages, thieves and assassins Almost all of them were summed up by Gülen’s majesty, but this is not to say that they can be safely lying high. The leader of the “Silver Finger” General Association, which is thousands of miles away, does not want to get rid of this dare to bite the next piece from him. Flesh and thieves, but they must now fight against the "fine net" guild of the Dragon Thorn Regiment of Grenada. Because of the relationship between the herb and its products, the latter extended the ubiquitous tentacles into the foundations of the "Silver Finger" and "Stolen" guilds, and violently swayed, powerful, and vicious, two faltering guilds even I had to temporarily consolidate the covenant against it - this opportunity is very rare - Gülen looked at the Kreima of Grenada and thought that he was in the name of the once, no, maybe now the benevolent master The "fine net" guild's arrogance under the sway of the savage; one side did not give up with the highland Norman's daughter Li Naina, he knows that she is going to go back, and who can she believe? Do you believe that those who have pursued their "silver fingers" and "bad thorns" for more than one day under high bounty? But as a ruler, she could not raise a group of wolves and a group of crows. Otherwise, how can she control the arrogant knights and lords? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the baroness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baroness is sitting in the courtyard leisurely, of course, not her, is the daughter of Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Leona, the other blood of the Norman royal family suddenly broke off in just one month, but it was really unexpected to the Sir Alex, but the Highlander The Man’s actions have always been quick and decisive. When the king’s daughter stayed in the Doring, but in ten days, the knights gathered around him have exceeded the number of thousands of people. The various coats of arms and flags are like children. The kaleidoscope that plays is so colorful that it is decorated with the wilderness and the grange around the city and the city. The "nightingales" that the baroness can gather can be said to have easily entered them - although Birdwin hates that the baroness has reached the point where she wants to hang her on the wall, but the young knights, Even though they really admire the lord who had been stationed in Thunder for 20 years and has repeatedly defeated the orc army, this worship is not enough to make them lose their yearning for and pursuit of love, not to mention the Baroness’s “nightingale”. There are no idiots that put emotions and purpose on the face, especially those who can escape from the orcs' claws. Some of them were originally poor worms that had only one coat of arms and title left, like the young count who once tempted Penny, and some, like the Baroness, used to be jealous or thieves, but If their performance can get Fukai's approval, then the Duke and the Duke of John will never marry a short surname. First, they are able to gain more trust from others; second, they are not likely to be questioned anywhere they appear; third, based on the inferiority of human beings, even with the same face, knowledge and character, a jealousy, A civilian, an expensive person will still receive different treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
