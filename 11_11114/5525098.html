			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house is not as empty and runaway as Cremari imagined, dust and feces piled up everywhere, in fact he has to say that as a ruthless idle For more than a decade, it looks quite decent, and the iron lamp holder hangs under the wooden beams (it should be the first to disappear, and iron goods can always sell for a good price, no matter what). The melted candle drips on the lamp holder and the ground, and the chair that can accommodate twelve people at the same time dine is not in the original position, but there is also one, and the porcelain in the sideboard is neatly behind the misty glass. Arranged like a moon covered by dark clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust of course, but only a thin layer, and he did not see spiders or other small creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the most unbearable thing is the air inside, cold, turbid, with a vague rancid smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you let the guards look at this?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garrison captain shook his head: "I will come here occasionally, but only this, I can't waste people in an empty room - ah, I Knowing what you want to ask, there are indeed thieves who have visited," he pointed to a slanted wooden window, which had been covered by vines. "But he quickly fled and went crazy, insisting on the ghost of the hostess and her children. Still wandering in this room, and later one, he died in this room, and some said that Beavis left his invisible servant or the magical image here, or the small summoned from the abyss. The devil - in short, no one has ever been interested in this house since then, and it has been preserved to this day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the young man of black hair:" Has your tutor told you about this situation? I mean, what did he really leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is something," Kremar Said: "But it is not his stay, he also learned about it for a long time - there are some about gray robes, some A little poisonous hobby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint mourning and curse passed through the elf's ear, and he moved his gaze to that position, like the table and chair casting a shadow. The place, the shadow is irregular, it is auburn and has a sticky feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that blood?" asked the Ranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garrison captain shook his head in a strange way: "No, Beavis managed to take every drop of blood here, poor lady, you know, piecemeal, only the mixed ball robes and Beavis know her. How much was lost, the burial people told me that they never carried such a light coffin - but I remember it was as bright as new, but this trace..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "A small spell of Pratton is simple but extremely despicable," said Kremar. "Material is the victim's pain and part of the blood. If someone lives here, it will evoke and absorb those pains." Memory and fear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And to attract those negative negative energy, forming a vicious cycle, so we can't even find one here. Spider," said the elf. "I must have found a way to get rid of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spell, plus the potion." Said, he went in there and took out a delicate little crystal bottle, chanting the spell When I put the things inside, the brown shadow immediately shook and trembled. The elves were not sure if they saw the wildly waving tentacles and claws, but even if they had, they disappeared and stayed there. Only the real, thin and thin, without the thickness of the slender gray shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dawn-purified water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is also the victim's blood and colorless The stone of the stone.” Kremar said, the solution is correct when the bottle is returned to the arms, but they don’t have the blood of the wife of Weiss, they use their own blood, and the effect may be better than the former. Better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mind..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't mind," the caster said softly. Both the elf and the Guard Captain of the White Tower: "You can open and transcribe it. I don't think my mentor would mind this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Beavis," the garrison captain shook his head again: "Have he ever mentioned the White Tower to you? And the people here? I, Jim, Stone Shield, Mrs. Panda..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw the face of the young man subtly red: "I'm sorry," he said during the period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, nothing," the garrison captain pouted happily: "Beavis is like that, I suspect he has long remembered my name." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think he remembers," said Kremar calmly. "It will only make him suffer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence silences the garrison captain. For a moment: "His wife is a good man, Beavis is also." He said, as if to break free from the sorrow, patted the mage's shoulder: "We may be the name of his wife. The name of the drug."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar thought for a moment: "It’s still not," he said in his heart: "I want the mentor not to be happy with his wife." He was mentioned over and over again, but because of the torture and death she suffered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right." The garrison captain sighed and he came over. I accidentally bumped into a chair: "Hey," he said, bending down and trying to lift it up, but caught a black crush when he touched it. He stood up in confusion and hung The wide sword at the waist sweeped into the sideboard. The sound of the pawn was really pleasing. It’s not so good that the disciple of Master Beavis can Inheritance and less together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is on the forehead, and he glances at the young brunette mage: "This is not what Weiss wants to inherit." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beavis and other mages who still don’t have the Master Tower, collect the most important assets in their nearest place, an extremely narrow space. Sandwiched between the master bedroom and the study, there are no windows, only two doors that require different secrets to appear and open, one on the left side of the bedroom and one on the right side of the study—that is, from the corridor and outside It is difficult to detect the presence of this room, but its owner wants to use it, but it is convenient and safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is only six feet wide, but has a depth of fifteen feet, almost no decoration on the walls and the ground, or that they are covered with more precious decorations. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are reels on the delicate ebony shelves, although it can be seen that they have been taken away in a hurry, but the remaining number is still considerable. On the same shelf, there is a half-wound wand; in the room near the outer wall, there is a mahogany beveled table, also illuminated with fluorspar and equipped with a steel fixed ruler, in the Alva Master Room. The beveled table is different. There are drawers in the middle and on both sides of the table. The drawers are filled with the materials and various blank scrolls needed to modulate the ink. The opposite side of the ebony shelf is made up of some narrow and long specially made. The boxes, each box is divided into a variety of casting materials, there are ordinary, but also rare, one of them with two flawless colorless crystal balls, the size of the baby's head; the last wall was A row of closets occupied, with two dozens of robes with defensive and other features, the wooden box underneath the boots, and the innermost dark box with jewels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only clothing, boots and jewellery need to pay taxes (the soul of the alien world marvels at the fact that the world also has an inheritance tax), scrolls, wands and casting materials are not included here - the robes decorated with constant spell gems are ambiguous, but consider To the downstairs, the whole cabinet was smashed with porcelain, and the garrison captain simply summed it into the magical equipment. In this way, with the house of Beavis, Kremar only had to pay a small sum. All the formalities can be completed at the cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still need to stay here for a while?" asked the garrison captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said Kremar, "for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a witness Kerry chose to leave with the Guard Captain who fulfilled his duties - Kreima read the third secret, a new, downward passage was created on the smooth stone floor, and the end of the ladder was stamped. It is not a hindrance to the lich who has the double recognition of the secret language. This is not a hindrance to the lich who has the memory of Beavis. Compared with the robe robes, the things behind the door are what they need most now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious silver staff with ruby ​​inlaid, and two gold-plated runes, a magic ring with ten fingers, and a pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the lich is lingering in the sea, the soul of the outside world is a little unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You don’t have to leave this room at all, we simply can’t use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——This is the house of your mentor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What about it, the Lich said rudely, do you think he will come back to live? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We have gotten enough, and the soul of the outside world insists that we can always reserve something for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-When we went to Gray Ridge, the lich laughed and said that it would soon become a pile of ruins or a thief's hiding place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I think it will have a better purpose, the soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the adults for their reward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
