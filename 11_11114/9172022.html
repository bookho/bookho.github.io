			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you not going to do? Danos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos I began to look at their princes and princes, and then he found that his companions had subtle expressions, and the warlock put his hands in the sleeves of the robes, which often forged a great danger for a caster - as for the dragon The knights of the teeth, their position has already stated that they will not be biased towards Danos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since we are here," Danos said: "You know that I can't do anything, I am not a madman, or an idiot. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So let me see how you really look?" The undead who used to say carelessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos reveals a bitter smile: "Do you want to take all my secrets? In front of these people."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe this is not excessive," the Lich said softly: "The facts have proven that they are all trustworthy, and you should repay your concealment." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, before the battle with a monk lich and her weak but therefore more insane master, the leader of the team said this Although the knight and the warlocks will be happy to see it (after all, knowing a secret in Greinada is like having a chance or even a life), they will still have some jealousy about Kremar, after all, in Gerry. In the three legions of Nada, who can have no one or two small secrets, too aggressive will make people fall into a kind of rabbit sorrow and sorrow, and even cause a lot of resentment - but in this battle, personal The power, the dark-haired dragon has been respected by every survivor, no matter what, just in him Chasing the undead who succeeded in deceiving all people (including their own monks) for hundreds of years, His Royal Highness gave them shelter and guidance - he could do everything, know everything, even the young red dragon When the lady comes here, she may not be able to do better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos feels tired, they can be said to be in a lengthy and slow way, like a huge stone mill grinding the hardest beans, slow The ground, subtly, ruined the terrible undead in a little bit - he began to lose his ability to love and trust as he gradually became weak. He deceived his wife and let him The monk Lich thought he had died. He understood that the monk Lich, who insisted on his power and love until now, will surely protect his fortress and his skeleton - she will make her own life.匣 匣 匣 的 的 的 的 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱 爱<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor woman, she does not know, the monk Lich could not continue to exist from the creation of her lich, if her husband really It’s gone, she will turn into fly ash in the next few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't know, many people don't know, the monk lich is not so common, but the undead who used to be in the lich and undead have been piled up. Seventy-seven islands have lived for more than 100 years. If this is a dragon, or a demon, a devil, a heavenly creature, he may have some details that cannot be mastered, but sorry, what is there about the bone shelf? Can the secret be uncovered by him? No, it’s like a dragon knight and a warlock who are surprised that their leader is just as knowledgeable as reading the heart of the loser. After all, many times, the way the undead do is almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They crushed the lich’s life and got the lich’s will, more than the sacrum used for camouflage, almost all of the bones above the knee were I kept it, and the dry eyes flew out, and then I was dug out of the mouth of the little devil Asmodeos by His Royal Highness, and the little devil’s miserable shouting made the Grenada involuntarily There was a bit of pity, especially when they saw that the little devil couldn’t swallow his eyes for the first time because the string on his neck suddenly tightened, as if it had a new neck with a fine stem The warlock didn't even think so well about a book he saw at the Warlock Tower. The Serris would raise a waterfowl called a osprey. They also had ropes around their necks, so they caught the big fish. There is no way to swallow it to fill your belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is not to say that they will let the little devil swallow such precious treasures because of sympathy. If Cremari continues to be so indulgent, they may still Hey and hate, compared to the life of a monk lich, it is clear that the lich bones that can make a living person have the power of a lich can be much more important, and the dark-haired dragons are already clear. Having said that, because the monk's sorcerer's life has been used to feed the little devil, the lich's bones belong to the warlocks and knights, they can hand over to the temple, waiting for the reward of Greedy. Or self-distribution - as for how to distribute, their leader does not intervene or care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Danos refuses Krimer's request and violates the boss's intention, then the other knights and warlocks can kill Danos under the command of Kremar, and Danos sees their eyes in the eye. Under the bonfire, everyone is eager to try. If he dies, his weapons, armor, magical tools and things in the pocket will be immediately divided. As far as their forgiving masters are concerned, he Maybe not take a share in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that after you learn this secret, Danos reveals an evil smile and says in his heart that he can continue to retain his current ambitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped back two steps, and the people around him now only have His Royal Highness Kreima still sitting quietly on a fallen, withered tree trunk, but Dano Si did not look at them at all. He only stared at the dark-haired dragon. The black eyes reflected the bonfire, like golden eyes, and the long hair was also rendered a thick layer of blood by the fire. At this time, He looks like a pure dragon, not half the blood that has been hated and rejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos first took off the leather armor, then the weapons and the pockets, tights, boots and trousers on the belt and belt. He stood in the fire, there was no cover and restraint in the whole body, and the warlock showed a surprised look. He did not think that the generation of the dragon thorns would be mad because of the small pressure, then what is he going to do? He glanced at Kremar, and suddenly realized what they would see next--red red, like the charcoal-like scales that are about to go out, which are like a slap in the skin of Danos, he is slightly Leaning forward, the back arched, the onlookers heard the tearing of the flesh, and from the position of his shoulder blade, a pair of small pointed sticks, blood left from the root of the small tip, the small tip quickly became bigger, tight When it was tied together, it was like an umbrella, and after it finally opened, the warlock took a deep breath—it was a pair of membrane wings, and then, unsurprisingly, he saw a full thorn The tail sticks out from the end of the spine of Danos, and it dexterously rotates in the air, as if to find a target for his master to vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems," the Lich said softly: "Your blood is much purer than what you show."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person thinks that Danos is only a thief with a meager red dragon blood, he will not be as vigilant as he is to guard against a powerful enemy, but he will show him when he arrives at North. When it's special, I believe that many people will feel regret and wonder, but it will be too late to do anything at that time. Danos is so cautious to keep this secret, of course, not to give a surprise. Perhaps, he has been waiting, looking forward to searching for any weakness or gap caused by the slightest slack. It is a pity that he waited for the fatal blow of the black-haired dragon. The generation of the dragon thorns is now impossible to kill Kremar. No, not to mention Crimmar, he may not be able to make those dragon teeth. The Cavaliers and the only remaining warlock were completely silent. They don't know what kind of secret they have, and what Danos will do to make this secret continue to be a secret meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is no other way than to offer loyalty to this Highness, Danos thought, and found that his mood is not so bad, this The owner may be in an awkward position, and there are many naive expectations, but he does have the wisdom and strength that Kelmen Kelsey climbed back into the dragon egg and could not have possessed for hundreds of years. And extremely tolerant and generous, at least Danos did not expect that he could still get such a big benefit from this barren and monotonous task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I know?" Danos couldn’t help but ask: "His Royal Highness, where did you perceive my intentions?" "Know that, in order to make a surprise blow, even if he is on the verge of serious injury or threat of death, he does not show that he has the strength to surpass people's cognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning, the Lich said in his heart that he may not be familiar with Danos, but he still knows Austal, the dragon The favorite thing is to play with all kinds of intrigues, even if he only stayed in Grenada for reasons that people don't know, or when he is somewhere else, he can't put a clumsy guy in the position of the leader. Shang - Young Red Dragon Lady, and perhaps Danos, thought that he might not accept a red dragon dispatched person to accompany him, or he might try to remove this hidden danger once he left the army, so North came to play a fool who wanted to refuse to fall into the mud of despair with Cremal and stupid to expose his "real" ideas. The Grinada people, as well as those who are not broad-minded, will be angry, of course - because they don’t want to let Danos feel comfortable and insist that the odious thief is forced to perform the duties he does not want to perform. The kind of malice is completely within their expectations. But what they didn't think was that the Lich's cohabiters came from another plane, and in that plane, it was like "irritating someone" so that he "does the opposite" and get what he wants. The result has long been a routine in a variety of novels, plays, and realities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
