The whole spell can almost extend human life to a long time like a god. If he succeeds, his wife will be the first beneficiary besides him. It’s down to their children, their only child is dead, but he can make the child return to his mother’s arms from the mourning wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to convince his wife of every word of his, Leif was tolerant of his wife, even allowed her to ask questions and explained to her in detail, The wife of the husband is only the daughter of a baron. There is no resident magi in the castle where she lived when she was young. There is only one priest of Rosada, but this pastor is not a very strong white robe. His main job is When someone was injured, they treated and taught the little masters in the castle to read and write. She only occasionally heard one or two sentences about the caster at the banquet. The feeling for the wizards was mysterious and seductive. She was so happy to have a sweet and wonderful time with Leif after she learned that she would marry a spellcaster. She had also cast some tricks to show her children. It was also at that time that she planted seeds. She did not know when she became indifferent and alienated from time. He was stranger to another person, one made this innocent girl nervous, depressed and good. I mean darn guy, and then he is since the formation of his troops, although Lie Fufu who has repeatedly insisted that her husband was not the culprit of those disasters, but her heart is still so little for sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These haven’t seen it, but she’s seen that those who are covered in black cloaks are rotted to a few visible under heavy fabrics. The limbs and hands and feet of the bones, they are not humans, their territory has no way to recruit so many mercenaries, let alone the knights, these are the ancestors of Lev, and some follow their battle and then have the privilege buried around the mausoleum Soldiers and knights, they are brave and warlike, they don't fear death and don't need food and potions, they don't have the compassion of ordinary people, even babies, they will only die under their swords. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight in the castle is just a group of desperados hired by Lev to cover his army of the dead and his descendants, who will open the cloak from time to time. Mercedes-Benz is in the center of the team and around, when the undead need to negotiate with the living, they pretend to be the leader and knight of this army, but in essence they have never participated in any battle, only to be picked up behind the vultures. Some of the residues discarded by the husband, when several priests of Cranvo were aware that it was not right, when Levi’s undead army suddenly collapsed, the collapsed mountains that Lev summoned buried the bones deeply. Someone died, the other part went back because of fear and nowhere, but as time went by, these people thought that the Necromancer might have given up here, not knowing where to go, especially their Children, they don’t think there is anything to be feared in this ruined castle. They become arrogant and rude, not only do not want to respect Mrs. Lev, but also often take And her son joked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Lev also confided to Lev in an angry manner, but the gray robe showed considerable tolerance. "Let them go." The Necromancer said: "We are the ones who will stand at the highest place, to At that time, you will find that they are so small, so small that you can hardly remember and remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I will remember." She answered this question. After she determined that Lev’s success, the first thing she had to do was to put these arrogant people into the grave while they were still alive. Perhaps because of their offense, but more, she is very clear, because they are so young and so healthy, and even can make the maids tempted, fat cat is the last one to be pregnant, but it is not the first But these humble maids have become part of the mausoleum. She hates them, from the maids who can have a healthy, surviving child, to the so-called knight descendants who make them pregnant. If her son is still alive, It must be more dazzling and strong than them. He is a noble jazz. From the very beginning, these people only squat at his feet to do his loyalty, instead of holding his tragic story as he is now. Ingredients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out and touched her son’s face, she could almost feel the soft fluff, warm and elastic cheeks, and sleep I often chewed it, but she couldn’t feel anything... maybe because she was too old, too dull, so no, Mrs. Lev put her hands on her face, her skin was for a long time. It became stiff and cold at low temperatures, yes, so her son was cold and cold. She flustered her fingers into the skirt, rubbing it over and over again, thinking about what she is now, ah, she is so old. Old is like a child's great-grandmother, and her child is still so young. Will he not recognize her because she is so aging, crying out? How should she explain? It’s been so many years...and his room, his cot, his servant, his horse and dog, now only his room and furniture are kept, every day she supervises the fat cat’s careful cleaning, his The servant is dead, his horse and dog are dead, but it doesn't matter, these can be re-added, he will have a mother who will never leave him, maybe a strong and majestic father, he can Living as noble and carefree as a heir to the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why is there no undulation in his chest? And his nose, can not breathe a little breath that allows the feathers to tremble, the mother's mother took out the bloody jade charm, the silver mirror is best, but she only has this, but fortunately the back of the talisman is silver Because, after a long period of friction, the surface is as smooth as ice, Mrs. Lev carefully licked it and handed it to the child's lips, but no, she waited for a long time, no, a little There was no white mist. There was only a small fluorite in the room. She narrowed her eyes. No, nothing could be seen. She grabbed the child's arm and grabbed it with almost the strength of an iron fork. Her strength was so amazing that the arm fell down and the fracture was flat, and even fine stitching was seen. Traces, without a drop of blood, only muddy dirty liquid dripping on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lev!" The child's mother shouted desperately: "You lied to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty room echoed her shouting, sounds Just like countless people repeating this sentence, Lev deceived her. Every time she saw the child, the child lying on the altar and seemingly sleeping did not change at all. He was not like the other dead. It was only because his father had touched him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Leif stood in front of the mother, maybe he would be completely shredded by her, but when Mrs. Lev threw it on the threshold, she found this The door has been firmly locked: "Leif," she squeezed her fist and tapped the heavy pine, because it was underground, the air was damp and cold, so metal and wood were prone to rust and decay in addition to rock. However, these doors were also harvested by Mrs. Lev from the time of service of the tenants. The craftsmen also made the door thick and heavy, inlaid with three iron frames, hinges and locks. They all use black iron mixed with copper. Don’t say that she is just a weak old man. Even a strong knight may not be able to drive her. When she hears the sound of scratching, she thinks she accidentally sticks her finger. I didn't want to hurt my nails, but when she retracted her hand, she realized that she didn't use her fingers to scratch the threshold. Who made this voice? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t want to go back and see if her child was still sitting in a chair and leaning her body, but a force forced her to turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave a scream that she thought she couldn’t make anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see," Gülen said. "I said that our trip was too easy." He lifted a chair in the room and threw it at him. Window, "Get out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gargoyle trying to reach into the window gave a sound like a stone rubbing, and the chair failed. Throwing out the window, the window is too small, and the iron bar was originally inserted. Now the iron bar is torn open by the gargoyle, but the residual root is left, and the window originally allowed only one person to reach out of the head, and The chair is too old, and the old ones are about to grow mushrooms. Gülen does not accidentally watch it smash on the wall. It can only be said that the spatters are used to wipe the moss from the gargoyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this practice clearly angered the gargoyle, the guy who should have acted as a drain, opened his mouth and threatened to reveal sharp fangs. The thief shook his head slightly, thanking this generous owner. He was actually studded with swarf's mouth and made of steel-made teeth. The tip of the tooth was also slightly bent like a barb. Imagine if it was bitten by it. It is by no means a matter of one or two inconsequential flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gargoyle's claws slammed into the outer wall of the fortress, and the sleek outer wall made its claws slip. Because it was so heavy, soon the overwhelmed stone decided to abandon the family and return to the earth, the window. The shadow of the sway suddenly disappeared, but if you think that it is so good, it is a big mistake. The thief has tried to make the only hard thing in the room since he could not hear the loud noise when it fell to the ground. The stuffed window was the black iron frame that was hung in the middle of the beam, but he couldn't take it and hit the window and was kicked out by a claw that came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, you have wings," Gülen still grabbed the lamp holder and wiped the blood from his mouth. He was falling. The wall was ready, there was no fatal or influential injury, but the teeth bit the tongue and at this time, the gargoyle had completely pushed the claw into the window, frantically Waving in the air, the warmth is like the skirt picked up by the priest Fro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gargoyle began to try to reach into his head after he found that he couldn’t catch them with his claws, and half a shoulder, the stone at the edge of the window was squeezed by it. The pressure is squeaking "It’s a pity, you are obviously a little overweight!" Gülen shouted loudly, but this happy news came quickly, and the people who built the fortress did not seem to have one day. His drain will come to drill his window, the stone bricks around the window will loosen in a moment, and the gargoyle cleverly cocks his claws, pierces the gap, and easily pulls out a stone brick, then another piece, and then A piece, probably only needs to be repeated a few times, it will be able to get all the body above the wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is too unfair," the thief murmured. "A guy like this shouldn't be wise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the gnome in the corner. If the gargoyle pulled out two more bricks, he would open the latch and let the zombies outside come in. Anyway, the zombies can at least Let his dagger work, although it is the most basic, but a gargoyle, even if you can make it into thousands of pieces, you can still find yourself if you can't find the core, but he immediately finds that he wants it. The gnome who went to the kitchen to eat the nightingale was chased by several zombies and ran back. The screams that had not been interrupted suddenly stopped. He looked at the dagger with a dagger. Just behind the paint mottled sacred cabinet, the gnome was busy. Put a small arrow that looks like he is fat and short, and snaps it into the bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me this is not a general arrow." Gülen said that he appeared silently behind the gnome and scared McGee almost literally. Got old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
