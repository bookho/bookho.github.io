			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" With the warning of Kerry Ben, the priest of Klanwo jumped away from the original position agilely, an arrow flashing silver Lee arrow flicked his cheek and flicked, accurately hit a triangular head covered with shadows, covered with tiny scales - the arrow pierced its dark eyes like a deep pool, and from There was a bright flame, like a star that splashed on the surface of the water, which spread quickly, like a thick layer of grease on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-headed ghost beast screams, it is a strange and harsh sound like a steel sword on a smooth rock, each hearing this People who are vocal can't help but want to raise their hands to block their ears. They will feel nausea, headaches, and finally want to wear their own tympanic membranes. There are indeed many prey in the double-headed ghost beasts. But they will soon discover that it wants you to hear, and you don't need your ears at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Klamow whispered, and the terrible voice was suddenly lowered, blurred, and it became fragmented and lost its original threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster climbed down from the ceiling, it looks like a large lizard of the main material plane, from the beginning to the end of a horse, week Covered with scales like human armor, with sharp spikes on the tail, with two heads - a perfect head is turning, opening a mouth with a lot of barbed teeth, and hurting the wound The skull bites down and swings his neck, throwing it on the ground without hesitation. It recedes and wants to escape it with the shadows as it did before. Unfortunately, this time the enemy did not give It had the opportunity, the second arrow followed, and before the mouth with the auburn tongue and the corrosive acid and toxic mucus had not had time to close, it shot from the fragile gap. Going in, it is unstoppable, and it is worn out from the delicate throat, and the arrow and the half arrow are exposed behind the neck of the ghost beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Klamow expressed his gratitude to the Ranger. The Ranger nodded to him, went up and pulled out the sharp arrow that runs through the head of the ghost beast, and the priest helped him pull out the other one, and he held the sharp arrow in his hand. The arrowhead of the arrow is all secret silver. The tail feathers are not from the birds. They are like the leaves of some kind of trees. They are elastic and tough. No matter which part has never been stained with the blood of the two-headed ghost beast. It is more light in the hands of the arrow made of steel. But these are not enough to attract the attention of Pastor Claude who has traveled for more than a decade. His concern is the subtle but pure positive energy that lingers on the arrow. For the evil creatures living in the shadow plane, it It is like the most deadly poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the magic applied by your mage friend for you? Pastor Ke Lanwo asked with a gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Kerry Ben answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today? Pastor Ke Lanwo continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must find him quickly, Crawford’s pastor said before he exhausted his spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Kerry has "said." But before that, we have to say goodbye to our enthusiastic owners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black shadow suddenly emerged from the shadow of the pillar behind the priest, and it was unexpected that the priest had prepared for this, a tall priest On one spot, the backhand pulled his own pointed hammer from the belt, and the tip of the sickle shape was nailed to the semi-decayed floor. A two-headed ghost beast screams that they are already familiar with. It climbs on the big pillar that is big enough for the hands, and the head and neck are stretched forward with difficulty, and the tongue is straight. It was stupid enough - but the priest gave up the pointed hammer nailed to the floor. When I wanted to stand up, its neck suddenly stretched out. At the glance, its prominent snout was almost able to dance with the pastor... Its teeth are also, it has smelled fresh blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its other head is guarded against the elves. When the elf shoots his arrow, it is equally twisted as a snake, and it bites it accurately—although it is still burned by the magic attached to the arrow, it still gets its prey, a big one. Piece of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is thinking this way, there is a fierce and vivid message from the nerves common to its twin brothers, no. It’s not sweet killing, or awkward satisfaction, but horror and pain. It bites the arrow and turns to look at it. A dagger with a short sword is going up from the bottom to the other twin head. The jaws are worn together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest waved his arm, and the pointed hammer, also made of Mithril, jumped from the floor and fell into his hand. He waved the hammer and simply Broke the head that still bites a Mithril arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the ghost beast fell off the pillar, as its kind, the spiked tail fell loosely on the ground, and the disks piled up in overlapping The circle, about four to five times its body, can also be as long as the neck of the ghost beast. Seeing its direction, it seems that when the elf is attracted to his head by his head, he wanders from behind him. Sneak attack on him in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest pulled the arrow on the monster's body and returned it to the elf. After leaving the room like a storage room, they found a nest with a dark glow at the end of a corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest of the double-headed ghost beast, the priest of Klanwo said in a silent language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is on other occasions and time, the Elf Ranger will go to check it out, and the two-headed ghost beast loves to collect some precious items that the victim carries with him. As a collection, a crow like Zhu's material plane will collect some glowing beads and glass. Of course, the elves will not covet the victim's property, but sometimes these possessions will have a family crest or a personal imprint. He will hand over these things to the priests of Cranwo, who will clean them up and sort them out. Pack it up, indicate the place and the witness. There is a special room in the church in Cranco to store these items, and people with missing relatives or friends will come to see it at a fixed time - most people don't want to see them familiar. Things, because the things displayed in the Klanwo Church can basically be said to be relics - but can not help but find, and some people can only be described as ecstatic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already marked it, and Pastor Klamo continues to “say” and we can search later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Kerry Ben answered, at the moment he left, an awkward thought made him creepy - that is, some of Kremar’s The thing is lying quietly in the nest where there is no light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich will certainly not fall to this point, although his current situation is not how about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- That is a fake! The alien soul shouted incredibly, why do you still... um. What is this like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you want to ask for the size of my psychological shadow? The lich and the wolf rolled over and rolled under a waving vine. I can tell you now, unlimited! Dear, unlimited! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What did she do to make you so deeply affected? The soul of the alien world asks. She lets you streaking before tens of thousands of people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-More exciting than that, the lich did not answer with a good voice, while tearing open a reel, invisible armor protected his body A shadowed sawtooth tooth just snapped into Kremar's shoulder before the spell took effect. The fluctuations of the spells tore it into countless pieces, and the blue-grey slurry sprays them. The serpent's slurry is as negatively energized as the other creatures in the shadow plane. If it is ordinary people, maybe It has long been eroded into a blood-red sponge baby, but the lich only felt a slight burning pain, just like when he was a living person, the feeling of putting his fingers into a charcoal fire was exactly the same. Several hairs that were corroded and broken fell in the dry land. Fortunately, they were in the shadow plane, and the weak spots were swallowed by the grayish black mist that had not yet had time to flicker. The former undead only hoped that their strangeness was not seen by the abominable enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Can you still cast spells? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——No, the Lich said, if there is no blood, you can, but now I can't guarantee the success. So...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- So? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich did not answer, the spell on his body was gradually dying under the violent attack of the branches and vines. He took a new reel and held it in his hand... ... the last spell has failed, although he is ready to escape the most dangerous sniper sideways. But it was still pierced by the abdomen as long as a small arm - it should continue to move forward, stir the weak abdominal cavity into a paste, and then pull out the heart of the caster from the chest, but it stops stunned All the moves. The positive energy contained in the blood almost burned it into ashes - it ran wildly, hiding aside, making a sound like a human woman crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your blood..." The voice said with amazement: "Which blood is still flowing in your body? Who can give you such blood?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich stood up and the situation was sliding towards the most unfavorable side of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ripped open the reel, the dazzling white light instantly swallowed up the space, and the voice shouted sharply. Before the light faded, he saw his enemies - a poor demon, the priests and his speculations were completely correct, and the devil who was sent back to the endless abyss by the unknown soldier was severely punished. She was reduced to a stage, and she fell into a demon with the inferior, but somehow, she still has some extra magic, not as sad as her former companion, or possibly out of a devil. Cruel teasing - she is assimilated with a part of the shadow plane, her lower body is connected with a shadow tree monster, and the upper part is still a description of the glamorous human female - long in the human race In the three hundred years, she may have obtained a lot of magical energy through the shadow tree monster, which makes her strong. As for how she came to the main material plane, it may be a careless black robe or heart. Caused by the malicious red robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sniffed the blood of the enemy and came to the multi-spirit, and she was originally a succubus, she tied a broad root system in this courtyard, it would be terrible The disease spreads quietly – the lich has already guessed how she spread the disease – no wonder they are seen in the bureaucracy of the consul, or in the temporary church of Clamow and Ilmot. Almost all of them are old people and children, followed by women, and there are few males who are in the prime of life and young, just because they can't resist the charm of the succubus, and the multi-spirited males are planted unconsciously. The deadly seed passed the seed to his lover and wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So does she know what she is pretending to be a worthy awesome existence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps she really knows nothing about it, the lich thinks that when he asked the question, he did not find the clues of fear or cringe - Maybe this succubus does not know what kind of role she is playing. She is just a mirror, projecting what she has read and the most influence on him as completely as possible... Poor little guy, The once-dead person is about to laugh at this. If it is not that he is still in a dangerous situation - he has to thank himself for his prudence. Since he became a disciple of the mentor, he has never been close to his father's court. One step, just a correct choice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ripped open a reel, the spell was almost interrupted, but still broke a small hole in the devil's cage, that Pastor Ilmot, called Gavin, fell in from the crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the demon's power is used to prevent the caster from escaping - she is the first to taste such delicious blood, the priest only received a few branches The harassment, he waved his hammer and opened things like whiskers and whip, and he was happy to find that he finally found a companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the companion smiled at him, broke a wand, and threw a spell—not to the vines around him, but to him.
