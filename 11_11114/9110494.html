The ladder provided by the handrail to humans is about 6 inches, which is not suitable for a dwarf, but can he still complain about it at this time? Of course, only running desperately or swearing, but when he jumped to the fifth level, a gust of wind pushed him aside, his head hit the pillar, but fortunately because it was too cold, he I have never taken off my own seal leather hat. This is really embarrassing, McGee’s ears are creaking, and his eyes are slamming, but he still understands what this is all about. Another winter wolf is only from the ground. One hop, I jumped to a place where six gnomes were so high. The rotating ladder was a bit narrow for it. It had to put a front paw on the handrail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reveals a "smile", yes, in the eyes of many people, many beasts show their expressions when they are hostile, I mean, Zhang big nostrils, pull back It seems that the ear is so a smile, but in a winter wolf with more wisdom, this may indeed be a real smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help!" The gnome shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Help" The winter wolf is following the story of the instrument and the hunter's legend in a funny way, the winter wolf can talk like humans, except The lingua franca, it also speaks the language of the orcs and giants, but the gnome is the first time to hear a beast talking like a human being. The sound of the winter wolf is not as terrible as its appearance and nature. Its voice is a bit delicate, a bit Sharp, it sounds like a child is talking. This may be the natural advantage of the evil orc gods or other things that give them. If Kerry is here, he will tell McGee that the winter wolf will continue to call for help with human voice. Bring the people who want to rescue the same kind into their encirclement, and then eat and eat it with great pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they don’t need to do this, but it’s clear that the wisdom of the winter wolf allows them to have fun in intimidation and teasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please," said the gnome: "I have very little meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter "Another voice said: "The tenderness of the cubs." A frost giant came out of the smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carried a stick with more gold ornaments than other frost giants, some of which were taken by the priest's vultures from the giant mountains that were broken by the limbs, while others were extorted from other frost giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about your companion?" Austal said that he walked to the front of the gnome, and the eyes of the gnome turned around and seemed to be gibberish. Fan, but Austal opened his cloak, the gray-black cloak is so thin, but inlaid with Mithril thin lines and gems, the gnome's line of sight swiftly passed over, then he saw the Olympics Starr let him see something like a red robe like blood. The gnome was suddenly frozen by this terrible scene, as if standing in front of a Medusa on the island of Fire Island is not a rare thing, although the most powerful red robes are said to be in Grenada. But the power of those red robes and the things they do are enough to make the gnomes feel awe, not to mention that Austal's eyes are even more sinister than the black dragons they have encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They went up, aren't they?" Frost Giant's priest voice hoarsely asked, after the death of the giant mountain, his enemies became Ostal, of course, he remembers that they still need to cooperate now, but he can't allow another arrogant guy to replace Jushan as the first person to speak in this temporary team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome took a deep breath and nodded indiscriminately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that we are very close to them." The priest said: "We need to catch up immediately." He stared at the Austrian with his gray eyes. Starr, but waved his stick and ordered a frost giant to climb the ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladder provided for human use does not consider the gnome, nor does it consider the frost giant, the frost giant can only put one foot on the ladder, and he must put the body Crow up so that you don't touch the ladder above. He tried awkwardly and tried again. When he finally couldn't patiently straighten up his body, he still broke the ladder. "No," he said to the priest, "Small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest turned to Austal: "Use your spells." He said: "Use your spells to send us to the little thieves."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you pray to the omnipotent Kawu, so that his most devout believers grow wings from the back?" Austal said: "Think, when you Suddenly falling in front of your enemies, like a cockroach catching a rabbit or a fish, how much their faces full of horror and fear will be worth repeating."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest saw the young frost giants headed by the eldest son of the giant mountain nod. They seemed to think that the idea was very good, great, and worthy of a try, which made his look further dark and he did not miss the mountain. The leader of a Frost Giant tribe, he is too clever, his eldest son is stupid, but the priest is too stupid at this time. "The powerful and great Kawu luxury needs sacrifices." He said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very good." Austal pointed to the gnome who kept turning his head. He was surrounded by several winter wolves, everywhere. They are all stinky, barbed tongues and noses that spray white mist. Even if they are not scared, they will be scared, at least. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too small," said the priest. He does not easily use the magic, Kawu luxury is not a generous and generous god. And he and Ostal are well aware that in the end, if they can really kill the thieves and get the secret of the metal dragon, then they will not mind destroying each other and taking more things, Even the magic books, rune seals, and the like that the Frost Giants can't use, they can hide them and wait until the humans hire them to sell them to the human wizard. This is even if the ordinary frost giant does not know, the priest is the most understandable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, he and Austal certainly will not easily throw their own power, which is why the priest will insist on Austal to cast this spell. The reason, maybe at the end, what the warlock needs most is that this spell is also possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very old," said the priest, though as a frost giant, he did not seem to differ much from a frozen mountain: "And I The prayers of the gods will cause my children to bleed, and they will become weak and unable to capture their prey.” He said: “If you are willing to pay more power, I can give you some gold. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The eldest son of Jushan is swearing, "He said no gold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Austal almost laughed, sometimes you would think that the idiots are also very cute, especially when he saw the priest's five senses twitching subtly: "My gold," the priest replied briefly: "From I took it in my bag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Frost Giant immediately bit his tongue, he is not so smart, but he can at least draw himself and others The bag, and he also knows that he needs to be dedicated to the priests, so that the Kaussian gods can bless them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
