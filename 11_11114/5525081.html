			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bibi dike is very different from the small town in the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very large, with four layers of milky white walls and twenty-seven towers. The structure inside the fort is exquisite and sturdy, looks like a carved The multi-layered ivory ball, and the dock and harbor below it is like a special seat and silk for the placement of this lovely ball - the port serves the city, not the port like the port, the city is the port service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Cobbert has the first-class license signed by the Speaker of the Freedom Council of the Bibi Dibao, and he is able to travel to and from the inner and outer cities and docks, which are many nobles and There are also quite a few reliable friends here, one of whom is a Master Alva, who is based in Bibi Dibao. He is strong and good at fighting. The parliament has provided him with a lot of money. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try this," said the Master, recommending his latest trophy to his friends, a plate with a finely fluffy milky white fruit: "A quotient The team brought it to me, they called it a multi-tumor white melon - a bad name that is appetizing, "He shook his head and added a grin - if you don't see it, you won't believe it. A sixty-year-old human male can make such a lovely grin. He picks up one and does a demonstration: "Tear open the skin and eat the flesh inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The skin of the fruit is very thin, but there is a honeycomb-shaped middle skin with a thickness of about one finger, which reminds the captain of the grapefruit: "Where is the tumor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside.” Alva cut the two layers of skin with a blunt silver knife and showed the things inside to the captain. Cobbert saw a large group of slippery, bloody things, each with a thumb. Big, like a mouse licking out from the belly of a mother rat, tightly huddled together, the captain did not know if he had a disgusting expression, but he Engraved put down something in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can be quite delicious." Alva said, using a small silver spoon to pull out a piece in the mouth, a sweet and eccentric atmosphere hovering over Among them, his friends did not dare to look at them with compliment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure this is not a work of a red robe?" Cobbert asked: "The one that eats the tentacle from the body." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva laughed, he remembered that he had eaten durian for Cobert, the stinky fruit that was covered with thorns, and the captain insisted on it. It is grown from the devil's feces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Alva said. "It's a plant, there are seeds." He spread his palm to the captain and the seeds in his palm looked like black almonds. But he didn't want to tease his friends, so he let the apprentices take away the remaining white melons and turned to a plate of blue-violet raspberries, shisha and sparkling wine. Alva lie in his sheet. In the wide spring chair that people can't put it down, the delicately sturdy walrus skin is like a still filled with live fat. He half-closed his eyes and hide his face behind the exquisite vertical glass enamel. The water sucked and snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the current port of Mind, is it still the same?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Thieves Guild there The division has a new leader, an ambitious young thief," Cobbert said. "But perhaps because it is too young..." He shrugged at the raspberry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to hear." The Master slowly spit out a white smoke ring mixed with mint, tobacco and musk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It sounds like you have a weird little child." After listening to the captain's narrative, Alva said: "He is a caster?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even an apprentice," Cobbert said. "He has also left his mentor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do you think he is dangerous?" "When he was sent by the thief named Gülen," the captain said frankly: "I think it is a tricky thing, a spiky puffer or a The poisonous sea snake, but on the second day, he saved my crew and my boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Alva said: "Then He may be in order to show you well, or to ensure that his voyage is smooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe," Cobbert said: "But there is always something like moonlight. Things that can't be covered for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The beauty of humanity and life ," Cobert said: "I don't He said that he was as innocent as a baby, but he respected life, feared nature, he poured me goodwill, and my crew, and we reported the same feelings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alva fiddled with the gray mottled hair of the seabird's wings and extended his hand to Cobbert: "Show me your badge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He refers to the badge with the Woking logo, which is worn by many merchants and sailors, because Woking is a symbol of wealth, and Cobert takes it from his short cloak and hand it to Alva. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This badge is actually a magical tool that can resist the charm of the spell, Alva made and presented it to his friends, he moved his finger on the badge, chanting The spell, it flashes red light: "The badge has not expired," said the Master. "Your description reminds me of those who are loyal to the bright Rosada or the benevolent Ilmot," he When you say these two names, you will respect your chest and show respect. "Is he a white robe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although he is wearing a white robe," Cobbett Said: "But he never prays and never calls the name of God. He will not be a pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva looked down for a while, "He Want to stay at Bibi Dibao?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain shook his head: “No,” he said. “He wants to go to the White Tower.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Tower..." Alva said, "I think I should meet him. I think this is your original intention. Where is he now?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Egret Feet Inn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You left him in the outer city?" The Master said: "You are too cautious, test Burt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He likes the hotel very much." The captain said, "When will I bring him to see you?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow's morning," Alva said: "When the shadow of the mast is in the west-north, I am waiting for you in the haze hut."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The captain’s slight jaw, he knows that Alva will prepare a spell for what might happen on the day of the meeting. “I hope that the brilliance of Su Lun will shine on you and me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Her glory will surely break the darkness." The Master responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He still doesn't believe you," the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the soul of the outside world simply said that he heard it, neither frustrated nor angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't think so?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a child," the soul of the opposite world Gentlely said: "I know that this world is not what you want to get." Although the memory is confusing, he still remembers that he was just an ordinary person in the first two decades, in a wonderful world rich in material and technologically advanced. He relies on the Internet to survive and enclose himself in a dense little scorpion, but this does not mean that he will not be frustrated, threatened and betrayed. Sometimes he will even be surprised because those who are against him, The profit that made him feel painful and difficult to do evil was so meager, Jane was ridiculously a four-figure reward, a boastful free publicity, a vain promise, a few empty pockets. The praise can be a fuse of betrayal and injury. They laugh at him, smite him, use him, and never be ashamed of his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sorcerer of the Lich, apart from his parents, he does not know how to get along with others, and he is willing to lend a helping hand to others if he can. I never dared to pin my hopes on others, and because of this, he would be grateful to those who would give him help. He would not feel that he was abandoned and humiliated when they had to walk away. - They did not treat his responsibilities and obligations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, Captain Cobert’s cautiousness is understandable. This plane is much worse than his world, and he is still a thief’s leader. The stranger who boarded the ship, the captain did not sweep him into the wooden barrel of the apple, thrown into the deepest cabin and the sea is beyond his expectations, not to mention his willingness to take this shallow after arriving at Beitburg Friendship continues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other: Thanks to the following adults for their reward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimo 翦瞳<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silk of Death<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;书友100218203719022<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
