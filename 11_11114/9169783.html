			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor of Longshan State is already very tired, but he still can't rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of today, thirteen casters ruined the attack of the Grenada’s remains of earth creatures at the expense of their own lives. After discovering that I was isolated, the enemy’s intentions left on the wall immediately disappeared without a trace—the walls of Longshan’s state are more than fifty feet, and the dragon claws of Grenada only want to retreat. If you don't want to let them fear, they don't care about an orc, or a goblin, except for a few extra-quick guys, those cruel. The monsters were not buried under the iron nets and arrows of the Longshan soldiers, but they fell to the feet of the towering walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not a victory, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about our car?" asked the governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Safe and sound." In the battle of the day, only a part of the Dragon Tooth Legion was put into the battlefield, while others, very clearly, rotated around the tower And tentatively attacking, obviously they also know that if the giant brakes are hidden in the place, the empty and spacious bottom of the tower will be the most suitable, the tower is also part of the wall, it uses two layers of stone like the wall Bricks and stone bricks are filled with lead water, and the stone bricks are mixed with sand. The potion can make the flowing sandstone become hard like a rock after solidification - the inclined horse road is destroyed. A lot, but the consul is not very worried, the dwarves left the pulley and the crane, once the horse can not be used, the giant can be pulled by the manpower to the highest point of the tower - the consul hopes that it only lost an arrow The red dragon in the upper half of the tower did not notice that the top of the tower could be opened. After opening, the giant python could directly shoot the arrow into the air or inside and outside the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Masters are busy casting spells. In wartime, it’s important to guarantee the spell position and rest time, but the previous Sol Stones let everyone They were taken aback. If it wasn’t for the Grenada people who couldn’t completely control the monsters, they might make the Longshan state pay a heavier price. They should have expelled all the Sol, but in order to Make sure they don't pose too much threat, and it's necessary to cast spells to prevent and contain them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor did not disturb these hard casters, he went to see the wounded and dead, and the wounded were concentrated in the sanctuary of Rosada. The holy water that flows around the sanctuary is taken by the priests and sent to the wounded. The holy water can't let them heal immediately, or let the broken limbs regenerate, but they can make them less painful. Rosada's chief pastor When I saw the consul, I bowed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are the children?" asked the governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very painful," Rosada’s chief pastor said: "But there is still hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" It is a good thing to have hope," the consul said, but he himself did not know if he could still have hope: "Do you think... can we still have hope?" He looked at it with hope. His old friends, their mothers are sisters, and their childhood grew up in the same courtyard until one went to the temple of Rosada because of the call of the god of morning light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the chief pastor seems to be unable to bear this heavy expectation, he is too afraid to look at the consul’s eyes, "Glorious Rosada He did not lower his will," he said, which means that the Longshan state cannot obtain assistance from the Rosada Temple in other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why," the Archon said: "He made it clear that Gredi is a false god, a despicable thief who steals the beliefs of the gods."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is...the country is in the country," as the country around Grenada is always in flames, but even a king is being crowned by another king. Instead, as long as they did not burn or the temple or sanctuary of Rosada, and drive away the pastor of Rosada, then the main hall has no right to intervene directly. This article is not engraved in any country or temple. On the stone of the law, it has never been questioned and violated. "I am sorry, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you have tried your best," the Archon said. "But I heard that there seems to be Rosada in the White Tower. The pastor was mercilessly driven away... Even so, can the god of morning light still be able to transfer his eyes here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner of the White Tower does not It will be taken care of by Rosada again," said the chief pastor. "But as a follower of Rosada, we have not punish her rights. The public is hiding behind the Grenada people behind her." Give it to the Grand Duke or the Jazz who believe in the god of morning light - the Paladin and the priest of Rosada will appear in the crusade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one who should be enshrined is the priests of Ilmot. They have different divisions, some collect herbs, make potions that can kill people and save people, and some sorrows that comfort the wounded and lose relatives and friends. People, there are some fighters, they not only appear on the battlefield, but also appear in the arrow tower and other more important places, or the key peopleGrenada’s Dragon Spurs can not eat melons when the other two regiments are busy fighting, their knights, or thieves and assassins, sneak into the walls like fleas mixed in the dust, they Carrying poison and white phosphorus, ready to destroy the water source or arson, the guarded bodies are piled up in the shadows outside the warehouse where the grain and equipment are placed, and no fewer than three members have been assassinated - if not with the priest of Ilmot With the help of some Rangers, the walls will not be as quiet and stable as they are now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, everywhere, probably the priests of the god of death, Klanwo, who, as usual, carry the mask of the crow, the long scorpion The Ministry refused to approach the living. They not only prayed for humans, but also the orcs and giants. But even if they were, there is no way for every dead person to get their rest, because there are people in the Grenada. In the relationship of many gray robes, all the bodies will be burned, but the dead people of Longshan State can be left with their names, and their loved ones can take away from the ashes for burial.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be other priests of the gods who may be the people of Longshan, who have settled here for a long time, or they may just be unwilling Watching goodness being ruthlessly swallowed by evil, they stayed, walked in the streets, contributing a small force of their own, and the consul issued an order telling them that they could go from the city to the warlock and the mage. The library uses whatever they need, but can’t express gratitude to make him feel bitter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally he stopped in front of the city gate, the wall of Longshan State was a broken arc, and the incomplete position was the snow cover marshOf course, there will be gates on the walls. Today, the three heavy gates have been demolished. The ramps of the walls have been filled with large rocks, and they are poured with lead water like the walls, if they can stick to Greiner. When the people retreat, it may take a short period of time to move the stones. The consul will put his hands on the uneven stones. He really wants to have hope.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sent a letter to the king and Dagong who were not conquered by the Grenada army. He did not expect to receive assistance from these people. After all, between them They often rub each other. What he needs is to remind them that Grenada has exposed their ambitions and weaknesses. When most of the legions are gathered under the walls of Longshan City State, the interior of Grenada must be Extremely rare emptiness, he also asked the priest of Woking to convey his sincerity - all the assets of Longshan City State, whether it is land or fortress, or gold coins, silk, grease or ore, were used to do it. Reward, as long as someone is willing to attack Grenada at this time, whether he can win a small town or a jungle from the Grenada people, all their military expenses and other expenses can be borne by Longshan State. The state will not ask for any price, neither a copper coin - the old man has never learned something like another plane of art, but he knows that a snake should be given up. Prey, the best way is to step on its tail<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he only hopes that someone can be confused by this treasure that can make the dragon covet<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona shouted, her flame-shaped sword was an unpredictable In the direction, her strength is better than that of women and even some men, but this angle is difficult to release all the power, but the special curved blade of the flame-shaped sword makes it only need a small pressure to be in the enemy. The body left a scar of deep visible bones, and the blood of the orcs splattered. Norman’s virgins evaded sideways, and the blood caused her sword to slip. In the face of the mighty orcs, this weakness may be fatal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the only group of enemies they encountered after leaving Beitburg, yes, the enemies they encountered must be calculated in batches, they It’s almost impossible to get a break, and the people who attacked them went on and on, like if they were crazy, if they were not the most refined with the Thunder, and the knights with enough experience for the orcs and monsters, and from the tourmaline Antonio's Master of Dykes and his disciples, maybe they will sleep forever in the ridiculous mountains before they reach the Thunder Castle or the Norman Highlands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the White Tower and the Hill are still in the elves, or their friends, and a step back, a straightforward and good rule In the hands of the people, Birdwin and Leona can of course take the road that Kreima and Kerry Ben have traveled, from the hills to the white towers, from the white towers along the elves’ flying wing boats. The Starlight River goes up and then heads straight to the Thunder Fortress along the perimeter of the Silver-crowned jungle, but now the beautiful and rich territory has been controlled by the evil "fine net" guild, and behind the "fine net" is the Grenada The Dragon Spurs, this is what Baldwin and Leona knew a long time ago, even if they want to pass through the bribe, it is impossible, let alone their reward has been raised by Norman’s Queen a place where countless people are crazy<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
