			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 193th chapter of the swamp (2)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Ranger does not say a word, Extending one of his hands, Birdwin put his hand on his sword, and Kremar put his fingers together, this gesture will cast a spell to shackle what he needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's pastor did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meme!" Ge Lan shouted her name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei trembled a bit, unconsciously biting his lower lip, reluctantly put his hand into the robes, the furry hot group The elf came out and waited for her to put the creature of unknown origin in his hand. He gently flipped the palm of his hand and used the fingertips of two fingers to pinch the neck of the little devil Asmodeos. It is raised in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." said Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Kerry asked: "Do you know this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to it I said, "The black-haired spellcaster said: "It is a little monster made by a warlock. It was hoped to be my magic pet when it was multi-spirited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been following us?" Gülen asked with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always carry it." Meimi said in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry did not go to see Mei Mi, he turned to look at Crimall: "Can it speak, use human language?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very fluent." Kremar said: "Not worse than Gülen." Perhaps better than Mei Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not quite what the little monster can have." Kerry could feel unnatural from this creature like a little hamster. Breath, in his two or three hundred years of travel life, he has smelled this smell more than once. This means that the smell of distortion and variation will make them sick, and it is not the red robe that is making them. Some will ruin their own triumphs when they flee or die, and some will deliberately leave them because they know that anyone with a conscience and a compassion will be angry and sad for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has fought against the corpse gossip with his familiar tattoos, and has also cut off the deformed heads with tears, and more than once put the animals and humans who have lost their nature and reason into the burning He also saw the little monsters captured by the red robes. The little monsters are natural creations, perhaps a little bit harsh, like those children who are right and wrong, but their nature is doomed to this group will not tend to On the evil side, but if they fall into the hands of the red robes that are best at tormenting and transforming, they will soon lose their original nature and become a dangerous and despicable tool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait and so on..." The little devil Asmodeos had to scream, it had already noticed from the elf's tighter fingers. The threat of death, of course, can escape, but everything that was done before is in vain: "Please don't, please don't, benevolent adult," it hangs at the fingertips of the elf, pitifully pleads: "Please don't hurry I am a good little monster, really, swear by my master's soul, although he is a warlock, but respectable ranger, you should know that not all warlocks are evil red robe." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what do we want a devil to do?" Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not what you want," Asmodeos lifted the two hind paws and grabbed them with their front paws, so that it looks more like a There is no threat to the hairball: "You are very strong," it compliments: "But this lady we have to admit, she is the weakest link in this chain, but she is also your companion, Are you not willing to let her multiple protectors, even if it is just a little monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not quite like a little monster," said the elf, he The little monster was thrown away, and it showed off a few buckets in the air, and it fell steadily in the hands of Mei Mi in time. He couldn't find the cold smell from the abyss in it, and there was no smell of sulfur and rancid smell in the devil, but its wisdom made the Ranger scared: "I have not seen the good words like you. "The little monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My master...the former master," Asmodeos said: "He is a very outstanding caster. He loves it. I am like loving a real human child," he sighed pretently. "He taught me a lot." It humbly squats on the wet reed, and the two claws are caught together. "Many Many, you will find that I will be very useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should not hide from us." Birdwin pointed out sternly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just a pet," Fro's priest said angrily: "It won't hurt you. And," she added: "I just didn't say it, I didn't hide it, look, I just let it. Do some small things, some small things that can make us better, but you are acting like it will wait for you to fall asleep and bite your throat one by one."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it would be like this, Asmodeos thought, as long as I can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey grabbed it very tightly, the little devil fiddled with a small bag hanging around his neck, this bag is not only loaded with plum honey as life-like The devil's finger, its soul stone, and a rune coat of arms, from the hands of Austal, can blur the elves' keen perception, lest it be elf one before they want to do something. The arrow was sent back to the bottomless abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meme..." Birdwin said, cast a reproachful look on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult," Fro's pastor revealed a sour smile: "I know you will protect me, I also believe that you will not lie, but I will never be the first one, right? It will never... There are too many people who are more important than me. If so, you will allow me to leave it, I am too weak," she said softly: "Weak and small, and nothing, so, for me, even a little bit of strength is also important... Sorry, I don't want to give it up, it's mine...Adult, just mine."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe we can give it a collar or something." The thief said, while casually using his fingers to tease the little thing that looked like a black rice ball, he snorted. His fingers were bitten: "...damn it! Who wants to eat a roast mouse tonight?" he shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't want to eat that." Leona said: "I have some salted fish roe here. Who wants it?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair caster raised his hand for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In fact, Asmodeos, if you say that you have a good cooking that everyone praises, this circle may not have to be so Big))<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos fulfilled its work diligently obligation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the bugs, but even some scales, the belly crawling close to the ground, and some small things that have fangs and teeth, do not mind the types of prey, are also driven away by it, the dim light at night No obstacles, it found more berries than the elves, and also picked white and blue leaves of anemone and deep purple gentian flowers for the two women, it sounds tender and tender. Sing a short nursery rhyme, and also tell interesting stories and little jokes, telling them how to misbehave the apprentices of the mischievous warlocks. It’s no exaggeration to say that if you close your eyes, you will think that you are Sitting on a mischievous and innocent child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last plum and Leona were teased by it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see your hand." Kreima told the thief that Gülen was sitting outside the house, staring at a single foot A grey waterfowl that curls up at the top of the reed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's already good." Gülen said, while holding out his hand, the two small needle-like wounds are no longer bleeding, that is, It is a little swollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little monster is not knowing enough about this alien soul, but out of caution, this guy is not a cute little pet store in a glass case. So he finally gave Gülen a bottle of healing potion, and the thief would certainly not reject it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil Asmodeos sighed regretfully in the silk gown of Plum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Ranger Kerry was responsible for the warning in the middle of the night. When the first morning light lit the water, he walked into the house and accidentally saw Crema. Err is putting the pure gold cover spell book back into his pocket, knowing that since the black-haired spellcaster said that he can't read the dragon language, this spell book has never appeared again. Reuben made a gesture of asking questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar shook his head in a tiny amount, took out his spell book, and began to remember the spells above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people wake up one after another, but no one will be stupid enough to disturb the caster who is remembering the spell, and wait for Cremain to remember the spells he needs. Kerry was handing over a cup of reed leaves, which was filled with warm, clean water and swamped into the swamp. Kremar’s clean water ball was handed over to Kerry Ben, who today’s breakfast is reed root and Mushrooms, Plum's "Little Monster" attentively got a few crocodile eggs for them, but they all hatched and were sent back to the original by the elves. The result was chased by an angry female crocodile as far as a The little devil, of course, will not fear a stupid crocodile, but under the watchful eyes of the elf, Asmodeos can only grieve himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It brought back a message that a group of poor humans with their goods were trapped in several desolate grassy hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf is not surprised, maybe his sharp ear has told him long ago, but he obviously values ​​his companion more, the little devil is full of malicious thoughts, it seems The elves are not so pure and unselfish creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has indeed heard the faint, low-clutter message from the wind, but his companions, including himself, are exhausted, they Need a break to continue or help others. They met those people in the afternoon. They are a big caravan, with more than a dozen four-wheeled caravans, nearly one hundred people, look tired, but the face is not counted. Too pale, it seems that the time of being besieged is not long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mercenary leader was sent to talk to them, and he was very dead after seeing that there were no black-footed half-humans around them: "These should be Cursing for thousands of years!" He couldn't help but complain: "A giant snake scared them away. I really should tie a chain to their neck!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not very good." The elf replied calmly: "Are you lost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," mercenary The leader said: "We finally killed the serpent, but when we looked back, we found that except for the halfling who was swallowed by the giant snake, the others ran out. We waited for two days and two nights and could not see it. To their shadow," he pointed to a semi-sinking reed boat. "We can only push the reed boat in the same direction, but after a few days, I could not see the edge of the swamp. Later I found it here. After I saw my own scabbard, I found out that we were turning back." He yelled aloud and swearing: "This place can be It’s horrible, the pointer on the compass is spinning and the Star River becomes untrustworthy. We can’t find anything that can indicate the direction.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did your black-footed half-man run away?" he asked with great hope: "If it was just now. My subordinates and I can help you get them back. We can share them. I want the owner of the caravan." There won't be a little reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We didn't hire a guide." Kerry Ben said, then added in time: "But I can identify the direction, If you are willing to believe me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary leader shook his head in disbelief: "You are crazy," he muttered. "There are only black feet and half-length people." Only in this swamp can anyone come and go, everyone knows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
