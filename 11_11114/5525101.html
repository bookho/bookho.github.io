			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author has something to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for reminding me that medieval sugar should be more expensive than honey More rare adults (why can't I find that book review?), but it is because of the magic, so many places will be different from the real Middle Ages, just like the civilians described in my text, the days they lived. It is much better than the medieval ones. In my vision, magic plays a certain role in the development of science and technology in the world where the Lich is located, so this plane is richer and more diverse than the real Middle Ages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, let’s continue reading the text - because there are more aspects involved, if there are adults who have found bugs, please ask more, fish Thank you in advance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roasted roasted chestnuts, wrapped in maple sugar, fragrant outside Crisp, the inside is soft and awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has thanked the elf who brought him the roasted chestnuts, then sat next to the still sleeping stalker, chewing chestnuts while drinking The rest of the light wine, until the snuggling guy around me whispered to curl himself into a ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The low-light industry has gone, the Galaxy is about to appear, wake up, my friend," Kerry said in the gap between chestnut and light wine: "Delicious The roasted chestnuts are waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last sentence is not very rhyming," Kremar snarled, sincerely thankful that his current body will not Because after sleeping in the hard state's deck for one afternoon, there are two more BuFFs of stiffness and pain. "And shouldn't the world that needs to be saved be waiting for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If you want to use roasted chestnuts in exchange for the opportunity to save the world," Kerry said: "But do you really want to do this? This is the last chestnut picked in late autumn last year, miss this time. You have to wait until October of this year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"awwww...then still chestnuts," said the black-haired mage, "I prefer chestnuts." He smacked the fingertips of the sugary nose, and the wind blew there, bringing the chill of the coldness: "The wind is getting stronger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because we have passed the tributary and entered the Starlight River, an elf with a hair color that is deeper than Kerry Ben said, "We are going to be fully motivated, Kerry! He cried aloud, curiously looking at the black half-elves filled with chestnuts by both gangs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar cast a question Eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our current speed is forty miles (one grid is equal to one hour). "The elf explained with great interest: "After raising the flying wing, it will reach 80 to 90 miles. "This sentence is obviously for Kreima, not for Kerry Ben. "Do you want to go back to the cabin immediately, or do you want to feel the wind on the Star River?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has snorted with disapproval.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar is pretending not Hearing, but his eyes told Kerry that he was eager to try. "I might hinder you." He said hypocritically.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can avoid you," said the dark-haired hairy elf, "but remember to hold the ropes, the wind and the starlight river." Will take away everything that can be taken away. "When he finished, he bowed shallowly to Kerry, and disappeared without a trace in a blink of an eye.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your injury. "Kerry is reminding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Kremar put the Mithril Staff into the Dimensional Bag, and healing can make you look new. But the newborn skin and muscles are very fragile. It takes a while to restore the original toughness. "I think I can still find a way to solve this problem." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear long call sounds rise from the water surface, and the elves and their half-family are as easy as the brown little squirrels in the criss-crossing sails Jumping between the cables, they put the anchor rope away, closed the hatch, lowered and tied the front spinnaker and the rear sail, leaving only the huge main sail at an acute angle with the cold wind from the north - the hull On both sides, a silvery light emerges, and the Mithril film wing, which is the same length as the hull, protrudes from the back side of the ship's side, and is unfolding in constant tremors. The two strongest children with wind elements pass under them and obey. Powerfully hold up the wings of this bimetallic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship flies up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to describe the soul of the outside world, it is probably only the moment when the plane takes off, but the solid bulkhead of the plane will isolate the wind and water droplets that can suffocate an ordinary person. The ship can't - on the face The gust of wind came like a wall, crushing his chest, and the water it lifted was as sharp as a whip, but it was only the beginning. Kreima had tried to estimate the speed of the ship. But very quickly, as the entire hull was almost completely out of the water, he found that what he saw was actually not enough as a reference for speed. All the colors should be a line of light and dark but he can still distinguish When the rock and the squatting sun squat on the rock - it is obvious that his eyes are not a popular product that can only keep images on the retina for a fraction of a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mainsail of the standing swells to the limit, the elves rely on the exquisite Austrian rudder to control the Mithril flying wing, every fine adjustment will bring Another leaps in speed, at some point, the hull will still be out of the water, and the sound of the water colliding with the bow is like a steel axe striking the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the dark-skinned elf highlights, at this speed, everything that has not been fixed or can hold itself will be thrown into the rushing In the starlight river, and then wrapped up in the river to jump off the silver waterfall, if it is not broken, and someone wants to find it, then he can probably find some traces in the sea around Longhuo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry wanted to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method that the caster came up with was simple. He first let himself float and then wrapped himself with the Mithril string that stretched and shortened. Waist, let Kerry book himself to the top of the rear mast - he looks like a swinging kite or balloon (if this plane is there), but it is safe and does not affect any one people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Kerry Ben?" Kremar asked, the gray cloak and the black short hair were pulled straight by the wind - speed and weightlessness The pleasure is filled with his lungs and limbs. He suddenly wants to do something crazy, really. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I yell, will it be a bit rude or Who is scared?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry really laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, when it was the turn of the lich to occupy and use the body, he found that everyone on the boat would reveal a kind of time when he saw him. An eccentric and sweet smile, which made him feel irritated. He checked his body, but except for a few reels (which he said habits), everything was fine. He suspected that he and he were in his meditation. The idiot who shared the body did something stupid. He found Kerry Ben, and the Ranger who had been immersed in the endless abyss for 10,000 years immediately smiled and walked away - waiting for him to finally laugh back. When the lich was around, the lich had nothing to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the undead person has finally encountered a half-elves who are not swearing at him, he does not feel angry or frustrated, on the contrary, full The negative emotions of prevention and depression make him feel comfortable and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This male mage called Fenway (this is a fairy name) has a pair of mossy green eyes with deep and severe wrinkles on the corners of his mouth and eyes. The skin is slightly grayish - the kind of gray that has been lost in the elderly, which is rare in the gray ridge. Even if it is a half-elf, they will be in the two hundred to three hundred years in adulthood. Keeping their youth and vitality, the Lich prefers that they are born because of personality rather than physiology - his hair is grayish gold, and most of the residents of Gray Ridge habitually stay behind their shoulders or behind their backs. The long hair is not the same, it is trimmed very short, and the length of the two cymbals is deliberately reduced, completely exposing the ears that are not as long and soft as the elves but still softer than humans; The robe does not choose black or white like the human mage, but a dark brown like a ranger, with only a mysterious silver ring inlaid with emeralds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the manager of the Grey Ridge - a wizard assigned to Cremal, and the ship that raised the wing only used half a day. And one night arrived at the Grey Ridge, put down a boat of silk, salt and dyes, laughed and laughed, whispering to discuss a "cute mischievous little guy" elf, the same or more than the Ranger, and A lich who needs to exhaust all the self-control to keep calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of seeing the manager is short and easy, thanks to Kerry Ben, whether it is in Bibi Dibao, Baita or Gray Ridge, Kay Reuben seems to have a high degree of prestige and credibility, and even people around him will benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone loves Kerry, except for the Lich, and his guide, the former interestingly tastes the secret and dark sorrow - - A half-elf who has lived in the Grey Ridge for decades, carrying an elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Gray Ridge is not a lively place,” Fenway said. The tone is calm and indifferent, not a touch of extra emotion: “There is no market, shops or pubs. If you want to prepare spell materials, you need to collect and plant them yourself. Or take a boat to the White Tower; if you need food, then you can hunt and pick, but you are not allowed to go beyond the need to survive - unnecessary killing and destruction will lead you to be expelled, the benefits you receive, Whether it is money or anything else, it will be collected and destroyed. Graystone rarely needs money. The reward you get is generally related to the work you do. You can exchange it with your neighbor or friend. The things you need can also be handed over to our merchants who will exchange for flour, spices and other common goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray Ridge is an extension of the Silver Crown In part, it actually consists of a whole wide flat river valley and low-lying mountains on both sides. The tall, thick and leafy maple trees cover every corner of the mountain and even invade the river bank. Shrubs and gravel slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maple tree here is called the crack maple tree. As the name suggests, it will naturally split more than a dozen or dozens after the fifth decade of growth. Axe-like gaps, the branches and leaves flowing out of these cracks are transparent and colorless, with the unique aroma of the trees, gather them together, and after standing, they will appear white like milk, and then heat to remove the water inside, and the rest It is a thick, golden syrup like pine resin. These syrups are poured into stone or clay molds when they are hot, and when they cool and solidify, they are the most lovable maple syrup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author has something to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another problem with the network last night--Sorry, even the mobile phone couldn’t go up...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;鞠躬, thank you for your support and Reward! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloody glaze rewards 100 starting currency<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xiaotang...reward 100 starting currency<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sima Da wrong to reward 588 starting currency<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven and Earth to reward 588 starting currency<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
