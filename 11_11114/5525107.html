			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is the first to climb up, as light as it is no need to touch the trees at all, he stops on the first branch, looking down This branch is about 30 feet from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is thinking about what to do - if it is him, no doubt, he is ready for flying, but if you control this body is another A soul, what will he do? He will climb up like Kerry, not using spells, and the undead who once said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray leather cloak was abandoned in a luxuriant raspberry plexus that had already produced a mouth-watering red fruit, the lich I picked it up and put it in my mouth. I accidentally found that its taste was a little bit nostalgic. When he was a young and humble student, he often used the birds and the squirrels in the corner of the courtyard to fall down inadvertently. The fruit is always filled with empty stomachs - for this he has a lot of whip, but this will only make him deeply impressed by this rich and sweet berry, after he turned into a lich for many years After that, with the lack of taste and memory, it gradually faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he can taste it again. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Lich chewing raspberry efforts to climb, Kerry deepen this smile that he chose a pair practice, the wizard continues upward, he followed in Afterwards, the squirrels yelled at them, and the Rangers greeted them leisurely, promising to bring them a few plates of creamy mushrooms as a compensation to disturb their rest. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; in that partridge in the hills, Ranger has climbed to the top of the silver crown of the tree before it stopped, now it is the elves called shimmer At dusk, the Milky Way is faintly visible, but the light can still be called bright. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp /> light not only from the sky, but also from their feet - from the bottom up, you see every leaf is dark black Only the tip has a hint of greenness, but when you look down, the silver-crowned jungle is a layer of silver-like shattered glitter that rushes down from the summit of the Longji Mountains. Diffusion and paving in the latter's spine, chest and abdomen, even the strongest eagle, it is difficult to find its margins, it is like the snowfield in the morning, and the sea under the stars. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Lich does not know the sea like another soul as stupid blunt ignorance, he understood the Silver Crown forests from books and memories of the dead, but really place in them - This is the first time - with his fingers, his eyes, his heart... A short but rare blank passage in his precise thought circle, the part of the elf in the blood is making him It’s weak and dull, stupid and ridiculous, he wants to stop, but he can’t do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the silver crown jungle." Kerry Ben softly said: "Every elf and half-elf home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Yes, the lich wants Although the half-elves can only hide from the rain under the eaves - the familiar sting makes him find his reason, and the undead ridicules everything under his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has never noticed the same thing. He took a bunch of leaves from the silver-crowned tree, put it in his hand, and then spread his hands:" Look," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His palm flashes like a frosty light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster put his finger in another leaf, he repeated the action of the elf, and in addition to touching, he also tasted it in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is silver," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The roots of the silver-crowned tree are more developed than their stems, and sometimes you can still see them as deep as five hundred feet, they can absorb Metals in the soil and rocks.” Kerry Ben said: “It’s at our feet, the dark rocks are flowing with silvery rivers, and the secret silver and fine gold are like gravel and fish in the river, but with the water flowing The fine net is the root of the silver crown tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So beautiful, so rich," the lich whispered: "Everyone? Or only me?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every half-elves will be brought here when they are adults," said Kerry Ben. "Although you didn't grow up in Grey Ridge, I think You also have this right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you worry that someone will be angry because of greed?" The Lich asked: "Not because it is not enough." Smart, not because it is not strong enough, or because it is a mistake or a crime, but because the body does not belong to the blood of the elf, it must be arranged. Outside, 60 years is so long for humans, but for the half-elves, it is such a short, you bring a bowl of honey to the thirsty, but only allow him to sip a small bite."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is what we can only do for you." Kerry said softly: "Although I know that sometimes it will be a torture."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich did not ask the elves why they were not allowed to enter the jungle, even if the understanding of the world is only a scale and half-clawed alien soul, you can never imagine Such a huge and seemingly inexhaustible treasure trove will allow those dark and selfish sufficiency to expand to an uncontrollable extent. Except for the elves, no one can believe that they can face such a big temptation and thousands of years. If the day is unwavering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many times, as an evil person, the lich will also secretly speculate that whether or not the god of the world was created is also taken into account, and the silver crown jungle was given to this almost impossible to find weaknesses and dark sides. Race? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they didn’t talk, the lich rarely indulged himself in the useless, meaningless scenery and idleness until the last one was white. The warm breeze is gone, and the broad rivers hidden by the silver-crowned trees cover the sky and the sky is flickering in countless gaps - the compound leaves that fall into the river are washed away by the rushing waters. Camouflage, leaving only tiny silver particles, they are suspended in the water, wrapped up all the way down, deposited in the calm river bed of the gray ridge, you can hardly find it when you are close, only standing high, hanging You can discover this beautiful secret when you look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starlight River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead has decided to keep today’s memories for a period of time, one year, or two years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is leaving the most time with Kremar The elf is probably Yi Er, and she is eager to try every work and entertainment in the Grey Ridge with the half-elves of the black hair. She also teaches Kreima archery, weaving, catching spiders and rabbits, and how to dance under the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They dance under the stars, and the clarinet made by the harp, snare, flute and reed accompanies them, between the beaches and woodlands that are stared by the stars and the quiet night. Kreima almost saw every elf and half-elves who lived and worked in the Grey Ridge, except for Fenway. Since he got the dangerous spell material of the box, he never left his room any more. His face became more and more gloomy and his body became thinner. Only a few times, he would stand on the ring corridor and hold the guardrail. Searching for the figure of a lover, he can always see Kremar, when he sees Ilva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world does not like Fenway, he likes Ilva, he remembers that in his world, he has no brothers and sisters, he once wanted a sister - Ilkh and his imaginary sister are like that, more accurately, better than that - she is beautiful and intelligent, gentle and open-minded, strong and courageous, determined and fearless, she carefully looks after Guide the young caster, answer each of his questions, and extend his hand in time when he needs help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she is occasionally controlled by negative emotions, when Fenway and her dispute or simply refuse her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter in which world, comforting others is not something that the soul of the outside world is good at. After repeated considerations, he brings a small bunch of fresh to the female elf. The dodder is similar in shape to the bell. Only a dozen flowers with large fingertips are crowded together. Translucent, the milky white is embellished with emerald petals wrapped in golden stamens. Thick wool thread entangled together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's beautiful," Il said with a smile: "What do you want to exchange?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Not for exchange," Cremari said seriously: "Give it to you, do you like it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw Il He showed a subtle and strange smile: "So, is this a gift?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the soul of the outside world is almost answered, but he noticed that Ilva’s expression has changed, a little far from happy. If you try to describe something, it is "I saw your pants open before you can, but you still have a hay kitty. I want to tell you, but I am really embarrassed and I don't want to sweep you. After all, you are I want to make you happy. Although you are really amused now, I know that you definitely don't want to use this method. I really don't want to make you embarrassed. Let me think about what should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you have anything to forget to tell me? The soul of the outside world asked with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What, the lich said happily, you mean that in the elf's cognition, only the blood relatives and the beloved lovers can get a gift that is conclusive. Facts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- God! The alien soul screams, I didn't want to... um... think... want... want...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Is there really? The lich laughed at him. Do you know what color you are now? Dear, pink, I was the first to see such a lovable pink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- But she asked me to eat bread and sugar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Did you see that she also used your pyroxene powder? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——... Ok, anyway, what should I do next? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Protect this body, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the soul of the outside world has not understood the meaning of this sentence at the beginning, then when he was thrown into the air by Fenway’s throwing ball I already understand that I can't understand it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The author's words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you again for the reward!
