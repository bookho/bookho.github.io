			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of morning light Rosada, the priest Yadel, walked through the long corridor with candles, the candle wick was cut short, and even could not illuminate the most Above the cylindrical arch, the breeze blows from the end of the corridor, bringing the aroma of the rose flower, the sweetness of the honey pie and the sweet singing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that the guest last night was still asleep, but this cognition was broken when he saw the slightly open door, as young and handsome as him. The outsider sat neatly on the edge of the bed, wearing the white robes that he had known before, and Yadel shifted his gaze to his lap. He was one of the few pastors who participated in the dark battle yesterday, and he also gave him respectable Master, Ranger Kerry's friend has applied healing - he is the most seriously injured of all living people, although he has already drunk the healing potion and stopped the blood, but that only makes the whole wound look More horrible - no blood cover, whether it is broken skin, soft fat, open muscles, or fascia hanging on the epiphysis are clearly visible, it looks like a bad temperament The red robe is a living specimen created by curiosity and jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tearing part starts from the knee bend and spreads to the hip side. Some of the body has been lost forever, the scratches are deep into the femur, and Yadel makes himself try hard. Thinking about whether his remaining energy can restore them to their original condition. Fortunately, the god of morning light is still generous and tolerant. When you see the intact intact skin, it stretches and opens soothingly, covering the wounds that healed like a light back. At the time, he and Kerry Ben were relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the morning light." The pastor said happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the morning light." The young mage replied, deadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalal made a chill, and the candle in his hand trembled. He wondered why this room suddenly became cold. "Bright Rosada." The name of the whispering whisper, a warm stream of water flowing through his body, made him warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put candles and other things on the desk, walked over and pushed open the window, fresh air poured into the room, the slanting star river fell to the east, The farthest sky is already white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich stood up from the bed and walked toward the window, standing side by side with the pastor of the god of morning light. The priest closed his eyes unprepared, raised his head, and firmly clasped his hands. The ground is held together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen from their window, it is a huge banyan tree with many children. Further, it is the sacred place of the god of morning light, a towering tower building, the part that ordinary people can't get involved, the priest of Rosada. And the letter-writers usually greet the first morning light in the way of singing and praising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Yaldale is here, not with his stupid gang, is because of the rather rigid rules of Rosada’s St. - Everyone who has the privilege of staying here must be kept in harmony with the believers of Rosada, that is, to meet the morning light with them. In order to avoid some of the fun-loving guys who spend their precious time in vain between blankets and sheets, they will send a priest to knock on your door and head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the caster’s estimate, when the morning light was spread here, it was almost time to exchange at the table, and he was finally free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hotel in Baita is as noisy as anywhere else," said Kerry, "The house of Beavis is ruined for many years." Here, it is quiet and warm, and there are people who can take care of you." So he simply stuffed a cat into the kennel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, they were able to check in when it was afternoon, but the sunset songs still made the Lich feel anxious - although it is reasonable to say that the pastors are low Singing will only benefit the physical meditation and sleep, but his memory does not think so - when the lich is still a young man, the army and adventurers who come to slash his mentor will never Missing the priest of Rosada, and at that time in the many immortal existence, he was the one who was most often thrown out as a striker or bait, so many times that he could give a hatefulness in the end. The white robe slaps and sings, after all, he is as familiar with the annoying embarrassment as they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past he would deal with rancid cysts and cold tentacles, but now he can't even drop slippers, let alone others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a darkness outside the window, but that is the last darkness before dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Ranger lifts up the clean water with a clear morning light The silver cup, and then drink the water in the silver cup, the holy water cleaned by the morning light with the warmth and fragrance of the sun, the exhaustion caused by the two days and two nights of sleeplessness is as rapid as the new snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Tower's garrison and mages searched the entire dark passage under the guidance of Kerry Ben to find clues and astringent bodies. They failed to find anything valuable in the smuggler's guards, snakes and Foster. Letters or seals and the like, until Kerry took off the ring that once made a red glow, his original intention was just to let Antonio Master analyze the spells, but he immediately saw a slight gray trace. Passing businessman fat white fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traces are like five hairs juxtaposed. If you are standing there, you may be negligent, but Kerryburn Beyond human vision, he can see that this gray line is actually a pattern of secret silver rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a holy emblem of any god." The knight squinted and said, he picked up a branch and roughly drawn it in the mud on the lakeside. A rough outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think I probably already guessed it," the garrison captain sighed. "But I really hope I guess wrong."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait back to the White Tower," said the Ranger: "I will give you a more accurate picture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but before that, you should sleep well for a while." The garrison captain said: "Like the young caster, you can go to the sanctuary in Rosada, or go to my house or Antonio, but Don't go to the hotel, my wife will be sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar," the Ranger corrected: "I am preparing to take him to visit you, If I can, I hope that he can get the things that Beavis left for him as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is an apprentice of Beavis?" Guard Captain Said: "I am unfortunate, then, is that Beavis is dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Kerry Ben said: "The fire of his life and The fire of resentment is extinguished at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So he finally finished his revenge, okay, may he and his wife get rest," the garrison captain said: "I am today. I will be waiting for you in my room all day, tomorrow, but really, you need to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will rest," Kay Reuben said: "But let us solve all the things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
