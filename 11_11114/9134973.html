			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelsey’s lovers are a little excited, where is this? It is the center of Grenada, the place where the red dragon and its descendants are squatting. If it weren’t for Kelsey, they might not have the opportunity to step into it. Now they can even burn and kill, even though they are only humble. Slave, but it can also be worn as a feat on their chests. Even if Kelsey, who has always been tired of being old and tired, may no longer be with them, but what she promises is enough for them to stand in the king. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are on the corridor and in the room, but unfortunately, even if Crimmar has returned, he still does not have the same as some people. In that way, his home was completely cleaned up, except for his usual study and bedroom, as well as the rooms of the attendants and slaves. The rest of the room was still empty and quiet, there was no gold statue, no velvet curtain, even small There is no piece of furniture, only the vines that have been cut off violently have new tentacles that come in from the window and reach into the gaps of the stone bricks. The warlocks were so excited, but they knew that the shivering little animals had nowhere else to escape, they could always find them - a warlock put his hand on his own rune seal, he raised a little devil He can summon it to find those slaves when necessary, but he does not sign a contract with the little devil. He can only say that it is a costly employment relationship, but if necessary, he will summon it. After all, he can Get more from Kelsey. He used the corner of his eye to look at his opponent without a trace. Another lover of Kelsey, he knew that the other side had an elemental creature, and at this point, he had an advantage over him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What sound did you hear?" The warlock's opponent suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock listened to the ear, he did hear the sound, they came from the underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Each palace has a basement." The warlock said, "We should probably check it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I think those disgusting bugs may prefer a place with light." He said that the two warlocks looked at each other, they had a dark hair and a light-colored hair, but because of Kelsey's Like, they have very similar facial features, so that these two people who are completely unrelated are like a pair of brothers, but even if they are brothers, they are more willing to puncture the dagger into the back of the opponent or to cast spells. Into the other's throat - after a moment of silence, they almost laughed at the same time, "So," the light-haired warlock said, "We should probably part ways."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at who can get more of the catch." The dark-haired warlock said that the fierceness was hidden deep in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are separated, if they are coming to attack a warlock or a mage today, they will be more cautious, but they have already seen it, here only Some have only one priest who can threaten them, and the priest has rushed to fight, but they have been prepared, not only wrapped in magical robes depicting protective spells, but also wearing rune ornaments for protection. The light-haired sorcerer chose to go down. His body has a weak demon blood, mixed with the dragon's blood, which allows him to see things in dark places - just superficial, in fact Not only that, but his eyes can also capture the life of the living things in the dark, which makes him successfully escape the countless attacks and set up as many traps, this time is the same, he did not intend to let himself Peers know this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basement is obviously inhabited, and it may not be long before it leaves, because the warlock can almost feel the heat from the blood flowing in the body, as well as the saliva, The smell of sweat and tears, he walked down the wide ladder, and then stopped at the end of the four or five steps: "I saw you," he said: "Poor little mice," he Make a gesture, "Don't think that I am cheating you, let me see, one in the box, one in the light shelf, and one in the blanket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the sound of blood flowing quickly during stress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the gnomes was in the courtyard before, as soon as he saw such a terrible change, he almost rushed into the palace and did not want to The basement, like a naive mole, his companion asked what he had encountered and immediately wanted to escape, but where can they escape? This courtyard and the palace are not only a happy nest or a strict prison, the monsters and the attendants guarding here, they decided to hide, or pleaded to the first person who came in here, anyway, they are slaves here, in other The place is also a slave, and the submerged armor of the Mithril is very clever, and perhaps their new owners will look at them with a special look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," the warlock frowned slightly because the gnome mentioned the wizard. He didn't like these dirty things to mention words related to magic. It was like a shame. He stretched his fingers and suddenly broke out to make the gnomes Shocked, they jerked their bows, but then they burned without warning. The gnomes shouted and dropped their weapons. Their little short legs were like waterwheel blades propelled by water. It turned so fast, but in any case, the speed of mortals could not be compared with magic. The shadows they cast under the light squirmed, like the viper, clasped their legs, pulled them to the ground, and then They spread to their waists and chests as if they were alive, "Wait," a gnome shouted: "We are gnomes, we can work for you," the tentacles have caught his throat, but he Struggling fiercely, writhing, "I will tell you everything you want to know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock just glanced at them and walked away from them. go In the past, the tentacles were wrapped around their throats, and they were not going to die for the time being, because Kelsey made a clear request, she wanted to make the dark-haired dragon feel horrified, fear and resentment, simply suffocating Death can not achieve this condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dwarf," a gnome inserted his finger between the tentacles and the throat. His fingers came with pain, maybe they would break soon, but He can also let him say the last sentence, perhaps from the blasphemy, perhaps because of the previous grievances, or because of the hatred of the gnomes and dwarves over the years, he did not continue to plead, but sold out that was not detected by the warlock Companion: "There is also a dwarf," he muttered. "It's behind you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock suddenly turned around, a short spear jerked Hit his shoulder, but as the magic shines, it doesn't even pierce the thin layer of velvet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf jumped out of a sword, and the black-haired dragon gave him three rune seals before leaving, without the talent of the caster. The magic that can be cast makes him quietly invisible. The gnomes insisted on talking to the people, but the collapse of the knees of the old man knows that today’s enemies will not allow anyone to live, but he still gave the gnomes a bow, although in the end they failed to launch. Even if there was a smashing arrow, but the collapse did not happen, the gnomes would betray him, did they not think that he could rescue them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See the ghost of the poop!" The stealth spell lost its effect when he launched the attack. The dwarf wore the black iron armor from the jungle of the weapon. Jumping out and creaking, this armor is still made by the dwarfs. It has sharp steel long thorns on the tops of the elbows, knees and helmets like the traditional dwarf armor. The length and hardness can be A wild boar hangs on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock straightened his mouth in disgust, and when he listened to Kelsey’s curse, he put most of the reasons in Kelsey’s The mother brother is born with abhorrence, but as far as he can see, this dark-haired dragon is indeed quite deviant - how can he give a dwarf, a slave to create the power of hyperthyroidism - the previous bow and The weapons he saw can also be interpreted as being prepared for the attendants and the soldiers, but in addition to the dwarves, only the dwarves can be worn only by the gnomes. Not to mention, this dwarf created some troubles for him. He was caught in a ridiculous battle. His magic was ineffective in the dwarf's body. The warlock became angry and he wanted to seize this. The dwarf, then took the runes on him, they can be used as evidence, even if the dark-haired dragon is indeed favored by the new king and Grein, but his behavior is enough to cause doubt and contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf collapsed and bowed to the warlock. He thought he could nail the bad thing to the wall, but replaced the warlock’s original position. It was a pile of viscous strange objects. It not only accepted the spiked puncture, but also took the dwarf's helmet. If it didn't break down quickly, he would have to keep his head inside. The dwarf gasped, he thought the warlock would take this opportunity to burn his butt, but he didn't, the dwarf couldn't find him, he walked around in the heavy breath, the gnomes cried and asked him to help They are once, and the dwarves just spit them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phoenix held before the gnome fell to the ground, its light is extremely weak, but the dwarf is also one of the races that can be seen in the dark by nature. He looked down at the steps with his head down. The last few steps of the warlock were floating. The grease and small steel balls on the ladder did not play the role that the dwarf wanted to see before. He leaned down and wanted to get them. Go, and this time, a preset magic is activated, the rune on the dwarf flashes for the last time, and finally failed to offset the full effect, which collapsed into a black-nose white lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf lamb can be said to be stunned to see his hand, no, it’s a hoof, then he licks and makes a sweet scream - He is now a sheep, or a lamb, roasting to eat meat tender and juicy, his hoof can not even go up half a step, needless to say that there are his own grease and steel balls on the steps. He only tried once and fell to the ground with his four feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
