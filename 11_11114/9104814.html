He doesn’t even dare tell his mentor, his defense against Thunder Castle. The ruling is not as confident as people did. Although he originally proposed this theory to further reduce the soldiers and knights left behind in Thunderbolt, when he did, he always had an ominous premonition. Like the Miyun in winter, it is coiled in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked on the wall, three of the ten people who saluted him were dressed in robes, and Dylan was proud of it, after all, except for the Thunder. Fort, probably only the Grenada, ruled by the dragon and the dragon's son, can show this huge and elegant power to the world, but the young mage always remembers that he was at a very young age. What the poet heard, there is a description of Thunder Castle... They sang the thunderous Fortress like a mountainous, strong and tall triple wall, singing and wearing armor, holding a spear, like a steel thorn-like knight, singing bravely And the upright lord and Sir Alex, first Morton Don Cray, then Birdwin Don Cray, sing in the banner of their will and the people's will forever, Dyron looked up and stood on the sides like a blade. On the arrow tower, there is a blue-green background of the coat of arms belonging to the Don Cree family, standing with a grizzly bear. The Normans in the Highlands worship the Big Bear. Because the Big Bear is strong, agile and intelligent, this huge creature is neither as violent as a lion nor as a fox, but they can always guard their own territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know that Morton Don Cray knows that his most hated illegitimate child eventually smeared him, and everything he appointed as a successor, will not be in Thailand At the foot of Seoul, it’s awkward, mourning and weeping? But whether it is, or not, it cannot shake the will of Dylan Don Clay. Some people may find it ridiculous. After all, Dylan is not the old son of the old Don Clay. His mother, Princess Ang Principal, not only ruthlessly humiliated him, but also took away the status of the Don Cree family and the eldest son, so that one does not have a drop of Don Clay. The hybrid of human blood became his only son. In view of the unshakable dignity and authority of the royal family, he even denied that the child’s rights were not. No matter which man, it will be regarded as a shameful humiliation, especially when he sees Dylan Donkre’s face that he has nothing to imagine, even if he is mad, hurting or killing Dylan. Some people are surprised, let alone he just turned a blind eye to this child and listened to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes Dylan really doesn’t know who to hate? Always hide all the truth in the mother behind the fan? Any two fathers who know everything but are silent? Think of the whole thing as a comedy for a comedy? Ironically, he has always been called the first king of Little Don Cray? Those rappers who are rappers? Still young and trustworthy? He can never forget that when he walked to Morton Don Cray, the latter used his stern eyes and the long sword in the sheath to push himself away. He knew that his anger and malice were simply unreasonable, but they just Like a group of greedy vultures, whenever he returns to his room in the middle of the night, extinguishes the candles, and immerses himself in the darkness of meditation, they will slap the steel-like wings and take the wind and open him. The chest, take out his heart to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows that even after he knew that he was not a parent of Morton Don Clay, he still hoped to get his appreciation. This is of course a naive idea. He suggested to the first king that he might be able to send more mages to Thunderbolt. It is a future mage. His mentor once told Dylan that he will become a very powerful mage, so that he can still stand at the side of Morton Don Cray, even if he does not wave his wide sword or open the longbow. Get his recognition. The first king may have said, maybe not, but in the second year, Don Cray’s family lineage added a name to Birdwin Don Cray, he was just a civilian, a hunter, a soldier, but he had gray hair and gray eyes. He is a knight, so he can easily get something that Dylan can't get exhausted. The first time I saw the feeling of Birdwin Don Clay was really indescribable. The only thing Dylan knew was that from that day on, he decided to go against his nominal father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, the one who gave him the most support, except his mother, Princess Ang, may be his father, Fu Kai, but Dylan Donkley I feel that Fukai's greatest help to him is not the wealth and connections that ordinary people can't imagine, but the mentor he has found for Dylan, who has shown the talent of the caster, the red robe warlock Austal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal is a warlock completely different from the kind of red robe that people make, at least for Dylan, he can even be said to be a tolerant A gentle elder, although his requirements are equally strict and demanding in his coursework, Dillen can only taste the mellow feelings between his father and son when he is with him. Perhaps this is not wrong, the instructor in the caster The relationship with the disciple is more closely related to the relationship between the father and the son in the blood or surname. For about three years, Austal was always with Dylan, better than his two fathers. Dylan received not only the teaching and guidance from him, but also the love of the elders he had always wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any regret, it is probably Dylan’s, it’s a wizard’s talent, not a warlock’s talent, otherwise he’s willing to give up Highland Norman Everything, followed Austal back to Grenada to live and study. Of course, no, although Grenada never lacks a foreign mage, Ostal believes that Dylan can show his talent and strength in Norman in the Highlands. For this reason, he has praised and praised Dylan more than once. Wisdom and dexterity, especially the defensive law of the Thunderbolt, the Red Robes Warlock thinks this is quite... creative. "For a caster, caution is of course indispensable," Ostall said: "But More important to the caster is that there is a hurricane-like thinking and courage to be arrogant. At this point, I must admit that the warlock is stronger than the mage." When he said this, he could say that he was gently touching. On the shoulder of Dylan: "I am very happy that you have so many similarities with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disciple of the red robe showed a small smile. He unconsciously put his hand on the cold stone brick. The electric current on it hit him and inspired the protective spells on the pendant he hung around his neck. The magic of the light caught the attention of the two warlocks. They rushed in. When they saw Dylan, they bowed their heads and humbly apologized to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Dylan said. "You...do it very well." He stood down on the edge of the city and saw him tilt from here. The greasy ground under the walls of the city. After the Great War, the corpse of the orc was converged to avoid rot and the plague was called for a long time, but when there were hundreds of casters, the dirty and bloody bodies only needed to be burned fiercely. The black smoke and stench polluted nearly half of the blue sky, but the wind from the whistling plain quickly blew them away. Only the walls and the ground left traces of tragic, but it doesn't matter, the wind and rain will wash them away. And when the warm west wind comes, the grass under the wall will grow quickly, covering the last ugly stain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wonderful thing is your idea." A warlock compliments that he is from Grenada, but his body does not have the blood of a dragon, and His other half of the inhuman blood is also a bit inferior, so he has a rather humble and careful attitude towards Dylan, a true descendant of the dragon's descendants. Perhaps the people here don't know the red robe, but in Grenada, no one does not know the red dragon's son Austal, his position not only surpasses most of the warlocks, but even occupy an extremely important position in the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you cast spells," Dylan asked: "Do you feel any conflict?"<br /><br />&nbsp "No, adult." Another warlock said that he and his companions, like a Grenada monk, work for a mage, but not every red robe is willing to do: "You The defensive arrays drawn are as subtle and meticulous as the elves' locks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all of me," Dylan said arrogantly: “My mentor, Austal, gave me a lot of comments and directions worthy of reference.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No doubt,” the warlock said: “Austal The knowledge of adults is that we can't match it at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan smiled, apparently he was willing to continue enjoying a compliment for him and his mentor. Unfortunately, a knight ran up the wall and interrupted their conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember I had ordered it," Dylan said displeasedly. "The non-caster is not allowed to board the wall without my permission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please You forgive." The knight opened his face and let Dylan see his face. He was not the Knight of Thunder, but the Knight of the New King: "I must convey the will of my king. He is waiting for you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan Donkre waved helplessly, he knew what his cockroaches were looking for, since the Duke of John became the new king of Norman in the Highlands, he began Suddenly suffering, suspicious, especially after the inheritance law was forcibly modified, he did not even trust Dylan and Princess Chunan. After all, Leona was most threatening to him before he regained his family name and status. Probably the Princess Ang Principal and Dylan, who is crazy about wanting to have a child, he gathers many healthy and noble women, makes them their own lovers, and tells them, once they are born. a son, or a daughter, then he will stand Being put to death in the tower linger queen, made her later, and let their children become heir to the vast kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for a long time, no woman’s belly can swell up, just like his former wife, it’s been said that the seeds of the new king are too thin. So even if there is fertile land, it can't sprout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the new king more and more crazy, he not only drank a lot of strange potions (given that he has a mage and warlock around him), but also quietly to a few The devil or the devil offered sacrifices, but somehow, everything he did was unhelpful. He began to sacrifice to Gredi. In the king, almost even a hen holding an egg could not find it. When I arrived, then Dylan heard that he was searching for pregnant women, from refugees to civilians. Who knows? Anyway, he gave a wish a few months ago to dedicate a tower and affiliated building that belonged to the royal girl Leona to Greed, turning it into the main hall of the goddess in Norman, Highland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it is this that makes Gree finally willing to look to the anxious new king, one of his lover is pregnant, he is after determining this On the third day, he cut off his wife's head, re-established a marriage contract in the temple of Greet, and offered more sacrifices. Dylan knew from the priest of Greedy that there were two sacrifices. Not ordinary civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since then, the new king has fallen in love with the constant recall of Dylan Don Clay, asking all the questions he can think of, tempting his mind, Lun can be said to be helpless. He has no hope for the throne of Norman in the Highlands, but he also knows that this is not something that can be solved. Maybe he really needs to talk to his father, Fu Kai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
