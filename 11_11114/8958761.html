			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If Kerry can hear it, the soul of the outside world threatens, he will make you a cookie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It seems that you don’t have to be physically like this, the lich says slyly--I think it’s better to think of a way to leave here as soon as possible, new When the king was a duke, only one mage could follow him into the court, but he is now the king of Norman in the Highlands. His mage is calling in, and after a while, the mage here will be as many as a hound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey curled up and held his own feet, making himself as small as possible, and they squatted like a giant bear's lair In the size of the stinging ramie, it is a kind of castor. Ordinary ramie stems and leaves are full of stings, humans or animals once they feel it will feel as painful as being stung by bees, redness and ulceration - the toxicity of this stinging ramie is even better. If the child and the little beast are mistaken into it, they will even be killed by stinging - so although it can also be woven into fiber, only the lowest slave will be covered with thick mud. Collecting - In the kingdom, even servants can wear silk and linen, so they grow lush and wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the existence of the elves, the plants are very friendly to them, and the stings on the leaves will docilely fall down when they touch them, and the branches will be aware of them. The ropes moved and they expanded into a closed dark green space. From those tiny gaps, Fro's pastor could see the dogs and soldiers running around – she wanted to ask humbly why the caster did not Continue to cast illusion, let them keep the appearance and sound of the hound until they ran out of the king, but she did not dare to make even a little bit of possibility to anger the behavior of the black mage, she is very clear in this temporary team It is the most useless. Gülen is a veteran thief with experience. The Elf Ranger and the caster need no rumors. Baldwin is their best friend, and Luzer is worth 500,000 gold coins, only her. She didn't have any special things that could impress any of the above - she didn't know how long she could trust them. She was close to numb, carefully peeking at the gray-haired man sitting next to her seat, and he was bruised. His face was gray, but when the knight wanted to cut her head, he rushed out to save her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey warns himself that Baldwin may only be worried that the spells that would cause the wizard to cast after she was killed will fail to expose their traces, or It is for her testimony. But she still can't help but jump in. The joy is not the gold coin, but something else, but the more pure, more noble one. She was still a toddler when she felt it. Her mother, but since she began to learn to become a priest of Fro, she never received this wonderful feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's not in danger, Mei Mi may do something that she would be surprised to see herself – but now. She turned her attention to the outside world. The hound was driven and monitored by the servants and soldiers of the dog. It was struggling between two double walls. Plum quickly swallowed a sweet saliva. She knew why the Master no longer maintained that. Illusion, because after a round of search, there was a chance to breathe, and the servants who were full of doubts began to count them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two hounds stayed in front of the locusts they lived in. They had their tails and did not dare to jump into the green leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here?" asked the soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," said the servant of the dog. "They don't bark. If they smell the sinner's smell, they will call - maybe inside Hiding a rabbit or a groundhog..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier tried to touch the leaf and then plucked himself as if it had been burnt The hand, one of his fingers has begun to redness. In a twinkling of an eye, it became a carrot, full of water, and the crystal was bright: "It seems that no one can hide inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try it "The second soldier said that he and other soldiers raised their spears and stabbed them to the thorns and thorns. There were dozens of stabs." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar swayed his fingers slightly. Mei Mei closed her eyes tightly, and the sharp spears of the spears seemed to poke them at any time, but each time they fell, and the nearest thorn from Mei Mei smelled the mixed grease, metal and The smell of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one." The soldiers said that they left quickly because their companions had already fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They should have found out that we are gone." Kremar asked, he made a gesture to minimize the sound in this range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The new king is probably not willing to let others know that we took Bedwin." Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei observed them, she tried to touch Baldwin: "I used to have a mage friend..." She said a little embarrassed: "He It has been said that magic can instantly transfer a person and others to a distant place..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former lord of Thunderbolt shook his head gently, but before he said something, Gülen grabbed the plum, his voice was slight but pointed and thin, like a needle stuck into the ear of plum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Other places can," said the thief. "But this is the king, the lord's fortress, the mage tower week, the guild station, etc., and so on, even Where life is at stake, there will be powerful wizards to set limits on the transmission and magic traps of flying spells. If someone dares or is stupid enough to use such spells, they will not be torn by the plane storm or thrown into An unknowable plane - the result may be 10,000 times worse than the Norman New King's net, I think our caster will never do that," he smiled gloomyly: "Returning 10,000 steps, if he is alone, he still has a chance to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei glared at him and wanted to sip him But she didn't have the guts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While they are busy scorning each other, Kreima has cast another spell that will give him some advantage in the upcoming action. He suggested that he submitted his rough plan to Kerry Ben and Dazer, because the plan and his courtiers, the help of the two mages, were indispensable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is very simple and straightforward, more correct, a bit rude and direct, the big man is carrying the black hair caster, and the changing look indicates that he is estimating - - Not to estimate how successful the plan is, but to estimate the madness of Cremal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later he thought so, if he was caught again, it doesn't matter, he is a nobleman of King Norman, including his courtiers. It’s a big deal to pay a ransom; but if the plan is really successful, then he won’t have to raise taxes on the territory for the next three years and can greatly laugh at Norman’s new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try the theft and replace it after an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we mix in between them?" Mei Mi asked, several times the guards and the Cavaliers passed her by. She is almost scared to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are allowed to come in, but may not be allowed to go out." Gülen said, "The dog may not be." He did not quite understand why the caster wanted Setting their illusion as a group of dogs, now he understands a bit, chasing away the escaped criminals. The only one who rushed out of the gate except the knight and the guard was the dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope they will not bring a mage." Mei Mi said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Master will not act with those inferior people." Dazer Luzer said that he also raised several powerful casters and knew their The eyes are almost never looking down, but this time if he can go back, he can remind them of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pale golden morning light finally casts on the entire court, and the illusion is about to expire, Kremar has given up the original idea and started preparing another spell. When, under the command of the knight. The back door opened and they rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghosts made the difference, and Bydwin looked back at Wang Ting’s last look. He saw a solid wall and what was shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking at? My nephew?" Duke, no, the new king of Norman in the Highlands asked him, along the line of Dylan Don Clay’s sight. Looking down, I saw only a large group of dogs screaming, and the Cavaliers and guards rushed out of the court: "It’s weird." He said: "How can they disappear without a trace?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan Donkley looked up and looked at the magical galaxy that had already been like a pale imprint in the morning light: "Who knows," he said perfunctorily: There are always some whimsy available."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New King frowned: "Sometimes you guys are really annoying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not very good," Dylan said. "Don't you always want to form a mage group?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes...but..." The new king didn't pay attention, or he didn't care if he noticed it - the topic was moved to where he was interested. So he took his nephew's hand and walked side by side with him down the wall, and he continued to linger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape from the court is only the first step, the periphery of Wang Ting is twelve high The masonry of the tower and the wall connecting them, on the outskirts of the masonry, there are outer walls and moats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the king of Norman in the Highlands thought so. If someone wants to kill him and his children like he killed the owner of the castle, he has to cross a wide moat-like moat and then smash the solid outer wall, and then he will greet the twelve highs. The battle of the knights and soldiers stored in the tower is the more strict and firm Wang Ting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But time has passed for a long time. Even though Wang Tingli still lives with his descendants, the twelve towers still live with the descendants of his courtiers, but the latter’s loyalty is far less stable than their ancestors. The ideas, each with its own requirements, in this chaotic and critical moment, they are dedicated to the new king, while quietly gathering their soldiers, not using all the power as the new king expected In the pursuit of the murderer who murdered Pharaoh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the escape of the Grand Duke Luzer who made them feel more excited. In the reward given by the new king, the murderer of the Pharaoh was only 10,000 gold coins, and the road There are 100,000 gold coins in the Grand Duke of Zell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe we can get more, they said privately, if they really caught the road to escape, Luzer, can you take it? Taking all the ransoms, it was revealed that the ransom of Luzer’s Grand Duke was as high as 500,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the murderer of the murderer, even the new king is not so concerned, although many people think that this poor guy is only crowned. Jun Jun’s crimes - after all, he did not have the slightest motive to murder the pharaoh. All his things were given by the pharaoh, and he lost the pharaoh. Just like now, he has to flee like a mourning dog to avoid the new king. The noose and the axe fell on his neck - but in any case, since the new king has said so, he has been deprived of all honors and status, and the surname has become a sinner, then he is a sinner . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will speak for a serf child? No, there are many people who want to hang him by hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Wang Ting, several people in Bedwin were consciously quietly away from the mad dog group, between Wang Ting and the Twelve Towers. In the hills and hills, according to the orders of the kings, the trees that could be used to build the siege equipment were not allowed, but the shrubs were really lush and very strong. They quickly hid in them, and in a while their illusions also failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the tower of Fukai." Dazer Luzer said that they were only a few hundred feet away from them: "But it must have been strictly guarded. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not difficult to get in touch with the courtiers of Luzer’s grandfather. Although Kerry’s Ji Yun is delicate and violent, the necessary moments are also very Reliable, it took away the seal ring of Dagong, and quickly brought back the reply given by the Dagong Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
