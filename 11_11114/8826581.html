			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Xiao Xiao’s love from the pair is almost as much as that between his master and the hostess. He prepared a meal for Mei Mi. The brown-and-white Moorish horse, not old enough, the mare, this ** is not suitable for use in combat, but it is very suitable for weight-bearing and long-distance trekking, and also prepared a strong scorpion for her to carry her luggage. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei’s companions are puzzled by her departure, and some even sneer at her in the dark – the king of Norman’s kings certainly cannot It’s a good idea, but it’s obviously inferior to the four seasons, calm, serene and prosperous – in any case, they know from the bards and the Knights of Birdwin, compared to the gems and Fur, the king of Norman in the Highlands is even more impressive is its long and boring winter and the harsh laws of the same winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Temple of Fro in the Norman Kings of the Highlands has its chief pastor and pastor, and the wandering Pastor Fro is there to be accepted, but more It’s possible that they were expelled from all sorts of ridiculous crimes, or they were tried to get into prisons – the “resources” of some areas are not so rich, and the temples where the goddess’s service is already overcrowded will do the same. Pastors who are old or have no sense of freshness for the local people should be wary of new people stealing or robbing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple of the White Tower is empty, and the former Pastor Fro is walking in a hurry, taking nothing but the accompanying clothing and money. The guards arrived very quickly, so the luxury items such as furniture and silk carpet in the temple were not missing and were not damaged. The eight priests of the Froe could say that they lived happily, they Fro, with her dried sweet peas, jewels and gold, prayed to her to see which one of them would be the chief pastor of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, who is the youngest, most beautiful, and the most valuable offerings, who is most likely to get this position, but what Pastor Fro’s expectation is The glory of the chief pastor has not fallen on any of them, and their connection with Fro has become extremely vague and drifting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange woman came out from the pink marble wall that painted the men and women, she was more beautiful than the eight, smooth brown The skin, curly red long hair gently swept over the bare waist, black eyes flashed like a deep pool of water under the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thieves and an ogre with a disgusting smell followed her behind, to compare with the latter, only to find that she is taller and stronger than ordinary women, she is wearing bright red Silk robes, but no golden bells on the belt, but a short sword without a scabbard, a snake-like whip and a silver-colored pointed hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's serviceman looked up and wanted to swear the sorcerer who broke into the sacred ritual, but a thief jumped over and gave her a lot of weight. One slap in the face, she stunned her: "Shut up," he snorted: "Listen to the respectable lady."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His companion threatened to pull out his knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women in red robes showed an evil smile, "Don’t hurt them," she said. "They are important assets of the guild."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s rude to yawn, rubbing the gemstone ring on the finger, ring There is also a secret silver ring hidden in it. The sign of the guild is engraved on the ring. Before the whole strategy has been implemented, he is not qualified to be a fine net on his finger. Now he relies on himself. The wisdom, courage and ability of the entire White Tower (which may be included in the near future), they have to beg him to mark this logo, and it is a silver fine net, indicating that he has become the entire hidden guild leader. A member of the tier, but this time hesitated to become Demon, does he still need a guild? Although his apprenticeship is still in the hands of his mentor, he can invalidate the contract in many ways—for example, killing his mentor—thinking of it, Desmond shrunk, his mentor once Once annihilated a thief group with two people, and once let thousands of people who fled to this place due to famine fall into the swamp of spells, he is strong and cruel and cold, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Or, as he had planned before, use the fine gold Mithril, Xuemi Danhong in exchange for the contract? Just use the knee to think that Demon also knows that it will not be a small amount, and his mentor is as greedy as a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingjin, Mithril can be obtained from other places, but Xuemi is the unique output of the Silver Crown jungle, thinking that he must go with those elves again Demon and the snake, Demon was annoyed like sleeping on a red iron bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, even the wonderful ** he had hoped for for a long time did not make the new owner of this white tower more happy, the dawn has not yet penetrated the dawn of light and thin When he was in the fog, he left the comfortable couch and returned to his room—he felt a little peace of mind surrounded by scrolls and wands, magic potions, and spells. His eyes were in a roll of silk from the Temple of Fro Slightly stay on the blanket - the silk carpet is made of pink crystal, and the edges are woven into the beads made of rhinoceros horns and oyster shells. The depiction is a pair of red and naked men and women, surrounded by sweet peas. , pepper, ginger, cinnamon, onions - that is, the commonly used reminder * drugs, according to the priest Fro, who dedicated this thing, said this silk carpet on the bed of a couple or a lover, whether male or Women can get the comfort they never got. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these, he also got a small box filled with gold and gems. Demon knew what they were praying for. When he sent the invitation to Pastor Fro, he did not forbid them to tell others that the Temple of Fro in White Tower had been lost. Its owner, sure enough, he and the guild did not spend a gold coin to get nine young and beautiful Pastor Fro, although somehow, a Pastor Fro hurried away, but this is innocuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enchanting women who are experienced and skilled can bring considerable money and intelligence to the guild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he can't take a silver coin from it, or get a bad side message for free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Demon thinks he can still control himself. He knows that the lenient of the guild can be compared with the chastity of Pastor Fro, he and his mentor. There are more savvy hunters than the guild members he has ever seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let’s go,” he said, stroking his favorite gold-plated wand, chanting a spell and opening the darkness to the Chamber of Secrets. door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has an obsidian brazier that is almost the same as the Alva Master, along with the fire elemental plane, the little devil Asmoded who is not tamed and respects the master. Oss fell to the brazier - the flame did not hurt the little devil from the endless abyss. After all, its hometown was full of smoke, sulfur and fire, and even a certain therapeutic effect, but Asmodia Oss hated the magic circle depicted on the periphery of the brazier, which limits and weakens the magic of the little devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was before, it would not be caught by this fragile mage, but it was seriously injured when it broke free of expulsion, it almost died It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It screamed, the voice was small, with fear and humbleness, it knew that his temporary owner would be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are dying," Demon said proudly, looking down at his magic pet: "You will be sent back for a whole year, and You still need someone to summon you, you can come here again - this is full of food and fun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," the little devil pleaded weakly: "Don't... I can do a lot for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
