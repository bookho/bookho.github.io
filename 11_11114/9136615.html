			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longji Mountain Range, please allow us to think of it as a mountain like a dragon, and once stood on top of all creatures in this plane Dragons, whether good or evil, have sharp, long and flat spines on their backs, as do the Longji Mountains. The thick ink-like jungle stretches from the foot of the mountain and gradually becomes sparse. It is replaced by the sand covered with moss and thorns. Upward, it is a single and deserted rock formation, about one-fifth of the distance from the summit. The rock layer suddenly changes from a squat and a sloping to a giant that stands steeply downwards. Like a wall-like rock, although it has cracks and steps, the narrowness of the palm of a male person may not be able to lay down the bump. They can accommodate the hooves of the rams. They walk and jump on the standing rock wall in a mysterious and amazing posture. The form is elegant and calm, but it must be mentioned that even the argali is loose because the stones are loose. Or when the strange wind suddenly hits and falls to a broken fracture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs also wanted to climb the Longji Mountains and enter the silver-crowned jungle, but their damage would be a considerable amount, even if there were orcs You can step into the jungle, the jungle's locks and elf's bows and arrows will quickly eliminate this tiny hidden danger invisible - only the elves can walk on such a cliff without any trouble. On the side of the mountain that belongs to humans and elves, there are many grasses that are elicited by the elves. Pong grass is a cold-tolerant and stubborn plant that grows to a minimum and requires only a small amount of nutrients and water. A large group surrounded by two people, when the Singh elves visited the mountains, these grasses were the shelters they temporarily occupied, as well as food and water. The roots of the grass were thin and tough, like a huge The net will ooze a sweet and sour juice after crunching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these are not on the side of the orc. Even if the seeds of the grass are brought here by the birds and the wind, the orcs will only use whatever means. Pull them out to eat a light, just like they have only wilderness and no mountains. The orcs are a greedy race. They have nothing but cherish and long-term concepts. They only know how to consume them without limit, so they are in Gersh. Before, almost no leader of the orc tribe thought that he could become a king. They did not need to rule, they only needed to plunder and possess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what ugly chickens have to face. After a day and two nights, there is only one grass and two groups in her stomach. I don’t know what is left. On the third day, she fortunately met a zombie bird, wrapped in beetles, and the ugly chicken not only ate the bird, but also the beetle that did not escape in time was put in her mouth, the beetle was in her There were many bites on her arm, but she only saw that she was bitten. Her limbs were paralyzed. I don’t know if it was because of the dirty things I had eaten before, or the little monsters stayed in her body. The toxin, she trembled and fell asleep in the moonlight - she didn't know if she could wake up again, but on the fourth day she still saw the beautiful morning light, she prayed to all the gods she knew, and then continued Climbing up - this time, she is almost surrounded by rocks and gravel, the slope is steep, even when she is exhausted, she must be vigilant, so as not to accidentally roll over . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth night, she kneels and prays again, her stomach gradually loses vitality after severe cramps, she can't feel cold Hot or hard and soft, no matter where you can grab the loose skin, the ugly chicken knows that he is in a dangerous situation - she closes her eyes, and when she falls, her cheeks touch something, After a long time she could understand that it might be a bunch of plants, her nose twitching violently, because she seemed to smell something again - she used her last strength to open her eyes, and the thin fingers caught them. . The ugly chicken thought about it, even if it was grass, or something else, in any case, knowing that she is thinking about eating her fingers or toes, maybe those that could not affect her continued trekking. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled it up and sent it directly between the teeth. At first she didn’t know what she was eating, but as she was more tough than the average person, Gradually opened, her touch and taste came back. In the bright skylight, she saw that she was indeed eating a clump of plants, a cluster of wild onions, with irrational hypertrophy and juice-filled rhizomes at the bottom, spicy leaves. Even more so that her hands and feet become warmer, this can not be said from the wild onions, but also enough to pull the ugly chicken back from the edge of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken ate half of the wild onions in half a night, she didn’t know why it appeared here, and she didn’t know if there would be a second person. The slave slave escaped to escape here, but her husband is a hunter. In the deserted lodge, he always leaves a little fire, a few clay pots and some acorns or nuts, and put them Hiding in places that animals can't find, this is for those who are unfortunately lost. Sometimes, these things can save lives. These wild onions save the ugly chicken life, and the ugly chickens hope they can give another One person hopes and opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can imagine that such a rock wall can be tolerated by an ordinary human being. It is a barrier and wall that divides the orcs and humans left in this plane. Its bottom is even slightly tilted inward, many At the time, the ugly chickens are hung on the rock wall, but the ugly chicken must thank the parents for leaving her body. This body is not good-looking. It is correct to say that it is ugly, especially for a woman, but in At this time, it was the shield and spear of the ugly chicken. When she was impacting her own tragic fate, she fell twice, but fortunately, it was not too far from the ground, she bruised the flesh. But no damage to the bones, and these experiences are enough for her to climb to a higher place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the silky mist passes through her underarms, her toes and fingers tightly grasp the hollow out of the rock wall, and Her body is close to the cold stones, which are like a monster, endlessly taking warm body temperature. The ugly chicken once heard her husband describe how the bard describes the wind - they describe the wind as The girl's fluff also describes the wind as a rushing stream of water, or the wind is described as a sharp sword, but the only thing they have not described is that the wind can also become a hammer and an axe, they beat the body of the ugly chicken. She slashed her will and tried to strip her off the rock wall. The ugly chicken couldn't open her eyes and the breathing became difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these winds don’t know when it’s softened, the ugly chicken opens his eyes and sees a group of gray-fur argali around, they walk with ease Around the ugly chicken, the body almost showed a 180-degree angle with the ground. They not only blocked the strong wind, but also pointed out the place where the ugly chicken could be settled and settled. The ugly chicken was gratefully Following their guidance, she climbed up briefly, and on a small bulge she took a short break and wiped the blood of the palms and feet with dirty fur, lest the blood slipped when she climbed. At this time, the gravel on the top suddenly fell, hitting her back and the top of her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gray-black wolf appears above the argali, it is a thin, lone wolf, old wolf, ugly chicken can recognize, its fur is It turned into an ugly grayish white, but the eyes flashed with wisdom that humans might not have. It stood at the top of the rock wall and pushed the gravel down. Even a young and healthy wolf might not be here. A steep mountain wall captures a argali, but it can take advantage of this unfavorable condition. The rams panicked and jumped on the mountain wall, but the number of gravel was small but continued. Constantly, there was already a young ram that had not experienced enough to fall under the cliff. Fortunately, it was only a little scared, and found that he could jump up and escape without a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wolf’s eyes flashed a pity, but it has the patience that the younger generation could not reach. Before these rams found the way to escape, there were always two or three Only the yang sheep will fall under the mountain wall because of youth or aging, so that it only needs to crawl slowly and enjoy a big meal - ugly chicken can ignore this matter, this is natural The rules, but she still stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, a yang sheep was sleeping in her arms, ensuring that her body would not be cold because of the wind and stones, she remembered that warm But the smell of the smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up the gravel and shouted and threw it up, but it didn't work. The old wolf was just lazy, almost evasively politely. It may still be ridiculing this stupid human being, a piece of gravel accidentally fell down, almost picked up a ram with a huge corner, "sorry!" ugly chicken shouted, then she squinted Clap your hands and start climbing. The old wolf seemed to feel the threat. More gravel whistled from the sky. The face and head of the ugly chicken were hit. The blood blurred her eyes. She gasped, and suddenly a wet tongue stretched out. The blood on her face was taken, and the ugly chicken found that a small sheep was standing by her arm - really, she really envied these small creatures that could stand on the tip of her finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken's hand reached the top of the rock wall, and was caught by the wolf claws, but the old wolf's vigilance also made it lose the last chance to fight against the ugly chicken. These pains are nothing to the ugly chickens of today. She only sent her upper body with force. Then when the old wolf decided to attack, the ugly chicken slammed its nose and the old wolf mourned. The pain made it crazy, but in addition to the ugly chicken, there were rams that climbed the rock wall. It was a few male squashes with hard rock corners. They alternated into the old wolf and had little need. The place where the ugly chicken helped, forced the old wolf to the rock wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken heard the whining and percussion when the old wolf fell to the ground, but she was unfortunately unable to eat the wolf meat, she put her gaze on the argali I’m sorry, but... well, given that they’re just fighting side by side – but soon, the ugly chicken learned how to collect and swallow the grass from the argali, and the taste of the grass is certainly not as good as the wolf. Meat or lamb, but it can be said to be a dish of delicious food compared to what was eaten before the ugly chicken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
