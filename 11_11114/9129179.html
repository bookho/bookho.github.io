He has no clothes to wear. There are big and small scars on his skin. His hands are connected by chains on his waist. His feet are also, but the souls of the outside world are recognized at first sight. His characteristics have not changed - the round is like a pebble nose, the dwarf looks at Kremar in astonishment, the red robe on his body, the slave businessman snoring sternly, if not aware There is a connection between this dwarf slave and this generous buyer, and perhaps the whip and the red-hot iron rod have been beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have some gnomes here." The slave trader said that if he changed someone else, he would be willing to sell this stubborn dwarf as soon as possible, anyway, no A slave trader will be responsible for all kinds of problems after the sale, but the owner of the dragon tooth is another matter, but when he first saw the attendant of the adult, he thought that the master would buy a warrior or a mercenary. After all, He didn't even have his own guard. But what I didn't expect was that the dark-haired dragon needs gnomes and dwarves, or does he try to build some magical weapons or alchemy armor? "This dwarf is not obedient, and he is more skilled and gentle than the gnome." The businessman eagerly said that in fact, from the position of the collapse, he can be seen that he is different from other slaves - he was alone In an iron cage, no slave is willing to approach him—he bite off the neck of a gnome at the moment he wakes up. If the dwarf is not a rare commodity, the merchant will throw him to the Devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen use a lot of means to want this dwarf obedient, willing to build weapons and armor for the buyer, but unfortunately, he is as stubborn as every dwarf before, maybe It’s even more violent. He doesn’t need a businessman to torture him, and he’s going to smash his blood on the iron cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar only nodded to the attendant, and the female attendant with the demon blood immediately ordered the merchant to open the iron cage, and the iron cage opened and collapsed. The ground rushed out, the strength was like a wall that could knock a rock, but Kremar’s attendant only took a half step back and grabbed his shoulder and lifted him up. Into the dwarf's skin, the dwarf's rough and thick skin made him not bleed, but the screaming immediately screamed: "Too high, too high, too high!" He shouted in dwarf: "I want to vomit." Yes, really, I have to vomit and spit you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant moved his lips slightly and collapsed and found that he could not make a sound. It is. When he wanted to vomit as screaming, Kreima turned and made a gesture common to the dwarf, squinting and squinting, and of course he remembered the tall black hair. But the dwarf thinks he should wear a white robe before, and the cognition of the collapse has become a bit confusing - the caster's robes are not free to change colors, just like the dwarves' priests are also thick and dirty. The leather armor is covered with a white burlap robes, and it is evil to know that red is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman has wisely closed his mouth, why should he be too embarrassed, maybe the adult needs only a sacrifice, or this dwarf Knowing something that others don't know, in short, the dark-haired dragon doesn't seem to care if he will stand by the stove or the anvil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But about this, he guessed it wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" The collapse said seriously: "Is it armor? It doesn't look like it." He refused to take a shower but put on a piece. A long, comfortable robes for the dwarf, with bare feet and knees sitting on the rug in front of Kremar, his look is very serious. "I don't do things for evil."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakdown is a young dwarf, and speaking and doing things will make him look a little mdzz, at least the gnome McGee thinks so, but the lich and the soul of the outside world know, He doesn't have the same city as he seems, and this is known from McGee's drawings of the doughnuts that he has stolen from his hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not for evil," the soul of the aliens learns to sit on the rug like a dwarf and face the dwarf. "Let you see what it will produce." The purpose." Then, without any reminder, a strange woman appeared in the view of the dwarf collapse, she looked like a human, very ugly, no even a beard on her face, she had no arms, only one Dragging the oversized wings to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not right." The collapse of the shoulder and the wing connected to the place said that he may have never seen this bloody transformation, but is a dwarf Still let him see the uncoordinated place at first glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't balance," the dwarf said. "It will fall." The soul of the outside world nodded. "That's it," he said. "I have considered strengthening the muscles of her **** and shoulders..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the dwarf continues to deny: "It is still impossible to balance." He pointed at the legs and waist of the female beast, and imagined the pair of wide wings. If she adds strong muscles, her upper body will be heavy to what extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I want to add an exoskeleton to her." The soul of the outside world said that this solution is still a lich who looks for those shards of memory. Out of it, in its plane, this technique has only recently become popular among the general public. Ordinary humans equipped with exoskeleton armor can be as strong as a Hercules, but in a plane without magic. This exoskeleton armor can only be controlled by the outside world for the time being. It wants to accept human brainwave control. Just like the real limbs, the technical aspects are still incapable; but here, the magic replaces science. In the plane of the plane, this plan is feasible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf looked at the drawings in his hand again, and his eyes glowed hotter than the lava: "And then?" The dwarf said he was aware How dangerous this kind of thing is, but the dwarf's innate curiosity and creativity make his fingers move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then they will be used for me." The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will use it for those soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The soul of the opposite world Say, "I don't trust those people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you also caught?" The dwarf collapsed and said: "Like a collapse?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be said," the soul of the outside world raised his hand, and the female animalized person sat down slowly, their service life was not long, only However, after standing for a little while, her knees began to burst into pain. If she was in the hands of a businessman or the original owner, she showed a painful expression or revealed that she was overwhelmed and would be disposed of immediately. Here, she can take a break, and when she is not called by the owner, she can lie on the low couch with her companion and hang her wings on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf collapsed and reached out to touch her wings seriously, and then he touched the connected place, where the heat made the dwarf accustomed to touch The hot metal hands felt stinging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This armor will help them stand up." The dwarf said: "It doesn't hurt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "More than that," the soul of the outside world said in a low voice: "They can also help them fly in the air like an eagle, they will make soft wings into sword-like weapons, and people can't even find them. How dangerous."dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapse is silent for a while, he looks at the female beast, he thinks she will be afraid, or Will hate - according to the usual statement, a kind person should help them unconditionally, even if they can not restore their original limbs, then at least they should not be trapped in another terrible mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do as the adults say," the female animalized man suddenly said: "Dwarf, this is our own choice," she said: "Thank I am more willing to become a thief, an assassin, or a warrior as a plaything." She leaned close to the dwarf and let him see his face: "We have no country, no tribe, no Faith, but we are not born like this, we... I used to be a mercenary. When I have arms, I can wield a knife skillfully, just like you are waving your hammer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," she looks at the black-haired dragon, "If we can prove that we can work for a dragon - as the adult promised, he will try to redeem us." Friends and relatives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have relatives and friends?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My sister," female The beastly person said, "His lover, or a mother's child, a child's mother. ... "talking all the time she had been staring at the dragon-American hair, it appears to confirm the authenticity of this promise from his face in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf looked at Kremar and looked at the woman with long wings, "Okay," he said. "I can try." Say: "I remember you fought side by side with us. I want to believe you once, but don't let me know that you are cheating on me, or the axe that will collapse will definitely cut your neck."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
