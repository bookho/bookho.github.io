			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aya Elf describes indecently coughing - the friend’s betrayal did not make him move, the thief’s torture did not make him discolored, even the only At the moment of life and death, his face is only angry and persevering. There is no trace of wandering. Who knows that a bottle of therapeutic potion that is about ten times more common has distorted his face...Grenada What is the therapeutic potion? With the lizard's faeces or the rotten grapefruit, how is this thing that is sour, bitter, and awkward, and with a disgusting smell, made by the temperature of the goblin armpit? And unlike other therapeutic syrups, this syrup is as thick as a mud, like a vomit. The reason why he swallowed it is because he couldn't divide it into many mouths.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in fact, the effect of this potion is great, almost as he drank the potion, the bloody wounds no longer bleed, the outside world The soul took out an obsidian bottle and poured the clear, cold water inside. The healing speed of the wounds was as fast as the wings.It can be said that just in the blink of an eye, only a thick scar is left on his arm, and then the scar falls off, revealing a new skin that is more vivid than the surrounding skin. It is also fragile, just like the meridians and muscles in the skin. But it has not hindered the action of the elf, and when he stood up, he found that his strength has also recovered, his vision has become clear again, and the numb and cold fingers have been regained back because of blood loss. Sensitive touch<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head and tried to move his fingers. His pair of thumbs needed him to return to the Emerald Island and asked the priest to go to the elf’s father. Prayer can grow againThat is to say, on the way, he and Lucie will still be in a crisis situation, but the elf's nature is not greedy, he still has a heartfelt wish to save himself and Lucy... Grateful, at the same time, another emotion rises from the depths of his soul. He knows that it is shame. He refused the child ruthlessly more than a hundred years ago. He is not willing to kill. The dragon's son, who is a close friend of his own, has goodwill. Even if he has half of her blood, he does not hesitate to turn away when the half-elves of the black hair need them, but they need this half of the black hair. When the elf, he did not wait for them to pray for help as he did, and he extended a helping hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Does this elf know you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--I know the body of "we", the lich is not tireless to say that it should be cursed a million times of the bottomless abyss, he has no roots I thought I would see it in this place, um, this Aya elf, he didn’t even want to think about it, because this elf is holding a memory that is unbearable.Ah, it’s not that the elf cruelly tortures and humiliates him, but the latter always makes him remember with the humble little, even the years that he can’t protect.You know, the processed memory has become very thin, but as soon as you see this guy, it is like a piece of old film tape that has been colored (of course, this is what he sees from the memory of the cohabitees) Just suddenly become clear<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, he still couldn’t show his talent. The new king seems to have forgotten that he still has a son, and Greed’s sight has not yet fallen to him. On his body, his clothes and blankets were taken away, and the food became bad and scarce day by day. He lived in the palace like a mouse or a pile of weeds. He heard it. The waiters and the maids mentioned the other half of his body, and he knew that his black hair came from his mother, an Eya spirit, and he knew from those words that the Aya elves were Grenada’s Dragons despise and hate, but they do have to be stronger than mortals and other races, and they are powerful enough to treat them as enemies.Because of this, when he did not receive any kind response in Grenada, he began to transfer his emotions to another blood relative he had never met – maybe they would accept him? Since he has their hair color, the shape of the man, his situation will not change even worse in his fantasies. As long as he can leave this delicate prison, he is willing to do whatever it is, anyway, he is willing to become a giant. Dragon and Dragon Enemy<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, just as he was praying hard, his mother’s old man appeared. He came to retrieve his mother’s relics, maybe A brooch, or a ring, may be an important gadget. When the young half-elves see those people - they have pointed ears, black as late night hair, and white as a moonlight complexion. As well as the dark-eyed bluish eyes, he rushed out without a moment of hesitation, whatever, he didn't even think that they would treat him as an enemy...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, what happened later? The lich thought, at that time, he did hear the Eya spirit shouting out his mother's name - this is what he heard from the attendant, yeah, not only hair color, his face is also with his mother. More similar, not his father - the new king of Grenada has a feminine and glamorous face that is biased towards femininity, but Kremar’s face... although it can’t be said to be as stiff as Birdwin But it does have a distinctive outline that is unique to the elves, not to mention his pair of eyebrows that are raised like eagle wings and those that are soft when they are not tightened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf said, is it necessary to send him back to his mother's knee? Of course, this is a kind decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the elf who is now in front of him said, no, he has evil blood, he can never hear the god of life, Angelus Shouting, he will only indulge in the dust of the wasteland and become the food of the devil and the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t kill him, if they did, maybe the story about Kremar could be over before the opening, the lich did not leave Deep in the sea, he does not need to observe, and he knows that this Aya elf may be grateful and shy, but he will never regret it. Even if time turns back, he will still push the young half-elves away, just like It is to push away a sinful creation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aloha..." The young elf whispered softly. She saw that the old man’s injury had healed and the blood color had returned to him. On the cheek, but he turned a blind eye to the rescuer's extended arm, but stood up against the wall. His look was very strange. He seemed to be both vigilant and kind with this unusual red robe... she Unspeakable emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the behavior is slow because of the elders in the elves, the souls of the outer world are aware that the lich’s emotions are slightly fluctuating - But that kind of volatility is as slight as skimming over the surface of the water. It keeps this change in mind and decides to wait until Hume to ask the Lich. As for now, since the undead, the Highness of Grenada did not stop it. Its behavior, then it is acquiescence - in other words, it can do whatever it pleases, the Lich will solve the problems after it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired dragon does not stop to take out another bottle of potion, which is much less swallowed than Alokh, the bottle is small Can be placed in the hand, he handed it to the elf girl - the chain has been removed from her arm under the influence of magic, she should be very painful, and the blood loss also makes her a little dizzy, but she is not only low Shouting, there was no other untimely shouting or crying - the soul of the aliens blinked and realized that she could not pick it up with both hands, so it opened the bottle cap for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucie glanced at his uncle Ai Luohe, the elder elder nodded calmly, and she immediately smiled, one can illuminate the entire prison The smile of the room, she did not wait for the help of Kremar, but leaned down, as if the lips of the rose petals touched the fingers of Kremar, his fingers were really cold, she thought, biting The neck of the bottle, the sweet potion flowing into her tongue, she couldn't remember how she drank it, maybe it was like a small fish, she slipped into her throat - any pain and anyway Thirst, and hunger disappeared in a flash, leaving only the fragrance and sweetness of the mouth, "Snow honey," she took a deep breath: "This is the snow-capped milk of the silver-crowned jungle."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloch almost couldn’t help but glance at this horrible red robe warlock, but he also knew he didn’t have that qualification, but he was seeing Lucie’s eyes. An ominous premonition occupies his heart, and he reaches out and grabs Lucie’s arm. "We want to leave here as soon as possible," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait." The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alohe and Lucie turned around, but one was full of vigilance and the other was full of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is for you." The soul of the alien world said that he knew that once the elves entered the natural land, they would get countless allies, but In his plan, no fewer than 30 members of the Dragon Thorn sneaked into it, and the tops of the two cliffs were only rocks, and there was no dense vegetation that could obscure the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucio reached out earlier than Ai Luohe and took the little lizard leather bag, which is a spare pocket, which contains The scroll, wand, and rune seal of the lich. There is also the wand that originally belonged to the leader of the city. Fortunately, it is not a one-off. As long as they hit it against the wall, they can choose an unmanned ladder and window to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the sun disappears," the dark-haired dragon said: "Or before you get out of the shadow of this mountain, don't use any transfer-like spells. Being restricted, all transmission-like spells will fail." But there are two reels in the pocket that can hide the trail, which guarantees that they can safely leave the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloha only felt a painful piercing into the heart, he had to admit, maybe this child does have more blood belonging to her mother, but he still Nothing can be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
