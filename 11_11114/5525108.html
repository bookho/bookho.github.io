			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar was tightly held by a turbid, gray, spherical, rotating gas, and he was thrown high and swept through the cracked maple The treetops fell into the Starlight River from about a hundred feet. The river was hard and cold. If he was an ordinary person, he must have been fractured and the internal organs broken. Fortunately, his body is like a newborn. The young dragon was so strong and strong that he only had a dizzy dizzy except for the pain caused by the violent impact at the moment of hitting the pebbles at the bottom of the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floating!" The undead in the sea screamed: "Immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His voice is more painful than the impact of the soul of the outside world, but out of trust in another cohabitant, he immediately followed this order, just as his toes are out of the water, The lightning that illuminates the entire gray ridge flies along the ground, and it breaks into the water, which produces a brighter purple-red light, spurts the smoke and makes a loud noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Fenway coming out of a damp, willow, with a cold face, he raised his arm, gestured, and released a spell. But now Kreima has set up a barrier, the fireball hit the invisible protective wall and broke into countless Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-gold short hair wizard did not move a small amount of new material from his sleeve, and Kremar raised his hand in an attempt to disintegrate His spirit destroyed this spell, but Fenway seemed to have long been expected. He steadily moved three steps to the open space on the right side, and did not disturb the spells and spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames of the radiant violently engulfed Cremari. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, Ilva’s golden arrow arrow rubbed Fenway’s arm, she also wanted to interrupt this spell, but Fenway dropped a The trick made the latter person unable to catch up in time. She crossed the mage with anger and wanted to rush into the Starlight River. She saw that Crimmar fell again and was caught by the older caster. Arm, pull into your arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway’s anger is not inferior to Ilby’s, but the thin, yellow face has a cruel and happy smile, this smile makes the female elf shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him die." He whispered, "This is good for everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilva pushed him hard, and the power of the Ranger was impossible for the Master to contend with, especially when he had no intention of hurting her, Fenway let go of her, step back and turn to the one who is helping Kremar from the water. The elf standing up: "Leave him," he declared slyly: "Otherwise I can't guarantee that my spell won't touch you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm screaming!" "I'm just a misunderstanding! He has been..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been with people all the time, it’s almost His amulet, "Fenway took it indifferently. "But you have to tell me that in his short life like a mouse, I have never encountered even a bard?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ir’s pause, indeed, since the reed and the harp, apart from the gods, wars and legends This beautiful, wise, powerful and long-lived race, everything they are involved in is worth singing and listening. The most talked about is their love. The elf has a long life, but only gives his/her loyalty to a lover. The most way he or she shows love is to give a gift that symbolizes love. Gifts - although the names in the songs are always exchanged, and the other races are different, but this old bridge is always chewed and chewed, but it is an indisputable fact, unless Cremer It’s a blind man, or you can’t explain why he doesn’t know anything about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...He is still a child!" said Yi Er. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway smiled sarcastically. "But it has made you pregnant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage The voice was soft and low, and Ilva was like a slap in the face, and she narrowed her eyes in disbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves and half-elfs standing next to Ilva looked at Fenway with disapproving eyes, one of them wanted to say something, but was yelled The action was interrupted - the female Elf Ranger took a deep breath and took a step forward, pulling the distance between her and Fenway to a suitable size, then waving her fist and hitting the ground. One slammed Fenway's jaw and flicked him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." The Lich happily commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world agrees, "That must be very painful," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, when they walked past Fenway, they could see a row of inverted beautiful letters imprinted on Fenway's skin. Today, Ilva did not wear the gloves with the small silver ring. Also carrying a ring with a name, this makes Fenway look like it is the property of Ilva, and notice that this elf is snickering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s an accident, the Lich said, but it’s a good opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Dry Fenway? The soul of the outside world joked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Also say - the lich didn't say it well - you told Irk, you are worried about the box of Fenway, if She asked how you know that it contains dragon blood and demonic blood. You said that it was Yadel telling you. Anyway, he was drunk that night and couldn't remember what he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The soul of the alien world is puzzled. I wanted to remind Kerry Ben before, but you refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Fenway grew up in Gray Ridge and has served for Gray Ridge for 50 years. He is also a lover of Ilva, although he has a bad temper. There are also a few friends, and you only stayed in Gray Ridge for fifteen days. Don't you think that a guy like us who doesn't even know the familiarity thinks Fenway is a dangerous person is a ridiculous thing? In particular, we can't find a witness, and we can't find a piece of evidence. When we can't collect a testimony—when this little misunderstanding hasn't happened, your rash move may make the elves resent and dislike us. I don’t even think that Grey Ridge is better, I don’t want to see this happening – but now it’s different, Ill’s only thinks that you’re out of revenge and jealousy, so it’s okay to go Let's talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——But she may not care! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——That’s nothing to do with us, I remind her just to avoid some trouble, but don’t want trouble to come to my head – don’t say That name, yes, is the name of the sub-parent of Yadel. The language of the dragon is not that every mage has the opportunity and enough wisdom to learn, not to be versed in the ability to reverse the name of the variant, Beavis in this regard. There is no such thing as a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Who is your dragon language learning with? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alien soul waited for a long time, he thought he could not get the answer, so when the lich asked to answer, he was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- My father. The Lich said that he sank into the depths of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager of the Gray Ridge was complaining when he complained to him Laugh out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful ranger pleads, her cheeks are red, two Only the arm is hugged on the chest: "Can you imagine? Krimaar, even if he is only twenty years old, even if he calculates it in a human way, he is just a grown-up, naughty and arrogant, but Fenway, life. The goddess is on, he is already seventy years old. If he is a personal class, he may already be a great-grandfather! And he is still so childish!" She paced back and forth in the manager's large room, frowning, sighing Qi: "And...Fenway's..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The special spell materials, this he and I declared, every," Consoling her: "That is to prepare for the destruction of a dangerous spell book. Sometimes, the darkness will devour the darkness. You still remember how the sacred priest connected to destroy two infinite abyss. Is it a magical prop? He found that he can’t use bright spells or pure When the holy water purifies and melts them, he throws it to an old red dragon, and with its evil flames, he succeeds in making these two things cease to exist in the world. Fenway is also planning to do so, Ilva, After El Lucin left Gray Ridge, he was the strongest mage in Gray Ridge and the most loved of the Grey Ridge. He was the one who would not betray the Grey Ridge."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you are just worried about him," the manager said, "but sometimes, the wizard does It's hard to understand, and he may still be worried about the fact that he must leave Gray Ridge after ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will leave with him," Erzhen said: "In his three hundred years of life, we will go hand in hand, and we must stay away from each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that your love will melt his The doubts are uneasy." The manager said: "Why don't you tell him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twice, the first time I had a big fight with him because of the child's affairs. One," Il said angrily: "The second time, that is, yesterday, I just wanted to talk, he told me that he thought that Kremar was a warlock."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
