			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada’s kings have regained their calm, but compared to the last time there was a fear of fear and anxiety, this calm will make people It is much more joyful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger of the ancient Red Dragon Mother has subsided, the merchants are busy, but this time they are not busy selling slaves, but buying slaves - The three legions of Grenada ransacked every manor, city, and country. Gold coins simply spilled from their pockets. They used these coins to exchange merchants for potions, reels and armor weapons, and so on. Then use these gold coins to buy the slaves that the Grinada and other buyers are desperately needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the map, we can see that from Grenada to the Snow Covered Marsh, there is a road that becomes more and more vivid because of the blanks. Nada's dragons are not good at governing a country, or they don't bother. These territories were divided into Grenadas who were not Grenadas. Some of them were even residents of this land – they knew very well how they got status and power, like the Highlander. Like the princes who had been appointed by King John of Man, they yelled at the dragons of Grenada, only to hang their ass in the air, but for those survivors, they were as terrible as demons and demons. In order to get the owner's favor, they can't wait to knock out the bones of everyone and scrape the thin marrow oil inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no civilians, no merchants, no craftsmen, no knights, no lords, except for the agents of Grenada. Only slaves who are engaged in all kinds of labor, they have ropes around their necks, and they can’t be released all day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Yadel feel ridiculous and sad is that those who are lucky have not been included in the regions and countries that must be destroyed by the Red Dragon, their governors, the Grand Duke and the King They have bowed their knees without seeing the red dragon flag. They are almost eager to offer loyalty to Gree, and the ranks of gold coins, silk and slaves are walking through the gates of the kingdom. - The war launched by Grenada received a second gain, which was more than the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These materials are like the fresh blood injected into Grenada, and the huge heart that has become tired and weak because of the continuous war has once again jumped vigorously. The Cavaliers of the Dragon Tooth Legion have been planning to change their mounts in secret. The Lich knows that this is exactly what Mittitch is planning in the dark. After all, he never really gave up the dragon teeth - obviously, these knights are actually on their mounts. Being controlled by a fine powder is uncomfortable, and perhaps expensive, but who can guarantee that these sly monsters will not betray their owners because of the powder? Everyone can see its effectiveness, and with the exception of Kremar, the entire Grenada, no single warlock or mage can get similar powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They whispered in the pub, is it better to replace that mount? Some people have proposed Peng birds, which have eight wings and eight thousand pounds, but this proposal was quickly rejected because their numbers are too rare, even if there is enough army to control the number. The food they need to consume every day is also a heavy burden. In any case, this is not a day, two days or a few months. Later, some people have proposed the Winged Warcraft, which has the same wingspan as the Peng Bird. The weight is about half that of Peng Peng, but its eyes can't be seen, and it has become a big problem. Of course, they can train this kind of Warcraft through sound waves, but this is completely a strange path, no one knows that it will happen. What? In a gibberish, there are still people who mentioned the human face bird demon, causing a sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, some people mentioned the Griffin, a kind of Warcraft that looks very similar to the lion-faced lion, but its position is often neutral. Or it can be said that it is biased towards kindness. They may not choose the Grenada people. "Our warlocks will make them fall." One knight said this, while others agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is," said a knight, carefully. "Gryphon is also a big cat..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich does not care about it - although it has been effective against his knight to report this, but really, the eagle The lion body beast is already the best choice for the dragon tooth knights. The evil monsters are not available anywhere - as the knight said, let a large neutral race of Warcraft fall, so The behavior will undoubtedly attract the attention of pastors and druids. This is not the state-to-state. They can fully intervene. The warlock towers in the kingdom of Grenada are also lost in these battles. A lot, they probably won't allow their members to continue to be consumed in inexplicable conflicts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
