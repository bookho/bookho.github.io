			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The succubus’s response is a violent roar, but this anger is not so much from the heart or disguise, it’s not to say A temptation, her skin quickly turned from a faint gray-blue to a bright, pale rose, and the linear black coix quickly expanded, reflecting the face of the summoner, her body slightly trembled, the frequency of the fine It’s like, no, or, that is, a means used by the succubus to highlight the charm. The curly hair rises high from behind her, like a tentacles or a vine, which grows tightly around each other. On the neck, pulling the captives to dump themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich does not mean to resist, the temptation of the summoner and the summoned is over, if he dares to reject it again, then the property of Ferry Hill The temper may not be as mild as this one--no one knows who the mother of the Grazite is, and some people are not maliciously guessing that it may be a water ghost, given her skin color and hair color. Weird, but she is indeed a succubus, and inherits the blood of Grazt. When she is willing, she can also use her charm to capture any male or even female. But it is precisely because of her different appearance from most of the succubus, she may have a small inferiority complex - the anger of a succubus that is summoned but rejected is perhaps smothered with soul gems, but Ferry Hill is not the kind of object that the lich dares to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her limbs are entangled in the lich, and the curls that seem to grow all the time have occupied the entire room between a few breaths, they are like waves Ups and downs, even if the undead person once bent his knees, he never felt that he was in a room completely built of large stones. All the touches were soft and tenacious, elastic, and charming. The devil spit out his breath, and the sulphur is strangely mixed with the mellow and decaying scent. Like the scent of the devastated but not rotted flowers, it wraps them like velvet. This is a kind of The strange smell is so strange that people can't easily forget it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curly hairs slid into the silk that clung to the hot skin of the dragon, they were like countless fingers, and they were like countless tongues. They wrap around, search, rub, and when the distance between their master and the summoner is shortened to the end, these slender little devils frantically slap on pale, smooth skin, leaving layers of small Scars - and the long tail, covered with black and black scales, moves like a viper from the legs of the dragon, and as its owner screams in excitement, it changes into a whip. The broad and beautiful back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Summoner took Ferry Hill’s arm, and he straightened his body, lightly and toughly put the succulent charm on him As a result, their bodies are still tightly connected, but the position has changed, and when Ferry Hill is dissatisfied with the loss of dominance, the lich’s fingers slide down and gently sink into full heat. It is well known that the finger of a caster is always exceptionally dexterous. Since they can make complex and unusual spelling gestures at a speed that mortals can't capture, of course, they can find the position that makes Ferry Hill out of control before the moment - the succubus slams his body, she screams The sharp teeth pierced the neck of the male, and the blood of the powerful life flowed into her throat, but the lich did not refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In return, in addition to those who violently twisted and tightened, Ferry Hill heard the dragon’s name shouting her name, she He also answered him, and the magic hit them at the same time, together with the ultimate feeling brought by the body, at least for a moment, Ferry Hill was very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am the first time I met a warlock like you.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak Hill said that she is now in a state of lameness and her expression has become very mild. She is lying in the lich's room, with a fine gauze texture. The cockroach has been pulled up high and through the horseshoe-shaped floor-to-ceiling windows and doors, they can see the pale purple blue sky and the mossy green cliffs. The succubus gently strokes the soft pillows and cushions underneath, feeling the lingering Abomination and sorrow - the soul of the outer world will certainly not accept the content of human hair, but the lich will not remind it to pay attention to the tassels and embellishments on these common utensils, so it will not Know that the round white beads are not pearls, but the human bones polished after being dipped in wax oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but for the Greinadas, the attendants around them, and the succubus that now occupies the room, they are normal, if one In the red robe room of Renada, there is no one or two pieces of decoration or utensils made of human body parts, which will make people suspicious. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bottomless abyss is down," said Felix Hill. "You know what I'm talking about are the annoying guys in white robes..." The succubus's gaze stunned for a moment on the lich: " Seriously, I can almost smell the abominable smell from you. This may not be the fault of the short robe. You are not like a warlock at all, especially a dragon warlock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich’s hand with the glass of wine is not shaken at all. The blood wine sinks in the golden cup, like a solid red amber: “It may be because I have half of my body. "The blood of the elf," he explained quietly: "My mother is an Eya spirit - she left me with a lot of things, my hair color, my eyes, and the vitality and purity of my blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferke Hill rolled his lips. "I am full of curiosity about your father." She said rudely: "How did he get a wizard?" He should be a dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bloody "The former undead said: "According to the analogy of mankind, he is the third generation of Red Dragon Grid. As for how he and a Eya spirit gave birth to a descendant, it is nothing but deception and coercion, nothing. It's worth discussing in detail." He delivered the glass to the rich lips of the succubus, letting the cold metal gently press the dark mucous membrane, and the succubus couldn't stand the temptation and opened his mouth and swallowed a big drink. After that, he leaned forward and removed the cup and replaced it with his own lips - it was a long, kiss, and the succubuses liked to kiss, because they most often used the essence of human life. The way of smashing is squeezed to the point where there is no deposit. Felix Hill is no exception. Their tongues are fighting in each other's mouths, resisting each other and hooking each other, sometimes rubbing each other's upper jaws with their tongues, and sometimes rubbing each other's gums with their tongues, each Minor changes can bring a tremor of current. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should sign a contract with me," said Felix Hill. "I will let you... let you become a demon directly, not pitiful." Awkward locusts." She rubbed the black hair caster's throat with her fingertips: "You will be a good succubus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't ask for it. The Lich said, but he knows that this is just a sweet candy, signing with the devil, without the need to extract the magical energy of the soul after death, and to become a low or medium demonic or devil's caster. No, but they have all paid a huge price, including the devil before the death, the devil played for a lifetime, the slaughter of countless lives, or the ruler - like now, he has not even let The daughter of Grazt sees her worth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is," said Felix Hill. "I have never seen a warlock who is so good at cooking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a slight improvement to the poor cooking style here.” The Lich said that the soul from another plane has a lot of dissatisfaction here, but the strongest A little bit more than a monotonous meal, although it feels like barbecue, stew, candied fruit and the like is not bad (at least not at all, it will not delay its food), but it will still be annoying with it every time you dine. Cohabitants licked a lot about the cooking, cooking, and cooking, and when it was in control of the body, tried to make this poor, more palatable food in the food, get more learning. opportunity. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although even if you just put a bloody dragon leg in front of Ferry Hill, as long as it has the power she desires, This succubus will never be furious because the appearance of the food is not refined enough, but it is clear that the carefully prepared meal can cause her desire and hope. The taste of the devil can only be said to be human food. Pingping, after all, they are a kind of wild race that is accustomed to even seasoning, but the demon of this level is still aesthetic, and there is a pair of arms that are laid out so long after the silver plate is unfolded. The meat of a triple corolla made the lich a lot of tongues in her favor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ingredients used to marinate these meats are nothing else, it is the painful potion after extraction, a potion that the warlock and the wizard can make, from Tortured by the caster's soul, and then mixed with remorseful tears, often used forever casting spells, or used to raise ghosts, or directly drink, but Felix Hill must admit, The meat used to marinate the dragon is also a pretty good use. The lich also put on the leaves of some bayonet vines and devil trees. These leaves taste a bit bitter and they also squirt blood, but for the devil it is simply refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I have to admit that you are a careful and awkward guy," said Felix Hill. "You make me feel interesting."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
