Byrdwin, and Birdwin had respect and gratitude for Leona in addition to love. In addition, they are in love, the thieves have no love, but he also knows that men and women at this time are the most unreasonable, even the lover's face has a pussy sore, they will think that it is stained with roses A drop of dew on the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little dispute," Kerry Ben corrected, "a little dispute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good "A little bit of a dispute," Gülen said from the good: "But what are they arguing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has hesitated, he doesn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't understand what it means." The king of Norman in the Highlands said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is probably a trap," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If they are so expensive, they just set a trap to catch or kill us, then they can do it in Baita. Lee Aona patiently said: "You should understand that if this thing is true, what it will mean - it is a huge wealth that can shake a country!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin shook his head. "If it's so important, then they shouldn't let Anzhen steal this secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Maybe she is involved..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible," Birdwin said: "She is just a little girl."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Aona sighed: "So what do you think we should do? We have only 3,000 soldiers now, and we must be alert to the lords of the Dragon Fire Island - I I don't know how many people will support me from the heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they will support gold coins and gems ? It "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Leona looked directly at Baldwin without fear. The man was tall and good-natured, but since he could become the lord of Thunder, it shows that he is not ignorant of his power and politics: "Humans are It is selfish, why are they loyal to my father, the landlord of Norman Norman, and why those people are loyal to my uncle John, interests. Dear, for their own benefit, farmland, serfs, Vineyards, lakes, weapons and armor... Of course, not everyone’s loyalty needs to be exchanged. My father does have some loyal and good-hearted courtiers, but they have their own children, their wives, their own knights. They can't give up all this and only ask their souls not to be blamed and tortured - even. Byrdwin, your crimes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin The ground stepped back, like a venomous snake biting in his heart. "What are you talking about, Leona, the gods are on, do you think... think that one is in charge Will the gods with the axiom be bribed by the wealth of the mortal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not," Li Ona shouted: "But at least, they can admit you." It’s not guilty, Byrd. Your sin is not here, isn’t it? Tyre is on (Bedwin instinctively shrinks when she says the name), you can of course use up your surplus Life is begging for his forgiveness, but how long is it, ten years, twenty years, thirty years? My lover, you are forty years old, how short is the life of a mortal, do you want this? Is your name mortally dying and dying as a sinner in exile? Then your soldiers. Your knight, those who love you, support you? Don’t you hear that? And have you seen Dylan Donkre’s work? Don’t you miss Thunder Fortress? You live and fight for decades, it belongs to you. Byrdwin, it will belong to your children in the future... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of this, we can't What to do!” Bywin: “If... If I could have a child in the future, then I hope that I will put him on my horse and tell him when he looks at the Fort Lauderdale. His father is upright. Go back to this place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just need an opportunity." Li Oona retorted, "Don't you want this? You don't have nights and nights. Don't you just go back to Thunderbolt? Don't you feel angry? My uncle John and Dylan's actions will only push Thunderbolt and Highland Norman to the edge of danger, not a curse, but if they The act of repelling dissidents continues. How long do you think Thunderbolt can last? One year or three years? Bywin, what is behind the double wall? It’s Highland Norman, our country, millions of human beings, they can live safely and happily, relying on the soldiers of Thunderbolt to block the orcs from the south, if the Thunderbolt is penetrated, then they What will be ushered in? My lover, my hero, I know that it is a difficult and painful thing to give up the principle, and even... will form a hindrance when you return to Tyre, but now is not the time for us to hesitate! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," Leona continued: "We know now, the fine-net guild may have an inseparable relationship with Grenada. You know what kind of country it is, you think it is gaining this unexpected wealth. What will happen afterwards? Create a more comfortable and healthy living environment for its citizens?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin is silent, he certainly knows Greiner What kind of country is this, the country ruled by the red dragon and its descendants, has the most red robes and an amazing number of mages, where the mortal status is rather humble, except for some sturdy and powerful businessmen. Although ordinary human beings are called civilians there, their unprepared life is no better than the slaves of Longhuo. In Grenada, the only good job is to become soldiers and knights. Once they enter the army, their families will benefit, and the needs of the military will always be the greatest compared to shops and hostels - the highlands. Although the Normans are militant, there are at least a few allies around them, and the Grenada under the dragon's wings can't be described by bloodthirsty. Every country and region bordering it has a big size with it. Small wars or battles - when the blood flag of Grenada’s army flutters in the sky, everyone’s heart is tightened because the army is not afraid of death, but also for them. The enemy has no compassion, and every battle prisoner will not be left behind. Even the noble knight or nobleman will only be shackled, and the headless body will be hung on the pole. The place where the poles stand in line is the new border of Grenada. After the selection, the humans who have not escaped are forced to migrate to places they are not familiar with. Parents, children, husbands and wives and brothers and sisters will be broken up. Gender and age. In the past ten years, they have to work with wooden shackles, and some will be sold to the Longhuo Islands. In the past 100 years, the transactions between Grenada and Longhuo Islands have been quite frequent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately. Grenada is not a rich place. Whether it is a field or a mineral, it is quite barren. Not to mention the secret silver, even the stock of black iron is pitiful. Several neighboring countries have been able to curb the expansion of Grenada. speed. In addition to the white robe and the paladins, it is that Grenada still needs their wheat and steel. After all, their soldiers are still humans, they need food, and their weapons and armor cannot change their spells, but they only Be brave and frightened, and calmly and bargain with the violent red robe warlocks, trying to minimize the output that might be a deadly threat to their country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a country that refused, yes, its ruler refused to pay even one grain of wheat. The result was that the three wings of the dragons ruined their kings with endless acid and flames, although they were followed by Tyre and Rosada, as well as by other followers of the gods. It was a frightening and helpless fact that a companion was lost, but the direct bloodline of that country was completely cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if Grenada gets this wealth, it’s different. Leona and Birdwin are not businessmen, but they also know how powerful a businessman can play before great interests, as long as the giants of Grenada The dragons are not fascinated by the ghosts. Every gold coin is firmly grasped in the paws, under the belly of their own, they can circumvent the army and the gods, and send all the things they need for the Grenada. The dragons of Renada are so greedy. No one knows where they will stop when they can do it, but they can get a glimpse of the ambitions of the fine-net guilds. This is a huge organization that even the elves are too late to get hurt. It is even more control of a city (and perhaps more is just unknown). But before that, even Alva Master and Kerry Ben were not aware of this. They had been fleeing and fighting before. This time they escaped from the White Tower and temporarily repaired and waited for Kreima in Beitburg, and Master Alva brought a very bad news, that is, "fine The branch of the guild is like a suffocating suffocation after the rain, and it appears silently in any place that can be said to be dark. In the past year, they have had a lot of guilds with the original "Silver Fingers" and "Stoise" guilds. conflict. However, because the "fine net" guild has a sufficient relationship with the caster, the latter two guilds do not have an advantage in these battles. If it is not because of their deep foundation and wide network of contacts, they may have been exhausted by the "fine net" guild. - The battle between them has affected many caravans and ordinary people. Just last month, a businessman who had a good relationship with Alva Master was extorted two offerings. The first one was proposed by the "bad thorn" guild. The poor businessman stuttered to the messenger of the "bad guild" guild that he had given money, but the messenger (perhaps because the merchant had two beautiful maids) told him that because of "fine mesh" In the war of the guild, the guild is now extremely scarce of money and weapons, so every person who passes through their sphere of influence will naturally be stripped of the second layer of skin.) Of course, the businessman does not dare to say no to a thief’s dagger. Two money, but before he entered the Bibi dike, he was blocked by the "fine net" guild. This time he could not even leave the goods, when he walked to the gate of the city of Bibi Dibao. Waiting, the guard thought it came a new refugee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master is worried about this, now he only hopes that the wars of the three guilds will end soon and achieve the best results - that is, three losses For this reason, he has contacted many long-lost old friends, and if possible, he will push it at no cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the "fine net" guild is just a tail that Grenada has extended. Birdwin simply can’t imagine if this country can get enough The money, how sharp its claws will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
