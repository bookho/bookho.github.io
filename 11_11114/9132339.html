			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich certainly does not know that the mentor in the Seventy-seven Islands is thinking because of his occasional flash of thought? 21?? is being eagerly missed, Although the demigod lich has obviously forgotten that it will only sneeze rather than cough by one person, but what about it? In the mentor, even the entire seventy-seven islands, it is difficult to find a willingness to make one and a half because of these little things. God's lich, unhappy person or dead<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received a routine award, and was fortunate enough to once again glimpsed "Mother" Gredi - verbally submitted a test piece of rune fragments, after Only have the opportunity to return to their palaces - the dwarfs and the three dwarfs have created twelve exoskeleton armor, equipped with female beasts who are willing to accept this gift, not surprising, still some people prefer Abandoning this rare opportunity, they have no family and no expectations. They have chosen a calm death and are grateful for it.This situation also occurs in girls and boys with cat ears and claws, because the transformation is not for them to be changed back to a normal human, but a monster, so some of them still do not want to Enduring the pain, after determining that their new owner is a benevolent person as they suspect, they use the potion to let them fall asleep until the poison in the beast's blood penetrates into their bone marrow and then causes death.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other unfortunate children who have to give up because of their weakness and eventually have to give up. The dwarves put a black iron on their little chest. Shields, shields are small, like a large brooch, but this is the courtesy of the dwarves for the warriors, more rare than the secret silver chain or the fine gold spearThey don't know where to bury him.In Grenada, the slave's final place was only the beast's stomach, and later the collapse decided to burn them, and then the ashes and the shields were poured into the molten iron. The molten iron was cast into a sharp dagger or dagger, and was held by their companions. Hands<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what the survivors expected - warm rooms, plenty of food, clean water, sheltered clothing, and what they could not give up Loved ones and loved ones, these have also been fulfilled. When the black-haired dragon became the new master of the dragon tooth, there are always countless merchants willing to work for him, not to mention those fathers and brothers who belong to him. Concerned, but what worried the new king is that Kreima’s performance is still not good enough. His behavior is actually ridiculed by many people. Yes, the black-haired dragons did not recruit powerful warlocks, fine knights and intelligent Instead, the merchant puts precious energy on a group of despicable toys. They can understand the distrust of the Grenada people, but can these deformed beasts truly be loyal to him? They will plead with him for what they want, and of course they will flatter others for the same thing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s not that the Greinada people have the so-called loyalty. Loyalty in Grenada is just a symbol that symbolizes interest and violence. Without the support of the latter, the former will only collapse in an instant.But if the Highness is willing to choose his colleagues or classmates, he can at least get a group of useful subordinates, and what can these beasts do? Use their little claws and small tails to tickle the enemy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good"The collapse said, he removed his shield. The shield is faintly visible to the three scratches on the opposite side. It can leave such a deep scratch on the shield of the steel, even the lion's body." They may not be able to do it, but because of their generous masters, all the claws that have been replaced and installed together with the bones are pure gold. "Do you feel pain? The dwarf asked with concern<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not so painful"The opposite side of the cat's ear beasts replied that if you feel pain, of course, these fine gold claws can be folded in the meat pad like a real cat, so they must be connected to command Their nerves, like the exoskeleton armor of the winged beast, can only be decorated with their own minds without the command of the mind - but that means they can feel every stroke of the paw. Playing and hurting is like human beings can feel their fingers, but this method may give them the most unexpected weapons. When they are hidden in soft fluffy fur, no one can imagine what they will be. powerAs he thought about it, he gently twitched his tail. Their tails were regrowth and implanted like claws. Instead of the tailbone, they were also fine gold. They were wrapped in strong muscles. You can hang a fully armed dwarf or two gnomes with the power of the tail alone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that they know that they are just a little bit of trouble in front of the real knights and warlocks, but now only the dwarves are able to train them. After all, he has been a warrior for decades, and perhaps the oldest of the winged beasts, which makes them a little restless.Although the souls of the outside world didn't think about asking them to do something for themselves and their loved ones, but even if they didn't have the lich's reminder, it knew that unconditional giving would only make people feel fearful and stunned, let them know themselves. What is still available is the most important<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Would you use us as an assassin?” asked a bold female animalized person, her wings flapping gently in the air, looking so light and fragile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe." Once the undead said: "But I think that might be more similar to an unexpected gift."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we are dead," another female animalized person asked, "or was caught..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It's best not to be caught." The Lich calmly pointed out: "But the bigger possibility you won't be caught, the body won't," he said slowly. "The soul won't." The tone he used to say this made all the people present unable to tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can guarantee that," the Lich continued: "You will not suffer more pain anymore, no matter who you are, you can’t mourn the wasteland. Find your traces in the ashes, your soul will rest in peace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your family has moved away from Grenada," said the Lich. "Only I know where they are. That place may not be rich enough, but it is absolutely peaceful, no war, no too cruel." The ridiculous lord, there is no Master, but there will be a priest in Ilmot or Tyre in the village."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words make the people look Suddenly warm and soft, they may not have the possibility, and they don’t want to see their lover and loved ones again, but they can know that they are no longer slaves or sacrifices, and they can live in other places safely and securely. Enough - a Grenada person may laugh at them without doubt Long black hair had been deceived Americans, but as a start to be informed and they are exceptionally clear, they are worth less than the value of a Long-American lies, especially in the Hispanic or dragon prince Grenada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will they die?" After they left, they collapsed and asked, according to the dwarf's tradition, wearing a long coat and leather armor, the beard shines. Golden light. He spent a lot of time in those rooms where he didn't see the sky, but like all the dwarves, even if he didn't see the sun for a hundred years, he only worked and drank ale in the cave, their skin would still struggle than in the desert. The surviving barbarian is more rough and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hope no," said the Lich, at least the other soul in this body is so hopeful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time, the new king who is troubled by his unusual scorpion is rummaging through his chess pieces, Ming, Dark, Year Long, young, just (yes, no joke), evil... Kreima’s character is still very confusing so far, you said that he is not part of Grenada, he can accept A gray robe can also raise a hand to destroy a tribe; you say that he belongs to Grenada, but he is willing to take expensive Mithril gold for those despicable and useless beasts - although this can be summarized In the experiment, but the ratio of getting to losing has obviously lost its proper balance, and he does not seem to like unprovoked killings. He is even weak in the face of hostile people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, wait, if it is another way, he can also say that those people have learned a painful lesson - think of their eldest son complaining Kreima’s mount sucked a powder addiction in the lion's lion that lured the Dragon Tooth Legion and took away the last gold coin in the Dragon Knight's money bag. The new king couldn't help but smile. For a moment, he knew why Mittite was a little uneasy. His eldest son originally wanted to empty his brother and make him a flag of being attacked by the enemy, but in fact, he became the weapon and shield of the youngest brother. It’s not that he’s decisive, maybe even the control of the first team will be lost – they’ve made similar predictions before, the dragon knights will only be loyal to Gree, but not necessarily so loyal to their leader. They will be bought and will succumb to powerful power, but now the scene is not even thought of by the new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His nephew is actually an awkward businessman who monopolizes the only goods and takes away the knights’ coins instead of the other in order to get their support. And to dedicate their own money sacs, the new king can imagine their dejected appearance, but before the end of the war, before another powerful beast replaces the lion's lion, the only thing they can do is patience, maybe they still To be grateful for this, the dark-haired dragons allowed them to exchange the powder with slaves who had not seen the trace. Even the warlocks in the Warlock Tower did not find the powder in the place, they could only detect that it was a magical plant, no toxicity, and talked about addiction - in fact, the lions and lions also They can't touch them at all, but the beasts haven't thought about curbing their desires from the beginning, but this is also a helpless thing. After all, if their mounts are noble and temperate, there is no such possibility. Will be in harmony with the Red Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
