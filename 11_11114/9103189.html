Ice house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't really care about the distribution as originally." Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world looked at him: "But I don't want to," said the black-haired caster: "I don't want to find my companion the next day. Mixed in the seals of the seals to feed the puppies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan laughed, the smile was a bit horrible, maybe that is why Perant wants him, himself The reason for a room with McGee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing here?" Perant asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The son of Nanuk asked if we should participate in the division of whales." Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have they started whaling?" Perant said with an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It shouldn't be," Kerry said. "The killer whales attacked a small toothed whale. The Alatitians drove the killer whale away, but that The internal organs of the toothed whales should have been broken." At this time, the Aratiat boats were near the shore, and the men in the seals of the fur coat jumped off the double-headed ship about 30 feet in length. Some of them would On the ship, some people took the unfortunate toothed whale on the shore full of dark blue gravel. Perant walked over and placed his hand on the toothed whale. It had stopped thinking and heartbeat, but it Life will continue in the human body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allatis are not anxious, they let the waves wash the toothed whale, like the last elegy that nature sang for it, Sa Fully crawling out of his igloo - his dress is just as bright and colorful as the parrot on the island of Longhuo, the seal skin is dyed in various colors, embroidered, hollowed out, and cut out. Fringe, his head is topped with a snow bear's head, his eyes are inlaid with amber, and it looks like he is still alive. The bizarre open mouth makes it look awkward, and the snow bear's skin is whole. From the head of the shaman to his ankles, he slowly paced around the toothed whale, then lifted his own dart, pierced the eyes of the toothed whale, one by one, and dug the huge blue-black eyeball Come out, they are held in the hands of the shaman, round and without flaws, like two gemstones that are intentionally carved into eyes. The shaman is step by step to the cold and cold water under the watchful eyes of all. Throw the eyeball into the dark night of the dark night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the sacrifice of the Alati people to the god of the North, but the whole process is not only too simple, chaotic, but also feels the fluctuations that the casters can often feel when they are watching or participating in the sacrifice. The god Wulou Tiru has been sleeping for thousands of years, and the lich is hidden in the sea. Perhaps this is not a rumor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it may be enough for the Alati Lit, who is the first to wave the bone dart, starting from the back of the eye of the toothed whale, each vertical The cut marks are as wide as the adult male's body. Then he climbs the back of the toothed whale and cuts a long cut mark horizontally. The black skin spreads out, revealing the white fat and the bright red meat. The Alatirit went up and hooked the whale's flesh with a hook that was so big in his head, and another Alatiist raised a short dart with a grip on one side, waiting for the whale's flesh. Being pulled down a bit, the second person puts the dart in and cuts the whole piece of meat along the skeleton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanuk saw the elves and their companions, and smiled and swayed their palms. This gesture is common everywhere. "We only need one." Small piece.” Perant said: “Who is going?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I.” Birdwin said, then glanced at Liona and Ge Lan, this "I" is more than just saying that he is alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This despicable work is not suitable for the king of Norman in the Highlands." Gülen said that the dagger had rotated a fancy in his hand and was stuffed with him. In the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Gülen go," said Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When other people agree, the souls of the outside world can't help but think that they also think that Gülen is a bit uncomfortable recently. Speaking of thieves is also too bad luck, like other men, fell in love with a Fro priest at most to worry about being betrayed by her, teased by her or simply disappeared, or Mei Mei unfortunately died It was normal on their adventures, and Gülen could bury her and put a small flower on the grave. But in any case, it will not be worse than it is now - she can't say that she is alive, nor can she say that she is dead. She left a hope for Gülen, like wearing a hole in his heart. Then use a thread to pass through, hanging above the bottomless abyss, let him **** night and night by the burning pain and cold sorrow, can not break free, do not want to break free - the soul of the outside world Worried that Gülen would be so crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on." Birdwin swayed at Gülen. As they walked over, the Alatilites gave them a position, the middle section of the toothed whale, the thickest fat, the most fat meat, Although Baldwin did not hunt the whales, he had eaten at least the big fish. He took out the key points at a glance and immediately went to all the Alati people for a half-hearted ceremony - the Alati Lit yelled When they got up, the elves couldn’t help but be a little surprised. Then they found out that the screams of the Alati Lit were not because they saw something terrible, but only sincerely praised the perfect work of the former Paladin and a thief. - Baldwin didn't even want a hook. He took off his gloves, his cloak and his coat, bareing the arm of the Mithril. His fingers were like the lava that touched the ice and snow and easily penetrated into the flesh of the toothed whale. When he stepped back, the thief's hand-drawn dart was embedded between the muscles and the skeleton like a shadow. He pressed down the dart, and it was as easy as a little girl to open a piece of whipped cream. Wen firmly continue to retreat until a complete skin of whale meat in my hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should have a banquet for this." Liona whispered, and Baldwin lifted the whale meat up in Alati. The cheers of the people showed it, and when his eyes met Leona, they immediately entangled and could no longer be separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I smelled a sour smell..." The soul of the outside world muttered, and Kerry, who was standing next to him, immediately bowed his head and sniffed. The death time of this toothed whale may be less than half a day. In this harsh climate of dripping ice, how can there be no decay time and opportunity, except for the fresh blood taste, he did not smell anything: Was the squid broken?" He whispered, and the Alati Lites also caught a lot of squid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nothing,” Krimaar said in a lower voice: “Probably The taste of the former seagull left behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impressed." Kerry agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow we will officially go out to catch whales and seals." Nanuk said: "I hope to find the big whales you need." He pointed to the Devin: "You have a strong warrior. He can throw the first shot at the whale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not prepared to capture new whales for a ship," Perant said. "We may be able to find whale bones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Whale Bone They are all in the deepest trench," Nanuk said. "If you find it, how can you bring it back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Only the big whales dragged them back.” Perant said seriously, he was not joking, but Nanuk decided that he was telling a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the most important, Nanuk cares about Perant’s ship because Perant promises that if his people can help them build the ship, they will come. The carriages, carriages and ponies that were driven by them can be given to them. For the Allatis, this cold-resistant pony is already a precious asset, and the black iron carriages are That is iron. With this, how many shuttle darts can they create. Everyone who goes out to sea can have a black iron dart instead of stone and whale bones. It is the only remaining dream of Nanuk for decades. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Nanuk thought about it. Even if there were five or ten people who died, he must be the son of nature. The companion hunt for a big whale, or where does the skeleton of the double-headed ship come from? To this end, he even arranged his three sons into a fork. When the Alatis were hunting whales, there were eight people on board, six paddlers, a helmsman, and a forklifter. Needless to say, the forked hand that throws a fork with a rope to the whale is the most dangerous. When the whale’s pain is suddenly digging, if the fork of the rope grabs the foot or if it only knows how to use brute force, it may be dragged into the cold and dark water; also the fork is wrapped around the rope. In the rally of ships and whales, the tail of the whale is broken; the tail of the whale is also a cruel and powerful weapon. The position of the ship is not right, and the forklift may be shot by the whole person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not so, where can they get the black iron, the darts in the family are used with great care, but the corrosion of the sea still makes them very fast It becomes brittle, rusted, broken, and the darts of stone and whale bones cannot even penetrate the skin of a big whale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We may soon encounter a big whale," Nanuk said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allatis are human races that are rarely seen as friends by elves. Lies are almost non-existent among them. If they are other human beings, Perant also worried that they would be guilty of yin, deliberately looking for a big whale, killing it only in exchange for the precious black iron car, but the Alatisites would not: "Promise me, don't insist on finding and killing big whales. Give us three days." Perant said: "If we can't find it, we will go with you to find a big whale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naunuk’s face immediately burst into a sincere and excited smile. “Just like this,” he said in a common language that is not very good at it: “Friends, that’s it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————————————— —————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around the whales, and the whale had been quickly disintegrated by the Alati Lit, leaving only a white Sensen's bloody skull, this bone is almost useless, and the other is the fin of the whale. His second son is kneeling beside a whale meat, and he can't wait to cut a piece of meat. Putting it in his mouth, and his eldest son was yelling, Nanuk looked at him and found that his little daughter was standing in front of the humans, drooling over the piece of meat they had assigned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does she want?" Leona asked, as a woman, she is more sensitive and gentler to others than to others: "You want What do you want?" She asked the child, "Do you want honey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bit her glove with her teeth and put her finger into the pocket, she Remember that you still have a little eucalyptus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't give her." The thief suddenly grabbed her hand: "Give her whale meat."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is just a child." Leona said: "Just a little bit of sugar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look around." Gülen Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women looked at the surroundings blankly, she did not see anything, except those who were Alathili: "Their beliefs do not allow their lives to appear Honey?” But when she took out the honey, no one came to stop it, except for Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the northernmost part of the range of human activities," said the thief. "We just passed here once, or twice, and maybe for the rest of our lives, we will I won't come here - it's so desolate, it's so poor, look at these people, can you see textiles and daily necessities from other places? They eat raw fish, seal meat and whales Meat and utensils are all stone. They live in houses with snow and bricks. It will take a few decades for a caravan to come here - or because they are lost." He took the honey from the king's hand: "She probably I will never know what is sweet. Before you send this honey, this honey, no matter how much she cherishes, will be eaten, then what about the next years? You want her to remember honey all the time. Is the sweetness of sugar sad and regrettable to live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
