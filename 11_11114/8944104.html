			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin first felt cold, stinky cold, from hard ground, stagnant water, his skin to his muscles and bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers that he was in a short coma for a while, and the wounds that Penny had left him had caused him to shed too much blood, and he was extremely thirsty. He put out his tongue and wanted to lick the water that was on his cheeks, but he didn't succeed—the two thick guards pulled him up from behind and fixed him on a chair with iron and numerous tiny nails. The sturdy shackles smashed his hands and feet, and he heard a tone of voice gently commanding his broken arm with a soldering iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot, and then the pain that can't be tolerated, he screamed loudly, twisted his body, his clothes were all removed before being put into the dungeon, and the black was infiltrated by blood. The shiny nail pierced his hips and the waist side, and he frantically wanted to break free, but the two very skilled executioners cleverly and accurately pressed his joints and head and neck, forcing the lost palm. The arm is tightly attached to a large soldering iron with a horseshoe. The blood dripping from the wound squirts on the red iron, and then the smell and aroma of the barbecue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A collar made of wild boar leather is placed over his neck, and the two ends of the collar are placed in a small hole reserved from the back of the iron high back chair. After wearing them, they clasped each other and forced him to lean back so that his back could feel the sharpness of the nails and also see the people in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man waved a slender whip and drew Baldwin’s eyes, only one eye, because he had to let Birdwin look good It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that my Highness doesn't care too much," he said slyly. "But I really hate you, Badwin. Some people say that you have a pair of Don Cray." The eyes of the family, but I see that it is a pair of frozen pustules, the gods are on - I always hope that one day I can poke them out, ah," he shook his head in surprise, "but I I didn't expect to come back so fast this day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin's internal organs are rushing, he knows this person. Even if the blood has soaked in one of his eyes, this despicable is a madman under Fukai, who is known as a hyena, and one of the many lovers of Princess Diane. When Baldwin first entered the kingdom, in order to please the princess, he found a little trouble for Birdwin. The problem was that Baldwin had not really realized the king at that time. The danger is that he almost killed this person. If it wasn't for Morton. Don Cray stopped him in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming the owner of Thunder Castle in Byrdwin, inheriting the name and seal of Morton Don Clay, and being favored by the king, this guy was extremely clever and stunned. Baldwin once thought that he would never again I will meet him - but he has been there, right at his feet, in the dark dungeon of Wang Ting, looking at the opportunity all the time, looking for opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected, great. The noble king of Norman..." Fukai's hyena pouted when he saw the expression of Birdwin. Exaggerated and extremely sneered: "No, Byrd, not the one you killed, poor pharaoh, he was pierced by the throat he trusted the most, what a big fishbone Ah, even if the benevolent Ilmot is here, it will not be able to save his mortal destiny. I am talking about our new king. I don’t want to mention his name here so that his glory will be polluted by you. You know, and my master Fu Kai, they asked me to leave your life to ensure that you can be judged tomorrow." He bowed his head and said: "Although I think this is completely unnecessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my other master," the hyena continued, "Ah, you know, the noble hostess, she can’t violate the requirements of the first two, but As long as you can still have reason and life, it is not difficult for me." It can be said that he smiled shyly: "I have to admit that I am not strong enough and not smart enough. Fortunately, I am still a little useful. - Bywin, my mistress is going to guard her brother, so I can't come to watch it myself. This is really a shame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sitting in a chair, of course, not a high-backed chair with nails, but a soft sheepskin The chair, with a goose down cushion, dressed as if to go to a grand banquet, he lowered his head and constantly fiddled with his fingers, as if calculating: "I have to give you a drink first." "Stop the medicine to stop bleeding," he said, sighing. "Because you have lost Tell's care, ah, you should know. It is said that once the white robes lose their grace, they can't accept the treatment of the priest's cast. It's really bad. Otherwise, we can play more tricks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand, a guard came with a steaming potion, another guard used The tongue puller opened the mouth of Birdwin, and the cup still seemed to be still Teng medicine so directly fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog waited for a while, so that Birdwin was slightly awake to hear what he was saying: "--I will first cut off all the fingers of your left hand. Yes, that's the rest of your hand, then all your toes, maybe some of your feet, until your feet can be stuffed into the iron shoes that can be worn by women..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
