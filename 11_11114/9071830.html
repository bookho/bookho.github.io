In addition, he also did not realize from the opening, in this plane, there is the so-called king - so before, he completely embraced the attitude of visiting a piece of living fossil that runs through five thousand years into the silver crown. The jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now there is only a blank in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the jungle is not very similar to his son, Kerry, although they all have clear blue eyes, pale blond hair, but Yingge Wei’s facial features are deeper, his brows are soaring, his eyes are almost completely shrouded in the shadow of thick eyebrows, which makes his iris appear like a deep blue iron blue, suddenly look, perhaps Some people think that it is grayish black, and his hair color is much lighter than Kerry. In the absence of sunlight, it looks like a silvery white moonlight. He is even taller than Kerry, knowing that Kerry is already six feet and four inches. But Kreima can basically look at him, but in front of Kerry's father, he must take a step back to ensure that he does not need to look up and look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruler of the Silver Crown jungle did not overlook his son’s "children" on his throne above the ground - he has been seven or eight hundred years old I have never done this before, even if standing in front of him may be the biggest and most dangerous enemy he has ever encountered in his life, because his shield is not only the child of Ingway. There is also a heavy responsibility and obligation – everything he sees when he casts a spell out of the cautious mind that a father and the king must have told him to be careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingwi is like his son, and his beloved former guardian, picking up the silver cup and taking a cold, clean water from the roots of the silver crest to the black-haired caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world took a sip of the subconscious, too cold, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I peeked at your soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the jungle almost gave up The soul of the world was squirting water. Fortunately, the water was too cold. He only tasted a small mouth. Otherwise, their conversation would have to be interrupted for a while in an embarrassing situation. After all, the king of the jungle was too close to him. Even if he is a mortal, he can count the number of veins on the silver robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Don't talk. The lich reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I have to admit it." The King of the jungle said, "You are amazed by me - from a small guest in another plane." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am deeply honored." The soul of the opposite world said dryly, if it was discovered that it was a redemption lich, it is entirely possible - the collection of the silver crown jungle It may be more than any country in this plane, but if it is a two-soul soul and knows that he is a soul from another plane, it can only be said that... God of God is giving the answer. This secret may not even be discovered by the gods. They may see that there is another soul in the body of the lich, but how strong a soul is to pass through the violent astral turbulence and the hurricane ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Initially I was only for Kerry," said the King of the jungle. "Know. Your encounter with Kerry is like a book." Write a good book, and before you appear, there isn’t even a name on your book.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, you are inexplicably present in your son The people around me are suspicious—the soul of the opposite world says in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your tutor is not Beavis of Longhuo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the witch Unexpectedly, this answer did not let the soul of the outside world jump. It is very... calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What is strange, the soul of the opposite world says, I know probably earlier than you thought, how is a mage who is good at plastics? Raise a lich to come? Well, you did mislead me, but I will read it. Will also talk to other people. He paused, perhaps because you always thought that I was too stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he always put himself in the position of a guest when he first arrived at the Dragon Fire Island. The Lich thought that he had been complaining that the soul from another plane was too clumsy, and now he hopes it will continue to be clumsy. No, maybe it’s never an idiot. The lich is never short of an idiot. He knows what a real idiot would be like – he suddenly came to another plane and lost all his family and friends. The memory is broken, and even your body can't be preserved, so you have to share a body with a dangerous guy. It can't even read and write at the beginning. The cognition of this plane is just like a freshly polished one. The finished parchment, if it is changed to other people, is not a mortal, even if the casters with firm will and excellent knowledge, like the poor fellow lichs, after losing the magic and well-known planes, Their performance may not be as good as his cohabitants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the undead has been accusing the white gang of being a despicable thief, he is very clear that the encroachment of his body is not this soul. The only thing that can be decided is that it can save the incarnation of Tell without any return after controlling his body, although the old guy may not be truly dead even if he is involved in the vortex of the astral, but this It is the fate or the decree of the god of God. Without Tyre, there will be Rosada, Su Lun, or Ilmot. Anyone can be a good god anyway. Initially, he needs a redemption lich. There is one, this is not something that can be reversed by the power or thought of a human or a lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The soul of the opposite world answered instead of the lich. "My mentor is Edell of the Seventy-seven Islands."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the King of the jungle slightly moved, although he knew that the Lich’s mentor would only be an undead, but he did not think of this small The guy's mentor will be Edell. Edell is not a real name, but a variant of the magical river and the river. The body is derived from the new name given to the lich when he abandoned the identity of the living. Perhaps some people think that the name is strange. Rinse again, but in fact. This variant name can't be said to be the most complicated one, as long as you are good at metal dragon language and Quentin Elvish, that is, the language used by the two races before the catastrophe - although the metal dragon, which is the good dragon, is unknown. For what reason left the plane, and the Quentin elves have also been divided and relocated to Singer and Eya - you can figure out the name is the Quentin Elvish in the metal dragon language This word is eternal in the Quentin Elvish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every undead person will be willing to embed eternal, immortal or immortal marks on his name or title, but in the seventy-seven islands On the other hand, there are not many undead who simply use this word as their name. Most of the undead have not paid much attention to the vulgar name, but a name. In particular, the name of the caster is often closely related to his fate, which is why the casters are particularly vigilant when choosing their own variant name. Sometimes they embed one or two auxiliary words in the variant name. To modify the original name, for example, if a caster is unfortunately called a ram, he will add a name to the god in front, because the ram is the best on some altars. In order to avoid the inexplicable disaster, they will choose a god who does not like to choose the ram as a sacrifice, as a savior, like Fro. Although the ram called Fro is a bit awkward, it is better than a ram called Taros or Mask—although Fro seems to be less secure now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who can choose this name means that he has the power to fight the pressure and threat of the name. The king of the jungle, Ingewei, only needs a brief retrospective to recall the "old friends" associated with him. Memory, their prestige has covered the entire continent before the Great Holocaust. Perhaps it will include half of the ocean. One of them is already a powerful and unmatched lich before the catastrophe. Ingwi really hopes that this is a dangerous figure protected by his son as a chicken, his mentor. It just happens to be called Edell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for why he didn’t want to be that Edell, maybe because he was the most undead person in England, he and Ingway before the Holocaust The adventure team led by the same jewel. That time was not Edel's Edel, which won; after the catastrophe, Edel, who had watched the silver crown jungle, was destroyed by a glory of the soul, and was taken back by the king of the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edell’s power is not even awkward to the king of the jungle that has already entered the semi-god field, but it is more headache than power. Is his character...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel my character Very good," Edell said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt." Austal bent down deeply. If he was a personal class, then he could follow this sentence down. It is like kindness and tolerance, but he is faced with a demigod lich. He does not think that the above words are derogatory to a non-dead person. He does not want to be inexplicably killed for this reason. - No, in the field of the undead, death may still be a reward, "not dead" is punishment and torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he is now the messenger of Grenada, carrying the glory of a country and the will of "her", but he is facing the demon lich It is the most famous madman in the seventy-seventh archipelago. Edelnay may not even give the face of Talos when he is violent, not to mention their "mother". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark gray mist smashed in front of his eyes, and the Dragon Warlock must bite his teeth to resist the chill and fear that went deep into the bone marrow. He kept his kneeling posture. Carefully stepped back, although he didn't know if it was a projection or something else, but he was not willing to think about the result of contact with the demon lich - and he didn't think Edel would be compassionate. The ground lifted the spell for him. He greeted Grenada with a burst of laughter and let them re-send a less vulnerable messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
