			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Walled City is saddened again, and can’t leave with two prisoners full of hatred and hatred. He may only take away himself and the year. The treasures - at the top of the tower, gems, gold coins, wands, scrolls, all the luxury you can imagine, as well as a lot of magical tools and casting materials, he picked up a crystal tube and looked at it carefully. With the help of magic, as the freshly beautiful blood just as it was extracted, the ruby ​​shines under the white light of fluorite, as well as the hair, bones, flesh, internal organs... He thought for a while, thinking Should you go down to the cell at the bottom of the tower? If you can't take it all, it's okay to take some of it. The orcs' priests are always fascinated by the viscera and blood of that creature. For these, they can take gems or It’s important for him to change the poison.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out a wand and tapped on an orc skull that seemed to be used for decoration. The skull opened and slammed in the rattle, and the wizard’s hand reached into it. Moved one of the molars, and then the sound of the slight organ gear was heard in the room. The stone brick wall showed a small hole, but for this thin mage, as long as You can walk in when you bend down. When he walks in, the hole is closed again, and the upper and lower jaws of the orc skull are tightly closed, leaving no trace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a short distance to let the Master come, just a few steps, he stood on the edge of a narrow and deep cave, the cold wind from the bottom Surging up, blowing his robes, the Master noticed that he didn’t even remember to put on his trousers. He reminded himself that after completing the work, he would change into the outfit, that is, put it under the mage’s robes. Tights and trousers, and the soft-soled shoes were replaced with sturdy lizard boots; while applying a small spell to lighten their weight, he jumped off the cave, and the twilight in his hand forced some to climb. The little creatures on the rock wall have shunned them - they are intentionally released by the Master, and they are poisonous in number, but they are very disgusted with the smell and light from the candle in the Master's hands, because the oil in the candle is from their natural enemies.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master felt that his landing speed was a bit slow, but it was also set by him at the beginning, maybe he didn’t expect that one day he would have to be so arrogant. Escape--He thought hard about why the Grenada people appeared in front of his walled city. He said from the heart that he hated the Grenada people and knew that he once fell into the Grenada. There will only be a long and painful death in his hand, but the problem is that he has been very cautious because of these two points, although his soldiers have consistently imposed high on the surrounding small towns on the grounds of confronting Grenada. Taxes, as well as gaining some benefits that should not be obtained by them, of course, there are those businessmen who are crowned with the name of the enemy... but only the Master and his cronies know that they barely dared to directly touch Gerry. Nada’s things even deliberately avoid the behavior that would irritate the Red Dragon. In recent years, they have colluded with the merchants of Grenada, who traded them in ordinary magic stores. Unable to buy Materials and magic tools, but they are responsible for clearing those too honest and stubborn villagers, Ranger, Knight ...... until the consul, and lord<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but cursing the businessman who sold him to the protective regiment. The latter swears that this formation is After the excitement, even the dragon must be stunned. He does not need to be able to resist the dragon. At first he just wanted to guard against dangerous and hypocritical enemies.Although it is said that this formation can make the advantage of the Dragon Tooth Legion a sneak peek, it still makes him sneak for a while, but he should have known that they have such a weak point of weakness... After the rock peak collapsed, Of course, he is most concerned about the runes, but he can't take them out of tens of millions of pounds of mud and rocks, and even their Mithril base and gems runes won't be damaged by heavy pressure and knocking. , where they are placed, they have to be measured again and again.And now, will the Grinada people be willing to give him time to measure? Of course impossible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when he spit out another embarrassing word, his feet fell on the ground, countless pairs of small feet knowing the crawling sound of the cable The sound of the same number of transparent wings and carapace slammed the leader of the walled city unpleasantly. This convenient passage is located in the center of the tower. In the middle of the spiraling stairs, many people come and go on the stairs, but No one found any other organ in the plain pillar. It went all the way to the bottom of the tower. In the damp and cold prison, the wizard recited a spell and knocked with his magic wand. Hit the tightly spliced ​​stones, the stones squirming like the living creatures, squeezing each other, leaving a gap that can accommodate the mage<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master listened to his ears, he could hear the tragic shouts from above, and wanted to come here. His men were following his orders to kill those Captive, his lips overflowed with a smile, step forward, here is the third layer of the dungeon, he waved his finger, let the only passage that can lead to the outside except his magic - that is, a simple stone The hole, which is located on the ground floor of the upper level and the zenith of this floor, the soldiers go up and down with a rope,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, the leader of the Walled City had some unnecessary worries. Will he find out that the two "goods" had been stolen by others when he walked in, but he immediately showed a more distinct smile. There is a part of myself, the two "goods" intact and the way he left last time - there is almost nothing on the body that can be called "clothing", only a little bit of talk is better than no cover, Master Knowing that this is the trick of the guards, they are not qualified to touch these precious "goods", but it is okay to play and taunt them - about the thin steel chain of the finger passes through the sacrum and ulna of the "goods", I lifted them up, and one of their thumbs was knocked out. This is no way. The man is a martial-skilled warrior and a skilled master. If it is not a child around him. Oh, maybe he can really escape from their round-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Master appeared, the male captive looked up, his face was pale, his hair was messy, his feet were carrying a shackle, and he was attached to it. Only the iron ball, heavy enough, even the three Deinonychus may not be able to move. He already has four, or five, have not eaten food and stayed up late, and have not drunk water. His lips are cracked and fresh. The blood of the mouth. If it is a personal class, it may have been comatose or dead, but he looks pretty good. At the very least, he can observe the situation around him, make estimates, and not give up the hope of fleeing here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Walled City is almost inexhaustible to say something, he must admit that this creature is really more annoying than the dragon - that tenacious vitality , stubborn nature, pure heart, is it not for people to want to destroy them? But he finally swallowed those extra words back into his throat. He hesitated and stood in front of the younger captive. Sure enough, the old man immediately responded and the mage heard a hoarse and chaotic voice. With pleading and despair, but this is exactly what he wants to see and hear. He doesn't stop to swear a spell. And the captive who was also the caster, suddenly heard what this spell was, he struggled in anger, the chain creaked, blood flowed from his arm to his lap, and then His hanging feet dripped onto the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing all this, and knowing what children they are going to encounter suddenly screamed loudly, their language is not yet fully mastered by the Master, but he I can barely hear that the other person is crying out asking the senior to stop losing because of her own time. As for how she shouted out, the wizard saw that her tongue was blushing, even the teeth. The same is true, she should have used her own blood to moisten the chapped throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever he wants to tell her is impossible to become a reality, he raises his hands and makes gestures, this spell will open her abdomen, Taking out the organ that is most important to a woman, he heard the whistling sound from the ear, a blow from the senior man - he rips his arm and tears off the chain, then He used his stump as a weapon, making it the most vulnerable ear of the wizard like a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next moment, a force volley hit the captive and threw him to the wall. He fell and fell to the ground, a sticky The mud covered his back, and it was impossible for him to lift his knee like a smashed stone. The wizard cast a scornful and mocking look on him and pinched a broken blade. Next, I only need one syllable...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he finally did not spit out the syllable, just before he took his eyes from the old man. When I turned back, a smoky black shadow pierced his side of the rib. The three-legged dagger used by thieves and assassins was intentionally made longer than the average dagger, and pierced from under the ribs. Throughout the heart, the Master was horrified to discover that the spell on the magic robe did not function as originally. The dagger was driven straight in. Although it did not penetrate the heart as the attacker hoped, it still split the blood vessels connected to the heart. The mage roars in anger and silently Cry, raised a hand, and a two-edged sword fine passing from the air and crying, his half a palm Zhanla the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final spell of the Walled City leader is still motivated by the disappearance of his life. This is a powerful spell that burns all the people in the room. Gray, but the assassin just gestured and read the spell—when he raised his arm, he helped his invisible cloak reveal a dark red robes, and the walled leader’s eyes that were about to close were slammed open. He thought that there was one in the army of Grenada that was called the dragon thorn, and it had the fewest number of people, but there was a military that was extravagant - to cover the real with bards, thieves, and assassins. The identity of the warlocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame disappeared before it was formed, and the assassin turned around, his eyes showing an undeniable greed: "Look," he Take a deep breath: "Look, what did I find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
