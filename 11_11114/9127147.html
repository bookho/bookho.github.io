"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a mage after all," his eldest son said: "The wizards are always very cautious, they are not mortal, they don't always want to be like a businessman." Go and touch the gold in the skin." Then he was not sure how to say: "He seemed to go to the city yesterday to see a thief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogue?" The king of Rinada said with a little doubt: "Does our little baby have such a big appetite? He just got the dragon tooth, now he has to stick his claws to the dragon thorn? Knicks can It is not an easy enemy to deal with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the thief is not a member of the guild of 'fine net', he originally belonged to 'silver finger', maybe now, Our intelligence personnel have not collected his intelligence yet, and the latest information tells me that he has re-emerged. The tip of the squadron 'Silver Finger' guild branch, and the illegitimate child of the Yal Island, Drake, regained the good - the poor guy he replaced was at the banquet of Drake. The public assassination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you said," the new king went on to say, "I know who he is, he is Gülen, one is The curse of the priest of death, Klanwo, has a very significant weakness. Although it can be said that it is an excellent and vicious thief, he is really inferior to the members of Austal. Less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is that the relationship between Austal and Kremar is not so good," said Mitt and himself when it comes to it. The father exchanged a tacit smile: "Wait..." He briefly thought for a moment: "Maybe I can guess their intentions - Gülen is an ambitious guy, they are on the island of Longhuo. At that time, he tried to use the king of Norman to reach his own wild vision - he had hoped Have a union of their own, but that is almost impossible, look at Austal, the back of the 'fine net' is the dragon thorn, although the dragon thorn can not be compared with the dragon tooth, and the dragon claw, but it is a legion. His initial plan is still slow—the 'Silver Finger' and 'Dark Thorn' have matured very much. They have their own city, have their own territory, have their own lair and army, and they have all the nobles. They all have inextricable relationships. It is difficult for a strange thieves' guild to gain the trust of the latter, especially if they can hand over their work to any thieves' guild that they are familiar with and trust. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if there is a person in the 'Silver Finger' or 'Dark Thorn' Guild, a high-ranking guy is willing to work for the Dragon Stab, from The most rigorous Neriwa ruined the entire guild..." The new king went on to say: "A chaotic and even collapsed guild will become a huge black hole, and only the dragon thorns can fill these black holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what can the little thief get? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His master is the commander of the Dragon's tooth," Mitt said: "If this is the case, he wouldn't have to worry that their contract would be Olympics." Stahl is torn at any time, because then Austal will face Dragons directly. Moreover, this contract is not without any benefit to Austal. If my little brother can stand on the dragon tooth, the situation in Wang Du will become two-on-one," he made a gesture. Expressing Kelmen and Kelsey, the relationship between the brothers and sisters and Kremar is so bad that it cannot be saved, and their relationship with Mitt and Austal is not good. Soon Former Kyle also tried to intervene in the dragon thorns. If it wasn't the priest she chose, she might be too stupid, she might be successful. Mittitch knows that Austal has been busy with things that have been busy recently. Rydi’s way of judging right or wrong has always been simple and rude. She only cares about whether things have been carried out according to her ideas. As for how to show, who promotes, she does not care.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they still have time, Austal may be able to wait until the "tobacco" influence is greater and take the next step, but now he must, immediately, get a remarkable result right away. In order to avoid being once again by Kelsey The shameful and pretentious plunder is about to mature. The Knicks are only the maids of Grei, and her identity can never be more honored than the Red Dragon daughter of Grein, even if her descendants are more than the children of the Red Dragon. More sturdy and powerful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, if Kreima is the owner of the dragon tooth and negotiates with Austal, Austal may If they accept this proposal, they can eat the 'silver finger' first and then eat the 'dark thorn', but who can guess what will happen in the end? If the "mother" plan can be so smooth, then This plane may only leave a thief guild.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it," said the dragon in the position of the king for three hundred years, but still known as the "new king": "We must not be impatient, my children, our enemies are numerous." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich does not mind letting his meeting with Gülen be known to others, the dragon’s arrogance They will not care about a mortal, although all the fragments of Gülen have given him the power that mortals should not have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for these fragments...he used to think that Austal would let him take out the pieces, but he didn’t, after coming to Grenada, The fragments of Rimal also belong to Kremar. The former undead even suspected that these fragments may be traps left by the dragons, and the greedy red dragons have already detected the dangers, so they will be interested in this. Missing. But the experience of Gülen's departure from the Dragon Fire Island seems to have brought his ideas back to their original place - perhaps Red Dragon Greedy did not want these pieces, but was temporarily unavailable - he knew Rosa from Yadel The main hall of Da has once proclaimed the gods, proclaiming marriage and the god of breeding, Greed is a false god, because her followers have expelled the priests of Rosada from the relationship of the white tower, Rosada’s white robe is also destroyed. After their temple, from then on, the red robe priests of Greedy seemed to have died down – perhaps because Greed was not willing to have a relationship between life and death at all critical moments, she is not really a god. Oh, although she is so powerful and majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the lich knows that this red dragon with a glamorous human form will never give up, just after he and Austal return to Gerry On the way to Nada, even in the enemy country of Grenada, they can still enjoy and rest in the temple of Gredi every night; and in the ridiculous fields, they can continue to see those cut. Opened a mouse or frog on the abdomen. These are some serfs. They can't afford to buy sheep, deer, and slaves as sacrifices to Greedy. They can only dig out the fetuses or eggs of these small creatures and expose them to In the air, I am ridiculously hoping to get the help of Greedy; and those who are gorgeous and full of skin, although they can’t publicly claim that they believe in Greed, they can wear baby bones on their fingers. Rings, or use the heads of pregnant women to fill their own cockroaches, ironically to pray that Greedy can give them a son or a number of sons, lest they be rejected by their husbands because they are unable to give birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the objects they believe in, the old red dragon is patiently entangled in the lava, still tempered by the flames of her wings The golden eyes are shining in the darkness - now, there are two pieces in her hand, one in the hands of the lich, one in each of Gülen and Plum, one in Bedwin and Liona, one in the hands of the elves, one in the hands of the gnomes There is still an unknown whereabouts, but if it does not fall into the hands of a follower of a god, the lich believes that it will soon come to the hands of Gerdi - the person around Gülen, if ever If the undead does not guess wrong, then he is probably the embodiment of the thief god Mask... The fragments of Birdwin and Leona were once dedicated to Tyre, this is what Gülen told him, the god of justice is ruthless The return behavior can make the thief laugh for a long time, but it also shows that it is being watched by Tyre; the one in the hand of the elf Kerry may have fallen into the hands of the king of the jungle, Ingway, and Ingway, Is the only one on this plane that can be positive with Gree Guy, even if the silver crown jungle is locked, Greed will only put this piece in the last ring of collection, followed by the gnome, the lich does not know how he escaped the eyes of Red Dragon and Austal. But McGee did disappear like this, leaving no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lich leaves the bathroom, Gülen will be covered with flowers and water to the face, this action looks really timid, just Even the two mixed-race snakes who served him couldn't help but lick their fangs, but they hanged each other before they had any action. The thief sighed comfortably behind the silk slap. Since the rune shards, he was as dangerous as his former master – the owner of the bathroom took his gold coins a bit unhappy and licked the snake The slow mixed length of the mixed blood, sent him a human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan can see at a glance that this human being is a Fro priest, she is still very young, maybe because of this, she will dare to come to Gerry Nada, now she seems to have understood her stupidity, but no one can leave, unless the snakes like the two stinks are dragged out and burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t understand what her new guests want to do, he has a desire for her, but he just puts her with a red garnet The whole land was bought. He gave her robes and cloaks, and then took her outside the walls of Grenada. Outside the walls were vast expanses of deserts, countless monsters, and everything that could be destroyed. Sandstorms of life, but there are also caravans, human caravans. Dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
