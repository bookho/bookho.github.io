			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet walked slowly in the remaining flames and smog, holding the piano in his hands, without causing any vigilance. Some soldiers saw him and thought that this daring bard was preparing to present a song to the new knight leader, who both sighed with his courage and was somewhat ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need one, no, two people go back to the Viscounts, ask for help," the Knights of the Kings shouted: "His people are in great In distress!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A knight greeted him and went back to execute the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buddy Winner may not be able to draw more people," he said, "they are facing more than 10,000 orcs." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," said the Cavaliers, "but helping them and notifying Birdwin is my duty to decide whether these people can get it." The aid is Baldwin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, you don't have to do that," he said, hiding his eyes behind the mask and being flamed. Illuminated, the shadows of humans, orcs, elves, and bats form a twisted and mottled black pattern on the rugged rock wall: "You are not serving in Thunderbolt."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am facing the weak house and the common enemy of mankind," said the Cavaliers. "Although I am not a follower of Tyre and often indulge in various things, I am still a Cavaliers - so I won't leave until Baldwin or Birdwin's appointed person comes to take over the duty."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I am with you," is just a teenager who said: "If I am fortunate enough to receive this honor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Cavaliers knight smiled slightly behind the mask, although his heart was still heavy - although he could not know the correct number of thieves, he had seen orcs, half-orcs and half-ogres, and more than three The house was well-trained and well-coordinated – and the previously unguarded soldiers and knights were killed by them... there were more than twenty, and double or even triple the number he saw. The soldiers died under the flames and the trampling of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that he has to be sincerely grateful for the guidance of the god of destiny, because under his guidance, Bird Wen will send two elf wizards to this huge team. He is concerned about the magical battle between the female elf mage and the red robe not far away. His embarrassment surrounds him from the vigilance, they don’t even allow ordinary The soldiers are too close to the people - but no one cares about a thin and thin migratory mage, a squatting and even a step to the right, leaving a gap slightly, so that the strange bard is more Clearly seeing his master's every move, he wrote a poem that made the entire king's lady feel moved and weeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bard seems to have noticed that he has bowed to him from twenty feet away, lifting his piano over his shoulder, and when he is still wondering why he played Solt in such a strange way. In the case of Liqin, the hollow arrow of the small pigeon feathers had passed through the hot air of the flame and shot into the narrow, long hole - the only weakness in the knight's armor, the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight who completed his previous order to reply saw this scene. He screamed and pulled out his sword to the bard. Erteliqin, brown headscarf, tunic, and a belt woven from countless knotted small ropes were instantly opened. The headgear and ornaments made of silver coins fell to the ground, but there was no blood. There are no divided limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary princes of the knights have fallen from the horse, and his cockroaches have eagerly taken off his helmet. The tiny smashing arrows are not directly shot. The eyes just rubbed his brow bones, but it was poisonous, and the king's knight's eyes were dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Bedwin?" he gasped and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The person who asked for help has left." The Knights of Thunderbolt answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave," the Lich said. "But it doesn't mean you can get where you want to go."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" asked the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you capture the geese, will they allow their guards to send out signals?" The Lich said, tearing open a medical reel: "They are not going A hundred feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s face suddenly became very bad, and he jumped up and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are thieves," one said, "They just want gold coins and jewelry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "That gives them," another said, "Our master will be willing to pay ransom for him and us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is no gray robe The words, "The Lich said that as a former undead house, he was too aware of the price of a gray robe. A gray robe, that is, a necromancer, rarely serves a long-term guild, but they accept short-term employment and demand high rewards. There are not many ways to reduce the loss of gold coins and precious casting materials. One is to give all the bodies to them, and the Necromancer will never refuse the body, especially the fresh ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, people who commit this crime are likely to be questioned to be related to the orcs (more ridiculous than selling potions or slaves). After all, this timing is too clever – it is a big crime, even if it is like The big thieves' guilds such as "sinister" and "silver finger" can't face the allegations related to it, but the profits from this business may indeed be higher than any one they have done before. After all, this is the number of people in a city. All the wealth that has accumulated over the past decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these two aspects, the people of Thunderbolt want to escape the threat of death by the power of gold coins and jewels is almost impossible, and thieves can Take away everything they want on their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s here, the knight is back, he doesn’t have to say anything, the gray-faced face and the bloody wounds already explain everything. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or maybe let my people try it." The Lich said that the Cavaliers followed his gaze to look at a corner, a look that was not very strong. The man stood there, the knight frowned, and he felt that he had seen this person and that he was strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is he?" The Cavalier asked: "Is not like an elf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A thief," said the Lich. "An excellent thief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the thief deal with the thief," is still dark, but not so painful. The Knights of the Kings said: "This may be a good way. Tell him that if he can do what we want him to do, I will give him a generous reward, enough to make him a jazz." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think he needs this," said the Lich. "Is it, Glan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If this is your wish." Gülen bowed humbly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He should be in jail." The Knights of the Kings said that they struggled to sit up under the support of the shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he is still in jail, no one will report to Birdwin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "He will escape as much as before," said the Knights of the Kings. "You, you are a caster. You should have a way to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Yes, I can," said the Lich. "But I can't leave, my friend is here." He made the last gesture and put his spells on. "I might spend it for this short trip." All the spells, then watching my friend's painful death, are helpless - this may be a bit selfish, but my friend is Kerry Ben, he is already dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The knight licked his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give Glenn what you want," the Lich stood up casually: "He doesn't want too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought I didn't want much," the young count said: "It's just a kiss. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I swore that my lips belong to my husband, only he can kiss my lips." Penny said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the owner of Thunderbolt, Sir Birdwin can appear here and now, he will be shocked, or he will only look around because he already I couldn't recognize his wife. In just a few dozen days, Penny completely became another person. She combed her hair with a lead immersed in vinegar, so that it turned black and then rubbed the rose. Oil, burn with a tongs; she applies a mixture of white powder and cream on her face and bare shoulders and arms, or directly apply mercury to make the skin white and metallic; at night Before going to sleep, she took a bath with her milk and applied the ointment made with the placenta; the maids helped her to wash her nails with vinegar, and then smoothed with cowhide, trying to be as delicate and white as ivory; she also emulated the lady's poison lady with gems powder With charcoal to paint around the eyes, drip into the eyes with a potion containing belladonna; she sacrificed to Fro, jewels, gold coins and fresh sweet peas (obtained from the wizard at a high price) in exchange for privacy A delicate and tender ointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has become accustomed to the sultry and meticulous service, even when she returns to her own home, she will become lost and unbearable when she loses her companionship. So she is more and more parked in the secret nest, and lazily spends a day, a night, and then a night, a daytime with the "Mrs." in the hookah and incense... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her "friends" she went to a party, she went, and was very happy, she first danced with men outside of Bedwin, at first She was a little nervous, but then she laughed and found that the young man was more nervous than her. He stepped on her skirt and almost fell on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny, who is kind and kind, certainly won't be thundered by this little thing. She forgives the young man with tolerance, but I didn't expect that this gentle boy is actually an earlord. He even has the right to inherit the throne, although he has to go to six. After ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown when their relationship gradually became intimate, Penny never thought that there would be so many happy things in the world - they hunt They gathered for dinner, they went around, danced in the moonlight, and sailed down the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sometimes run very far. When they are staying at a farm, the hostess of the farm mistakenly thinks they are a couple and thinks they are quite a pair. child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this is true," when he sent Penny back to her room, she gently said in her ear: "How good that should be." Ah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His lips are so close to Penny’s ears, so hot, hot is like a hot heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny closed her eyes, she never missed Bedwin so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wrote a letter to Baldwin, but she never responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the count came to her again, she refused - she refused three times in a row, then the baroness she came to appreciate the roses in the greenhouse, she came I saw the rose and saw the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," asked the count: "Can I kiss your finger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Penny's fingers are not beautiful. She used to stay up all night with a dilapidated spinning wheel. She had thick braids on her fingers and her nails were flat, but the count took them over and kissed them cautiously, like Kissing a pair of valuable treasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you leave your lips to your husband," the count finally asked: "So leave your fingers to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The author’s words, thank you for your reward! It’s really a night of hate, how can such a good book not be rewarded! The arrow pen knife rewards Jiuyu 582 coins. This book is very good, and I hope that the follow-up will be more exciting!
