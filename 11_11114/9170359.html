			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about outside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People are preparing for your coronation ceremony. Said the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan stood up and walked in the direction of the terrace. The maid raised her head slightly. She was also a mage. The hands hidden in the wide sleeves pinched the caster. Material, "How," Dylan noticed a slight fluctuation in the air: "Is this not allowed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can do as you want I want to do that," the maid said softly. "But please don't stay too long. You and your mother have many enemies. They don't want to be the king's power."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan smiles slightly, when does he start in Norman, in his own country, in his own kingdom, in front of his people, as in the face of enemies Be alert? Norman’s successive kings were temperamental to a little rude bastard. They often ran through the gravel road between the minaret and the minaret. When Dylan was a child, he often squatted by the window and watched the pharaoh with his amiable The subjects together went hunting, or simply ran, except that surrounded by his knights and luxurious dresses, he also looked very different from an ordinary Norman male, and his The people, like Dylan, climbed on the edge of the window sill or the terrace, or crowded on both sides of the road, throwing handkerchiefs, flowers and other cute gadgets to their king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, as long as Morton Don Cray is in the annual reciting period, he will definitely follow the right side of Pharaoh, which is a distinguished position. And only the trusted person can be allowed to appear there, because the hand that Pharaoh used to pull the sword is the right hand - after that, this person becomes Bedwin, which is exactly the same gray as Morton Don Cray. Hair and grey eyes, and Dylan's side is always only her mother and Fu Kai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people with a pair of green eyes feel a lot of pain from the depths of the heart, just don’t know which one, Morton, or Fukai ? For a time, he couldn’t tell the disappointment. Why did he have to shoulder the heavy responsibility of their delivery? Whether it is Thunder Castle or Norman, or how brilliant Dylan can do, a nominal father, a de facto father, can no longer see. But just as he was stunned, the maid made a choice for him—she stepped forward and raised her cockroaches. The bright skylight shot into the room, and the completely different light from the fluorite made Dylan’s eyes slightly The stinging, he held out a hand, held his eyes, and then pushed out the heavy threshold before he was put down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the male bear and the female bear formed by bending the copper strips of the sheet metal, and then the tall double doors of the glass inlaid with various colors are in the maid Closed silently behind her, she looked around and stood by a stone-carved monster, so Dylan couldn't easily see her, but she could see the young and noble people's every move - she didn't like Dylan. The pain of Dylan is purely disease-free in her opinion. She is a mage, but unfortunately her parents are just a humble craftsman, relying on creating a scorpion and a plowshare for the civilians, or even the qualification to create horseshoes or arrows for the lords, so in a mage After discovering that she had the talent of the caster, her parents were very happy to get a bag of copper coins and one less mouth to eat. Her tutor can't be said to be a bad person, but because he is not a bad person, he soon died. She lost her dependence and she had to sell all the things she could sell to maintain her own livelihood - a female mage can still It has aroused the interest of many noble people, but while satisfying her stomach, she is still busy with accumulating her own strength. It is not wrong at all. It is accumulation. Do you think that Master is a glorious and brilliant career? For her, the Master will only shine in the eyes of many people. That is because on the long road to become a mage, the gold coin that is invested like a flowing water can almost create a golden image of the same size as him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has met good people, has met wicked people, has done good people, and has done evil people. The best years are quietly eclipsed in the battle, leaving Her only bitter and sharp dregs. She didn't understand that someone would be like this... The first half of her hard life told her that as long as someone was willing to reach out, she would hold it firmly, and her master, Diane, was almost kneeling in front of Dylan, barely revealing the white back. Let her son walk on the ladder in front of the throne in his own body, and he is still hesitant, inexplicably stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, it’s not someone else who recruits her, it’s Dylan, he recruits her and there are two other female mage just for her mother, after all, The male mage can't be guarded by the princess at all times, but the only one of the three who is valued and trusted by Diane is her, so she was sent to look at her son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid just walked over and glanced casually: "Put the gold foil and silver foil on the statue." She looked at a farther place: "There is silk, and it is said that the Seris people have a very deep winter. Important festivals, so in order to decorate the bare branches, they will decorate them with silk-cut leaves and flowers. For this reason, the sacred rewards have captured several Seris, not farmers, all extraordinarily craftsmen and weavers, Two hundred girls are following them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too extravagant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But this is the will of the Norman rulers, we have to obey," the maid said. "If you feel that something is wrong, you can change it after becoming a king, but now, you just have to wait for peace." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a group of people are coming from the gates of the city. Originally, Norman did not have such strict laws, requiring people to walk down after entering the capital. But these are small details that are innocuous It was violently supplemented or modified by King John and Diane. The people who entered the kingdom must not only walk down, but also surrender the bow and the arms higher than the waist. The wide sword and the spear are of course in the ranks, which causes a lot of The Cavaliers and the Sir Alex are dissatisfied, but Her Majesty feels that it is enough to allow them to enter the king with a dagger dagger. After all, it is also a very dangerous weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this pedestrian, the wind and frost, wearing a dull leather with sand and sand, covered with gray-yellow cotton cloak, the first in front of the chest Hanging the coat of arms indicates that they are not ordinary civilians, and Dylan knows them. They are the lords and knights of the territories between Thunder and the kings, some of whom are still stubbornly loyal to the loyal after the death of the pharaoh. Because various accidents and accidents have died, their territory is not given to him by the new king, or by the people of Chun'an, while others can only say that they are temporarily surrendering, or more correctly Perhaps because their age gave them enough sleek and cunning relationship, they swayed their teeth while swinging their tails, so that the greedy villains could not catch their weaknesses, and could not find a suitable excuse. , I have to give up first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan’s mother, Princess Angkor and John, have asked Dylan to try to dispose of these people, but Dylan, who has always been gentle, is in this matter. These people are not the vassals of Birdwin, but the courtiers of the Don Cree family. He believes that he will inherit the name of Don Cree after all, and as a Don Clay, he can’t do what he can’t take care of. Investigate, but he will never allow these people to die in vain and suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let these people come to see me." Dylan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid listened to his orders, but when Dylan looked at the shadows of those people who stepped into the tower where he was, a sudden loss came to him. The body--the attendant informed him that his mother, Her Majesty the Norman, was assassinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan flew away, he saw the assassination, but luckily did not die or was seriously injured, the pastors prayed beside her, The magical technique caused her to open her eyes immediately, and her wounds healed. As for the blood that was lost, it was always able to be added back. <br /><br />############################################################################################################## The land spent half a lie on her side for a whole night, and when he returned to his room, those people had already left, and he knew that his attendants were lying—they didn’t look like they were coming to At the ceremony of the coronation, the eyes and demeanor are full of melancholy and eagerness. If these people are looking for their own, then only the Thunderbolt may have a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me." Dylan said: "Is there something happened in Thunder Castle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No," the maid said quickly. "Swear by my strength." This is a very serious oath for a caster. Dylan’s heart calmed down a bit: "They are looking for you." "The maid followed: "Because the agent you left to Thunderbolt seems too shameless and greedy," she briefly refined the information she had obtained from the mouths of those people: "He is plundering every copper coin." The threshold of Thunderbolt will be set aside a thousand feet away from the city, and within a thousand feet, merchants can see no less than three soldiers, and their management is difficult to buy even cheap salt. - Everything is becoming expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure it is not Thunderbolt?" Dylan stared into her eyes and asked; "Not a protective array." Is the law touched?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The beasts are unusually quiet, this is their My," said the maid, "His Highness, this winter is particularly late, and the orcs have suffered two heavy blows, and they may not come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
