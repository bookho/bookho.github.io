			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of Hongpao is not the first time to enter this room, his son used to show off half of the threat to show him The mystery of those who belong to the caster alone - the walls of the study have shelves from the ground to the top, and the shelves are filled with books and scrolls (although most of them are used to fill the discarded scrolls and come to great lengths But it is simply a gibberish spell book); a beautiful ebony scorpion with a wand (and many casters, the wand is really intertwined, just the tip of the nose, the real thing is only one-tenth of the fake Not yet); a dead body was used as a hanger for a magical robe (there was only one piece, and the rune above was mistaken with a letter); the huge desk was filled with inkwells and quills (of which Some have failed due to poor preservation.) If you let a dragon or a mage like Alva look at it, this room is nowhere to laugh, but let a mortal look, it is no different from the dragon's lair. Dangerous and magical, piled unimaginable wealth<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the guard captain did not hesitate, he knew that once the son entered the room, it would take a long time - when the former city owner ordered his son to do things, he Have carefully peepedHe walked straight to his little son, where his son stored some important items. The cabinet was made into a baby's head (perhaps a baby's head) - he bit his finger and let his blood flow out. The baby's dry lips, as his son did - this magical tool is the sharp nose from other warlocks, but he made the re-casting, turned it into his own, and made and set Threshold lock similar error<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby’s mouth is wrongly opened, and some may wonder how a baby’s mouth can reach the limit like a snake, but the guard captain is watching Zhang was half as big as the head, and only felt fear and nausea when he exposed the mouth of the bare gums. He hesitated for a short time. He reached out and took out a small crystal bottle from the strange items that the mortal might not have been able to distinguish. It was also his son and he showed off - he served a succubus summoned by a mentor at the Warlock Tower. Because of his diligence and shamelessness, the succubus gave him a strand of hair before he left. He made a bottle. A precious potion, put it into the succubus's hair, so that as long as he drinks it, he can become a powerful demon, which can destroy the whole small town.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of Hongpao thought of this almost for the first time, and he thought maybe this is what fate expects him to do - he wants Ms. Rose, But he knows that if Ms. Rose is telling the truth, then he may never get him. What kind of person is his son? He is very clear, although he has always been proud that he has a warlock son,<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this warlock son is so mixed in the warlock tower that he doesn’t seem as good as he thought. If Ms. Rose’s brother really became a red robe valued by the mentor, maybe he Son will force him to forget any previous thoughts<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can be a demon, something more mortal than a warlock, he can get Ms. Rose, this small town, maybe the whole city is also uncertain<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought like this, unplugging the bottle cap and drinking all the things in one bite, the taste is not unacceptable, even a little sweet, but It didn't disperse, it didn't melt, but it went straight into his stomach—he did feel the power coming out from the depths of his body. He wanted to laugh, but he was slammed by a thought. - If it's a sharp nose, at the very least, as a warlock, he feels a bit wrong when he opens the cap, because the lid is cast like a spell, not to open it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nose is sitting on a chair covered in velvet with a seat and backrest. This chair is his most I like it, and the goose down in the mat is thick, but he only feels like sitting on a needle felt - the room is a bit cold, but he still looks like he has just been taken out of the bath, he rubbed his sweat with his fingertips nervously. It’s not late at night, but whether the other party is willing to accept his call is not something he can decide.But he is still lucky today, a vague figure (like floating water) soon appeared in the crystal ball, you can see that the image is frowning seriously, seems to be extremely dissatisfied because of the disturbanceDudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to pay for such a question, every precious thing that the other party asks for is holding the heart of the nose, and His understanding of the pointed nose is far more than the understanding of the pointed nose. The sharp nose has to wonder if he has a small devil hiding behind him. Maybe, maybe not, but this is not what he can now considerate<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Tell me first"The nose is pleading<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First give me"The warlock is ruthless to say, for the sharp nose, although it can not be said to be a complete loser, but also better than the loser, the guy who did not have the need to go to the virtual snake, and he I don't believe that the sharp nose will fulfill the promise after getting the answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp nose grabbed his finger in resentment, and he ran back to his study, quietly in the study, and looked no different from before he left. He wiped his blood on the baby's head and took a jewel from his mouth. This jewel that trapped a soul could be used by the warlocks to pay for the deal with the devil, and two reels. A rune, which he bought from the Master of the Thieves Guild, was used to protect himself, but now they can play a similar role, but the feeling of being forced and humiliated is not How do you feel good<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he still has to wait for a while, because the warlock who is willing to give him the answer should do the work of a companion, he could have waited for the nose It doesn't take too long to give an answer, but the sharp nose is not that important, at least for him - when he comes back again and the spell gets his own reward, the nose finally gets what he wants. Message to get<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad!" shouted his nose, "Dad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was looking for his own Father, but found that his father is not in this house.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————————————————————————————————————dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;很痛<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of the red robe curled up in a dark corner, where there was a pile of feces and dust...the big mouse and the donkey were here to make a nest, but a huge The black shadows descended from the sky and landed on their lairs. Except those who were unfortunately crushed at the beginning, the remaining little creatures fled and fled. After escaping a road, a mouse turned to look back. It is the oldest and most experienced of the rats. It is known that such attacks do not all represent disasters. Sometimes people or part of the human body are thrown here, and each can make them beautifully eaten for a long time. And the smell of this creature seems to indicate that it is one of them, it smells full of bloody smell and rotten smell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
