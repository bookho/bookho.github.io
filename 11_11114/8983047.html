			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 150th chapter of the team (18)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship is like a bird Proudly flying in the stormy waves, the whole body shines brighter than the Starlight River and the New Moon. Its white sails erect sharp corners, the silvery pattern flows in it, and its wings complement each other. It looks very small at first. Small is like being able to be placed on the palm of your hand, but the young thief apprentice just blinks a few times, it is big enough to fill your field of vision until it stops slowly in the pleasing call and piccolo The thieves who are responsible for monitoring this river beach have to lift their heads and back a few hundred feet to get a glimpse of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ship of the elves." A thief said, "You must let the collar know this thing right away." He flew away as he flew, and other thieves followed. Since then, no one wants to remind the younger son of the Baita Jewelry Association. For them, the boy who is only an apprentice rather than a full member is not their peers. His safety will not involve subsequent plans. As for his mentor, since he did not even veto the order, he did not think about leaving the sweet embrace of Pastor Fro, and let his apprentices act alone as a so-called vigilant mission in this desolate and barren river beach. What qualifications and obligations are there to be optimistic about this child? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, this kid is a double-handed, thieves don't want to add a tough competitor to the future, even though these thieves are at the lowest level of the guild for a long time. Classes (if they are not, they will not be assigned to this task), and perhaps they may not become an important member or leader in their lifetime, but they will not prevent them from taking advantage of the good life they have enjoyed before, and their parents. Love, and people's respect. If the elves kill him, then it's better. If not, it can be awkward to watch him, and it is quite pleasant to cry back and cry. Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief apprentice did not realize that he was ruthlessly abandoned by the "companion". He looked up and slightly opened his mouth and looked at everything in front of him with surprise. After the most beautiful ship he saw, the ladder of the vessel stretched out, and a group of people dressed in black dark brown or dark green robes walked down. Their hoods were deeper than those they had seen before. And wide, almost covering their entire face, they walked lightly on the riverbank, like sliding, robe flying, a few people came to him, the thief apprentice pulled out in horror, slammed it up , point to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thief's apprentice," Perant replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's still a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The python is carrying it in its mother's stomach Deadly venom," Perant said coldly: "Human children are sometimes more dangerous than adults because they don't know how to measure gains and losses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So let He slept for a while.” Perant’s companion, Elf Master, said he gestured, but was stopped by Perant: “Don’t waste your spells,” said Druid, who is close to the child and desperate in the latter. I want to pounce on my fingers when I pierce his abdomen. The tiny brown powder is released with the action of the druid. The young thief apprentice falls to the ground in the next moment of inhaling it. "I come to He took it to a farther place.” Perant said, then untied the robes, his body shrunk, his head thinned, his mouth stretched, his long ears tucked into his head, and the feathers were drilled from under the skin. Come out, and finally his clothes fell to the ground, a wizard brought a staff, and they took them into the ground. In the pocket of the second, and the place where Perant stood, there is only one giant eagle with a large body and a handsome figure. Even if it is only standing on the ground, its head can be in front of the elm of the elf mage. Ping, the mage stepped back two steps. The giant eagle patted his wings. The rune on the finger that was worn on the finger and now hung on the toe showed a soft light, and a magic breeze lifted the giant eagle. The body with considerable weight and volume, it flew up, hovering in the air for a few laps, accompanied by a sorghum eagle, it slammed down from the air, grabbed the sleeping boy, took him The eyes of the upper half of the elves were very good. The mage’s sight followed the giant eagle that had changed from Perant. It did not fly too far. There was a forest outside the wall of the White Tower, and a cluster of flourishing rafts outside the woods. Hemp and linen, the thieves' apprentices were thrown into it without mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When he wakes up, he will feel itchy," said the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And it hurts." Another Elf Mage added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant re-entered into the sky, the fierce wind rushed on the face, bending the small fluff of the bird's side constantly twitching the sensitive nostrils, he can Feeling the wind through his flying feathers, holding up his body, underneath him is a dull river beach, shining starlight river and white tower, it looks like a toy fortress bound in a glass ball. The elf's boat hovered over the Starlight River. In addition to the robes of the robes, there were fifty elf warriors and ten elf sorcerers on the ship. They were all the elves in the elves, even more than going to the Thunderbolt. The elves are more powerful and powerful, especially the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant eagle swallowed a cold air. He flew in the air, swept the woods on the bank of the river, and stunned the birds that had fallen asleep. The birds fluttered from the warm nests with horror. It was a druid who began to scream and complain after they bothered them, but they still obeyed when Perant made the order. Perhaps this is why I prefer animals rather than human relationships. Perant thinks that their wisdom sometimes Far from being a human being who is smart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some birds are already spawning or brooding, Perant tells them not to worry, he summons the plants, firmly wrapped around the nest of the birds . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all this was properly cooked, Perant fell back to the ground, this time he became a watery, shiny otter, and the innocent king of Gray Ridge The same white face and wide tail like a shovel, he ran around the riverbank, warning the little creatures to quickly, they drilled out of their caves and ran to the higher places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves wait patiently, they are not afraid of the obstacles that the White Tower’s thieves will cause to them, they even hope that the collar has the courage to be with them. The war silver crown jungle never directly intervenes in the battle between humans, but if it is attacked, their counterattack will be the most rapid and violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Perant drove away most of the creatures around him, White Tower was still asleep, with no indication that the Thieves Guild was doing something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard wizard took the clothes out of the pocket and handed it to Perant: "Can you start?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Always," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two elf sorcerers made a gesture, and the elf's ship vacated again, going upstream, and the junction with the Starlight River and the White River. After a certain distance, they stopped at the predetermined position. The previous two elf mages read the spell, and the wind sent them to the air, so that they could overlook the junction of the river and the river beach. In today’s action, they command all Elf Masters are watching their gestures and listening to their commands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first spell that was actually used for this action was a thunderous sound, accompanied by a huge shock wave, like the giant god’s deity. And with the fists slamming down, the shock wave pushed the rivers of the Starlight River and the inland river, leaving a distinct dent on the riverbed that had never been exposed to the sky for hundreds of years or longer. This is not the only one. More, the same spells poured out. They forced the rivers of the inland rivers and the Starlight River to roll back, and under the spells cast by other mages, they were frozen because of the extreme cold. The water level in the river suddenly rose, and the river hit the river beach. The pebbles and woods on the side, and the starlight river became more and more violent, it roared and continually hit the walls of ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spells cast by the third group of Elf Mage caused the riverbed at the junction to bulge and bulge out, and the inexhaustible soil was extracted from the ground and transformed into a solid stone embankment driven by magic. It was only one foot wide at first. But as the spell continues to throw, it has been extended to a width of hundreds of feet, and the height is flush with the river, or slightly higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It completely separates the inland rivers of the Starlight River and the White Tower, and it is no longer possible for ships to sail directly into the White Tower from the Starlight River. It is also impossible for the tower's vessels to sail directly into the Starlight River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the frozen walls created by the wizard wizards have begun to split, and the huge water pressure is unimaginable to the mortal. After a loud noise, the walls are broken. Cracked, the river directly hit the newly emerging barrier, but as the elves presupposed, the stone embankment did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long can they last?" Perant asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s longer than humans think," said the elf mage who was responsible for the matter. "It’s based on the rune plate, and the rune is given to me. It’s not someone else,” he said with a slight sigh: “It’s our king.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen holding her "son", standing on the highest tower in the fortress, looking down, the entire white tower can be seen from the window, and the elves' bloodlines ensure that she can be weak in the light. In the case, it is farther and clearer than ordinary humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master," her maid trembled and asked, "What happened?" The shock just dropped her from the bed, she thought it was The tower collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elves have given up the white tower." An Zhen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible," the maid shouted. "How is it possible? You are their child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A child who has been abhorred." An Zhen said, revisiting his eyes to the outside: "They abandoned the white tower and abandoned me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The people in Baita wake up from their sleep. They don't understand what it is. If they were in the past, they would run to the streets to observe the situation and discuss with their neighbors. But now, no one wants to be in the dark. There was a thief on the street. In the dark streets, people in the original White Tower liked the whale oil lamp in the hollow sandstone pillar at the door of the house, letting the delicate and lovely lights shine on the street and pointing out the home for those who left home. The direction, but since the thieves, the lights will attract them. After all, the family that can light the whale oil lamps all night will not be poor. They are almost aiming at this, so now people only light and have business when they are absolutely necessary. The reason for the shrinkage is inside, with a sharp decline in income Housewives have to plan carefully to live a good life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that your plan has failed." Red robe said that they also observed the situation outside the White Tower on a tall tower. Although they did not have the eyes of the elves, they had spells and magical instruments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only one of them failed, we can go another way, that road is also full of gold coins and intelligence. Fine network" thieves guild The female leader said calmly that she could not find any signs of depression or anger from her face, but people who could climb to this position were always angry and indifferent, so the red robe warlock was just out. A sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to hear the details." The warlock sneered at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the elves are willing to compromise," the female thief shrugged. "Of course it is good, we can get a complete white tower as before." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the elves are not stupid," said the red robe warlock. "And they are still very stubborn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we got a white pagoda that could no longer be sheltered and watched by the elves," said the female thief, who reached out and painted a circle: "Now the white pagoda, and the hills are ours." She twisted her waist and raised her chest: "We can show our strength in this land, thank the long-eared rabbits," she smiled and said, "The hills and the white towers are not." The power of other thieves' guilds is mixed with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no secret silver of the elves, lead white and red, white tower is not a white tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it goes with the Bibi dike, and the roads and dark lanes in the hills." Say, "We will build an unprecedented guild here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so," said the red robe: "Don't make me cute." The little disciple died in vain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry and Kerma They rested for a day at the "recessed corner". As the elves expected, Berry's father rushed to the nearest city with a few strong men, but their wives and children were left, they could not walk out in the wilderness. Far away, there is also danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
