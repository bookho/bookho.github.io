Ah ah... ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Have she ever been allergic to flowers?” Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin recalled, he remembered Leona holding her favorite lilac bouquet in the hallway, and the hall and bedroom The floor is always covered with rush and dry lavender. He knows that some people will strangely sneeze as soon as they smell the smell of flowers. This is the case with one of his knights, so he never sent him to Thunderbolt in the spring and summer, because he sneezed like It’s like a thunder, it’s like a shower, and the tremors don’t even catch the weapon, but he did not find something similar in Leona’s body: “I don’t know,” he said; I haven't seen her like this before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe she is only allergic to white velvet." Kerry understands, "You have thin linen or silk." He asked Liona: "Hold it on your face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona nodded, her pocket, but she also knew the shape. It is bigger than the one in Gülen or Kremar's waist. She knows that she can't get back to the king in a short time, so she brought all the belts, and there are two pieces. The tulle short robe from Rees is used for wearing in the midsummer. It is said that it is not directly threaded but directly woven with silk. Baotou unusually soft, even if consecutive three folds can also see a mole on the skin through the fabric, is very valuable. She put her hand into the seemingly ordinary bag, groping it out, pulling out the piece of fabric, folding it on her knee before anyone else could find out its purpose, and covering it with her face. I made a knot behind my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin and Kremar were not recognized, Kerry had lowered his eyes when he saw it at first sight, Gülen also Just snoring in my heart, only Mei Mei has been staring at it, she knows this fabric, in her mother's Temple of Fro, the chief priest of the temple has such a piece, not cut, only in the festival of Fro When she received the most important guest, she wrapped it in her body. She was usually put in a silver plaque filled with myrrh for antiseptic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really like it?" The thief whispered as she passed by her, and Mei Mi was shocked and found that they had begun to enter the swamp. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar studied a small tree with red branches and found that its red color does not belong to them. It is the moss that grows on the bark. Where there is sufficient water, they show a blood-like appearance. Blush, dry moss is much more eclipsed, and easy to remove, like iron powder sticking to the branches, the breeze blowing them will fall down in pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey afterwards is not as imaginary as Mei Mei imagined. From the beginning, it was full of dirty mud and black water. Although the elf walked in front, it never reminded They paid attention to their feet. "We haven't really entered the snow cover swamp yet." He said so, the land they stepped on under their feet is as secured by Kerry, although it is soft but has a reliable support, white cashmere is in full bloom. The flowers are just gently falling on other plants. They don't look like stacked snow, but they look like a mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long will we go through the swamp?" Birdwin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The swamp is constantly changing," said Kerry Ben. "If the lucky god Temola is willing to bring her glory to us, then maybe It only takes a week for us to reach the other edge of the swamp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are monsters," said the thief Gülen: "The merchants are willing to walk from here." In addition to reducing the distance, another reason is that no guild can be stationed in the snow cover swamp." He only hopes that he can continue to encounter some gadgets like goblins, if they encounter the devil or the dragon, among them. Who must have been watched by toxic eyes, the thief does not think that the person will be him, he is just a mortal, and has already carried a curse of a god. He swears that if he meets again, those who are supposed to be in the whole narrative The monster that should appear when the poem ends, he must try to get rid of this group of guys, even if one must face the assassin sent by the new king of Norman, at least they are still people... well, it should be human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※The next content is changed within two hours...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone looked at Leona, she raised her fingertips and touched her lips, and touched her nose again:" I seem to be... oh oh! oh oh oh oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have she been allergic to flowers before?"

It is said that it is not used by the line. The silk is directly woven, and the texture is unusually soft and thin.
