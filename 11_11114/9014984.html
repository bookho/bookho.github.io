Kerry’s soft voice said to his animal companion, a small rolling cockroach, who would write The small shirt with a small print was rolled up, and the bee wax borrowed from the caster as a casting material to wrap it tightly, passing through a thin Mithril chain from the middle and hanging it in Goshala. On the neck, Ji's body is only as long as the palm of an adult male, and it has to fly thousands of miles to send this critical and critical letter to the gray ridge, which may hit a heavy rain, a hurricane or a raptor. A little extra burden can lead to results that Kerry would not want to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, although they found parchment and ink in the priest’s home, the weight of the rough parchment was really Too cruel, especially after it has been soaked in water. In the second pocket of Kremar, there are some tampons, which are thin and light paper made from the skin of the unborn cow and fetus, but these papers are dedicated to the same as the specially treated thin goatskin. Reel's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona took away dozens of reels when she left the kingdom, and Mullen’s new lord, Mullen, unabashedly took the ruling official All the scrolls of the library were given to them, but Kreima has already seen these scrolls one by one, and some of them are not very clear (please forgive this uncompromising school residue), some powerful, but not suitable This nearly innocent white swamp they need more, targeted spell storage, Kerry is very familiar with this, he told Kremar, then Kreima went to prepare those spells and Copy it on the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Kerry used his "Starlight" to cut a smooth piece of clothing from his spare shirt, and the elves’ shirts were pulled out with silver-bellied spiders. The silk thread is woven, light as a morning fog, but in the toughness comparable to the skin, Kerry has made a small pen that can only be pinched with fingertips, using the bristle tits' hair. The ink mixed with his ink priest's ink can be used to drink porridge. In contrast, the ink used by the caster to copy the scroll is as thin as dripping from the deep ochre. Every letter he wrote on the silk shirt was only as small as the tits of the tits: the elves detailed the dangerous fungi they found under the nest of the goblin, and their "gardeners" and guards. By. There are also inferences and speculations associated with it, and a new tip of poison and its ashes are attached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is very important." Kerry Ben said: "You can only hand it to Perant." He used his fingertips to touch the small head of Ji Yun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feathered mottled bird comfortably closed the eyes with the yellow circle and screamed, and the relatives rubbed Kerry's finger with his own cockroach to feed it a little wild honey. Gosura is not an aboriginal of the silver-crowned jungle. It lives in the hotter south with its people, but because the bird is small and has a cute flat face, it is very popular with women. Rogues and business people naturally use them as a commodity. When Kerry found it, it was still an egg, its brothers and sisters were dead, and it survived tenaciously. Kerry wanted to send it back to the South, but it seemed to be the mother of Kerry who hatched it, and would not leave him anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Kerry’s contract with the companion, Gossula is stronger than its peers and grows like a bird in the north under the feathers. Thick down feathers, but it is essentially a less cold-resistant worm. If he can, Kerry would not want to choose Gosura, but he can't guarantee that other birds can send this important letter to Perant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Perant received the letter. The silver-crowned jungle and the elves who are traveling will search here. The elves will destroy all the poisonous tips and find those who dare to cultivate this terrible mushroom, or other evil creatures, and then relentlessly put them. Sending to the bottomless abyss Since they like this kind of thing that can call the devil, they should be happy to be the devil's neighbors with little effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching the flight of Ji Yun to the sky of lavender, the elf returned to the house, the hearth was already ignited, and Gülen stood up when he saw him: "Yes "It’s time for dinner," he said. "I want to go..." He gestured: "Can that adult be disturbed now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Village Long houses are not so suitable for copying scrolls, with the consent of the villagers. Krimal requisitioned the priest's room, which was inlaid with glass, quiet and bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went back to him," Kerry Ben said. "But before the meal. Can you do me a favor?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say." Birdwin touched his cheek and gave a scorn when he touched the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know your weight?" The elf asked: "If you don't know, or you know, but can't guarantee the correct, I suggest you try to weigh A moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want to know this?" Mei Mi asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s because of the relationship with the swamp." The thief replied: "The weight of the elf is completely different from that of human beings, so he can't use his own standards. We can't walk where we can go, so he needs to know our weight to make sure that the ground on the way can support our body, so as not to cause unnecessary accidents."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei turned her face. She didn't know how to treat Gülen. At that time, she thought that Gülen would beat herself, or worse, kill her, but the thieves just stepped back two. step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are betraying." The thief said as if he was prophesying and cursing: "Betray your past, betray your mother and sister, Betray your faith and god, you will regret it, Mei Mi, when you are covered in suffocation, dying, spit out the smell of rotten, you will hate the present, everything you give will be in vain, your * *Broken and your soul can't be redeemed, and you can't get to the end. You will eternal life running on the plains of mourning, avoiding the devil's and demonic claws, eating only the dust, inhaling only the cold wind and what you want, forever It will only be an absurd shadow, an illusory nightmare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tone is so calm, just like describing a flower But more than the roar and roar, Fro's pastor is all over the body, she is standing in the same place, unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the thief’s performance did not happen, as always, he ridiculed and satirized a sly plum, and then concentrated on dealing with the sheep. Milk, lamb and bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following content is changed after an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s going to work hard, Gossula." Kerry Ben softly said to his animal companion, a rounded little cockroach. He rolled up a pleated shirt with a small print, borrowed a beeswax from the caster as a casting material, wrapped it tightly, and hanged it through a thin Mithril chain from the middle.

Kerry was very familiar with this. He told Kremar, then Kreima went to prepare the spells and copied them on the reels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Kerry used his "Starlight" to cut a smooth piece of clothing from his spare shirt, and the elves’ shirts were pulled out with silver-bellied spiders.
