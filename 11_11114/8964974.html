			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long has this been going on?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About four months," said the priest of Ilmot. "Because there are no grass leaves to feed the animals in winter, sheep and chickens besides cattle. They were all slaughtered. At first, a family member was stolen from a salted chicken. The owner of his family asked me to preside over justice. No, I am not very good at applying detection spells, but I have eyes and Ears, there are some insignificant rights, but it is not humans who steal the chickens - the thieves are coming again soon, I am chasing them up and grabbing the meat from their claws."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, while lifting a small bucket from the stump that enshrines the idol, and walked out of the room that was not spacious but bright enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are very surprised to shoot these bats, because this winter is not too cold, although the berries and young leaves are gone, but they are not covered with plants. Heavy snow, these bats can make a living by sucking the mud from the branches - we have seen them do this - but the problem is that even in the past, those long and harsh winters have never happened. Bats steal meat and attack humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Attacking humans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hid the bacon and the eggs in the cellar or the water tank. They couldn’t find the meat and started attacking humans...” The priest said, pulling up a leafy grass from his herbal garden. The thing, the onion that grows the leaves, is also the holy flower of Ilmot. He fills the keg with soil and buryes the onions in the soil: "put them in the benevolent Ilmot Under the eyelids, it will be exceptionally good to come to Japan." The pastor explained: "The big one, the taste is sweet, add some oil to cook. It’s like fat, ah, I’ve just said that, right, the bat started attacking humans,” he said. “The first is a child who sneaked into the woods to pick berries. He cried and ran home. Only the ear, his parents sent him to my way, was also bitten by a group of bats, one was sucked blood. One was bitten off the finger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you dispelling the bat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the priest walked back in the keg: "My tutor said I have nothing but piety, but I think I still have something to offer. I learned the burning hand and panic from him, and repaired minor injuries. Although the last one I didn't have enough grasp - but kind Ilmot gave me herbs," he said proudly. "They can treat any kind of disease. Does your friend like onion soup? That is the most wonderful kind of medicine I have ever seen and know. Whether you are cold or sunburned, or bitten by a snake, you are scratched by a sickle, as long as you have onions .. Will be able to end of the story, if not then add a little tomato "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;He prayed the barrel of onion to the statue of Ilmot, prayed for a while, and got up and went to the kitchen - also the vestibule of the church, where there was a hearth, and some were fortunate Like the peasants who kept some of their income, a hot pot was hung on the hearth. He set aside the charcoal fire, let them burn, and dug out the bread and onions from a large wooden bucket near the hearth, and a hard, black grease. "Lard," the priest said: "It's a good oil, the burdock gave it to me, you know. In the pig's stomach, there is such a good place that is full of fat, he cut a piece so generously. Give it to me - he was also harmed by the bats. One afternoon he heard his cow calling, and when he went to the bull ring to see it, he found that his cow was covered by bats, Ilmot I don’t know which god gave him the courage. He just waved the torch and yelled, and his cow didn’t matter, his eyes were almost dug out.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which bats will appear even during the day?" Kerry helped the top when the priest tried to pour the liqueur from another big wooden barrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"anytime, anywhere." The pastor said, "And more and more - have you only seen one last night?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it is a single order," said the Elf Ranger. "It tried to grab a bear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The power is infinite, isn't it," said the priest. "In just a few days, the baby they had taken away, a seven-year-old girl was also embarrassed," he handed the wooden cup to the elf. "This It's my brewed light wine, using the wild berries in the woods, the lords have allowed - and not my wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor's light wine In fact, it tastes like a water with bile and vinegar. The priest looks at the elf and drinks it. He smiles and takes back the cup: "Because it is not good, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is a herbal wine," said the priest happily. "With sour sedge and aconite, it is good for those who have been hurt. Don't look at me. I know that you also have injuries, healing potions." Very good, but herbs can make up Insufficient place," he poured a full cup again. "Bring it to your companion." He said: "With three days of drinking, they will be able to live and dance like they did before they were injured." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And bread, I don't have a tray, but there is a writing board, I will cook some onion soup," the priest continued. "With meat, you guys." I will need this, but unfortunately, the pig's trotters that have been sent to me have been eaten by me. According to the Seris people, where to eat, we can cook it for the soldier to eat - or we can try it. Can you get some claws from the wild ducks if they have not been taken away by the damn winged mice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf carried three cups of light wine through the altar of Ilmot. When it was near dusk, the thin sunlight had shifted its position, and it was on the barrel of onion, perhaps indeed with the glory of Ilmot. It is so green and vigorous, and Ilmot’s face hidden under the hood stares at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin has been lying on the bed under the insistence of Mei Mi, and he is really going to the limit, anyway, he has flowed too much blood. And lost his arm, the healing potion is not a potion, can't replace sleep and food - their group has never eaten since Pharaoh's banquet for Baldwin - the one steals from the bear's paw The fish was scorched, and the ducks were all returned to the pair of furry mothers and sons. The only thing that made their stomachs feel a little comforting was a small bottle of winter honey from Kerry, each of which was only a shallow sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves gave bread and light wine to them. The bread was thick and mixed with gravel. Fortunately, whether it was plum or thieves, or Bedwin, They have been in this life for a while with this bread, or worse food, and they are very hungry, and Kerry would not care about this. He was a wandering ranger. Only Kreima took a small piece. First, food was not indispensable to him. Second, he didn't want to torture himself unnecessarily. The lich took a bite of bread. After immersing it in light wine, it was found that it was not difficult to eat. It was a bit like the film and television props caused by wood chips and plastic foam in the memory of the alien soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is probably the most rewarding bounty ever," said the thief, even with a wooden cup that could cover his entire face. He still looks like a shadow that is broken down from the haze of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reward?" Mei Mi looked at the elf in amazement. The slender eyebrows wrinkled together. She sits at the end of the bed, given that there is only one chair in the room, and this chair is being occupied by the caster, and she must be tired than any of the four, and the position chosen by Pastor Fro is nothing wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief didn’t want to answer this question, but made a gesture of viciousness and disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is why we can enter the village so easily and easily, and get the hospitality." The elf calmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we have all been hurt." Mei Mi said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Reassured,” said the thief. “I won’t have you,” he said scornfully. “A dead wild boar will be more useful than you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So," Bird said. "Is it related to those bats?" He showed his elf a slightly swollen thumb: "I accidentally touched its teeth before." After receiving a positive reply from the elf. He bent the thumb: "Do they know where the bats came from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should know." Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin looked at his arm, "Tomorrow," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And me." The caster said that the undead had smelled familiar scent from the bats, like those on the hills. Rabbit - he planned, if the bats were really a red robe behind him, he managed to leave. What they didn't need most now was to draw the attention of a red robe - of course, at least with Kerry, some Difficult, but he can make those stupid villagers think they are related to this disaster. Then they will wield grass forks and sticks to drive them away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei suddenly panicked, she didn't want to get along with Gülen alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can, too," said Mei Mi. "I am a pastor, and at least better than the priest of Ilmot."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a good statement. It is a bit unfair. The servant of Ilmot is a man," the thief said sarcastically, drinking the last bit of light wine: "And, Mei Mi, when you want to say something that is not very pleasant. It is best to listen to the outside motion first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the cup and strode over Straight to the hidden wooden door: "I smell the smell of broth," he said: "added onions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. The priest of Ilmot replied calmly, his hands wrapped in thick linen and carrying the two ears of the clay pot, so he failed to knock on the door in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed the pot on the small table, and Gülen grabbed the wooden spoon inside and smashed the steaming broth into his wooden cup. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry," said the priest of Ilmot, calmly saying, "I do have the will to ask you to help the village - and just like this Mr. Bit said, we don't have a lot of money. Most of the people here have never seen a silver coin, but things have grown to the point where I have no way to control it." He rolled up his sleeves. Show these strangers some scars of deep visible bones: "When I see you." He said to Kerry Ben: "I saw your companion again, I said to myself, Ilmot Responding to your petition, he sent you here, and I sincerely ask for your help - we have nowhere to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand..." Bydwin said, but he hadn't had time to finish it, and he heard a terrible cry outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry originally rushed out of the room - a pregnant woman, leaning over the barrel, as if she was going to the well to get water, a few gray The bats surround her, and the size of the bat is twice as big as that seen by the elf last night. It looks like a fierce bird. They made a sharp voice, and with the same sharp claws, they grasped the woman’s arm that protected her head and abdomen, and grabbed bloody meat from above. The more dangerous thing for women than the one she was carrying, A teenager in his teens, who was supposed to raise water is his own work, perhaps because his bat had attacked the child, so his mother followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenagers were turned to the ground by bats, they slammed their wings fiercely, tore his clothes, and extended his mouth to suck his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has shot the first arrow, and Birdwin shot the second arrow, the latter is not an elf, but his head is not much better. And more powerful and fierce - the arrow of the Elf Ranger runs through the eyes of the bat, and the arrow of Birdwin nails them to the ground, or wear them together, like a skylark ready to be sent to the oven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the distant, Tyre’s hall, inscribed with Baldwin. On the side of the balance of Don Clay's name, a crystal powder like a condensed sunlight was sprinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pastor nervously looked at the balance, the balance was cast in black iron, inlaid with the name of Mithril, in the temple of Tyre, such a balance There are thousands of them - they are basically balanced, neither dumping to the right nor dumping to the left - some balances have a slight tilt, and the name on the top becomes dim, indicating that the balance represents The paladin is on the wrong path. In general, the priest will promptly warn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin. Donkre’s balance was only overnight, no warning before, no one can understand what this is all about, even With the devil's temptation, the Paladin's balance is usually gradual, and it has never been seen in the memory of the priest for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why," the young priest asked puzzledly: "I saw it, those lights...Bedwin did good deeds, why his Is the balance still motionless?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
