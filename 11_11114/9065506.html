It just fell around Amos, and the cetyl wax splashing on the ground quickly burned. He was supported by the slaves. Retreating, Dada, who had been kneeling at the foot of Amos, jumped like a beast at this time and rushed to the outside of the hall. Amos savagely pushed the slave who was holding him, and repeatedly explored it at his waist. It was only a few times that they remembered that their weapons were dismantled when they entered the main island of the East Pole. He quickly searched for it in the smoke and the fire. The copper lamp fell into his eyes and it was shaped into a sword. The shape of the fish, and the swordfish is named because it has a pointed and long captain. The fierce tip can be used as a weapon. Amos ran over and untied his silk robe. The pedestal, the curved tail of the swordfish, lifted it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amos is the youngest and weakest, his seat is the most in the pillars of all the lords, and he is only behind Dada. A few breaths of time, as we have described before, the pillar hall of the lord is surrounded by a convex corridor, the corridor is connected with a white stone trestle, the bridge directly extends into the sea, the platform at the end can be used as The dock can also be used for airships to take off and land - Amos first saw the airship decorated like a boat of the gods, the white airbags have been bulging, and many beautiful gnomes are like little dolls. That's busy on it, but it's not landing, but flying away. A mage makes his voice unusually loud and threatens the despicable craftsmen, but Amos doesn't think they will suffer because of it. After such intimidation and landing, after all, there is a greater threat that is approaching them - when the sea does not know when it is quietly retreating, revealing hundreds of feet of white sand, shells such as corals, fish and crabs. Animals in the sand The panic crawling on all fours, flapping, seawater had flooded into the chest Kyi and other child slaves, and now. They can all see the feet of Ji Er. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a precursor to the tsunami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amos stood there, Dada is rushing to the shoal, which is on both sides of the trestle, he jumped into the raging sea. Swim to Jier, untie the rope that bound her, and when the dolphant came curiously around them, he could hardly press the fear of his heart and kicked it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolphins are aggrieved. The effects of those drugs became weaker in the animal's instinct to disaster. It and its people were not stranded. In the muddy sea, the gray figures of the dolphins were looming, they tried to sneak into the deep sea, but the surging force They are pushed to the shoal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run," Jier shouted: "Run to the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Dada was fiercely stunned by Jill. The eyes were interrupted, but he did not understand why Jier would say that the pillar hall only exceeded the sea level but only a few dozen feet. Even if the tsunami did not engulf it, the soldiers and masters of the lord would catch them. Dada knows that a narrow road that is not known can allow both of them to sneak into the depths of the main island. In this chaotic situation, the lord may not remember to capture two slaves, they can hide, and then he will Take Jier to the side of the island, although his new owner has become the food of the giant lizard, but there is an elf on the side of the island, the elves are always benevolent and gentle, and Kerry is still a believer in Su Lun. He will be willing to help them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too late." Jier said, "Believe me, Dada, don’t you understand? The previous lords built their fortress and palace here. For some reason." For a moment, Dada really wants to ask if he can really believe her again, but they have heard ominous The roar, he followed Jier back to the place where the danger was even greater than the tsunami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the reason?" he asked when he helped Ji Er to avoid a shouting gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yadel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers have revealed an unbelievable look. In this plane ruled by the gods and the devil, the temple, the sanctuary, and the temple can Said to be the most special existence. Especially for mortals - an evil god, such as the priest of Talos, who can set off the storm and roll up the waves to destroy the sanctuary of Rosada on an island. For them, this is merit and glory; But if a group of mortals rush into the sanctuary and smash it with a torch, they can be violent before the priest of Rosada or the Paladin of Tyre to capture and judge. Pastor Talos was thrown into the sea and was swallowed up by the white shark, the messenger of Talos. Whether they believe in Talos or not, this thing is not done to please Talos, the pastors only care about their authority and Will pets be divided, and whether their innate talents are despised and despised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a temple, a sanctuary, a temple, it can be destroyed, burned, and annihilated, but it is still powerful, like the Temple of Fro, which is everywhere, many of which are empty and collapsed. Stumbled, but if a mortal does not notice the sacred emblem of the sweet peas and inadvertently steps into it, he may still be bound by the power of the vines and wildflowers. The best result is a serious illness. The worst is probably death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are very smart," Yadel explained. "Perhaps there is a great caster who is guiding them," he asked to briefly observe the surroundings. It’s easy to find light-colored stones in the criss-crossing shades of green: “The cornerstone of the temple has not been removed, and there are no buildings or people that affect everything in this area. There are still people here. Dedication, to ensure that this temple is not abandoned," here is like a deserted courtyard, but the slate on the ground is infiltrated with brown patches. It is said that there are still people here to sacrifice Talos. "The god of the storm did not have too much demand for his temple. He only paid attention to whether his followers and pastors violated his teachings." In fact, a god like this There are many, like Ilmot, whose priest is open to a small room to be his sacred church. He is also happy to accept it, but Talos only cares about it: "I don't know the history." How do the lords of the East Crown deceive? - No, maybe they are not bullying, they just steal the power of Talos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But none of them Appeared..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This power is not for someone," said Yadel: "It is used in palaces and fortresses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tsunami arrived as scheduled, and it stood up. Covering the sun and the sky, every place that is visible is gray-blue water, just like the god's hand, in the moment, the entire East Crown main island is pressed into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea was the first to swallow up an airship that was swaying into the air, and Amos heard someone laughing. He turned his head and found that it was their old father. The chaos in the pillar hall seemed to have been under certain control. The lord was surrounded by the caster and the soldier, and the muddy eyes swept past Amos. . The meaning of it is that Amos shudders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada and Jier huddled under the trestle, they were too late, and there was no way to escape the eyes of others into the hall, Dada hugged Ji Er, She was covered in sand, her hands and feet were cold, and only the faces were abnormally exuding disturbing temperatures. "They..." Her lips twitched. "They built a palace around the temple of Talos," in her When the elder brother looked over. The lord’s most beloved female slave blinked: “And the temple of Talos is not affected by any storms, volcanoes, earthquakes or other disasters, so...” She shuddered and looked at them like a mountain. Tide down the tide: "This is... the safest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amos looked at the sea in front of him, as if there was an invisible and powerful god overlooking them, reaching out for the mortal to stop this abrupt disaster, he put down his knees and prayed incoherently. With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" shouted the lord of the East Crown, and he entered an indescribable state of excitement, like drinking a whole barrel of honey. It was like spending the night with Fro's incarnation and his eyes were red. The lips are purple and pale, and a strip of blue blood vessels protrudes from under the skin. The pale yellow hair flutters in the wind. He was also wearing the robes embroidered with lightning, and the lightning emblem on the robes shone like a real thunder in dim light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an expected change. The priests of Talos have certainly seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He deceived us!" the priest of Talos shouted. "Is it strong and respectable, my god will actually protect such a leader and unbelievers." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is absolutely impossible!" the chief pastor retorted, although there was a moment when he thought of whether it was because the owner of the East Crown had an inexpressible blood. But he immediately rejected this guess, and then he thought of a possibility. Before he has not followed Talos, or in the distant past where his grandfather was not born, when the building community they saw has not yet fallen to the first pillar, will there be a Talos there? What about the temple? Just like the temple they built on that small island, the only way to explain why it can be fearless and violent tsunami and hurricane, even when the East Crown is swallowed by volcanic ash and lava at any time, its The owner still lives in peace and even has a heart to hold a grand festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron puts a holy emblem, the emblem of Rosada, clenching At the time, it is no longer hot, but warm - it is inlaid with precious sun stones, like the sunlight on the clouds, surrounded by golden laurel leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last step. Yadel has no regrets to put it on the altar that belongs to Talos and is contaminated by blood and internal organs. The clean water poured on it is like a transparent carapace condensed on the smooth surface of the altar. There is no penetration or dispersion. But when the holy emblem is put down, they melt immediately, and the holy emblem is after a while. With a crisp squeak, the Cavaliers repaired it as if it was breaking from the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Purification." Yadel said, then the Cavaliers and he saw the burst out of the sun stone. Dazzling light, every clean and dust-free morning water is refracting and absorbing this light, and the whole altar is covered with omnipresent light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This light is so hot and beautiful, but it won’t burn their eyes. The Cavaliers can clearly see the altar twisted and broken. Peeling layer by layer, he even heard the anger of a beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light rushes into the sky, even in the daytime, it can still be seen by mortals thousands of miles away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers who chased Yadel and the Cavaliers will certainly not let go of this weird sign, they quickly surrounded the area, armed with the soldiers of the Cross Out of the tall ferns, dozens of arrows made of stainless steel are aimed at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a mage, he throws a reel, the reel sticks out of countless black tentacles after landing, the knight repairs a sword, several tentacles fall On the ground, but more tentacles got out of the shadows under his feet, tightly bound his legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yaliel yelled at the spell loudly, and took a shot on the Cavalier’s body. Those tentacles suddenly felt like they could see the enemy who could not fight. Shrink back faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A pastor?" The wizard flew in the air and looked at Yadall arrogantly: "Rosada's? The god of morning light is so kind and tolerant." So, even the criminals who bear the two crimes of blasphemy and defamation can get his pardon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knight repair wants to say something, but Yadel caught him and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master raised his hand, he got the order without oysters, the soldiers raised the crossbow, he knew that this moment may not be able to form any harm, but can Consume the magic that the priest might pray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But before the soldiers let go of their fingers, they heard a terrible and huge sound that they had never heard before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
