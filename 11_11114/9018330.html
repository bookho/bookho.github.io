			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact," the owner of the caravan leaned over and poured a cup of hot tea for Kerry, although in a sense, the drink was light. It’s not like a cup of tea. It only has two or three lemongrass, plus a spoonful of white snow honey: “I always wanted to know you, but the lucky god Tamora is quite popular with me in other respects. But every time I have the honor to visit the Alva Master of Bibi Dibao, you have not left or have not yet arrived, and you know, as a businessman, my time is always dominated by the respectable Woking. And your whereabouts are as unpredictable as the clouds in the sea breeze. I think I should still offer a grand sacrifice for my gods Woking and Temola, after we leave here. Look, they Let me meet you, or when I am in the worst situation in my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beware, you may be overstated," the Ranger smiled : "Is there no spellcaster in your caravan?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." The owner of the caravan said that the caravans who were able to trade with the orcs through the Thunder Bluffs could not have no casters, and the fierce mercenaries were able to withstand a small number of orcs. Invasion, but the poisonous beasts released by the orc priests can only be defended and resisted by the casters. "They are also very good," the master said bluntly: "I also promised that at least I can return to my home safely. The problem is that I have my goods, my apprentices, they are some of the most trustworthy good children. As for the mercenaries I hire, they are also loyal, not to a last resort, I will not let go of them alone, which will cause me to lose a lot, whether from property or reputation."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that the owner of the caravan is a person who knows how to observe and observe, and has long sleeves and good dances. He has not blindly requested, asked for or even wants to marry them, perhaps he is indeed twirling. Seeking help, but the performance is not so aggressive or pitiful. He talks with them, laughs, and lets the female slaves play the musical instruments and send delicious snacks to create a warm and calm atmosphere. The atmosphere is not like a happy atmosphere. The stranger who met in the snow cover swamp, like a long-lost friend, the undead person looked down at his cup, and his servant was equally understanding They didn't give everyone the same food and drink. As mentioned above, there are two or three dark brown lemon grass and a spoonful of snow honey in the elf's cup. Although the snow is on the mage's cup. But the weight is twice that of the former, and it is sliced ​​olives under the snow that has not melted, and the surface is floating with mint. Both of them can moisten the lungs and clear the throat, avoiding hoarseness, and are the casters. First choice; in front of Birdwin is a heavy and thick mead, strong winter wine, add a few tablespoons of mellow honey after heating, sprinkle a thick layer of walnut, hazelnut and other nuts mixed powder, stir evenly Then throw in a rich and sweet butter, this drink may make the average person horrified, especially when the cup that carries it is as big as Birdwin’s head, but for the knight who needs nutrition and heat. It's a great addition; Mei Mi got a round silver cup with a beautifully carved, inner layer of gold, with tiny rose petals floating inside, with fine sugar, and the caster noticed that she hit it from time to time. The Liao Na, Highland Norman king is a woman holding a tall porcelain, from the modeling point of view, it can be said to be almost not worth mentioning, but perhaps because no more decorations to dominate. It's black, but it's not the kind of rigid and monotonous black, but the velvet black with peacock blue and crow green. It's only inlaid with tiny gold lines on the base and the edge. It is said that this color is only the Seris. In order to be fired, a mineral more expensive than gold is needed in the process of firing, and only one piece can be found to be perfect in a thousand finished products. Others are always regrettable. Hey, it is so rare that only the immediate royal family members and powerful lords are qualified to touch and use. The cinnamon fragrance in the cup is simple and strong, and it is lasting and sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food is just a simple rice cake and barbecue, with a spiced snake meat. The rice cake is also the food of the Seris. The thief leans lazily and squints, and it is not easy to notice the owner of the tent. Like the caster, it is black hair, the eyes are dark brown, the forehead is flat, and the outline of the facial features is not so clear. It may have a part of the Serisian lineage. Gülen rotates the gold cup in his hand. It is also a hot mead, but the base is not Winter wine is a kinder ale, and it is more suitable for a thief who needs to be vigilant at any time. He lifts the cup to cover his half face, and his eyes quickly touch the caster sitting opposite, the caster is obviously The same idea as him. The thieves really hope that their small team has not yet become famous because of the existence of Birdwin and the Queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many adventurers want their names to appear in the mouth of every bard, Gülen is a thief who bears the curse of the god of death. He just wants to get rid of the reward of the Norman New King in the Highlands as soon as possible. He is not familiar with the Dragon Fire Island, but Drake, his former associates and the situation he described there, consists of three large islands and several small islands. Unlike the Azores, the Dragon Fire Island is made up of hundreds of similarly sized islands. The lords of more than ten fingers rule them. It’s no exaggeration to say that they are not only the king of the Dragon Islands but also those The gods of civilians and slaves or you can not count civilians. The number of civilians on the Longhuo Island is very small, and the rest are slaves. The ratio of the latter to the former is almost one hundred and one. The slaves fished, fished, planted tobacco, beets, and delicious fruit. The wealth they exchanged saturated the lord’s inner treasury, allowing him to arm his army with a firmer and sharper weapon shield. Hire a caster and a thief to create a towering fortress in the walls, and buy more slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every country, every city, even every village, you may see slaves," Drake drank sweet more at once. Drinking drunkenly said: "But there is no worse than the slaves of Longhuo Island... Hey, look, whether it is in Bibi Dibao, Norman in the Highlands, or the Azores, or even In the seventy-seventh islands, slaves always think about running away. At the very least, they will be lazy from time to time. When you beat them with a whip, they will always scream and the sword will be cut on them. They are also I will struggle with one or two. But in the Longhuo Islands, dear, the slaves I have seen are not as good as a group of cows. They don’t know how to be tired, they don’t know the pain, they don’t know what is called joy, no, maybe There are still a few times when the young and middle-aged slaves were gathered together in a certain fixed time, and then drank the so-called honey water, prompting them to dear to each other so that they could give birth to more small slaves. But they are not allowed to have a husband or wife After that night, men and women will be separated. The babies born by women are confused and kept together. It’s like raising chickens or lambs. It’s nothing, you know the slaves after death. What? They will not be burnt to ash, nor will they be thrown into the sea, it will be too wasteful, they..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, even Drake, who has been degraded as a devil, can't help but shudder: "They will be put into a stone mill and ground into plasma. These plasmas are mixed in the wood chips and placed on the slate. As a reward, some desperate slaves can eat this kind of cake. Think about it, they are eating their own father, eating their own mother... eating their own brothers and sisters... eating The child who died before... This is still a rare favor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan must admit that he felt a little uncomfortable at the time, though He and Drake are both cruel and selfish, ruthless guys, but when they think that tens of thousands of human beings are working hard to eat their own blood, even the daring thief leader has never thought of it. After droking Drake, he had been to the Longhuo Islands several times. After all, the lord there was the most generous, but he never mentioned a word related to Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for a guy who needs to be forgotten by the whole plane, Longhuo Island is a hiding place that has never been better, because of the lords there. With unshakable authority, it is difficult for the Thieves’ Guild to stand on the Longhuo Island, and the rights of the followers of the great gods are suppressed to the lowest, and because the lords of the islands are constantly conquering each other. To rob the relationship between the island and the slaves, the rulers quite welcome the capable people to work for them, and they don’t care or care about their past lords, so they can’t be rejected, so you may see any on the Longhuo Islands. Because of this, a face, unless there is hatred of deep bone marrow, otherwise they always try to turn a blind eye and listen to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan intends to find one or more lords who need thieves and assassins on Longhuo Island, serve them for a short period of time, accumulate rewards and ask for a certain A red robe can find the red robe in every chaotic place. What's more, there are countless "materials" in the Longhuo Islands. The red robe will make a special mask, which is like covering the face. It's a real face, unless the owner dies or if he wants to, he can't get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way he can at least escape the eyes of the guild and the Norman New King of the Highlands, and then slowly find a way to relieve the curse of the god of death. Glan feels that the guild does not Willing to lift the curse for him purely because his identity and talents are not enough for the guild to use more resources, not impossible, he does not believe that no one has killed the priest of the god of death before him, but he never I have heard that someone can be permanently deported by death. It can only be said that those who have been cursed have finally taken control of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may take a long time, but the thief is always optimistic, and there is a former paladin who is vowed to regain his favor from Terre. He doesn’t think that Kravo will be more troubled than Tyre. You can become a member of another guild by your own means. The "dark thorn" or the newly-argued and unstoppable "fine net" with the other two great guilds, the curse of the god of death, Ge Lan has already No longer as scared and scared as at first, after "habit", he felt that it might still be one of his killers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the thief is planning a future life, the conversation between the owner and Keruiben has come to an end, and the owner of the caravan does not have to worry that he must The goods and the attendants were discarded in the endless snow cover swamp, and they became one of the VIPs of the caravan owners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most notable thing is that they don’t have to walk out of the snow cover swamp by their own feet, and apprentices and mercenaries have made new ones under the guidance of the elves. The reed boat black-footed half-body is relying on this kind of vessel to go freely on the swamp's water, but the half-man reed boat is very small, and now the reed boat is about two times larger and can carry more people. And the goods used to pull the gourd boat are a common scavenger in the swamp. People call it a multi-legged scorpion, but if the soul from another plane is here, it will feel like this creature is more like It is a lizard with a suede. It has six or eight claws. The frog is like a frog. The way of action is not to jump but to move the left and right feet forward. The body is very light and dark. The tumor that bulges on the green skin does not contain thick pulp like the real cockroaches but stores the air. With the wide and sturdy feet, it can fly freely on the surface of the marshes if the enemy is below the water, if the enemy Above the water Those translucent build-up burst open, releasing the air inside, while the claws away, a wink loose drill mud can go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After encountering the giant snake, the black-footed half-man, the domesticated multi-legged scorpion, was swallowed up most of the time, and the rest was also black-shouldered. People ride around, but as long as there are elves who are familiar with the swamp, they can always find new "horses." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought they only eat carrion." The mercenary leader said with surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They really prefer carrion," said the elf. "But they also like physalis because they can remove excess toxins from their bodies. Eat, the taste is very good, do you want to come?" He spread the palm of the mercenary leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
