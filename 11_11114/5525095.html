			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ps: Watch the exclusive story behind The Saints, listen to your suggestions for the novel, follow the public number (WeChat add friends - add public number - enter Qdread can), tell me quietly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has not sang the songs that are beautiful, but only belong to the elves, and he chose one that can be said to be well known. Almost every bard must arrive at the first and last tribute to the gods, pay tribute to the gods, pay tribute to the local people, pay tribute to the land, pay tribute to the land, and pay tribute to the god of singing, Morrill, except Those unborn babies, even the humblest slaves, have heard and sang this song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...When the first plow is opened, the hand touches the plow, and the whip falls on the back of the ploughing cow that pulls the yoke. You must be sincere. To Cranmo in the Hades, pray to the holy Jammu and pray for the sacred land to harvest the grain. Let the young slaves follow, sway the seeds that will be sowed, making the birds difficult to create. Carefully managed by mortals, The most favorable, the disaster is not well managed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of this song is so straight, there is no gorgeous drag and no devilish speed The content of the lyrics is even more shocking. There are no princesses, warriors, no magic and adventure. In the mouth of some mediocre bards, it is as boring as a dried mushroom root, but the elves The song is so clear, so embarrassing, it is like a new river leaping in the sun, and like a vast forest shouting in the wind, every syllable he sings is full of respect for nature and nature. Love, admiration for life, can’t help but live . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the god of Gulaba gives you a happy ending, the mature wheat ear will bend down to the ground, you can take the spider from the scorpion Run away..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They listened, listened, the loss of goods, the coldness of the cave, the pain of the body and the panic of the inner fear seemed to have flapped their wings. Far away, they seem to have returned to their homes, and they seem to be on a flat road again. They hold the bottles in their hands and lean against each other. They follow the elf and whisper and sing: "In the uncomfortable summer, Jerusalem artichoke In full bloom, only the muse, falling on the tree singing loudly, and screaming under the wings. At this time, the goat's meat is the most fat, the wine is the most alcoholic. The woman is bohemian, the man is fragile and incompetent - the sun The flames make the head and knees hot. The skin will dry out due to the heat. At this time, I hope there will be a shade under the cliff, plus honey and ale. A bowl of goat's milk, a pancake, a forest inside. The meat of a shepherd cow, or the meat of a goat, sitting in the shade After drinking the wine, I turned around and turned my face to the fresh west wind. Three times from the end of the year, the crystal clear waters of the mountain springs, the fourth time to give the wine to the gods... ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed mercenaries are sitting about ten steps away from them. Merchants and apprentices don’t trust the wooden-like punt that floats on the water. To prevent them from accidentally falling, They used a fixed cargo rope to cross the horizontal and horizontal weaving into a large fishing net, and then drilled into it one by one, holding the rope in order to be at ease, mercenaries, mages and rangers declined their kindness, like them People, limiting themselves to one place is only more dangerous than safer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged mercenary and the guy who loves to sleep are also sitting with him, three people back to back, each facing a direction, middle-aged mercenaries love to play A short sword that has just been found on the body. Its blade is made of steel, and the handle is luxuriously inlaid with gold and gems - although most of the guards are killed by the wizard and the elves, No matter which of the two, they gave up their spoils, of course, the merchants did not dare to take it, so the biggest winner of this small battle became a one-eyed, one-of-a-kind and generously distributed some of them to With his two peers, anyway, there is still a way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think will happen next?" The mercenary, who was closing his eyes and seemed to be dozing off, whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows, fate changes more than biao," said one eye with a smaller voice: "What we can do is only if it is willing "We looked up and walked over." He looked up and looked at the top of the cave, where there was sparse glowing moss. He calculated that there was one every fifteen steps, shaped like a wet mark smeared by a giant's hand. It guarantees that no vessel will be enveloped in the darkness as it travels on this narrow waterway - perhaps they are indeed the result of a hard work by a giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich sees much more than one eye. The mortal eyes can only see very few things in the faint light of the moss, but he can With more light like the sand in the sea, this gnome ship has no steering wheel, it is set in a fixed direction, only forward and backward, and the waterway it travels, Like the dark passages they sneaked in, after the artificial grinding and excavation, the most peculiar thing is that this waterway for sailing is actually cleaner than the water channel for people to sneak into, with fewer mussels and water plants, so that he can see the dark purple The smooth rock walls are dense and deep, but there is no fine texture of rules, but this is never natural. Just like those mosses, they are also artificial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss is for lighting, so what are these textures for? He looked at the walls and the tops on both sides, and every place he saw was rough and undulating,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foster was tied up, his legs straight forward, and a wooden box filled with wine, lest he should jump into the water to escape, he was placed in the middle of the elf and the bow, face to face with the elves, as long as Kerry this one Raise the bow and arrow and shoot him immediately - he squats and screams, prays to Woking for a while, and then pleads with an unknown god, as the predictable punishment has scared him a little mentally disturbed. When people began to sing with the elves, he also sang, although no one could understand what he was singing, but in the lyrics, he succeeded in unscrewing a certain piece with his hands. Gemstones on the gemstone ring (thanks to the ranger's deterrence against the mercenaries, they seem to be worried that he will be dissatisfied with their excessive greed), the gems begin to chill after leaving the pedestal, and the chill has been infiltrated from his palm. His blood vessels were so cold that he couldn't help but shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorceress suddenly remembered that there was such a texture in the smog cottage in Alva, but they were decorated with a beautiful decoration on the stone floor, he The thoughts quickly moved to the tutor's tower, which was filled with books and reels in one room after another, and quickly searched inside. This is a need, who needs it, what does it need? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man’s long shadow passes through the haze cast by the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry Ben?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of what these textures represent, but already It is necessary to say nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three otters that are erected so high in the caves gently put themselves in the middle of the crowd, more awkward and quieter than any magical presence there. Silently, they used their tails to support their large but relatively slim body, showing the merchant's skull and the colorful body connected below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humans screamed hysterically, clutching the ropes around their legs and legs, they are now like a group of fish trapped in the net, just waiting The predators came to pick and pick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry's arrow hit a mouth of a otter, running through its jaw, pain forced it to arch, launching an attack, it can't close the mouth There is also a woman's arm-like, steel-hard body, and a tail that can pull off the mast and the wood pulp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was holding the tail of the arrow and thrust forward hard. The arrow of Mithril smoothly pierced the upper jaw of the otter and went straight to the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
