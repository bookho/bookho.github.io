Smile: "I don't want to humiliate your wisdom," he said. "I can be in a group, the Greinada," he glanced outward. "The dragon, or the devil, and the devil's blood, are like a duck." You are relying not only on the favor of His Royal Highness, but also on this white robe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness is also a dragon. Or the priest of Greedy, should be yours, and our respect and awe." Yadel said: "Since I am not so stupid, then I should know the king of the capital in Grenada, in the Red Dragon Gerry Under the gaze of the first, it is extremely dangerous to kill the child of her red dragon daughter. Whether it is successful or not, I can not only get a little benefit from it, even my own life can not be preserved. And," he said : "I don't think that the girl of the Red Dragon will be stupid, is she? Is it easy to get involved in a dangerous place because of the vassal of her scorned brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, really, it’s not like a white Robe." Austal stood up from the chair, he walked slowly in the room, and he was graceful, with a confusing rhythm: "Is Rosada really so fond of you? Dear sinner? Even if you I have committed such a serious crime. He still allows you to call his name and give you shelter and strength. I think that the god of the morning light does not like the people who are good at playing tricks. After all, the god he hates most. That is the one," the warlock said cautiously. He could read the name of the god of morning light Rosada in the kingdom of Greet, but the conspiracy god, Sheikh, was not in the ranks of words he could freely manipulate. It is said that the god of the three priests is most fond of listening to the voices coming from the past. Although each god can sense his own name, Chirac is undoubtedly the most Strong, and because his priesthood is a conspiracy relationship, all His conspiracy will be immediately known to him, even if they are only targeting a weak dragon, it is difficult to say whether this information will be brought to Kelsey's ear by the omnipresent darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s heartfelt to say that Austal is not too afraid of Kelsey, just as the new king could have decided to let it go decades ago. She disappeared completely, she was too fragile, it was a poor quality that made the red dragon shame, especially with Kremar, a brother with the blood of the elf who is in conflict with the dragon's blood, her Even stupidity will make countless people laugh. Although she is proud to be a distinguished place in this kingdom, she is almost no one to pay attention to and support her, including her own father and mother. The new king is completely self-sufficient in this respect. As we said before, the new king is going to kiss the claws of Grein, but in Grenada, even more far away, from the red dragon to the mortal, who is not What is the slave of Red Dragon Gredi? But can a true slave be compared to a real dragon? And Gredith is indeed full of tolerance for the new king, except for a few things, her golden eyes have never had a hot anger in front of this descendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She despise her father, of course, don’t expect her father to have any kindness to her, and her mother, if Kelsey and Kelmen If it is a pair of cowardly young dragons, maybe she has already swallowed her belly and gave birth to a less powerful descendant. It is a shame to the female red dragon, and she doesn’t do that maybe just because she prefers to be with her own red dragon. The brothers have a strong son, not forced to maintain the human form to be a dragon-born wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her brother, Austal is saying that her brother, Kelmen, is now thousands of miles away like Kremar, she can’t Get any help from him, even if the Dragon Claws are guarding the king, but she has no right to command and mobilize them. Kelsey, she can rely on only the blood of the dragon, body and money, she uses The former two recruit young and ambitious warlocks, thieves and mercenaries, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then gold coins and precious cast materials were used by her to consolidate this relationship. But if Austal is standing by her side, she will let her understand that this is simply asking for the end. Who is she? The immediate descendants of Grein! Her identity? In addition to the royal family members, she is the chief pastor in the Temple of the Great! Where is she? Under the wings of Grein! With this triple crown, she should have become the most devout and fanatical pastor as Grirdy hoped, which is what Greddy needs, not the Mitre's Legion, which is now Creemar. Holding unrealistic fantasies. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a woman is her most favorable condition, but unfortunately she not only did not notice it, but even put it in one can say It is a semi-disposable location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where have you been? Pastor Kelsey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelsey is the most enthusiastic about this, not only talent, in the course of the temple, her performance is still worse than most pastors, which keeps her in an angry and sharp state if she finds an opportunity, no matter The pastor apprentice is being framed or taken care of by herself. She can whip for hours without stopping. Even with potions and spells, the apprentices and disciples who died under her hand still have more than one hand, especially those who dare to perform. More outstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wangdu’s priest is the eldest daughter of one of the virgins of Gree, she is a fanatic, always holding Kelsey’s behavior. Vigilance and dissatisfaction, anyway, those who can understand Greedi's will more quickly, hear her voice, and cast a magical child, may only be more devout than Kelsey, but Kelsey's Identity and blood can press most of the weight, she can only interfere, but can not be expelled and punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the chief pastor." Kelsey said with a wave: "I can go anywhere I want to go." dudu2(); <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what about your prayers?" asked the pastor. "You have been absent for a full ten days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will read it to Grydy alone," Kelsey said, and the words paused slightly. If it is someone else, maybe she will only think that she just walked away from God, but the priest is a keen woman. She immediately notices that Kelsey is not right. She took a few steps, but Kelsey immediately stepped back, but she The breath of the breath still reveals the secret sweet smell of her secrets, as long as it is the priest of Griddy, who will be familiar with it, because in recent years they have put the dark spices into the fire every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What have you eaten?" The priest said that the fruit of this plant with bright flowers was originally from Longhuo Island. The lords of the islands used this to control the slaves. The warlocks of Grenada studied them and found that they would cause bad damage to the human mind that would not be reversed, and even spoiled a wonderful soul that was so varied and tasteless. The cellar lowered its original value, so it quickly gave up, but given the generosity of the Lord of the Fire Island, it was continued as a monotonous work to this day, but only apprentices and disciples were deploying those potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this situation has gradually changed, as the temple of Gredi stands up again and again, in addition to treatment and other functions in the temple. The potion has more of this kind of spice and food, it will make people crazy, let people give up the original belief, people are willing to give everything for it, although this malicious has not yet been the majority People are aware, but the priests of Greedy will never know that they are forbidden to touch and use them, but some people will not be able to curb their curiosity, maybe they also think that the things that can be solved by casting a spell are not very good. Terrible, but the purpose of the temple clearly pointed out that once the priest of Gerdi had tried this thing personally, she would immediately be sent to the altar of Grei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonderful thing is that there are always people who will touch the boundaries that she can’t touch, even in the Temple of God, the Temple of Gredi, just the priest Dealing with two apprentices related to it, one of them is the apprentice of her disciple reserve. The latter is tempted and murdered, but the priest does not care about this. She only hates that she is so wrong, she even chooses One such stupid idiot, okay, but fortunately no one knows that she once wanted to promote the young pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelsey knew that she was discovered, but she didn’t care, even giggled: “It will bring me closer to Greedy,” She bowed deeply to the priest in the house, and when she got up, she shook a little: "Now, I am going back to my room. I am going to pray to the priest, to our mother, Respectable Gredi, powerful Greedy and wise Greedy."dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gredi knows that he has such a descendant The priest is very willing to dig out the heart of Kelsey on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelsey certainly knows that the pastor has a lot of dissatisfaction with himself. But what about it, her mother is a red dragon, U reading (ww.ukanshuco), the part of her belonging to the red dragon is showing this distinguished status all the time, she will be full of frivolity When I made another compromise with the silence of anger, or gave her a nod to the arrogant point, she turned again and walked to her room. It could not be said that it was completely gone. The residence of the priests in the temple was similar. In the place of the hive, the rooms are closely arranged, surrounded by a hexagonal open courtyard. The center of the courtyard is a lava pool connected to the fire element plane. The flame is constantly spurting, and the gray-black smoke is covered with sulfur and broken particles. Rushing into the sky, but the wonderful thing is that the room that is close to the ground is colder, and the room that is higher is not only warm, but also more spacious and comfortable. The more you go up, the services you can enjoy and the ones you can get. The more resources there are, the more powerful it is for the apprentices, disciples and pastors to climb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
