And rescue, his father and king need himKerry was the last one to enter the lock. The elves waited for him on the edge of the gray ridge, and the white face of the water. They all thought that the otter was going to greet Kerry, but Kerry knew that it was not.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to know what it would be like to have the power of the king of the jungle, Engel, to cast all of his power. The lock is invisible, but the elves can hear it. The small gears bite each other while they are turning, and they can hear the rattle of the heavy steel rope tightened to the extreme, and the reeds are pushed away by the key and fall into the grooved ticking... The entire jungle is under the cover of spells. Every elf, as well as half-elves, every animal, every leaf, every drop of water and every hurricane, cannot escape its gaze and interrogation. There will be such a situation, but the half-elves that will become stiff and frightened, the elves are like being greeted by the dawn and the stars, they allow this power to pass through the body and mind, completely unintentionally exposed in front of it. Self--they revered like that, and trusted the king of the jungle, Ingeway, and sure that he also believed in them, no doubt, no hesitation<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurricane of power quickly passed, without being hindered, and of course there would be no disorder or error, every node of the lock was pushed In the right direction, and fall into the orbit that should be in, if there is a human wizard here, it will be moved to tears<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar has once told the Ranger a small story - the kind of loyalty and trustThe black hair caster said: "What kind of friendship is the most sincere? That is, you stabbed me from behind, I think it is just because you accidentally fell.Now, think of it, how ironic it is, Kerry has always thought that on the road they walk side by side, the first thing that will go away is Cremari, but I didn’t expect to turn back to my friends. Is yourself<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant can see that Kerry is very upset, but he doesn’t know what happened between him and Crimal, but he’s even In the elf, it can be said that it is an elder. It is extremely unwise to add comments or suggestions to things that you don’t understand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has nodded to Perrin, and walked into the jungle with the otter, whether there is a half-elves who can be left in the Grey Ridge elves. What the company discussed - Kerry has walked through an elf, holding a young half-elf in her arms,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe only ten years old - the latter I am sleeping, I may have to sleep for several years, from the complete fall of the lock to the lock, once again, they will be guarded and supervised by the jungle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otter climbed from Kerry's arms to his shoulders and placed the three-layered fat chin on the elf's coat. It looked back, watching the wizard wizards lift the flying wing in the Starlight River under the orders of Perant, the sails were removed, the masts were laid down, the vines were drilled from under the hull, and they were hung in the air, maple They immediately covered them with their thick blades, leaving no traces. It is hard for humans to find that there are no fewer than twelve three-masted ships.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White face is always smarter than other otters, it, its wife, its children, and the idiots it has seen (they all It’s hard to understand the behavior of humans and elves, but the white face knows a lot. Just like now, the winged ship that was brought up will no longer bring that person, its sight. As Kerry’s pace stopped, it’s shaking, it’s not exchanged, it’s not struggling, but Kerry knows it’s so sad.Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I give you a little fish to bake, white face...like the one he baked..." Elf Ranger Say, of course, he didn't wait for the approval of the otter. Kremar caught the little fish from the caves accumulated in the waters of the Grey Ridge River, but Kerry knew that these small fish came from the depths of the jungle and they were clustered. Under the falling silver crown flowers, they are scrambling to pick up the depths of the flowers, so there is no stink of the general fish in their bodies. Because of the relationship between nectar and plankton, their stomachs are not so developed. Look carefully. The translucent white blade-like body has only one gray-green thick line, which can be pulled directly from the tail.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has seen this and has eaten the small fish grilled by Cremari, who knows what to do - a slate of pyroxene instead of powder. Then directly put the cleaned fish on it, the phosgene that absorbs the water will violently heat up, the heat absorbs the water from the fish, and makes the slate become hotter, but when the water of the small fish is almost dried, The oil that is ignited in the body will give off a strong scent and a strong aroma. He will not give salt and snow honey to the water, because Kremar said that dogs and cats eat salt or sweet things. Will be bald, he does not know if the leeches are also, but it is better not to have it, white face has a happy family, if it is just because eating too much salted fish, it is sad to remind the marriage is too much Ridiculous<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," said the Ranger tiredly. "It seems to be not very tasty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, for Griffin, it may not be considered as something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it’s a mixture of snake meat in the breakfast. It said that it doesn’t like the meat of the snake, it’s too cold to make it belly. It hurts, for this it ate the servant who prepared the food for it as compensation; and when it went out to bend, of course, you can call it patrol, and met a female lion and lion who was single. Well, here, maybe we need to explain it a bit - the lion-headed lion is actually a part of the big group of lions and beasts, and it is a very weird one, specifically, apart from them and most of them are not Neutral is a good family, not only chaotic but also extremely evil. What is more, they are all males and no females. If they want eggs, they only chase the female lions and ask her to condescend. Respond to your own pursuit. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the female lion and beast is a kind and elegant creature, and the rude and violent eagle lion animal has always been It’s not a false resignation, so the pursuit of the lion-headed lion is almost a battle of feathers, although the eagle-headed lion is often successful – this time Griffin’s encounter is a single order. The female lion and lion, in a sense, is no different from the fearless claws on the top of the plate, but. Can you imagine it? The female lion singer saw the first sight of it, no horror, no rush to escape, it actually - laughed, from the heart of the smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin admits that he has forgotten the eyes that have not yet fully escaped from the blue, and that the bare is like a chest of skinned chicken. But does it not see its claws and fangs, and the pair of strong wings, beautiful and thick claws? Griffin didn't feel that he was ridiculous at all. The key thing was that it was shocked by the strange response of the other party. He didn't catch it at the first time - the result was a female lion It was very clever to escape while laughing. The most tragic thing was that this scene was also seen by a small group of sheep and lions. These guys who like sparkling gold coins and gems were hired as substitutes for dragon teeth. The strength is inferior to the lion's lion, but not a lot, so after Griffin rushed in, although he did get the idiots to get the lessons they deserved, they suffered a bit of injury - mainly before The sprained wings were smashed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Griffin ate a bull to comfort his injured heart, but did not expect that it was actually in its owner, Gray The eldest son of King Nada, the emperor Mittert, heard a bad news - its owner is no longer the commander of the dragon claw, this position now belongs to another person - that is, once used outside the city is not magic The power, but with a more terrible strength than the orcs, it smashed a black ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this can relax the standard, after all, the guy is also a dragon, but he is a stranger, in the previous hundred years, Greiner Darry has never seen his smell, Griffin can ensure this - his knowledge of Grenada is probably from the book, or from the bard's songs, and Such a person, but to become the owner of the entire dragon tooth? If Griffin is another resident of the plane, will it scream "WTF"? ! But now it's almost the same. When it heard the news, the fur on the body and the feathers on the wings suddenly exploded, and it looked like a furry thorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," Griffin said not so happy: "My master, then what should I do? You are no longer the commander of the Dragon." , but I am still the leader of my ethnic group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can be his mount," Mitt said: "He also knocked down. You,""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't like him." Griffin said that it looked at his master with expectation, maybe it was, hoped him Say, "Me too." Then they can get together and kill the dragon. But Mitt is just smiling: "I probably need to find another eagle lion as soon as possible," he joked. "Or would you recommend one for me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin’s answer is a pile of feces—yes, Griffin’s baby doesn’t want to talk to you, and Griffin’s baby throws you a pile of feces that it has just shed. Griffin likes Mitt, he is as bad as a decaying melon, and that person, if he is an evil guy, he should twist his neck when he licks Griffin At the very least, you should dig one of its eyes - or he is scrupulous about Mate, but Griffin has a more accurate premonition than the average lion lion - he really does not seem to be with them.
