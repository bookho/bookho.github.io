In another plane, she did it twice. Even the crazy things that I can't believe, the first time and the last time, she felt that she was close to Leona infinitely. Even if there is still a little gap, it is negligible, so thank you, though She doesn't know about the North Sea, but it's enough to look at the route—the snow cover swamp, the whistling plain, the nevernight sea, no matter what is the one that is better at wiping the love than the wielding sword. The place where Pastor Luo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is difficult for Plum to understand why they are doing this in person. Krimaar already has an abundance of islands, he can hire The mercenary and the mage went back to find what he wanted. When she thought of it, she licked her lips gently, or the wealth might be more than what he could get from the side island. Fro was on, if she could, she I really want to see for myself, of course, not in the sea of ​​the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what makes her feel distressed. She likes the island and likes her own temple. She doesn't want to leave here, but Mei Mei knows that she is It is not the most beautiful, and it is not necessarily the most favored pastor of Fro. She can stand on the side of the island and be able to become a chief pastor. There is nothing else because of the protection of Kremar, if he loses his shelter, Mei Honey is still a pity that can only be exchanged for a room in the tavern of the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan has relieved her from this trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are there two seas, one forever sea, one sea for the north, can they distinguish between them?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sea of ​​the extreme north is not the sea," said Gülen, who has only a very shallow understanding of the sea of ​​the North, who will care about that place after all. Even the Lich will not stop for a long time. "The sea of ​​the North is a huge layer of ice that stands on the sea of ​​the night. The sea of ​​the night sea is cobalt blue, like the eternal night sky. Thousands of miles of ice are white, because of the effects of hurricanes and tides, they will form a wave-like bump, which looks like another ocean, so it will be called the North Sea." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds very desolate," Mei said. While leaning down on the body, picking up a piece of debris and pulling the robes in front of him, Grange found out what it was with the sharp eyes that the thief had to have, and his tone became a little helpless: It’s just a piece of cockroach, plum, you have a bunch of beads that can hang from the neck to the knee.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, you can buy a silver coin by grinding into beads." Mei Mi said with self-deprecation: "I am only worth one silver coin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves got it. At first, he seemed to try to comfort Mei Mi, but he finally gave up. Consolation of this kind of thing is synonymous with sarcasm in the guild, and it is clear that as a person who is also struggling in the dirty mud, the goodwill on the tongue can only satisfy himself. Imagine if he was still the trembling child who was scared by his partner's head, and wouldn't want to listen to any false and empty words. At that time, what he wanted most was that someone could take him away. Leaving the terrible room far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he only has to remain silent now, he can of course take the plum from the temple of Fro, and then, look at her like her mother Is it weak, rotten, and stinking and suffocating? Fortunately, he can always do something - for Mei Mei, he went to beg his companion or his master. The caster of the black hair, the lord of the side island. What surprised him a bit was that the problem was solved very smoothly, no. He never thought that Mei Mi would occupy an important position in the team, but what he did not expect was that the owner of the side island not only allowed Mei Mi to stay, but also provided Mei Mi with a pretty good hiding place. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a side island, it’s not a Biyindi, it’s not a port. It is the capital of the Lutheran Grand Duke of Luther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think Luzer has not forgotten the 500,000 gold coins." The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan’s expression can be used as a specimen of horror: “But that is a big favor!” He almost screamed and shouted: “Is it?” It shouldn't be used..." He made a gesture in a bit confusing: "If I let Leona and Birdwin know... Wait a minute, will they know? Or..." He looked anxiously still reviewing one. The caster of the book, he did not know whether to say it, because the next words are undoubtedly alienated, Bywin and Leona, even if they were once the lord and once the king, but they are Gülen seems to be two fools. The thief is jealous of Kerry Ben. He never thought about sitting on the same balance with the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luzer is Lutheran's Grand Duke, and Luther, who borders the Norman Highlands, has already had a war between them. To be exact, these two are enemy countries." A piece of parchment that asked him for the blue crawfish franchise, said slowly: "Although Luzer did owe a debt of life, he was Ludzel of Luther, he not only It is his responsibility to be responsible for himself, his own ancestors, his own courtiers, his own knights and his own people, and it is his limit to allow the soldiers of Thunderbolt to stay in the triangle, although these soldiers are also confronted by human beings. The enemy - the relationship between the orc rather than the Lutheran, but from a certain point of view, he has paid off the part that belongs to Bywin - or else you think that this debt should be repaid? Is it Li? Does Oona still need the army of the enemy to provide her army in order to return to her own king? This is not for help, but for treason, although Luther of Luther will be willing to do so."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if it’s just for Mei ...... "free gift after the inevitable hidden traps, in order to avoid even the Grand Duke of Lu Zeer finger into the highlands Norman, Liao Na Wen and Byrd could not make a move, then Crane Martha do? A caster, as long as he can cast spells, his demand for gold coins and casting materials will never be satisfied, he can ask for a large sum of money to Luzer, instead of asking him to hide one can say Pastor Froe who has little to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you test BUG." The black-haired caster replied with his usual frankness that it was a stranger that Gülen had never heard before. Words, but since the caster has his purpose, the thief has no peace of mind for a lot of reasons - he certainly won't be stupid enough to get into the feet, Cremari is not his or Mei Mi's mother, and even a mother may not be The opportunity to hollow out a big money bag will be easily abandoned for your own children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gylan lowered his head, his toes were buried in the fine sand washed by the sea, a flash caught his attention, he picked it at random, one The nail-sized stone fell into his palm, and the thief wiped the sea sand above and showed it to Mei Mi: "Look, this is the treasure worthy of being placed in your heart." He whispered: "It It’s like your eyes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a three-color tourmaline, crystal clear green, turquoise and golden in the small world, glamorous It is impossible to let people remove their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey put his hands behind him, and Gülen will gently put the tourmaline into her front, and the cold stones will slide down the hot skin. Even if bathed in the warm sunshine, Fro's pastor gently shuddered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
