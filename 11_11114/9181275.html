Birdwin looked at the record and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Humans can't stand this temperature." McGee said: "There is still wind in the open, but here," he glanced around, deep in In the underground, between the rocks and the red river that melts the iron, all the humans are moving around. The gnomes reminded them that they should wear a leather armor to resist the sparks of splashing, but they have no choice but to put their skin on it. Peeled off - in any place where the eye can see, there is a tank full of water, and the groundwater attracted by the gnome's machinery is poured into it. The water that has just been injected is cold and cold, but only a few breaths. In time, it will become warmer, and after a while, it will burn human lips and tongue - but this has not happened yet, because people drink plenty of water all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin also felt thirsty, his shirt is the output of the silver-crowned jungle, interwoven with spider silk and secret silver, can be used as Soft armor is softer, more transparent and smoother than satin and cotton, but he also feels the unbearable heat: "This can't be done," he said, watching a few people silently carry a faint person away. The unlucky one almost fell into the stone trough flowing in the molten iron. People didn't mean that it was a common occurrence for them. The original Highland Norman was not lacking a blacksmith, but the human being with this craft. It’s always the object of the first looting of the orcs. In fact, if not a certain number of areas have lost their lords, Birdwin may not be able to recruit so many blacksmiths. Each of them is for the new king. It is precious. Except for Birdwin’s wild vision and the necessity of the king, the grizzly knights who have been sealed as lords also have a huge gap in this respect – even if civilians and serfs return to cities and fields. No tools and implements they do still empty-handed to bake bread, wine, leather tanning and farming it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mckey hesitated: "Maybe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Birdwin Asked, he was thinking about whether there was a hidden place to be used near Wangdu. He could use it in the name of the hunting ground, and then let the Knights of the Grizzlies Legion station, guard and guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just because of the location, the gnome thought that the first time here was not a dirty, stinky cell, in those staggered and twisted stone walls and After the iron fence was dismantled, leaving only the original pillars, the walls and the top surface, the gnome found that it should be a ground palace. The person who created the royal court for the kings of the Normans in the Highlands may be a dwarf or a dwarf. Wang Ting is not only the residence of the king and the sons. It is more of a huge fortress. Most of the fortresses have unrecognized water reserves. After the outside world is separated by the enemy, the talents in the fortress are not. It will die because of thirst, and the underground of the ramps and caves can also serve as the last place for the tribes. But I don’t know why, in the past few decades, this vital place has been used by Pharaoh as a place to imprison enemies and rebels. Prisoners are here, not in the sky, nor as human beings, their Blood, tears and feces flow into the gap, seeping into the ground, under the thin slate, the water has produced terrible alienation, not only can not drink, even sniffing will lead to madness and fainting. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the prisoners were removed, the priests and knights managed to clean up to the point where they could go, and the gnomes found out that they were blocked by the sprawling moss. The nozzle and the inlet are extremely exquisite, and the water in the rock formation can be poured into the entire underground palace in a short period of time, making it a dangerous country. The reason is that they have found a large number of them here. Fish wrecks, each with three to five feet, the mouth is full of jagged fangs, even the knight's leather gloves can be cut - because Norman is in the north, so crocodiles and giant pythons can hardly be here. Surviving, so the former Norman King will put fierce fish here. Compared to the crocodile, the giant python, they don’t seem to be terrible, but when the foot is full of snowy white bones, every time Individuals can't help but feel chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They must be very hungry." The gnome muttered, he now believes that Leona’s father is not in the right place because it was originally a true heir. I know something, but he may just see it here, say, ah, here is really a useless place, let me fill it with prisoners, then he did it, completely unaware that the bottom is Novo The last chip of the Manchester royal family - but in any case, it has now been discovered - the gnomes think that Baldwin and Leona will keep it as a secret, for which he is worried about his life, but it seems they I don't think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new king of Norman and the last person of the Hayman family, they are either born here or die here, there is no third choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have any thoughts?" Birdwin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My patriarch," said the gnome, he did not mention the dwarf, although in the short time of the Iron Bone City, he knew that there were no fewer than three dwarves around. City, but the dwarves will not abandon their homeland, the gnome will, as long as your price is high enough: "What do you think?" The gnomes and dwarves are fearless of flames and heat, even if the gnome looks like a human Children, but their skin and hair are fundamentally different from humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They will be willing to come over?" Highlander Norman and the Dragon Fire Island are separated by thousands of miles. At the Long Fire Island, Birdwin recognized this race. Still a little understanding, the gnomes are not dwarves, they are a group of people who are addicted to pleasure. The hard and long-term trek has never been a small game they will choose. They are holding barbecue on the goose feather pillow on the brocade face, drinking with a gold cup and a silver cup. Honey, feel the sea breeze that is slowly blowing is their way of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Dragon Island is not very peaceful now." McGee said that he was still a little more than other gnomes when he was still on the island of Longhuo. After experiencing so many things, there is no suspense, he has a longer-term vision than the people, and some things simply do not need to be inferred and analyzed - now stay in Norman Island How many people are there? Thousands, or a few hundred? And that sad Dada, there is no one worthy of his trust except for the eunuchs and slaves. Oh, after the eunuch reneged his father, even the eunuch was not so credible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br /> The black-haired dragons once said that the social form of Longhuo Island is distorted and deformed, especially when most countries on land have turned from slavery society to feudal society. The Dragon Fire Island is simply a bunch of flaming bonfires. It looks fierce and brilliant, but in reality, it only waits for the fire to burn out. The rest is only the frame of the black and dark, just push it gently. It will crash down - McGee admits that he can't understand at all, but he knows that the wizard is taking more firewood from the burning bonfire - he is shaking the pedestal of the entire Fire Island The irony is that none of the lords of the four islands have raised the vigilance they deserve. Maybe they think that after a person has climbed to When the tip, it would not be stupid enough to destroy the body under the throne, and let yourself again reduced to abject slavery side by side position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mckey vaguely heard that Rosada’s pastors and some druids are studying how to destroy plants that can confuse and guide humans to perish, because Most of the instruments they needed were created by the gnomes. McGee clearly remembered that he had handed over a distillation apparatus that looked like a triple hookah, and what the Druids needed. The folded box that was pulled out of the layer, he didn't know what they did with these things, and after careful peeping, he found that it was used to raise a bee. The gnome knew that the bees could make sweet honey, and the lord also had his own Beekeepers, but the kind of bees, smaller than flies, can they really make enough honey? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a pedestal that is spread over a humid, warm place. This kind of embryo that is mixed with the residue of sugar and beet is raised with caterpillars and has a dull color. But the butterflies after the phlegm are as colorful as the flowers of the plants, and even the wings have a pattern like a fold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKid doesn’t know when the disaster in the side of the island will break out, he strongly urges to follow them, on the one hand to satisfy him all the time. The expectations and fantasies, on the one hand, also evade the feeling of being flustered all the time. Now is an opportunity. He thinks that Baldwin needs someone who can work for him, and the gnomes need a new master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what do you think they will need?" Bird asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A territory," McGee said: "You don't need to be big, you don't need fields that can be cultivated, hills and mountains can be, in Wangduzhi In the middle, there must be a house that can accommodate all the people - occasionally we will gather together to celebrate the celebration, we will take one for every two hundred finished products," he thought, not so funny. To the finger, "Maybe you can give a title, my people also like medals, ribbons, glittering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byder Wen nodded a little funnyly: "It doesn't sound too much," he said. "But two hundred get one too much, three hundred one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
