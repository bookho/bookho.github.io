			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If other people, they might anger Maren - even if he really has no other way. Now he doesn't even belong to himself, his body and soul. He talks about his territory and output. He dares to take out the black iron trade and just rely on the love of Ms. Graypai. He certainly knows that Grenada needs Black iron is because it is expanding wildly. Every iron ore he supplies, every pound of black iron, every steel will become the armor of the Grenada army and the sword in his hand, maybe not far away. In the future, the shadow of death brought by the Red Dragon wings will even cover the sky above Norman, but if he does nothing now, then Norman in the Highlands will become another southern country - more than a thousand years ago. The southern countries are also a strong and unified empire, ruled by a wise and broad emperor, but unfortunately he became ridiculous and stupid after aging, in a short period of more than a decade, he will be a higher than the current The wider country of Man has torn into hundreds of principalities and city states. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this painful and long process like a woman giving birth, it is war, flame, death and absurdity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world is silent, the other plane is peaceful and warm, but it is also one-sided and temporary. Some people have said that history is a documentary of war. Hot war, cold war, partial, comprehensive, human blood also surges in the desire to conquer and kill, so it will not blame Mullen, who else knows better than it, "long-term must be combined, long-term must be divided "Do you have the pain in these eight words? Its country has also been torn apart, and the war is endless. Whenever it looks at the relevant records, the printed squares can bleed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that you are loyal to Leona," said the soul of the opposite world: "So you should know their current situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking of this, I think I must thank you first," Mullen said, screaming deeply: "They took the army and recruited soldiers on the Longhuo Islands. The Norman sluts can find their own place on the side of the island, as well as the Harvey Grand Duke of Bituminburg," Mullen said, then he saw the eyebrows raised by the black hair caster, suddenly realized that maybe The news has not yet reached the ear of this noble person: "Bibi Dibao is no longer a free city now," he said. "It is now a duchy. The original Harvey Archon became Ha. Wei Dagong.” When it comes to this, Mullen’s mood is somewhat low. The Harvey Archon is an upright person. When he got the information from the bard, he couldn’t believe it, but many places, many things, many people. Are changing, just like a long time ago, he did not think that he would become A robe of slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Harvey has reserved a number of women and children," Mullen said: "The Dragonfire has started a new round of war on the island - Norman Morse's mercenaries were involved, and before I left Highland Norman, they seemed to have won a victory and won two small islands - of course, they belong to you, Norman always have to return Highland Norman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world nodded, and Mullen seemed to be worried that he would be jealous of Birdwin and Leona. But the soul of the opposite world did not regard the side island as its own territory from the beginning. It was Beavis. The lich only made up the identity of the Beavis disciple, not to mention an entire island, even those from Baita. The magical tools and scrolls of the souls of the different worlds will also be time to return them back - don't say no one knows, it knows enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, they are not very bad now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"but only This is the case," Mullen said. "The side island is weak in this area, from the pastor to the mage, counting the followers of Yadall and other Rosada, and a few pastors of Ilmot and Tell. Ride, we only have a number of fingers that are not enough - and our enemies, alone on the lords of each island, have dozens of casters to listen to, not to mention the new king, who is said to have built a number for Gredi. Hundreds of temple sanctuaries, and these buildings are filled with powerful warlocks and priests. They and the Thunder Castle masters know how to fight, there are several, I mean, rejecting John’s blackmail or showing The knight and the lord were attacked by demons or demons—no one in the castle or two hundred in the castle, no one can escape, we know, these are the sins of those dirty red robes. ......oh," he paused for a moment, standing in front of him. Personal is also wearing a red robe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter," the soul of the alien world mentions the red robe, which is the knee-length white robe that makes Mullen feel familiar. "Take me The peanuts are good." The soul of the outside world is said in a serious way, and even then, Mullen couldn't help but smile for a short time in the metaphor of the whole image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
