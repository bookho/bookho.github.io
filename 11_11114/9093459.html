This is what McGee asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are on the other side." Perant said that Leona and Birdwin are surrounded by Kerry Ben and Kremar, gnomes and thieves. The power is a little weak. After all, they are just thieves and the other is just a gnome, but this question does not seem to need to be answered, because in the next moment, a loud noise shocked half of the castle, the flames skyrocketed, and they saw them.

Once he saw the familiar needle flash, it flew down without hesitation, sneaking over the night sky and stretching. Out of the claws - the gnome only felt that the fabric in the back position was pulled violently, and he suddenly appeared in the height of ten feet and continued to climb, with a posture overlooking the entire Lev territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy flight!"
