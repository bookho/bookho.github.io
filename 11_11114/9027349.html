The thief grabbed the head of Asmo Deus's furry neck, and was not so polite and violently swayed by Fro The priest's little pet, but that is dark, the winged hamster is not so docile, it almost bite Glan's finger when it turns, the twist is even more than a half of a week, if not a thief His fingers are more sensitive and responsive than ordinary people, and his fingers may have become a snack for Asmodeus. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I," Asmodeos flapped his wings and landed on the shoulders of Pastor Fro: "I can still Where is my master where is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Gülen said: "Is it always with you? Plum?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei hesitated for a moment, because Asmodeus had disappeared when the two-legged gnome dragon appeared, she thought it was because it was too She was so anxious to hide in a cave or a gap, and she was not worried about it. She did not value Asmodeos. At most, she thought that she could send it to steal small items, keys or other things. Something, but her devil's finger (yes, Meimi thinks it's her) is still in the small pocket hanging on the neck of Asmodeos. She may be the only person in the entire team who does not have such a portable magical tool. Gülen’s pocket is stolen from the semi-dragon. The mage gave this to him because he had his own pocket. It is also the elf. Standard, Birdwin's Dimensional Bag and Leona are a pair of children. Sometimes she can't help but feel that this is not fair, but she also knows that she does not have the qualification and power to ask for such expensive and scarce items. This means that the problem means Everything she carries must be exposed to the eyes of the elves and others, which makes her deeply embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When tasting the delicious squid soup, Mei Mei also thought that if she could, she had to go to Birdwin to say something sweet and see him. Can you help her find her little magic pet, of course, it is impossible for Baldwin to run into the mud with a wide sword to help her find a black-like, only fist-sized little guy, but if Dewen made a request. The black hair's caster will not reject him. She sees it very clearly. Kreima is a Kreben's tribe. In a sense, the former is also the latter's protected person. He is obligated to Kerry, and Kerry is a close friend of Birdwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what she didn't expect was that she got a warning when she got back to the tent, and then she managed to kill a mage! This is indeed unexpected, the impression that Kreima left for Mei Mi is simply imprinted on her heart. She has vowed to never deal with the caster again, either in the blunt pub in Point Harbor or in the temple of Fro, no, she has had enough of those fingers, and can recite spells from the tip of the finger The monsters who emit lightning and flames are so, why is she going to do something that is not good for her and is a crisis? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to compete with Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei said to herself that she thought she had completely abandoned Baldwin, but she was wrong, and her giving up was only on the surface, not on the heart. She... still wants to be a woman like Leona, a good, noble, brave woman who can make Birdwin gaze with respect and tender eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s really stupid, but this feeling is really not bad, although the person who lost the head of the wizard is not plum, but Leona, but the priest of Fro I still tasted the wonderful feeling that she had never tasted before, and the fate of the strong is firmly in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil's paws of Asmodeos pierced the skin of plum, Fro's priest frowned, took it and stuffed it into his robes "It's with me," Mei said. But she knows that the little magic pet suddenly appeared when they boarded the elf's flying wing. "It's very small, so you didn't see if you must say if it left. I think only When I dealt with the mage," she smiled at the thief: "I didn't wear anything at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin glanced at Leona Leona shook her head, she didn't see it, and couldn't be sure when the black kid would leave and when. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it will need a cage." The thief said. The thief's suspiciousness is second only to the lich in the adventurer, and he has never received a gift in his life. I don't believe that there will be a free gift and a good gift. The back is mostly a trap or a noose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now we can't get a cage." Mei Mi said, she walked to the side of the ship, looking down at the staring river, the hot sun Shining on the tumbling river, the river is like a layer of melted gold, or a piece of crystal. It is both beautiful and unobtrusive. It is about the middle and lower stream of the Starlight River. It is very different from the gray ridge. Its riverbed is as irregular as a child's building blocks. It is high for a while, low for a while, narrow for a while, wide for a while, sometimes as high as tens or even hundreds of feet, and the turbulent waters are different. The sudden reef is more visible than it is now, the back of the piebald is almost as smooth and safe as the human baby's bed, but on the elf's boat, as long as you don't look at the current, you may even mistakenly think of yourself. Still standing on a solid land, no, perhaps more comfortable and more enjoyable than that feeling, like riding on the back of a bird or flying in the air with clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter statement may be true, because the elf's flying wing can sail on the Starlight River because the magical flying wing can summon the wind to lift the vessel when the vessel needs to be lifted or dropped. Most of the time, the boat is only lightly glide on the water, rather than the general flow of water that is required for ordinary ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When we get to the Dragon Fire Island, we will get a cage for it," said Gülen, approaching Mei Mi. "What do you think of a Mithril cage?" The little guy's teeth are really sharp." He showed his arm to Mei Mi, the thieves used to wear leather wristbands with iron pieces, and the piece of iron with nail thickness has awesome Two little holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it biting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But not," said the thief, while using His own fine gold dagger smashed the fifth rib of the plum, where a bag was swelled, where Asmodois hid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Mei Mi unhappyly grabbed his hand: "I don't want to be bitten by it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the owner of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the loyal dog is stepped on the tail, it will be called, let alone me and It doesn't take long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," said Gülen, inserting the fine gold dagger into his waist: "So what do you think?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mystery Silver Cage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are willing to give me one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A gift?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I can find a room in the Temple of Fro in Longhuo Island," Maymi said: "Of course you can come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A word is fixed." The thief said, and then walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't like cages." Asmodeos drilled out of Plum's robes. Only revealing a head: "Little Monster loves freedom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be stupid," Mei said. "That's not for you, it's for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they talking about?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The little pet that said Mei Mi." The Lich said carelessly that this elf ship could not even be as big as the reed boat made by the mercenaries in the snow cover swamp. Winning is light and convenient, but the only person who can master the steering wheel is the Elf Kerry Ben, Bordwin was born in Norman Norman in the Highlands, and there are almost no big rivers and lakes in the north of the Norman Highlands. White tower. There is a river in the ship, so as a lord, he knows nothing about the boat is not an unforgivable fault; Li Oona is the same; Mei Mei ignores; as for Gülen, he spent his life in Jianjian Port. In the first twenty-five years, but he is more adept at drawing gold coins and gems from the crowd, instead of looking for pearl corals in the sea, so although he will drown and have several pirate friends who can be said to be quite familiar, But his understanding of the ship is limited to the outside, as well as the internal structure (this is to try to find out the target and try to secretly explore the results) and they will have a few days and nights to go. . And then you may not be able to find a barely available berth. Even if the elf needs only half the sleep time of human beings, he still needs to rest. At this time, another person needs to replace his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar is the first choice, as a caster, he learned how to use the steering wheel in a short time, and he has more than humans and elves Power, the steering wheel used by the elf ships is lighter than that used by humans, but if they let Gülen or Plum come, they might be beaten by the steering wheel when they turn sharply, and Leona is also carefully excluded. So now it’s only Kremar and Birdwin who are standing on the steering wheel and learning how to control the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin shook his head. He really didn't understand why Mei Mei had to keep the little monster around. To be honest, he couldn't find out what useful this little thing was when they confronted the enemy. The trace of its running is not to say that the key can play a key role, it is clear that the loyalty of this little monster's dictionary is not placed in the first few pages. But what he must admit is that he has a heart for Mei Mei, as Mei Mei said, when it is necessary to make a choice. He would choose Leona instead of her, although he promised her to be her protector, but Leona is not only his protector, his master, the heir to the throne of Highland Norman is proving him. After the innocence, Leona will return to the kingdom of Norman in the Highlands, put on the crown again, put on the Chinese costume, and retrieve her glory and power. The former lord of Thunderbolt does not feel narrow-minded, selfish and weak. The new king will be a good ruler. He loves his country. He does not want it to sail into the abyss of extinction in the hands of blind drivers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is better suited to pick up the heavy scepter than Leona? ! No one, only Leona, the king of Norman in the Highlands, the only child of Pharaoh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Mei Mi insisted on leaving the little monster, he gave silent support to them and the time spent with them was not much. As long as he arrives at the Dragon Fire Island, he can let go of his responsibility. Mei Mi is the priest of Fro, and according to Kerry Ben and Gülen, the Longhuo Islands are all over the temples of Fro, and the lords of the islands are used to The characters who are happy to enjoy, Fro's offerings to them are the most abundant and perfect Fro priests on the entire continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos carefully exposed his eyes from the gap between Plum's robes, peering at the movements of humans and elves, especially the black hair The dime bag hanging from the waist of the caster, it swayed slowly, swinging its tail thoughtfully until it felt itchy Mei Mei patted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey after that has been very calm, the previous chase and attack is like a long nightmare, but in the end there is a dangerous problem to be solved, then It is the silver waterfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we mentioned before, the estuary of the Starlight River is not like the other rivers, there is a gently sloping river beach as a buffer, a large export area for The river is quietly and gently integrated into the turquoise ocean. Its estuary is the Silver Falls, the highest and widest of the entire continent, with a height of 4,500 feet. The sound of the water hitting the sea is hundreds of miles away. Can also hear it vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the elf's flying wing can detach from the Silver Falls and leap into the ocean, but that doesn't mean you just have to hold the rudder and control the boat not to be biased. The power of the tens of millions of tons of water is more terrible than any other magic. They will wrap the boat down all the way down to the bottom of the waterfall. There are ships and fallen trees that fall into the Star River. They are as big as they are. The pavilion, or the rough, but no one has ever seen a piece larger than the palm of the hand. The curious warlock and the dwarf used a variety of metal casting tools to test, and they found that even the toughest The fine gold will also bend and break under the impact of the waterfall, not to mention ordinary steel or wood stone, human body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to pass the Silver Falls, open the wings of the ship hundreds of miles from the estuary, raise the sails and increase the speed of the ship To an unprecedented level, sometimes the wizard needs to cast spells to set off the wind, because the natural wind does not follow the needs of humans or elves to arrange their own direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
