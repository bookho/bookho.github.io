			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world thinks for a while, "Do it step by step, first from the crow... No, I want to study the ingredients of the secret medicine first - it’s terrible, it actually controls nearly 100,000 people..." It sighs in a similar way, with a sigh The figures show awe, 100,000 people, not 100,000 grains of sand. It still remembers that in its plane, slavery lasted from BC to the eighteenth century, and most of the content related to it was very vague, but one A small story, or a real event, can make it memorable—in an era not far from it, when a person full of justice and courage kills a slave owner, opens the slave’s jealousy, tells them that they are already free men. When the joy of urging them out of the shack, the slaves did not move. Later, a slave came out and hesitated and asked: "So, sir, our master?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your master?" Said: "I have been killed by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slaves were shocked, but they were not as grateful to him as they were, but rushed up. Kill him because the man killed their master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Kremar is a little poor, his results will probably not be better than that person. The squalor system on the side of the island is not executed for ten years or It’s a hundred years, but it’s nearly a thousand years. A small coral can accumulate for a thousand years and it’s possible to form a considerable island, let alone a human being with only a few decades of life. There are always new slaves on the side of the island, but more are the people who have been slaves for generations. They are used to this kind of life. Dada calls them cows and horses. They are like no heads and no regrets. The cattle and horses - they were slaves in the mother's stomach, left the mother when they were not breast-feeding, and built themselves into a "good" slave under the supervision of the wife and daughter of Shantou. They are not allowed to learn anything other than farming. The eyes can only look at the ground. If the child who is mischievous is afraid to raise his head privately, the scorpion of "Shantou" will use their fine wool whip to beat their eyes. This will not cause unhealed harm (don't forget that this is the owner's property), but it can also bring profound pain - of course. They will not pay more attention to it. If there are indeed one or two out-of-date smart children, they will report to the "Shantou", "Shantou" report to the eunuch, the eunuch has the right to advance 6style_txt; throw these little nephews into the stone Grinding, lest their thoughts cause greater waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those tamed children will soon be put into labor until they have the ability to reproduce, during which time they are happy, because cattle and horses also need feed. The slaves of adolescence can get a lot of beet residue. These nutrient-rich foods and secret medicines can make them grow strong muscles and strong bones in a flash. They also have strong **, they are under the management of "Shantou" Fertility, males can only be with female slaves for five years, female slaves can give birth to the ninth child, and the beet residue in the feed disappears after they are no longer allowed to give birth. Instead, more secret drugs are used. Palm leaves, the wonderful thing is to eat food that can't be called food at all. They still have endless efforts to work around the clock. It was not until the last glimmer of the sun that fell on the surface of the sea, but the glare was fleeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret medicine makes them mentally slow, unable to remember too many things, and cannot understand too deep words, only a few simple words with whip, whistle Let them act, besides that. Even if they are put into a huge stone mill, they only have tears and screams, and even resistance and escape can not be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than 100,000," said Kerry Ben. "You seem to have forgotten the place outside the island."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The side island is enough for me." Kremar said, it knows. Maybe it can only save 10,000 or less people. On the Longhuo Island, slaves are consumables. Those who use secret medicine on them will not care about their lives. The slaves here, Almost all can only live to 30 years old, "Shantou" is slightly longer, because they take less secret medicine, and the eunuchs around the lord and the lord's son are longer. If they are lucky, they can live and their own. The master is as long as the eunuch of the East Crown lord, and the eunuchs of the lords of the East Crown lords are unlucky. When their masters die or become slaves, they wait for them to become "smart hands." "With the "cow horse" a way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a separate list of female slaves around the host, because their lives are sometimes shorter than the "cow and horse", their owners are in the thriving place Whenever, or when you are angry, you will often brutally ruin these feathery birds. Many female slaves are only 11 or 2 years old when they die, not to mention that they will still live better. Crossing each other, the female slaves who can survive to be retired to the "smart hand" can be said to be few and far between. Just look at how much effort Dada spent in the "smart hand" looking for a female slave who temporarily waited for the new owner. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will be a difficult and long battle." Ranger said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter," said the soul of the opposite world: "Time is meaningless to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When he finished this sentence, he suddenly paused. Kerry looked at him curiously. Sometimes you can read a lot from Kremar’s face, like a copy. The open book, like now, Kremar is squinting in dismay, as if to say something that should not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has thought about the conversation just now. Is there a sentence about time? Just now, he did not understand the meaning of the young caster, because the life of the half-elf has grown longer than humans, but it is only two hundred and fifty to three hundred years. It is only a glimpse of the elf's eternal life. But he immediately thought that in terms of human beings, such life is already enviable enough. Kreima’s mentor is human, his father may be human, and he is only twenty years old. Maybe he thinks two It has been a long time for more than a hundred years, so I will say so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Idiot, once the undead said. But thank you for your stupidity, he didn't doubt you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Of course, if we are caught, your time You can count down your fingers and count down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What do you think of my thoughts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? Is it that you are prepared to be a savior? Mr. Harry Potter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The slave of the side island is my property, the soul of the alien world. Then I am willing to use them for watering. It is also my business. In addition, what do you see in my memory, why do you know Harry Potter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You are much more great than the green-eyed little black cat. He saved four or five thousand people and filled a village. And you, do you think that you have to face only 100,000 slaves, no, my dearest idiot, you have to face the entire Dragon Fire Island! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I am not ready to go to the newspaper - are you not interested in this secret medicine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A very common secret medicine, the Lich screams violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you know its ingredients? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--A little knowledge of one or two--when the former undead or a living person, there is a mineral in his father’s mineral deposit. One of the important ingredients, the sparkling small stone, the same color as the realgar. Need to grind into powder, because of the strong demand for this secret medicine, most of the warlock's apprentices have done this boring job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I won’t do this for you, the Lich says, you are pushing us into a dangerous abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- But have you ever thought about it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are atonement! Atonement, understand? ! Why do you see that you are looking for death every time you wake up? ! Is it difficult to do good things? ! is it hard! ! is it hard! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Shut up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I didn’t say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I think I have reminded you that the Lich says that you are in the sea. Your thoughts are completely transparent to me - do you know that you just screamed loudly? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——...嗄? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Don’t pretend to be stupid, I know you are deliberate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The key is not here. The question is your attitude. Do you really want to achieve eternal success with me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——...Try it out, the soul of the outside world can’t help but say that you might get some benefit from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Tell me, what did you do on the road from Baita to Gray Ridge for the first time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--what! Is this your sincerity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- believe me, for you. This is best a secret forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drake lay on the front deck, his hands behind his head, staring at the navy blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking at the Magic Star River," Drake said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crimson silk gown passed over his cheek, and the hard and sharp Mithril shoe tip touched Drake’s cheek: “How can I not know you? When did it become a caster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really can't see." Drake admitted: "But there was a caster who said that night. The sky is beautiful, although I didn't know that he was a caster at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He?" The red robe warlock said: "I thought it should be her, given Our Captain Drake is so obsessed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If someone has lost your connection to two boats and the sailors on board, you will also He never forgets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks like an old friend," said the warlock, leaning down on her body and extending her light brown soft arm to the Golden Lady. The owner: "So, is he the target of our journey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Part," Drake at the Warlock's Help He stood up, and then he gently applied force to pull the red robe warrior into his arms with a kind of indifference: "My dearest Riyt, our main goal is the monarch of Baldwin. With the daughter Li Naina, both of them have a high reward, and Fro priest Mei Mi and the thief Gülen, the thief Gülen is preferred, because he killed the Norman New King’s illegitimate child, now this sorrow The father is willing to take out the bounty that is no less than Birdwin in exchange for this hybrid. As for the Elf Ranger Kerry Ben, you know, he has a good father, the gods are on, I really love these fathers, I think we can ask for a ship of Mithril, perhaps with snow honey and fine gold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the caster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My private reward, beautiful Ruiyite, my most powerful lover, I remember that you like that red Tourmaline, catch him and give him alive to me, that tourmaline is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a bit difficult," Red Robes, White Tower The owner said: "He is a very good caster, maybe not strong enough, but..." He escaped from the hands of Austal and passed him well, now Austal Still busy in the seventy-seventh islands, waiting for him to come back and know that there is a little mage who played him, the face must look good, but unfortunately, Ruiyi Teco did not have the guts to laugh at one of the strongest warlocks among the brothers and sisters. But her intention is to grab him before Ostal reacts, and then see if he can use the little guy to exchange some benefits from Ostal. Anyway, this is his omission, though not It’s a big deal, but Ostal’s praise from the “mother” after taking back the dragon’s grammar book. And so do not have the gift of blood next fight hate like crazy, as long as he revealed a little flaw, they swarm the Fed, he will be torn to pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one is stronger than you," Drake said. “It’s like no one can be more beautiful than you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your tongue is like being pickled by honey,” Ruiyite said. Let me find out the traces of the bee sting, or I will cut it off and put it in the garlic and vinegar for a day and night to drink with blood and red wine."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every part of my body belongs to you." Drake said sweetly: "Good people, pick it up in the coarse salt or marinate in the grape vinegar. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruiyi smiled contemptuously and pushed Drake's face mercilessly: "I hope you didn't say this to the sea devil." She will be serious, Drake.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can be said to be cheerfully watching Drake’s face pale and then Become a young man, the day spent on the Sea Magic is the humiliation that Drake will never forget in this life. If it is not Rui Yi Te, a powerful red robe warlock, one of his favorite, finally invited the helper to say Out In that case, he will bind her under the keel of the Golden Lady from the Longhu Islands to the Azores until she has only the bones of the forest, but he can't do anything now, he wants to make a smile. Even if there is no mirror, he also knows that his face is distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
