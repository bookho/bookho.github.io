			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon knows that the return of his elder brother will definitely have some effect, but what he did not expect is that this effect will come so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archon often orders them to return to their bureaucrats for dinner when they are able to gather together, so that they can make them as they see it. It’s inseparable, but Demon’s view is that only naively, Yadell will believe that they are a good-going one. Demon will laugh when he sees this scene, and the eldest son must be absent-minded. The thoughts of the three sons did not care at all, stubbornly thinking that his children were as obedient as the chess pieces on the board, but did not know that his rights, honours and expectations would be the same as the savory sweet butter. As long as you touch it gently, it will be ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Demon," the Archon said, cutting a piece of fresh beef without lifting it up: "The recruitment of soldiers is suspended."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon suddenly clenched the silver knife: "I don't understand," he said confusedly. "Father, we just discussed this matter yesterday. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I talked to your brother today," the consul said rudely. "I think he is right, we should go to the lord." Ask for help, let her send soldiers and mages instead of vainly spending the money and manpower of the White Tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing," the consul unknowingly beat the empty plate with a fork: "Stop recruitment, drive away the idle tramps and useless apprentices."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demon looked to his brother, the eldest son of the consul gave him a smile of apology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are experienced and powerful mercenaries," Demon said in a low voice. "In addition, it is not an apprentice. It is a mage, although they cannot Antonio Master is on the same page..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should think that Antonio Master will be angry for us not believing in him," the governor smothered the bread with his bread. Oil: "Fortunately, I still have time to get rid of them. Demon, at most, give some money. You said that those people will do whatever they want, so I don't want them to sell their lives, as long as they leave the White Tower as soon as possible. Giving you a day and night, it should be enough, they will find it very cost-effective." He raised his eyes, the thick eyelids covered most of it, but the rest can still make many people frightened: "You can do well, Right, Demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon knew that there was no chance to save. He bowed his head and said: "If you can, add a white, father." He said: "There are so many people after all."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No more," the consul said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, the governor eagerly invited his eldest son to sleep in his bedroom: "Let your old father take a good look at you and talk to you." "He said in secret: "We haven't seen it for three months a year. - Will Yale come together? My bed is very spacious, even if I lie on two people, I can still get your puppy." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadale's face is red, he has rarely heard his father call him with this cute nickname: "I want to go back before sunset." The sanctuary, I promised to the teacher, so, I am sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," his long brother stretched his hand and gently touched his soft hair. : "Following the promise is the most important thing. I will stay in the White Tower for a while. I will go back to the sanctuary to see you. If the father really wants to warm up, can we find Demon... Demon?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has already left," the consul said, and he saw Demon's black robe flashing at the door: "I don't know." He is looking for such a mentor to be good or bad," he said sadly. "Although he is really strong, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gloomy and indifferent," perennial The eldest son was only known to have such a person after Demon became a mage. Demon’s mentor did not look ferocious. To be exact, there was something handsome, but as a reserve of the Paladin of Rosada, Demon’s The elder brother always thought that he was like a fine thorn in the shadow: "How did he become the mentor of Demon? Did Antonio Master recommend it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, he is just a wandering mage," his father said. "Demon likes him. He gives his mentor an oath before everyone knows it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is he still in the White Tower?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, he left two years ago," said the Archon: "I gave him a The pen is rich in rewards." The Master accepted, but the Archon still remembers the smile he showed under the dark hood. He said: "Dear dear Officer, the biggest reward I get here is nothing else. It is your son, Demon, who will become a mage that you can't imagine, strong and outstanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be a good word, a blessing, but the governor will be chilling as long as he thinks back, just like it is a terrible curse or a vicious rumor. At this time, Demon was rushing out of the bureaucracy, he hesitated a few heartbeats, because the sudden return of his eldest brother broke many plans, he Need to be saved – he considered it for a while, arranged the order of things to do, and then went to the sanctuary in Rosada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sanctuary of Rosada is close to the inner city, but most of the buildings are still in the outer city, where civilians and servants live, so that his believers can Come and pray and take holy water and bay leaf at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests of the god of morning light presented their last solemn and brilliant ode to their gods. As the light dimmed, the crowds became scarce. The elementary schoolers dressed in knee-length white robes are busy cleaning the courtyard, scrubbing the canals and statues, and taking away the fallen leaves and dead branches of the flowers except the holy trees... Pastor Monroe passes through them, at some When the child didn't notice him, he beat their ass with the laurel branches in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respect, respect," he said dissatisfiedly: "I am not so slack and stupid to be an apprentice, remember, respect your elders and The teacher is a very important thing, understand, respect!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," the child who was beaten by his ass smiled and bowed to him: "Yes, may the morning light shine on you, Teacher Monroe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not afraid of Monroe, indeed, Monroe is sometimes annoying, but He is not a bad person. He has done the biggest punishment, that is, slaps their ass, but the branches in his hands are always thin and soft. They recite prayers or transcribes hundreds of times on the cold slate floor. The hymns come to be more compassionate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menro sat out of the gate of the sanctuary with satisfaction, paused in front of the holy pool, and took a fine silver comb from his carry-on bag to comb him. The hair, his hair is golden, but unfortunately, the thin is like a veil of layers of women, and his hairline is receding at a visible speed. He has found many methods, including The whole head was soaked in camel urine - this method was told by his lover, and the results were still not satisfactory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Yadel when he put away the comb, and the young man who entered the sanctuary twenty years later was respectful and humble to ask him. His hair is linen, not pure enough, but the thick and rich is enough for Monroe to envy: "Young people," he muttered in his heart: "This is a young man."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
