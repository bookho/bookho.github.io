			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ain Stone is a magical treasure created by the sorcerers of the Austrian-French era thousands of years ago. It looks like a gem of various colors. , the size varies, but given the aesthetics of the casters, generally do not exceed the size of the palm, after the casting method, they will rotate around the head of the master, just like the planets around the stars, each has a different role, For example, to enhance strength, sensitivity, physique, intelligence, perception, charm, or protection, or to continue to restore his lost vitality, it is also possible to absorb the spells thrown by the enemy, and to store spells, and in an emergency. Use - Unlike ordinary rune gems, it can be used by everyone, but it can store several or more spells, depending on the power of the producer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that being able to make Iron Stone means that this caster can’t be just a mediocrity<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster is eager for them, but these little things are harder to obtain than the rune. After all, the ancient rune is rare, but people can still imitate them, but Ian Stone's method of production is only in the hands of a few people (with or without people), they almost do not need external money supply, and rarely lack critical materials or servants, Ian Stone in many casters The mouth is more like a legend, although it is written every year for the first place in the list of businessmen who have the privilege of working for the caster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They see a deep purple Ain stone, or you can call it a fresh purple, which indicates that its level may be second only to Those special Ain stones - pearl white Ain stone can heal and restore, lavender, green Ain stone can absorb the power of magic, and the fresh purple Ain stone means it can be used to store spells - wear This Iron Stone is almost an extra self - for everyone present, including the Red Dragons.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal cannot refuse at all. If he does not become a lover of the Red Dragon, then he may have room for concession - let Cremaar and His blood is entangled in the fight, but now he has no chance to stop, can he say no? After all, Danos is just a thief with a shallow dragon blood. He can only transfer the right-hand man to a person who is likely to become an enemy in the future, and can not get a benefit from it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young female red dragon quickly took the Ain stone from the hands of the younger brothers in the eyes of the younger brothers. "I need warlocks." And maybe there are mages," she told the maid, almost unwilling, I believe I will get a surprise.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant cockroach sleeps under the mud of hundreds of feet, the winter is always silent and dull, like time Everything was stagnant, the edelweiss stopped growing, replaced by the snow falling from the sky, but the giant cockroaches had never seen it before, and before the snow fell, she sneaked into the black water, and the frog, the snake, or Other monsters fall into the hibernation every yearThey are almost undisturbed, except that occasionally they will slide over one or two mud monsters, they will not try to swallow the giant cockroaches, it is too big, and a tail is likely to turn them into real mud, except In the deepest part of the swamp, there is probably no monster that can swallow it all at once, but the latter has not appeared again for more than a thousand years. The depths of the swamp are warm and safe, and the food will continue from above. Fall down<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today it seems to be an exception, first of all annoying little bugs constantly harassing cockroaches, then more snakes and monsters are also There is a lot of noise everywhere, and there is a constant buzzing sound above the swamp. If you are still asleep, this low and complicated sound may only become its lullaby, let it sink into a deeper dream. But when it wakes up, after waking up, in addition to the sound, it makes it angry and there is a chill from the surface of the swamp. Even if the blood is cold, it still prefers a warm nest, it is annoying. Stretched a few times to make it flexible, then varicose muscles, and swim quietly to the heights<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the swamp, a warlock slammed up: "The enemy!" His voice became very big with the help of magic, then he I felt the ground beneath me, or the ice surface jumped a bit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice surface is of course impossible to jump on its own. It will only bulge under the impact of the monster. This kind of impact is not the first time, but it is still so big. Let the warlock involuntarily frown<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada’s army marched in the dark, just like to make their journey more interesting, with the cold current, the blizzard also followed The lion-headed lions flew in a circle and found that even though the passengers on the back could keep the light around them, they could still rotate uncontrollably in a small range, according to the birds. As soon as I flew into the air, I felt a squeaking voice rushing into my head, causing their brains to hurt. The vassal army of Grenada, and the orcs removed all the fur tents and put them Dip in the water, then put it on a gravel-built platform, pull it down and let it hang down. Under the dual action of magic and cold current, the tent will soon become a flat-bottomed sled, and the orcs use them. The ropes connected the sleds, and the Grenada’s Deinonychus was responsible for dragging them. Fortunately, these monsters did not have the wisdom of a lion, but they still roared for a while, but very Quickly, the warlock’s whip and mercenary Meat or let them once again bow down to the<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They haven't seen the blood of the elves yet, but they first saw their own... In the darkness, the color of the blood is like the deepest shadow, but they can still smell the smell - the smell of human blood is always It is sweeter and richer than the blood of the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos cautiously stared at his new owner and saw him close his eyes slightly, but was not sure if he was mourning or enjoying, possibility The bigger one is the latter. After all, there will be no Grenada people paying attention or pity to an insignificant mercenary, and then it is impossible to do it - turning around, the leader of the dragon thorn Lamenting in my heart, no one can hate changing bosses more than the Grenada people. Although they often do this for various reasons, it does not mean that they like to guess and familiar again and again. They are always moody and unpredictable. The new owner, in case, of course, he said that in case, or one million times, you are wrong, the death that can be simply used is still the best, and he is afraid that this is obviously related to the Warlock Tower. A very good black-haired dragon will throw him at a warlock to make a test or a sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a skid is pulled out of the ground, they are in a very front position, without any consideration, responsible for driving the Deinonychus The warlock threw a small lightning bolt to make it run faster, and the warlock and the mage on the skid before and after the dumped skid cut off the connected rope for the first time. A warlock waved his arm and could not turn behind. The sled car suddenly leaped up, and even with its dragged skid, it slid a half circle on the ice and stopped. The rear of the deinonychus and the sled car whizzed past them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight on the skid picks up the spear, they have to deal with this giant scorpion as soon as possible, the Legion’s team will not wait for them for too long, and Losing the guidelines of the Red Dragon, they will only get lost in this swamp that is close to the endless. As for the monsters, the cold or the hunger, it is not something they can guess, but fortunately, the skid There is exactly one warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who once saw the flames behind them, Grenada is in the hot desert, surrounded by the ocean, if it was not all the way before, it must There will be knights or casters who don't adapt, just don't know if they know how to deal with a jealousy. Speaking up - another soul in his body may ask them to remember to leave some meat, and the roast is delicious. He must also admit this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Do you think the elves will be prepared?” asked the brother of Red Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the young female red dragon replied, "What about that?" She doesn't like Gredi, but she knows that Greedy owns What kind of ambition, in this case, she will not use her god to humiliate herself and reduce her mastery of believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After flying all night, they have been able to vaguely see the edge of the twilight, under the blue sky at dawn, this edge looks It’s so clear, the red dragon knows that they will soon become tall trees that stand in the clouds. She breathes deeply. The more dazzling light than the sun shines from her body, and the people around me must close their eyes. Turn your head to ensure that you won't get burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do we want to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can there be any other choices?" One of the twin red dragons answered the brother's question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three red dragons are vacating, and after flying into the sky, their horizons become wider, and they don’t need much time, they find the card The wounds left by Ulan and Angris's saints after the battle - the sharp impact marks rubbed against the edge of the silver-crowned jungle, the whole ground was picked up, and the shimmering shimmer was seen in the depths. The rock layer, on the edge of the traces, can see the rolling hills, but it can be seen that these hills may not exist before one day. In fact, even the jungle is finally affected, the trees are dumped, and the vines are corrupted. No less than three streams of water were cut off, and the smell of filth still lingered, but it was still seen that the elf tried to save the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Red Dragon, this is just another piece of evidence that the elves are stupid. When the enemy is present, they don’t even go. Save your strength against the enemy, but spend them unnecessarily on some wood? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw traces of the dragon fire in the dead trees, and the smell of sulfur pointed out the boundaries that the eyes could not find. But they could not feel that the mother is still here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
