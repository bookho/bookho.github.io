			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the time when Cremari’s first spell came into effect, Kerry and the more perceptive pastor perceived the looseness of the puzzle, waiting until When the couples who are forcibly matched together unanimously decide the painful separation because of the second mage, they have been able to accurately find the source of the scream and the fire—the tectonic essence that was torn from the shadow plane by the demon. Not so happily swaying - it is part of the shadow plane, like a small piece knocked from a huge magnet, the shadow plane always pulls it, and it itself is eager to re-separate The body is merged into one. If it is not controlled by the demon, it should have disappeared from the main material plane on the sixth day of birth, just like those that are produced in the shadow plane and connected to the main material plane. Alien vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power that is holding it now does not know why it has weakened, and the cry of the plane far exceeds the attraction of the main material, it is like a Like the flamboyant, innocent and childish playboy, he left behind a group of sorcerer tree monsters and rushed to the embrace of "mother" without any love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the departure of the essence of the shadow, this gloomy mansion has returned to its original state, the sun shines into the house, although the air is not so fresh, but Walking in it, I can feel the cool wind blowing from my cheeks. Some of the shadow creatures that have been dragged into here are screaming into the place still covered by shadows, and some more evil creatures, like a The hell cat, who was only confronting Kerry, was scared by the glare of the sun that suddenly fell on it. It jumped up literally, and the silver-gray body hair was erected like a smashing arrow. A scream of anger rushed to the most vulnerable of the few - the priest Ilmort who lost Gavin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young pastor did not flinch or fall into a panic as the hell cat expected. Instead, he bravely and firmly rushed forward, clasping His hammer, they slammed together, the light of the more dazzling magic than the sun shrouded them, and the hell cat screamed. The stinger in the tail made a deep mark on the hard stone floor - and the priest of Ilmot prayed loudly, continually striking his head with his hammered gold hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hell cat screamed annoyedly, twisting his body—it looks like another plane and the cat owner who favors slavery to human slaves. Just ten times as big as they are. The silver-gray fur is shiny and smooth, and the tough muscles like steel can erupt even if the orcs can't resist. Now, this power is used to escape, and the young priest of Ilmot only feels one. The huge force of the stock pushed away. When the hand was empty, the hammer fell to the ground and smashed a precious alabaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry's arrow caught up with this evil creature, it screamed into the darkness, and the blood dripping down into the white marble floor, quickly infiltrated into a dark brown stain, a priest with feet I tried to wipe it, but found it to be like the original pattern of the stone, and it didn't move - they decided not to take care of it for the time being. Anyway, until the devil is expelled, this house must be thoroughly purified, and maybe it will be burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A priest of Crawford walked up to check the wounds of the young priest, he was not safe and sound, the claws of the hell cat caught his face, among them One eye can be ruined by one finger, and the bottom of his chest, close to the heart, is scratched by its powerful hind legs, and the flesh is turned over. Exposed to the white ribs and the soft viscera wrapped in the film - the priest of Klanwo bowed his head and prayed for a powerful treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has already opened a closed door at this time, and the door is opened enough to make one of the dirtiest orcs The nose-smelling smell came oncoming, and the Ranger immediately shut it off. But the corridor is full of that disgusting smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is inside? The priest of Klanwo asked in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small sanctuary in Tampas, showing the armor and weapons of the warrior, but it has been polluted, and the elf is also answered in simple sign language - in fact, The keen vision of the elf made him see a lot of things, out of hatred of the ancestors of this family. The devil not only destroyed the church, the weapons and the armor, but also smeared the entire room with the blood of his descendants - two female bodies without limbs were nailed to the middle of the altar, and a sword that was broken into two halves penetrated separately. In the lower part of them, their chests were cut open and all the internal organs were dug up, replaced by a litter of white mites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil also deliberately placed a precious fluorite on their foreheads, illuminating their faces, and the two faces that are fearful There is no fear, no pain, but a strange smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf quickly tried several rooms before finally finding a small room that was originally used for storage, which was filled with discarded furniture. Narrow, perhaps because it wasn’t taken up by the devil and those who were confused by her mind, they killed a few giant worms in this shadowed plane, and Kerry’s opened a dusty Account, put it on a chair, "We will come back to you soon." He promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Pastor Ilmot nodded and his wounds had healed, but he could feel the sharp tingling of his abdomen and face every time he walked. He couldn’t move quickly and could not speak consistently. He knew very well. It would only be a cumbersome to follow them again, so he did not raise any objection to the arrangement of the Elf Ranger, but he sat down safely with the help of Pastor Cranford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Claude gave him several reels for defense and healing, and a slender whistle that will be used by followers of the Death God. This whistle summons the crow. The voice of the whistle is inaudible to ordinary people, but the priests and elves of Klanwo can hear it. If he is in danger, he can get assistance by blowing the whistle, and the defensive scrolls are also Enough to let him support them to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young priest Ilmort was still a little scared when the door was once again cautiously closed. He heard a lot from the brothers who traveled abroad. It’s not so rare about the terrible story of the devil. The devil often uses those who fail to place orders for various reasons as a priority attack, but he can’t ask them to separate a person to accompany themselves, because now they are getting rid of themselves. There are only two priests and elf rangers left in the team, and they still don't know how many fierce and brutal monsters they have to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they didn’t leave, he even felt anxious because he was worried that the time delayed by his injury would make his brother and companion In a deadly dilemma; they left, and he missed their companion uncontrollably. The room was very quiet, and the corpses of the giant worms were in the corners of one side. In order to avoid their resurrection, the elves burned them to ashes. The scent they emit is not strong, but it is as cold as it can get into your bone marrow. The priest shudders and wraps himself in a tent - a sun shines through the window with the iron bar. It looks warm. He carefully moved over, and the warm, bright light made him feel more at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat like this, almost sleepy, and when a loud noise awakened him, he almost broke the scroll in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he immediately heard someone calling his name with joy, though he became somewhat choppy because he was still coughing - young Il Pastor Mott suddenly heard the voice of another older brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you here?" Pastor Ilmort, who was forced to form a group with the thieves, asked with concern: "-Are you injured?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the young pastor said happily: "It has been treated - but it can't be acted upon, at least not to join the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You find Gavin?" his brother asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We saw the flame and heard the cry," the young pastor said. "It was from the atrium. But I don't know if Gavin is There."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if not," Gülen said: "He will go there too - it has returned to normal, I think Ilmot The priest will not fall to the lost in a house with only fifteen rooms. Of course, if he is not killed by those endless monsters, the thieves add in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older pastor looked at the thief: "...I must also go there-" He hesitated and said, "Would you like to stay?" If you are going to face a demon, then a mortal can hardly play any role... Sorry, I have no contempt, but you know that some gaps cannot be skillful. With experience to make up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan has just started thinking about this problem, he is not a mage. Not a pastor, is he really going to face a devil? He felt that he had done a very good job - he did not run far, but with them into the dangerous place of the ghost, he also saved a priest of Ilmot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also fought a half-dragon hybrid. He also made a worthy trophy for himself - Krimaar only took a spell book from that pocket, and the rest of the stuff was given to the thieves - they were all expensive gems and sparkling Gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this forced team, the only one who will sing the thief Gülen is probably the half-elf mage of the black hair, Gülen Knowing where he has won his favor, but he knows that the Master is not the kind of good guy who is willing to endure an idiot or a coward, he just seems to be kind. In fact, it is more ruthless than any of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Useless things are discarded.
