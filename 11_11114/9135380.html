The fact that the warlocks made by the warlocks of Grenada is also a poor imitation. After all, there is no cat ear and angel in this plane.品#书¥)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the succubus in the endless abyss can be compared with the six-armed snake, the Fro de or even the Barlow They have a graceful body and beautiful faces. Their strength stems from their own charm. No matter how powerful people are, if the mind is not mature enough, the will is not strong enough, and they can only be prey in front of them. And the tool.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She carried a male's head, and the oldest animalized person suddenly recognized that this person was his throwing spell and injured their smallest Sister, how cruel and proud he was when he stepped into the courtyard, she thought, he probably didn't think it was just a moment, he lost everything he could snuggle, his magic, his wisdom, his blood, in The succubus was like a funny joke. The succubus carries his head like an ordinary girl carrying a beloved doll. "I thought you would need my help," said Ferry Hill. "But it seems that you have solved the trouble here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sacrificing so much, Yadel said in his heart that if he was still the pastor of Rosada, he might blame the fee angrily Rick Hill, because this succubus was originally a card that the black dragons left for them, now think of it, perhaps because Cremari is invisible to confuse the boundaries between evil and good; or Ferry The illusion of pretending to let him put down the vigilance he deserved, but he should not forget that a demon will never become kind, it may be gentle and patient, but it is only for pain and despair. The fruit trees are bred higher and bigger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like now, the blood of the innocent remains in his body and hands, they are already cold, but Yadell still feels them Like a charcoal fire, he lowered his head and could almost see the smoke rising from the flesh when he was burning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the warning of the morning god Rosada Or reprimand, he should have been more careful and more cautious, he should know this black The land will never allow light and purity to occupy a place, but he can't blame Ferry Hill. She is a demon. Her nature makes her happy to see human death, especially the weak and weak human being. The devils, they may not even have the dust of the ground, especially under the command of the summoner, she can not hunt them, use these lives and souls as money and food.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Yadel can understand, other human beings, even if they can't understand, will converge their anger and impulse in time because of the tremor from the depths of the soul. It is a dangerous abyss, they can I felt that the fur and the feathers stood up violently. They breathed quickly and the coixers contracted, but no one dared to have any movements..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferrick Hill kissed the solitary head with some boring kisses, and the other people’s creeps were that the head was still screaming and screaming when accepting the succubus’s kiss. This spell was originally intended for black hair. Dragonborn The slave and the friend, did not expect that, due to some bad hobbies, he became a test of Ferrek Hill, his soul is still in his head, and the eyes are turning swaying, and The tongue is constantly coming out of the teeth because the muscles there are damaged. [Update fast, the station page is refreshing,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few ads, most like this Kind of station, must be praised]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's stand up. The succubus said after kissing several of his spoils, "Don't forget that our enemies can be more than these two." "dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is also a priest of Greedy," said Yadel, "and a gray robe." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shadow plane," said Yadel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you have a way to get back here," said the succubus: "The priest, and take care of them, of course, I don't think you need to be jealous." Do, after all, my master trusts you so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?" asked the senior who had a winged beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A refuge between darkness and light," Yadel said: "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ferke Hill looks at them into the shadow plane, the shadow plane projected the main material plane, but the nature of space and objects will be terrible and unpredictable changes, if you want to catch up with time, cast a spell They use it to shorten the road, as long as the spell is correct, they can even walk hundreds of miles or even thousands of miles overnight. It’s true that Yadell called it a refuge, because the passage into the shadow plane is always uncertain and unfixed. Only a few people and creatures with shadow planes can capture themselves in this special plane. The goal, yes, they will face the hunters of the shadow plane, but as a follower of the god of morning light, the power of Yadell happens to be their nemesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the connection point of the plane gradually disappears, the chill of the air is already approaching the foot of Ferry Hill, and the wall and the ground are condensed. The white frost, the burning flame extinguished silently, the succubus raised the head in the hand and complained that it was very cold, and Ferry Hill immediately satisfied his wish. She looked up the whole head and the skull. The soul swallowed down. Some people said that the devil's blood is acid, and the gastrointestinal tract is magma. This way he can warm up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not quite like what a gray robe can do;" Ferry Hill muttered, and she could feel it was not The spell, but the result of being overwhelmed by the power of repression and intentional disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To pay tribute to our most charming little hall." When the devil twitched his nose and tried to search for memory, the gray robe appeared, he took The negative energy comes from the endless abyss, but surprisingly, he is extremely... calm, it should be said, like a whirlpool heart, the surrounding violent chaos can not affect him. Standing in a reassuring position, no, maybe not so reassuring, Ferry Hill gently patted his wings and mentioned himself to the air, she is not ready to be an enemy of this "grey gown". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the nickname that made her change her mind. People know that she is a succubus, but no one knows that she is Graz’s daughter, Felix Hill. People dare to ask her name, and the dark-haired dragon has always called her a succubus lady, but this person... she is uncertain, she seems to have guessed her identity, and if so, he will not easily Fighting with her is not only a succubus, but also one of Graz's most notorious assassins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about your master?" asked Felix Hill. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still in the courtyard." Gray robe said happily: "She is a wise child."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that she knows her quite well." Ferry Hill said: "She doesn't seem to be as good as these two cute puppies." She glanced at the terrace, not just those The beastized person, Yadel even took away the body of the warlock. "How do you really make them born? Is the egg broken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Who knows," said the gray robes. "Maybe the red dragons set the temperature too high when they hatched them. You know, human children can easily become idiots if they are hot... ...but on the other hand, they are still very sorry about their lives," he shook his head. "Look, they are only willing to face the slaves of Kremar instead of Kremar."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," said Ferry Hill, looking at the grey gown while he was mentioning the name of the black-haired dragon. All the familiar and affectionate feelings: "We can still talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk," said the gray robe: "She is just a bit "You are willful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelsey anxiously waited, as she said in the gray robe... vigilance, she can be guarded by a whole army Mocking at the younger brother who is not recognized by her, she can also walk into the courtyard without the master under the gaze of the warlock and the gray robe, but she wants her to enter the private field of a caster, she is not so sure that she once thought The black-haired dragons who have been displaced by Grenada for nearly a hundred years are not enough to incite her and Kelmen's power, but this does not seem to be the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
