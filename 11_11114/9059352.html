			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caubert’s departure represents a terrible small war that has come to an end. Following the merchants, the managers of other islands, the brothers of Beavis The younger brothers also sent their eunuchs, giving gifts and slaves to show goodwill. Although the truth of the whole thing is well known to everyone, it is inevitable that some people will try to provoke them, such as the messenger of the youngest son of Amos. Inadvertently, Drake of the Golden Lady and their eldest brother can say that they have a very deep relationship, because their elder brothers have always had great interest in the elves, so in recent years, Drake has been He is looking for elves and half elves. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world is not profound to Drake’s understanding. After all, the golden jade has been busy with the mixed ball. They sent the experience - after he came to this plane, the first elf he saw was also found in Drake's dark cabin. An Eya spirit from the Emerald Island may not be an adult. So far the soul from another plane still clearly remembers the eyes that are as bright and clear as the emerald, and the blue-and-green, blue-necked curls like the crow's feathers—although she tries to keep it Calm, trying not to let others see their fears and panic, but when I saw Kremar’s gray robe, she still trembled uncontrollably – she thought Drake had sold her to a dead spirit. Master, and this wizard is looking at the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, Kreima had to cast a spell to calm her down, and Drake’s dark cabin was still in captivity with a few fishmen. The raw materials of human paper and some casting materials, there are two human females, a mixture of humans and gnomes, but in addition to the Eya spirits, they do not need much help. The fisher only needs to open the valve in the water storage tank to return. To the sea, human women and mixed-race are in the adventurer's squad. They are arrested in the battle with the "Silver Finger" Thieves Guild. Their teammates are directly killed because they are not too valuable or too much injury. Among them, women were left behind because of their beautiful appearance. The mixed blood was sold to Drake by Grande because of a semi-gnome and semi-human deformity, because Derek asked them to leave all the strange things and people, all kinds of people to give He saw it and shot again, and the nobles seemed to like it. Even if you have to watch it in a cage, it is a good pastime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Kremar went to talk to Gülen late at night, several Eya spirits had already walked on the dirty streets of Jianjian Port, but no People know that they have two powerful mages, and the magic envelopes them. Let them blend in with the deep nights - the lich is happy to throw the little parcel that he almost couldn't get rid of, and the irony of the undead is that even one of the Eya spirits looks at him. For a long time, I still haven't said anything about it with him and the Jade Island...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost forgot... It was thought that after that, there would be no connection with the Eya spirit except for the spell materials and experimental products. It seems that fate is indeed a daughter-in-law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dismissing the group of increasingly disgusting messengers, the once undead turned to the west side of the fort, where the gnomes lived, Leona and Bo Devin lives close to him, and Baldwin's arm needs to be observed and debugged anytime, anywhere, according to the requirements of the gnomes, even if the real production has not yet begun. However, Bedwin was still indispensable in the preparations for the previous period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked out of the room, Dada saluted him and asked if he needed a soft sedan. Although the fortress on the side of the island was called a fortress, it was on the other islands. Like the mansion, it is not like the Thunder Castle or the kingdom of Norman in the Highlands, or the official residence of the White Tower and the Biyindi Fortress. It is entirely made of rock. It is only four feet high and is white and flawless. The alabaster stone, above is sandalwood and walnut, so you can paint white on it. Draw gold lines and set stones, although the windows and doors are narrow, but there are many, one close to the other. Each room has at least two façades occupied by such doors and windows. When opened, the entire room is open, so the building looks very dense, but if the owner needs it, his path will be straight. And it's cool - all the doors will open for him, and he will be closed after passing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some of the residences of female slaves. They are getting used to it more quickly than their owners. When they are in their homes, they are almost naked, both to get a little coolness in the hottest weather, and to seek the favor of the owner anytime, anywhere. When the door is opened, they will not only panic, but will put a variety of attractive postures in the original position. The soul of the outside world once gave up the soft sedan and walked to the west wing on foot, but on the way back. He gave up, and the soft car can at least put down the gauze - the female slaves are of course beautiful, but it always feels that their snoring is going to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtain of the soft car has been lowered, the rounded sea pearls sway gently, but even if you close your eyes, the lich can still detect that someone is approaching them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes and found that Dada was not so surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have anything to say to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada follows the sedan chair, At this time, there was no way to swear, so he put his hand on his forehead, "My esteemed master," he whispered. "It is something about the gnome McGee. I don't know if you are willing to listen. Listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pygmy McGee is a dwarf who wants to be a dwarf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think I already know," said the Lich. "His dress and costumes are all loudly proclaiming this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His logo is Handle hammer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich did not answer, he thought of the grill, it was fun, it is said that only the ordinary gnomes will be used to make this everyday Utensils, but the gnome of the Eastern Crown lord once said that he needs the most outstanding gnomes, and on these days, although the gnomes have many rejections of McGee, they still quite a lot about his methods and ideas. Convinced and lenient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, the basics of Mai should be the patriarchs of the gnomes." Dada said that the undead had blinked, and the news seemed to explain many problems. "The inheritance of the gnomes is the same as that of human beings," Dada said. "It is determined by the blood of the father. The property, status, and power of the gnomes can only be given to his son. If there are several sons, that is the eldest son." - And McGee's father is the patriarch of their family, and the only son of Mai, who should be the only child, should inherit his position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But as far as we can see, No.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The current patriarch is the brother of McGee’s father. When McGee’s father died, McGee was still a cub, a respected master, along with His father died together with his mother, his sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that it was involved in the war between the lords. Who knows, but the lord of the East Crown announced that he is a collusion with an outsider. Contrary," Dada’s tone unconsciously brought a glimpse of the heart: "Our lords deprived McGee’s father of all power, status, and property, and gave them to the brothers of the former." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich made a chuckle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These gnomes have endured him just because of this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not." Da said: "After McGee made his first work, they must retreat - they can do the McGee, they can do it, but they can't do it. When McGee found out At this point, he started to go crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A gnome who wants to be a dwarf." The voice of the lich came from behind the curtain: "Insane is a good excuse. Otherwise how do they explain to other gnomes why they don't throw McGee into the stone mill? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This may be only part of the reason," Dada said. "Respectable master, I am not sure..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't insist on being correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There may be some gnomes...the master, in fact For the first time, the lord directly interfered with the internal affairs of the gnome. Simply put, although the brother of McGee’s father bit the bait, he still did not completely swallow it. If the ruler of the East Crown showed his thoughts To further control their family, he would probably not hesitate to hand them over to Mackey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s weird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gnomes seem to be like this," Dada said. "They are selfish and evil, facing The same is true of the people of the family. But if the outside forces try to invade them, they will stand up like a hedgehog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next Dada will stop talking. After all, they have reached the West Wing, and the gnome's hearing is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarfs are small as humans, but the requirements on the home are exactly the opposite of the dwarves, who like the sun. The windows should be large, the rooms should be high, the width should be wide, and the brightness of the lighting should be sufficient. The decoration should be exquisite, but also incense, it is best to connect a private private bathroom, there is a bath that can be used for swimming - Dada knows their habits and tastes, the above conditions are met, the slaves are equipped though Not beautiful enough. But it can be tolerated, no matter what, for the current gnomes, this human arm is the most important - the soul of the outside world feels that the gnomes are very similar to the researchers in the other plane, although they also I know how to enjoy, but I must compare it, but when I see a new topic, I will forget everything and start to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They and Bedwin gathered in the center of the West Wing - even in the manor tower and the house of the Master, or in the Temple and the Sanctuary, The large colorless glass that will only be used in the copying room and the hall is luxuriously constructed into a greenhouse that is no less than the size of the courtyard. From the ceiling to the wall, it is a transparent glass, just the flowers originally planted in it. They were all transplanted out. According to the requirements of the gnomes, the ground was covered with a smooth alabaster overnight. The stone was polished like a mirror, and it could reflect the various instruments hanging from the dwarf robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birdwin was sitting in a special chair, or that was an execution chair, but the spikes were pulled out, but the iron frame and the iron ring welded to the armrests and front legs were both Didn't get rid of it, although they are not closed now, but look at the meaning of a few gnomes, but I really want to try it. If it wasn't for the Norman king of Highland, she was watching coldly, she inherited from Norman Pharaoh. The face is still terrible when it is not ridiculous, let alone her hand is carrying a hammer - it should not be the work of the dwarf, or the gnome will at least push her out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former lord of Thunderbolt was not fixed in a chair like a criminal, but his expression was still not complimented - he was on the upper body, gnome McGee Stepping on a folding ladder, holding a strangely shaped instrument with a tiny needle on it, according to the movement of McGee's fingers, they will find one, or a lot of roots, piercing in Bedwin's incomplete Positioning the skin of the arm, the smooth cylindrical surface has been stained with blood, and some places even have a cyanosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Lich approached them, McGee was busy asking Bedwin’s feeling: “Is it hurting here?” Sting: “Is it still?”< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorn two times: "Can you feel a few places hurt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many: "Tell My position?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich stopped to watch for a while. "Is this measuring whether his nerves are intact?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." McGee looked up and didn't have a gift or greeting, so he refocused and devoted himself to his work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods are on, the curse, I have asked no more than a hundred times, and then he answered you." Birdwin said, small There was no poison on the small needle tip and no salt water, but he was already sitting here. Nearly half of the white cockroaches were constantly poked. He felt that he was almost a needle, and he could not sit like this. He still had to feel carefully and did not dare to answer every question of the little doll. McGee warned him that each of his answers would be related to whether his future arm would be as perfect as expected. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is a festival for the Bibi Dibao people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
