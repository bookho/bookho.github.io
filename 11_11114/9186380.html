If this does not fully show the fate of fate, then three skills The excellent assassin may be able to explain some problems - Ingwi does not know what happened to Edel, the pseudonym "Gray", but let him want to curse Edel at the end of the bottomless abyss, Under the triple threat of daggers, smashing arrows and short swords, he actually remembered to take away the lambs soaked in the tub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingeway would rather have him stay in the hotel, maybe he can find an elf, after all, Bibi dike is often the Emerald Island and the land At the first junction, the elf who first traveled will be familiar with the outside world, and the elf returning to Lindao will take a break here, but he is also very clear, and more likely, he will be peeled by a fool. Become a pot of fragrant mutton soup - although the elf is not very clear, during the time when the deformation is in effect, unfortunately, the victims who mourn the wasteland appear in the form of animals or humans in cages or pots. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what, think about the worst, Ingeway feels that he should give a certain understanding of "Gray", just like He did not try to return the Ingwi to the Emerald Island - yes, how do you explain him? Not to mention whether he can enter the island, when the king of the Jade Island came to find his own child, can he directly give her a ... lamb? It is a bit chilling to think of Ingeway here. He can almost imagine that the entire Elf Island will rush to feed him, hug him and touch him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ingwi discovered that he was actually trembled - when he found that he could not get rid of the three followers, "Gray" was crossing a pile of fluffy When it was thatched, it fell from his arms - maybe anyone in the three saw it, but a lamb that only screams is obviously not enough for them to give up the original plan, Yingge Weihao is not easy to get out of the thatched pile, covered with grass and dust. His fur is not wet. When the wind passes, he takes away most of the temperature. He hesitates for a moment and considers whether he should drill back to the grass. But he thought that if those people lost the trace of "Gray" or were knocked back by him, then they might want to try their luck on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamb leaping (gating himself) through a small half of the woods, a brown spot on the branch and turning his head to look at him, but In the end, it gave up this seemingly fat prey, but there were two yellow scorpions immediately behind the lamb, but after seeing the rams slammed a python that wanted to give it a bit, they Also quietly lost the trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a wide but desolate road outside the woods. The reason for this is that this road is enough to accommodate two carriages on the road. The vines, and the sky is blocked and covered by the branches that grow freely - the lambs sway their noses and smell the smell of the air - when the sensitive ears of the lambs hear the hum of the distant Ingway is a little hesitant, is to hide immediately, or see who is coming to make a decision? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage soon appeared in the view of the lamb, the glass window on the door was opened, and the people inside seemed to be enjoying the breeze of the night, she Even before the coachman saw Ingway, in the darkness of the darkness, the lamb was like a pearl, the carriage slowly slowed down, and then stopped at a distance of ten feet from the lamb. The coachman jumped out of the carriage and opened the door for the nobles inside. She was a noble lady with two silvery but faint faces, wearing a velvet robes and a thick cloak of the same texture and color. It looked very warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me see," the lady smiled in surprise. "The gods are on, do I see a lamb?" Ingwei walked, and when the lamb was vigilantly retreating, she did not stubbornly press, but put her knees on the ground and patted her hands on her legs. "Come," she said, like casting a trick. In the sleeve, I found out an apple with a scent. Ingwi really didn't want to admit that his saliva was secreted more vigorously. He had stopped eating one night and had not eaten anything, damn "Gray", damn "Assassin "There is still a pear in the roasting sheep's mouth, even though it is over-cooked... and the lady, with a hardening of the snow, opened the apple and half put it in her mouth and took a bite. The sound made Ingwi a little dizzy, and half gave it a little forward. "How, lamb? Good apple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady grabbed the lamb who had come to bite the apple. The lamb did not want to wiggle a few times, but when she hugged it, she stopped moving: "Well. "She said, while stroking the messy curls of the lamb, "Where do you come from? Sheepfold, or businessman? What about your mother?" When she touched the hard things, she pulled it up and looked at it: "It seems that you have a very wealthy master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, so let me put it down, I can wait for myself, thank you. Ingwi did not dare to continue to make a move, because he could clearly feel that the lady’s body was so weak and old, and even the ribs were clearly smashed into his body. He was afraid that he would go down with his hoof. The lady changed from going home to returning to the mourning wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go home with me." The lady said, "Maybe I can help you find your master. Outside you are not eaten by wolves. It’s just being eaten.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, okay, are you still Apple? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingwi thought, maybe he was afraid that he would jump out, so the window of the carriage was closed after he got on the bus, but he could pass the suspension bridge from the carriage, and The city gate, and the next paragraph to estimate how much the lady’s mansion is, or more correctly, this should be said to be a castle. I don’t know if it’s because of the late night, the castle is quiet and excessive. The number of servants is small and diligent, but they can hardly speak. The baby Ingram was taken down by the maid, the water was very hot, and the precious spices were put, but fortunately not basil or basil, otherwise it was so rich, and Ingeway would think that they were preparing for cooking before cooking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingewei was washed clean, the maids wiped him with cotton cloth, and a silver comb combed him, and the collar was also shimmered The maid also tied a pink bow ribbon to his short tail, and as soon as he swayed his tail he could hear the bell on the ribbon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can he do? He is also desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lamb was sent to his wife’s arms, it was already fluffy like a white cloud, and the lady kissed his nose with a kiss, "I will take you Go see my husband," she said. "He will be happy to see you so cute little things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was quiet before, then The lady walked down step by step, then what Ingway could feel can only be described as dead silence. He moved uncomfortably. The lady’s reaction was to wrap him in his own cloak. ," she whispered: "Don't move, don't call, dear, my husband doesn't like noise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing the ghost, Ying Gewei had felt extremely bad, but the lady had already reached the end of the ladder, the candle suddenly lit up, behind a huge desk, sitting on the lady's husband, the owner of the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be indistinguishable from others except for his pale face, but the rotten smell that only appears on the undead is his Gewei was stiff in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" he asked softly, "A sheep?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I got it on the side of the road," said the lady. "It's so cute, so I want you to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband showed a A stiff smile: "Yes," he said. "It's really cute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity that it already has a master." The lady opened her fur. Let your husband see the collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can give him some..." Her husband said absently, when his fingers came over, Ingway would use all the self-control Can you not bite it, no, it's not good... "Mystery?" He said: "It seems that you have an unusual master, lamb. But it doesn't matter, you can have it, my love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
