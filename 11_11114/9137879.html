He knew that these barbarians were slaves to the leader of the Legion. They accepted the dispatch of the master and were destroyed in each. Looking for valuable things in the city, but in his opinion, most of them are human beings. "It’s just a few women," he said slyly. "Close your eyes and pretend that you haven't done it." He is half threatened and compromised. Say, "What do you want, gold coins? Or potions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want what my host needs." Musa said, while naked/naked / Naked with the estimated look at the mother and daughter, and the baby. The Dragon Knights followed and looked at the past: "I don't think they are very valuable things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women can only get pregnant in a month," Musa Said: "They have always been short of goods, and babies," he shook his head. "Is there a better sacrifice than this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragon Knight Admit this, but he still wants to say something, but before that, Moussa calmly straightened his body and opened the wide coat on his body. "Name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Knight is reluctant to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, people want to sigh more, the inside of this barbarian’s coat is equipped with something like a reel, or To be correct, it is the reel belt. He draws one of the numbers and opens it. The scroll does not depict the mysterious magic text or the important information, or the heartbreaking poetry. It is said that it is simply the embodiment of the copper stink, because it records the name of the debtor, the number of debts and the date of return of the debtor. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moussa has already sorted the first letter of the name as indicated by the Dark Dragons when they transcribed them, so there is no need to For a long time, he took out the volume belonging to the knight from inside. He looked at it and then looked up with pity: "You know that you still owe one thousand five hundred gold coins."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1,500 gold coins only," said the Dragon Knight, annoyed: "I have gems and pearls to pay for this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm," Moussa said happily. "That would be great." He didn't lift his head. He leaned over and hooked up the one that was thrown as a spear. When the money bag came over and the money bag arrived, Moussa smelled a strong bloody sigh. He used his toes to think about the circumstances under which he left the original owner, but as a looting lord in the desert. For the team's living robber, his moral sense is not strong enough to cause discomfort. He hangs the money bag on his belt and then smokes it. A charcoal pen, the one that the dragon tooth knight owed: "So," he said with a brazen voice: "Do you still need a little good quality that we provide? Guaranteed to be pure and pure, one can be awkward God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a veritable scorpion, and the dragon tooth knight looks gloomyly recalling that his mount was rolling around and twitching after smelling the herbs. Howling and rushing to the sky, rushing to the tent, rushing to the scene of himself and the ground, of course he wants to refuse, but his mount has already excitedly raised his head. "When?" The sweet voice was too loud to say: "Isn't that the herb sold out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before seeing the venerable Red Dragon," Moussa said: "We still have one day and two nights of leisure time. In order to alleviate your exhaustion and tense spirit, my master has traded ten pounds of good herbs from the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten pounds! Then we will have a grand banquet," Eagle The first lion beast slaps a few wings in a row and makes it dusty: "I just can't wait, dear," it called his knight. "What are we still doing here? We should return as soon as possible. I am worried about my brothers...that is a group of disgusting idiots!"dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of Dragons obviously endured a bit: "You are not Want to eat that baby?" He whispered, body, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
