			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the drive of fear and horror, Gülen made a few gestures subconsciously - he was asking: "Can he see us?" - they It is still in a closed martyrdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words that are "spoken" with their fingers are common to thieves, and red robes and grey robes are often mixed with them when they are still apprentices, so there are also It is understood that when he realizes that he is standing in front of him not his usual caster companion but a group of people opposite him, the wizard who has done a lot of white robe style actually responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did I see you," said the caster: "How did he see you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has taken out the fluorite brooch. The brooch was originally hidden to avoid being discovered by the enemy. Now it is obviously no longer necessary. He and the trained thief can provide weak rot in only the moss. Seeing Kreima in the case of light, others can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-eyed caster gently nodded to Kerry Ben, taking a circular inscription from the pocket of the square, A person with no magic can think of it as a very beautiful pendant. Its bottom plate is Mithril. The lines are intertwined with the runes, showing the shape of Anglos, which is the shape of the silver crown. Amethyst (toxin removal), amber (immune rickets), jade (enhanced vitality) and chalcedony (avoiding undead) - the caster throws it at the foot of the crowd without hesitation as the starting microscopic array The crystal is broken first, and then there are three other precious minerals. Their magical power flows along the characters and lines. The sparkling brilliant light illuminates the eyes of the elves and humans. The gentle warmth is as light as the rain in the summer. Slowly flowed into their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhaustion and pain disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei wants to talk, Krimaar puts his index finger and puts it in front of his lips. He said in a clear lip: "Ready to fight." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin just pulled out the wide sword from behind, and the rock walls behind them melted like the snow under the winter - now they There is only a huge array of holes between the biggest enemy, and the array can be said to be drawn close to the bottom of the nearly circular cave. It does not leave much room for action. No one dares to step on the lines that seem to be still flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half dragon in the center of the squad also thought so. He noticed that there was a white robe among these people, but he did not care at all, at least. He is doing this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removing scales and tails, curved nails, and tall and strong beyond humans, looks like a half-dragon with the same beautiful human male standing up , fascinated to explore the head. Sniffing the air: "An elf," he said sweetly and yearning: "How full of vitality! Better than a village, a city, a weak and filthy human being is completely incomparable - I have not eaten an elf for a long time, They are very difficult..." He put out his tongue, first licking his forehead and licking his lower jaw. The deep red tongue is divided into two strands like a snake. Each strand can freely turn in different directions: "But "It’s weird." He whispered: "There is better, better, better than the elves - the half-elves of the black hair, someone told you how wonderful it smells... too weird, The bottomless abyss is down, you should be the most inferior of the mixed blood, but your vitality is the strongest of them, I can't wait to sip your blood - I swear I won't waste your one A minute..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan knows that it is stupid to be influenced by the enemy’s speech in this critical moment, but he still has control over it. A glance at the Master behind Birdwin, the Master is finished The indifferent. It was Birdwin who showed a real anger when he heard that the half dragon wanted to swallow his companion. He took the wide sword and took a step forward. The half-dragon scorned and cruelly smirked, waving his fingers, and the bats hanging at the top of the cave opened their blood-red eyes. They were crowded and squeaky, as if they were always at their disposal to their prey. - They are large enough to bury them all in a living grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but for the half-long expectations. After a step forward, Birdwin turned to the right and took two steps to reveal the caster behind him, and the caster had already held a wand in his hand. When he saw him in Half Dragon, he Broke the wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent magical energy bursts from the ends of the wand's break, causing a great explosion, and the flames and smoke engulf all the holes still in the cave. biological. The Lich's footsteps moved lightly, and just hiding behind Birdwin was in the dark to record the scope of the array - his memory repeatedly praised by the mentor played a bigger role than the wand and the reel - Birdwin made a loud sound The roar, the sound of the wide sword sniper mixed with the sound of Kerry’s bow and arrow breaking through the air, and the thieves climbing the rock wall, the tiny stone fragments that his foot kicked hit the ground, Mei Mi is the quickest among them. She returned to the shadows without notice before Kremar took action. She was praying that the former undead only hoped she could judge correctly and get a Effective magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-dragon laughed, he threw lightning, and the lightning creaked to disperse the smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin saw his enemies, a field scorpion that was as big as an adult male, covered with a camouflage like a tumor and a tentacles. Its shell is hard like steel, and the sharp thorn is like a sword. The hunter who has lived in the forest for more than ten years is very familiar with this insect. It is only as big as a nail and can be crushed. It's not a good thing to deal with - its venom can melt the skin and muscles, let them liquefy for it to suck, often drunk or weak people fall down in the forest and the wild, bite by it Injury to the face, the damage they cause, even the treatments that the priest casts are sometimes difficult to ensure healing. Birdwin has seen people walking around with scars and holes on his face more than once. Maybe no one can think of this. The terrible wounds were caused by just one or two small bugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they get into your ears and nose, the consequences are even more serious, and people often die inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it’s a thousand times bigger than the original, and Birdwin doesn’t want to know what else he can leave after being bitten by it. It’s fortunate. It was the spell cast by Cremal's rune plate that restored his power and energy, and made him smart. Otherwise, he might have been caught at the moment he just happened - he stabbed the monster that was converted from Tian Hao. But the camouflage on it played the role of armor, and Baldwin turned around it, cutting it to its foot joints, and the monster's defense clearly did not extend to it. It screamed screamingly, but nothing could prevent the former paladin from accurately cutting off the hard, fragile carapace at the joint, and the white, stinking juice spewed out of the mouth of the field. Like a small fountain, Birdwin's wide sword touched a little and was eroded with several depressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin took a step back and threw the overwhelmed wide sword to Tian Hao, who gnawed bite. Crazy to chew, the pieces of steel fell from the bottom of the floor, and Baldwin's fingers were placed on the belt, pulling out the double-edged axe that Kerry had given him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is facing a group of velvet moths, only one-fifth of the ridges, but there are hundreds of them, they are gray, in The smoke is almost indistinguishable, and the wings and hairs are covered with toxic scales, if not the magical power of toxins contained in the amethyst on the rune. They are now at least half of the staff - but even if the scales don't work, their tough and sharp mouthpieces threaten the elves' lives - the elf shoots his arrows one by one, and the poisonous moths are more embarrassing. The few who hid behind the companion, or turned back to him, wanted to attack the other worms while they were concentrating on the other worms, but they should not forget that there is still a caster, and Kremar tears open one. The scrolls, the icy air flow swept through, and the frozen insects fell on the ground and immediately shattered into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not a white robe," said the semi-dragon curiously. "Would you wear a white robe to confuse your enemies? The god allowed?" He had already noticed the power attached to the white robe. Even if you can't, it's not afraid of the flames, and it's not afraid of the poison. It can also be seen as a clue: "Other mages also recognize that the main material plane is really strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich looked at him and cast a spell. This spell caused a cockroach that was about to climb to the location of Plume to fall off the rock wall. It writhed and spit out its internal organs from the mouthparts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the undead did not observe the situation, he immediately tore a reel, the spell in the reel forced the half dragon to interrupt his spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many spells do you have?" Half Dragon asks: "How many spells did you use over the way? Is the spell you prepared suitable for the present situation? Poor "Little Master," he said slyly. "You have a good mentor. Look at how much he has prepared for you, but unfortunately, they can't save your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar's answer is a broken wand - the spell in the wand smashes the half-dragon's body - an illusory image, the half-dragon makes a sound in another place, it sounds like he has nothing hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can see how many magical appliances you have," said Half Dragon. "You are very rare. I will put your soul into the gem." Take it to your tutor, I will slowly eat you, from your skin, your flesh, your bones and your internal organs, to the bottomless abyss, you will be conscious at the last moment, I I will put my head to the end, listen to your mourning and eat, the sound of your singing spell is beautiful, it should be good when it is miserable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I It’s just a strange thing,” said the Lich. “Why do I only see all kinds of bugs?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you feel bored?” Unexpectedly, he didn't make an order or make a gesture, but the bats who were eager to try seemed to finally get permission, and they couldn't wait to join the battle. Birdwin made a roar: "Damn," he shouted. : "I feel enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only these," the Lich is calm and somewhat disappointed "Bats - the hybrid of the dragon and the devil's hybrids should have more than that - your bad devils? Your little devils? And those red robes or gray robes that are willing to become servants?" Why... until now, I only saw one of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You asked me how many spells, half dragons," the Lich continued. "I also want to ask how much power you have. What is your sacrifice for?" A village has only 30 households. Hundreds of people, all mortals, and a priest of weak Hammer, are so pitiful, how much can they provide? You can't even summon a big demon or a devil, let alone with him. Trading, or do you do it for other reasons? But as I said, you can get too little...you can hardly do anything."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking forward to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked, at the same time, a more intense volatility than before was interrupted All the battles - the caves are shaking, the bats and bugs are falling from the air, the elves and the former paladins fall on the cold rocks, and the thieves are thrown hundreds of feet away by a stout dragon tail - almost Directly picked up on a prominent triangular stone, if not the caster timely cast a suitable Spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fragmented rune plate lies alone in the corner of the circle. Anyone, even if he has no idea of ​​magic, can see that it is perfect. The squad lacks a corner, a small horn, but the elf can feel that the magical power of the flow is contained, delayed, and it accumulates in the broken place, irritating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it for this?" Half Dragon said: "I can fix it at any time, after tearing you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich smiled slightly: "I met a locust mage before." He said: "I have a little doubt after defeating it, because here was a lich, a lich, Even if he has been destroyed, his remaining pieces should not be so weak. Moreover, on the way I came, I encountered too few grievances and monsters. I didn’t even see the magic image. Are those white robes destroying and purifying too much here? No, they are leaving in a hurry. They didn’t search the entire underground palace to make sure there are no after-effects. The reason is not known, but what they left behind. It should be more - so I am guessing, is there a kind of existence that has already fought with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The existence has eliminated most of the The residual force of the deceased took away what he wanted. But he did not leave because he could not Open - he was injured - he set up offering games, by virtue of the village wanted to get a human can make him whole energy "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
