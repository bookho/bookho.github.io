There are rooms in the monastery for people who come to pilgrimage and live with the lifelong monks. There was only one chair in the room, the bed, the monks had a small table in the room, they sat down at the small table, the bishop of Perugia occupied the narrow bed, and Piccolo used it. a chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A monk came with two not-so-luxury nightingales, a few slices of sweet ginger for appetizers, cabbage soup, creamy squid, and old age. The cheese is finished, except for the time, this meal is not too picky during the Lent: "The brothers who come from afar," Bishop Perugia puts a piece of sweet ginger in his mouth. Asked: "Are they all arranged properly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is in order," said the deacon. "We have prepared bath tubs and bread for them." , salt and water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bathtub?" said Picromini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Bishop Perugia chewed sweet ginger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I remember correctly," Piccolomini said, "St. Francis has made it clear that 'dirty' also has God. One of the sexual markers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk looked at the pilgrim with uneasiness, and Piccolo was only concentrating on immersing a piece of bread into the cabbage Soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "St. Francis has said that our sisters of water are so respectful, clean, and precious." Bishop Perugia said carelessly: " We cleaned our bodies with our sisters of water and followed his teachings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and glanced at the corner of the room. The monk, "Yes, child," said the bishop. "You can go back to your room. We will chanting each other for each other, just as we were in Rome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young monk stood up immediately. He is not the kind of devout person who for the sake of concealment for the rest of his life. The opportunity to serve both bishops is also the same. Extremely rare, but he knew that there might be something that could not be heard by a normal monk like him, so he immediately quits the room docilely, leaving only Piccolo and the bishop of Perugia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you may be able to tell me." Bishop Perugia said, "Who is that child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can start reading the scriptures," Pique Romini said: "The Adrian brothers." Adrian was the name of the laity of Bishop Perugia, when they were still at the Roman Theological Seminary, young and innocent, bloody and reckless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a secret, right?" said Bishop Perugia, as if he had never heard anything from his classmates: "We can trade You tell me, I also tell you that it may not be significant, but I promise that you will not owe my debts or be my creditors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The child you brought..." Bishop Perugia said: "Is it a hostage? Or a gift? Or is it another illegitimate child? The Romans have said that you already have twelve illegitimate children, just like Jesus Christ. There are as many disciples."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Receive the embarrassing statement, you know that I have no illegitimate children and no mistresses," said Picromini. He is not the kind of person who will treat himself as harsh as a monk, but he is not good at chasing sluts and sly skirts like Roman priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s fine to let people talk like this," said Bishop Perugia. "The crimson (the cardinal is dressed in color) or white (the Pope's clothing color) There are no one or two children hidden under the long coat. The true holy people are on parchment and marble. Don’t let them think that you will be a threat.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Threats?" Piccomini looked up: "I am not even a cardinal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be." Bishop Perugia Say, "You are a Piccolo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Picromini, whose key moment is thousands of miles away."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you are not ignorant of Rome." Bishop Perugia said that he crossed his hands with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our Father is in jeopardy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can last for a few months." Bishop Perugia said: "Possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is the atmosphere in Rome already getting nervous?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Some cardinals are collecting gold, what do you think?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picolomini reveals a sardonic smile: "In fact, I think they can use the dice to elect the pope," he said with less respect: "Who did the pope? I will reward each cardinal. "He spreads his hand: "It is fair and reasonable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have prepared a lot of money "Perugia said: "Maybe you can change the color of your clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can be a bit difficult," Picromini said: "Is it still? Will someone voluntarily give up teaching?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe someone will suddenly go crazy," Bishop Perugia said with sincerity: "But Picromi Ni, I want to go back to Rome. I don't want to stay in this position until I am old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your idea value Dear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what about you?" Bishop Perugia asked: "What about you, you? Piccolo, listen to this illustrious Surname, you are the nephew of Pius II, the 22nd is the bishop, and allows you to inherit the name and family emblem of the Picromini family. You have served in no less than three most important positions, except your uncle. You have also taken care of Paul II's daily diet. He trusts you so much, loves you, regards you as his right arm, if not Francesco de la Lovere..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Undoubtedly," Piccolo said calmly: "He knows more about how to bribe and temptation than I do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because you are still hesitant," said Bishop Perugia, dissatisfied. "You could have made a career."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, okay," said Picromini. "I know what you think. If so, you can talk about what I need to do for you." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not so utilitarian," Bishop Perugia said bluntly: "But yes, yes, I really need yours." Help." He stood up and opened the door and looked out: "Let the prince of Valencia come here. He said to the monks waiting outside the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the priest of Valencia appeared in front of the two, so that Picromini could not help but be surprised that he was still only a child. "Is Rome already fallen like this?" He said: "One Can a child become a priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter," Bishop Perugia clap his hands: "There are still babies or abdomen in the world." The fetus becomes a duke or a king, a priest, eight years old, nine years old, ten years old? What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How old?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, eight years old." Bishop Perugia said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picolomini grabbed the linen under the plate and wiped his hand. The beeswax candle lit the room like a white, he could find all The details - if the child is ten years old, some people will believe it. After all, his face and body have been separated from the child's stage. His hair is dark brown and only has a little bit of curl at the end. His eyes are the same color as his hair. His calmness is like an adult monk. His standing is elegant and dignified, his skin is white, and he is happy when he sees it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there are still some places on the angelic face that make Picromini feel familiar, he looks to his classmates, then closes his eyes quickly After a while, this faculty is not eye-catching, but not every bishop can ask for an eight-year-old child. This person and the price can be put into the child's adulthood. After all, the child is still It is quite common for a teenager to die in the middle. Once the beneficiary has died, all the ideas and expectations related to him can only be said to be castles in the air. It can only be said that this child is willing to let people take this risk for him. Although Cromini’s uncle also loved him very much, he was not so crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valencia, the parish of Spain, Ha, Rome, don’t you have a Spanish cardinal? Piccolomini finally remembers where he saw it. This face, Rodriguez Borgia, he is eight years older than Picromini, but he is one hundred times shameless than the latter. Everyone knows that he and his lover are open to the public. And gave birth to four or five children, and now one of them is standing in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rodriguez Borgia," said Picromini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Perugia nodded cautiously, "Come to us." He said to the child with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Borgia wants the supreme position." Picromini said, looking at Borgia's face with his sharp eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who doesn't want it?" said Bishop Perugia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His odds are small," said Picromini. "His enemy is Giuliano de la Lovere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So far, no two identical surnames have been allowed to appear consecutively on the pope's lineage, and he cannot become a pope."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Pope. The Lovere is only forty-one years old this year, he can wait for the first class," Picromini said: "It seems that this Rome will The turmoil continues - so Borgia does not even dare to keep his family in Rome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are still small," said Bishop Perugia "The smallest one is only two years old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He entrusted one of his sons to you," Piccomini said: "My classmates I really didn't think that you deserve to be so trusted. Is it that St. Francis shows another miracle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can leave. "Bishop Perugia turned his head to the small Gorgias said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Valencia gave a ceremony to the two bishops and left the room. During the whole process, he did not rush to interject and express his opinion. There is no panic and anger, and the ability to control the body and emotions is obviously more than many adults, a Borgia, Picromini, if Rodriguez Borgia can really If you wish to become a pope, this child will become the sharpest knife he has stabbed at the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you can talk about what you want me to do," said Picromini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Perugia licked his neck. "You have twenty-five followers," he said. "Not the smallest one."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picolomoni raised his eyebrows dangerously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One more should be no one to pay attention," Perugia said with a brazen shame: "Or stay one less, St. Franciscan monastery internal school (Note: Refers to preparation The vacancy worth of a priestly student is worth one hundred Florin gold coins, equivalent to three good stallions, and is constantly rising, given that the crimson vest is so expensive, maybe tomorrow It is equivalent to ten small stallions." He pinched a small insect caught in the folds of his neck and groaned: "I think someone will be willing to exchange with Little Borgia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How much did Rodriguez Borgia give you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do you want money, or a vineyard? Or a church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Perugia looked up at the beam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vineyard," he said: "I guess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I want it One-third of the proceeds," Piccomini took a sip of water in a wooden cup, adding honey to it: "And time until the pope is elected."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing wrong with a Borgia disciple," said Bishop Perugia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But he is not my debt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So who is your debt? Bishop Perugia asked: "Medic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picolomini's eyes suddenly became severe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait...etc," Bishop Perugia raised his hands. "This is just a simple logical topic. My old classmate, my class." Not as bad as you thought - when was the child born, not after 1478 or after 1478, and what happened in 1478? We all know that the Medici family was almost endangered by the Pach family. It is said that Lorenzo de Medici escaped into the sacred room and was lucky to be spared - then I remember that just before that day, I received your letter, you told me that you should be the Archbishop of Pisa Salvia’s invitation to the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Florence presided over the first weekday mass after the resurrection of the Lord’s Day and the appreciation of the holy things...” He laughed awkwardly when he said, “Lorenzo is poisoned, No, don't ask me how I know, but Piccolo, our teacher once said that your medical skills are like a wizard. It's you, not someone else who makes Medici everyone. He has returned to his life and can stand in the next three days. Get up and preside over the revenge against the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," he continued: "West Scott IV announced the confiscation of the Medici family in Rome. All the property, and expelled Lorenzo and the court members of the whole of Florence, and claimed to be able to usurp the teachings of Florence, who accompanied Lorenzo to Naples, convinced the king of Naples, Ferdinand I, to abandon him. With the covenant of Siscott IV, and become a friend with Medici? Without you, I doubt whether Lorenzo de Medici can enter the Berdych Palace."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
