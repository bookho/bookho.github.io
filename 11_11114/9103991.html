Of course, it is not an island. It may be bigger than the island in the never-night sea. The surface is uneven, and there are constantly thick transparent liquids from tiny holes. Overflowing, the Alatiti people put those high heats that have faded away, but the back and the abdomen are still a little festering humans, constantly picking up those precious mucus with their fingers and applying them to the body of the latter. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third day that Perant has found the end of the spear. It is worthy of their luck. The power of the spear is really able to dispel the sea ghost. The shadows brought by mankind - the people of Nanuk have not gone far. Once the disease is under control, they can't wait to return to their loved ones. The head that Perant has found has survived in the night. For hundreds of years, although it is not as old as an elf, it is already a very, very, very old elder for ordinary heads and humans, and it is very tolerant and gentle. It not only allows elves. Extracting its blood, and willing to swim into the shallow sea with the elves. The shallow sea is dangerous for many large sea creatures. Because there is no water support, they can't get rid of the grounding difficulties with their own muscles and bones. Even if this spear tail is already a magic. Creature, but it has no wings and no feet, and human weapons can also harm it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it still follows Perant, and it doesn't mind treating humans as long as they are willing to give it enough fish. After all, it needs to stay here. It’s not a day or two. It’s hunting almost every moment. After all, its body is too big. In order to maintain its own life, it can only take a small break occasionally—that is, Ordinary head lice often do - floating Shanghai noodles and basking in the sun. Now it can comfortably basking in the sun, although the sun is not too strong at this time, but at least it can bring meager warmth, but when it turns over, pay attention to the humans on the body, they are a bit stupid, no Like the seabirds, seals and sea turtles, they will see a slight precursor and will quickly slip away. Once, it almost made the human body almost fall into the ice and feed the white krill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant walks on the body of the spear, and the head is as fine as the grain-like scales on the tail of the spear. It’s the rocks on the beach. Several Alati people are rowing their seals and kayaking on the edge of a protruding “stone”. It’s also a place that no one else dares to approach, because it’s the spear tail. The head of the skull, its large crotch is like a cowhide tent that can hold twenty people. It is two water-like eyes, covered with a translucent soft film, and its mouth is open. It is entirely possible to swallow the boat of the Alatihi people, and the person standing on the boat is the three sons of Nanuk. They take turns to pierce the caught big fish and send it to the mouth of the head. At first they were worried that their spears would stab the head of the head and make it angry, but after two or three times they found that the tongue of the head was rubbing against the tip of the black iron. It is the weapon of another steel in the fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head bang suddenly moved, and all the Alati people could feel the "ground" violently shaking and shaking. Nanuk glanced at the druid and found that it was just a head screaming with the Son of Nature. It was - it erected its pectoral fins, and the shadow of the pectoral fins shrouded the druid all at once. Perant reached out and gently grasped one of the fin tips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please," Druid said softly, "My friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pectoral fin can be said to be gently shaken a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shaman told me to tell you." Nanuk’s eldest son said that he had lost a child before the fetus, but his lover is still there. It’s already very lucky. “He found the tulip tribe, they are willing to give fifty people.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perran features nod: “Plus your Fifty people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One hundred people can build the big boat you need in five days," said Nanuk’s eldest son, although the tulip The Alati people have to split half of their black iron, but there has never been a war between the Alati people. They are not worried that these black irons will turn into arrows and swords piercing their chests. And if there are no 50 people in the Tuhua tribe, they can't complete the exchange, and with the seals of the Tuhua tribe, they can make the children of nature and the big ships needed by their companions better and more beautiful - this It’s the only thing they can do now, and his father’s promise on behalf of the tribe will always be good. Any sub-human nature and the natural son around, but these did not fully repay the favor they have been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people of the Tuhua tribe will come after a round of flowers," Shaman said. In his igloo, a lichens that will bloom small white flowers can be raised. This lichens can last for up to eight months in a warm environment. The flowers are white and open, and the night is closed. When the Alati people need it. "Precise" time, or when you are in the night and the eternal time, you will observe this flower, but in the tribe of the Alati, you must keep the flower open for a long time. The temperature, and only the shaman's igloo, in his igloo, the seals and whales are always scarce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we still need whale bones." Shaman said, in fact, Nanuk believes that they are better able to hunt a seal group so that the big ship can get a new seal skin, but the shaman sternly screams He, although Nanuk only wants to pay off the debt, but to hunt more seals for the big ship, this greedy behavior will only make the Son of Nature even more angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sea of ​​the night and the sea of ​​the North is not affiliated with the Alati." Shaman said: "It also belongs to every one that lives here." Creatures, whales, seals, fish, white krill, every generation of Alatiti, this is the case, we capture them, eat their meat, drink their blood and fat, peel off their fur, wait for us to die Our bodies will be thrown into the sea and become their food. This is the purpose of the god of the North, Wulou Tiru. We are no more intelligent than any whale, any seal, or any fish. Noble, more great, we are the same as them. Remember, Nanuk, this is the key point for the Alatisites to thrive in this land, more than the arrows and spears of the black iron More important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little episode, Perant, knows nothing, he only knows that the Alatis may remove some of their own boats to supplement The seals required for the big ship, but the shaman also said that the hunting in the extreme season will They add more sealskin, and some people were injured, and the short-term but also less than their ship, now the only remaining question is only required to ship whale bone only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whale bones are not a problem," Perant said. "My new friend told me that there are an ancient trench just a few hundred miles away. There are whale bones there, but they were abandoned by the whales long ago, so the new whales may not be able to know where they are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big guy?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Isn’t it?” Perant said that in the night of the night, it’s hard to find a milder creature than the head lice. Especially the spear tail he found, the huge body and the identity of the magic creation are destined to be difficult for other creatures to threaten it, so its temperament is even better than the average head lice, and it is against humans. Miraculously no stranger, it tells the Druid that it has seen "human beings" with the same ears as him. When it was not that big, their ships sank in the storm, after the storm They couldn’t wait to float the head of the sun in Shanghai and they were treated as a broken hull. Only then did they find that they were not, and the good-tempered heads let them spend a leisurely time on their backs. In return, they fished. Give it to the head, which is why it knows how to allow humans to climb on their bodies and change fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are you going to go?" Shaman asked, "Do you need our warriors?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant shakes his head and reaches thousands of feet deep under the sea. Even if he can cast spells to breathe, they can't afford the weight of sea water on them, but he really is not prepared to sneak into the deep sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go with Kremar," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When Kerry found Kremar, he sat alone on the black rock, with Kerry's quiver on his side, and the magic silver arrow floating on the magical light, which was busy with him— - White, let's just say that, under the torture of the undead, even if there is no day and night, you don't need to check the Glan's bluff from the owner of the blunt tavern in Jianjian Port. The compensation fell into the magical tools in their hands, and he knew that he spent nearly seven small squares on these arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves walked silently, their steps were lighter than Gülen as a thief, even if they were full of moss, they walked on the stone It is still like walking on a flat, clean carpet. Kerry Ben walked behind the black-haired spellcaster and looked down at him with a funny smile. He found that the caster had two distinct spins on his head. The Seris said that people with two spins would be extraordinarily smart. I don't know if this sentence applies to non-Serris, but he always feels that as a caster, Crimal is qualified or even excellent, but he is occasionally a bit stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gray butterfly flies over the sea breeze, perhaps the caster’s black hair gives it some illusion, it puts its wings and falls In the middle of the two spins, the tentacles are trying to find some dew and pollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf stretched out his hands and curled up a warm dome, covering the butterfly with imaginary wings - the wings of the butterfly are very fragile if you pinch If you live with it or swat with your palm, even if it is released, the butterfly will not be able to continue flying because of the broken wings, and then be preyed or die because of weakness. After feeling the slight itching caused by the butterfly's foot, Kerry has taken back his hands and opened it to the black-haired spellcaster who turned his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is there a butterfly here too?” The soul of the alien world said with amazement: “So cold, so deserted place?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butterfly is not as you see it. Fragile," Kerry Bun asked the butterfly who didn't want to leave his palm. He touched the bottle of snow honey from the side, poured a drop of snow honey in his palm, and the gray butterfly immediately ate with great concentration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This butterfly needs to be hidden on the ground for 14 years to become a butterfly." Elf Ranger said, "in human computing and it can be in the air." In terms of the proportion of time spent flying, she has to lie in the underground for thousands of years to come to the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so hard." The black-haired caster said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, and there are also predators here, there will be squally winds, there will be heavy rain, even if you can escape all of the above, they only have fifty days. In less than a time, you can find a partner and have children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Maybe it was caught by the sea breeze, its wings can not compete with the sea breeze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Involuntarily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is very lucky, it met you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fate is like this," Kerry said. "It's not always bitter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just talking to them When the gray butterfly had finished eating the snow honey given by the elf, Kerry had raised his palm: "Go," he said to the butterfly: "Go, go find your people, here is not what you should stay." Place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&& Perhaps the butterfly is really reluctant to leave this warm and sweet place, but as the elf said, it is impossible to fight against the winds of the sea. The sea breeze rolls it up and can take it away, but let The elf was able to smile. The strength of its wings was much stronger than before. The sea breeze was able to take it away, but it was clearly able to control its direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
