The last two are because there are modifications and agreed time, so I have to put a chapter out first. thanks for your support! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prelude<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper's unusual anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, the reaper born in the Chaos Sea has an undead creature that can accommodate a small giant family in the skeleton. The chief scorpion of the face exists, they are immune to mental attacks, and most of the spell damage is reduced, the power is infinite, the movement is agile, and the most important thing is that they can easily appear in the unpredictable chaos in the sea without locking the force field. Every place... looking for any neck that fits the invisible python, any creature that is attacked by a chaotic weapon made to break the damage reduction will be constantly under the shock of chaotic power. Painful suffering... until it is abandoned because of intolerance, it is a part of chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the darlings of these chaotic seas will rarely encounter such a tough enemy, a paladin wearing a rough gray cloak, perhaps because of the long stay in the Chaos Sea. For a period of time, the clothes on his body have been broken. The only equipment is the dull but tight chain, and the unadorned sword, but this does not affect his high fighting will and strong combat effectiveness. . Obviously, the double-edged sword, which is more reliable than the appearance, has repeatedly hesitated to slap the sickle that is smashing with ash, and the number of the wounds is increasing as the change of the chaotic sea. The fearless outsiders make more A small number of small wounds accumulate on the white skeleton, although some of them are restored to their original state, but more cracks are connected together and form a dangerous fine net... The pale bones make ominous sputum, and the reaper feels Fear often feels like this is what they give to others. The premonition of demise made him retreat, but hesitated because it was forced by the Chaos Sea to execute a distorted order to declare a lawful biological death. Finally, it was a weak, strange, crying voice that made a decision for him. The reaper of Entropy gave up its mission and launched a plane-to-face transmission that was only used once a day and disappeared into the enemy who was too enthusiastic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin whispered, dispelling the negative effects of the reaper’s last long, cold, vicious breath, and then he had to face up to nothing here. One of the most difficult things in the impossible plane is more than five hundred giant scorpions. A chaotic fluid is produced from the pebbles of this chaotic sea native. The giant python can recognize these fluids and flow upwards, gather around the spawning to lay eggs and fertilize, and their will even gradually expand a large tabletop pebbles into a continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the actions of the giants sometimes turn the chaotic fluids that grow with the pebbles into huge chaotic storms. The worst part is that the giant cockroaches of death will become the guards of the pebbles, stubborn, brave, and hard to destroy. The stone guards will shred any creature or non-nature that dares to harm the source of the storm with a violent hurricane, countless flames, ashes, gravel, gravel, hail, and even energy condensation... from this basic On the small continent that has already become a self-contained system, the lawmakers squirming out like a grand multi-material meteor shower with a grand, but upside-down order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, the frenzied giant breeding ground smashed a piece of solitary sea like a real stone and quickly left, like the choppy airflow aftermath After a period of time, it completely dissipated. It left only a large strip of areas that looked very clean compared to other places in this chaotic plane. Although it will soon be filled with more chaotic substances, It now looks very similar to a trace of a finger on a dusty table, and it is precisely because of this that the only thing that stays in it is particularly eye-catching. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a small, quiet, comfortable, but dark space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original face with a smile instantly became serious. The paladin burned a pure flame, especially the forehead, as if there was a sun in the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to hold his arm has relaxed, and before the wide cuffs of the gray robes hang down again, the paladus’s sharp vision has seen the pale hand bones. Its shape is similar to humans, but it is obvious that the human finger phalanx has only three knots at most, instead of the four knots he sees now, which means that the undead creatures in front of them are transformed by elves or half-elves that are more focused on the elves. Cheng Cheng, this discovery will be even amazed by the gods. Since the destruction of the magic empire, almost no lich has been seen in the transformation of the elves, even if the elves are tempted by the devil and degenerate, how strange the noun, related The written record is probably only the oldest and most secretive on the mainland, and can be found in several libraries protected by semi-stagnant time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It silently retreats into the darkness that is not affected by the light, and the outline of the white skull that is slightly lifted is clearly clear in the shadow of the hood." He "gaps at the light, and does not seem to hate something that can no longer be reached like other undead creatures... Subtle, fleeting mood swings are sharply captured by the Paladins without greed, no hatred, no anger, no, Peaceful and soft, except for the child's vivid curiosity and eagerness to try, if not the pure negative energy that can almost condense into a solid, the rescued person almost thinks that there is a hidden in the decaying and filthy bones. It is absolutely impossible for a pure soul to be polluted by sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter what you are holding out for," the paladin said seriously. "In the name of Tyre, I swear you will receive my thanks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the empty eyes of the undead, the tiny red light spots jumped. The paladin can feel the joyful emotions flowing through his body. The lich is still very young. He doesn’t even know how to hide himself. The feelings, or rather, the feelings, the old warriors cherish his wrong choices, the eyes are more determined: "Speak your request." Then, I will reach your wishes in the name of Tyre, then, Free your soul that has not completely fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull in the hood turned left and right, and the skeleton stepped back: "Hey," he said at a loss: "Required?... Hey, Say, thank you?” dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then his body glows white, more bleak than the Paladin, but softer Some, sudden changes caused the lich to be scared, the airflow in the narrow space became tense, and the action of the paladin was controlled like a shackle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin’s old face reveals an incredible expression, yes, a covert, simple detection, just to make sure that you are not being lichled The lie is misleading or exploited, but even he did not expect that there will be an undead creature, pure, not for any purpose to save life other than himself, which almost subverts the definition of the lich for thousands of years. Whether it is the nine-story hell of Bata or the blessing of the region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light that surges on the paladin is rapidly expanding, his figure becomes taller, hey, the radiance is daunting, and finally The appearance of the show makes the Lich unable to stop the turmoil in the wind, the protector of the commander, the incarnation of the god of justice and justice, his thunder-like voice falling from the top like a solid lava in the sorcerer skull Above: "In the name of the God of God, you will be redeemed for your selfless charity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between the upper and lower jaw bones of the bone shelf is slow Slowly increase, if he is still a personal class, we may describe it as "a mouth can be stuffed into a dragon egg." Salvation, of course, he knows what "redemption" means, and can spell it perfectly and read them, but the relationship between this word and him should stop here, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that fate has fallen into complete hysteria like the Chaos Sea. The Lich’s sorrow and overwhelming are interpreted by Tyre’s incarnation as the resilience and shock of returning to the light. The resulting reaction can't be done. He solemnly lifts the only remaining arm. The god of justice is warm and dignified. The power that cannot be disobeyed is like the overturned sea pressing against the body of the undead. The positive energy contained in it snarls the witch. All the negative energy in the demon has been expelled, and then they have succeeded in replacing their work. At the same time, the gemstones that are thousands of miles away are twisted, broken, and turned into whiteflies, and the nature of life that is carefully hidden inside is forced. Restored to your own body, the tough check-up version that was accepted at the time of death, once again joyfully descended under the call of the gods, began to slowly eat away the will and spirit of the Lich... The rare second experience, the sorcerer miss you. The inexplicable pain is entangled in every memory and thought in hundreds of years, tapping, grinding, carefully looking for any gaps that may exist, can't get rid of, can't stand it... until all the tests have finished perfectly, The undead are still doing their best, using the body and soul to make the most tragic scream. He feels that there is a voice around him asking him to stop, but the lich is not negligent to ignore, although he knows that it is too long and profound. Torture is indeed over, but in any case, as an evil undead, it is unreasonable not to collect some interest for the harm and torture that I have suffered... As for whether the other party should be responsible for his suffering, well...this is not in the lich Consider the scope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes _ oh, he now has eyes, eye walls, intraocular cavity and contents, nerves, blood vessels, and eyelids that protect them, eyelashes are all available, the lich has blinked, the scene in front is blurred Become clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only tranquil and safe place in the Chaos Sea, the Zen Temple of the Seris, the distinctive blue-gray rock and the simple and clean room told him Where the air is flowing, the lich is aware that he is breathing instinctively, the heart is beating regularly, and the blood flows in the blood vessels. Dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some strangely controlling the body to sit up, he found himself wearing a pure white fine linen robes, which is Tyre’s The priest's favorite kind, there is still a weak magical power of Tyre, you should also engrave a balance or warhammer on my forehead (Tell's holy emblem is a balanced balance placed on the warhammer) In order to better reflect the value of this souvenir for the first time, perhaps the last chaos before, during and after your birth! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secondary bag for hiding important items is also hung in the old position on the waist side, and the protective amber ring on the little finger that is not far away is still intact. The crown of black opal kept the original invisible state stuck on the head, glanced at the side of the body, a spot hidden with a spotted ochre, a dark, dull unicorn horn wand lying quietly Beside the owner... The lich can temporarily confirm that he has not encountered any loss... No, reading a book (ww.ukanshucom) He thought sullenly, I lost a gray robe, and swayed a bone everywhere and frightened and threatened Human freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea of ​​consciousness of the undead is dark and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here, he was able to return to his favorite state of complete and smooth bone shelf, almost let him blend with the sea of ​​knowledge, empty suspended in the air Gray robes, his eyelids leaping with a needle-like blush, staring maliciously at the despicable and insane intruder, thieves, useless waste and feces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly swaying the blurred body, exuding the white and cornflower blue light, trying to reduce the sense of existence but difficult to succeed, the soul is uneasy and cautiously At first glance, the dragonfly floating in the black shades in an elegant posture can create a Gothic lich with even a white skeleton and a rag-colored bed sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
