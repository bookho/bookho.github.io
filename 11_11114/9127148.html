			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about our new owner?" In the "red belly" bathroom, it was a coincidence that I chose the dragon knight in the room that Gülen used. Asked, "It is said that he is a very shy person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock who is very good at giving the cat a claw is lazily pointing to the position around him, not looking at it, and the bare//naked knight is just Gently flipping the palm of your hand, revealing a leather bag that is only as big as the palm of your hand, but the bag is bulging, it is thrown to the warlock, the warlock gently pinches, pulls the string of the bag, and goes to the palm of the hand. Down, the gems inside are rolling on the damp skin, each one has the size of a scorpion, even in the dim light of the bathroom.The warlock smirked with satisfaction and shook it to his overlapping arms. The woman around him showed a greedy look, but she did not want to be able to take two of them. The guys who can still survive have a minimum of intuition, knowing that those people can provoke and those who can't do it - she has a more supple attitude, the skin is close to the skin, almost all with the thin body of the warlock<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight of the Dragon has rudely pushed the woman’s companion aside. He can’t stand the quirk of this warlock. So far, the beastized person from his hands The slave is the most popular. The girls and boys sent to him by the merchants are countless. They are all good-looking and clean, but he likes this messy and dirty place. The service of older women who are obese and have loose skin, in the steam of the soles of the feet and the scent of the scent and the scent of the scented perfume<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be like this," said the warlock. "You will know if you try. Their technique is the best."He turned over. "Unlike those young children, no one can understand men better than them.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going to set up those pastors? The Cavaliers said, but they still lay on the slate, the slate was polished very smooth, and because it was so hard to get dirty, the previous maids had washed them with hot water, so there was still some temperature left on it, but it was on the top. You will feel that there is a deep chill that penetrates into the body from below. People here rarely enjoy the convenience of magic, so this is a rare enjoyment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should also want to say that there are those maids of the Gredith Temple."The warlock said that while he was satisfied with the humming sound, his entire body was wrapped and crushed by the fat meat, and the wonderful mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Note your wordsThe Dragon Knight warned that the maids around him didn't dare to be as arrogant as the companions. They only dared to push the strong and hard muscles of the guests with their palms. Every part of the knight's body was so flawless, only a few scars on the back. However, his warnings are only perfunctory, although in the Dragon Tooth Legion, the followers of Greedy also occupy part of the combat power - they treat injured soldiers and knights, but more often, they are more willing to lash They, the knight, thought that the priest of Greedy and the priest of Froe could never be compared. Although neither of them would have only one lover, the priest of Fro can only be tempted and possessed, the priest of Gredi. But it is tempted and possessive, looks similar but fundamentally different<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brother was once a priest with a red dragon as a lover, the biggest expectation is that she is willing to give birth to a child before she gets bored. Because of their pedigree, and the talent of the mother, the chances of having a child with the same talent are great.In Grenada, a gifted child is a valuable asset, and the rich can guarantee that the person goes further in the dragon claw.Of course his enemies would not want to see this scene, and soon an alien mage appeared in front of the pastor, and the followers of the red dragon were quickly lured by the obviously more powerful caster, and In trouble, his brother was injured first and then disappeared silently in the desert.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that he rejected the invitation of a maid from Kelsey - many people think he is crazy, but he immediately turned to Mitt, Mitt and Kelmen, Kelsey, the brothers and sisters, are natural enemies. When their youngest brother, Kremar, is still in Grenada, Kelmen and Kyle The sight of the scorpion venom was almost entangled in the latter, but in this way, Mitt was not suffering from the red dragon scorpion when he had no authority, and then Kreima was "dead", but luckily Yes, at that time, the new king has decided to hand over the dragon tooth to Mitt.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Knight is at this time to become Mitt's confidant, he can be said to see how the oldest prince is in the Dragon's tooth Gradually standing on the heel - in the beginning, his enemies were more than his subordinates. Among them, there are more powerful dragons than him, unruly warlocks, old-fashioned scorpions, and every day. The violent screams, the rude curses, the dangerous sings, and the taunting voices of the yin and yin screamed in any corner of the dragon's teeth. It took Mittite twenty years to finally let the dragon tooth belong to his own hands. In the first few years, when the dragon tooth needed to go out, the sad reminder commander could only direct his own cronies, and himself, several times, as the knight around Mittite, he was only a millimeter away from the shake. Looking at the past, he is very surprised how he endured.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very interesting thing." The warlock waved his hand and leaned over the body. The dragon knight turned to stare at the slate. The warlock's bones and organs were really too hurtful. The warlock complained a few words, and finally the topic. Turned to the direction the Cavaliers hoped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We discussed some academic things," the warlock said, while observing the look of the knight, "he mentioned several rather interesting terms, like 'Rejection', do you know what is called 'rejection'? Not only is there a 'rejection' between humans and beasts, but also between humans and humans, beasts and beasts. No wonder what I have done before. Rotting and shrinking - in short, different blood is like an enemy, the same blood can be fused together, so when a person's nose is transplanted to his stomach, it may grow and heal there, but If you transplant to the ass of a pig, you can't do it – we have to find out the difference. You see, I have an idea. If it is a blood problem, then between the blood relative and the blood relative... I mean, Son and mother, father and daughter, grandson and grandfather...The closer the blood is, the less the situation of 'rejection' will be... Hey!" He glanced at the maid around him, no matter what he said. Happily I waved my arm and hurt my muscles: "In short, if it wasn't already agreed with you, I should have returned to my lab first. I have a lot of new ideas. I need a lot of materials... The bottomless abyss is down, I I hope to create a stranger than Chimera..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only these?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There are other things," the warlock sneered rudely. "But I think you are going to fall asleep. I don't think I should continue to say it. Poor friends, what are you supposed to be?" "Applause doesn't know," he muttered. "To tell the truth, I really don't want to tell you these things, if you don't really understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knights take a deep breath and told he could not beat him, "? he did and the things you mentioned Aralia do," he said: "? or his own intent to manufacture a horse" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock snorted, "If you say, one... can be strong over the eagle The mount of the lion beast may be," he said. "But you know that even if he is a dragon, it is the youngest child of the new king, the master of the dragon tooth, he can not suddenly succeed in a year. Such a monster can't be done even with my help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One year?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You have to pray that he really doesn't have this idea," said the warlock. "Maybe he just wants to talk to a colleague with advanced skills and excellent ideas, chat, and he doesn't always want him to find a knight to discuss these issues." . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Has he recruited you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a pity, it doesn't seem to be," the warlock pinched the buttock's buttocks: "I know, you want him to recruit me, so at least you can know He is acting, but I think he seems more willing to take a break and your knights are only waiting quietly for a while. "The Warlock certainly knows what the Cavaliers are bothering. They probably did a lot of pre-planning solutions long ago, but the only thing they didn't expect was that the other party didn't want to play with them. Yes, as the Legion gradually finished, the Cavaliers They are becoming more and more at a loss. If Cremari wants to threaten them, they can fight back; if Cremal is to buy them first, they can also sneak a snake; it is also possible that Cremari will try to mobilize some of them. People, divorced them, differentiated them, then they will let their new owners know how much he has to pay to do this, but the crux of the matter is that Cremari must take the first step.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t want to go ahead because they will become passive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Greed’s will has According to the award, Kreima may be punished, but this does not mean that the knights of the dragon tooth can be unscathed, they also pleaded with Mitt, but the former owner of the dragon tooth seems to have no way. This may be considered normal In Grenada, if a subordinate dares to make a passover, the heaviest punishment may be to be executed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock maliciously speculates, how many of them are there? Time? I hope that the Virgin's maids will come to receive slaves and spoils, and will not be furious because they have nothing to gain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Knight is unable to get more After the intelligence, I left the boring little room. The warlock lay on the slate, feeling the coolness of the slate and the burning of the female body. He wanted to get a hot and crazy caress. He got it, maybe even more. ...but next time he won't choose a room like this, the steam here is so dense that he feels difficulty breathing, he opens his eyes in the shackles, but nothing can be seen, he casts a spell, the spell immediately swallows Everyone around him, but his pain did not disappear - he wanted to stand up, but still fell weakly, he fell into the bath, pouring hot water with sulphur smell into his nose and mouth, he wanted Shouting, but only 汩汩Sound, and finally he sank down <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
