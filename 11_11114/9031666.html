			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul from another plane casts a small spell that allows the slave to support the body more easily. He doesn’t think that the skinny is like a The child's slave can drag himself from the ground in this situation, instead of panting on the ground like a turtle, or halfway through his master like a gannet landing failure. The belt rolled out in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought he could get a grateful smile, or could see a relaxed look on the face carved out of wood, at least I saw a surprised expression, but he didn't see anything. Except that the slave stood up quickly, there was no sign that he did implement a spell. He didn't have time to feel frustrated, and he felt the horror - it was indeed The individual, not the clay that is pinched out, is not rock-carved. Too much point, even the two statues in front of the smog cottage of Alva Master are more like a living person than he came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is indeed breathing, sweating and bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outer world feels fear, it is a kind of fear that is different from the damage and persecution. In his plane, some people like it. Puppets and some people hate it because of the so-called "human fear", the researchers have proved that people who are too similar to humans will be disturbing and disgusting, because they will not move or breathe. Reminiscent of the body - this slave will move, but also breathe, but he does not have his own will, no soul, which is more than a doll or a body will make him want to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A palm is slowly placed on Kremar’s shoulder, and in a gentle way that does not scare him, Kreima turns his head. I saw the eyes belonging to the elves. The eyes were quiet and clear, like the clear sky after the storm. Just watching it can calm people down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about we bought the slave?" Kremar asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give him freedom." The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The law of the Dragonfire Islands stipulates that slaves can never be free." Kerry Ben said: "You can use him, kill him and even eat him. You can't release him alone, you can resell it, or you can abandon it, but if that happens, someone will continue to use him or kill him for you. On the Longhuo Island, slaves are property, items, you can imagine Is your box free?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can take him away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The slaves of Longhuo Island belong only to Longhuo. This is also the law."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, what if we just let him do something easy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most thorough execution on the Longhuo Islands There are three laws, all of which are directed at slaves. You can... do what you want, but you must avoid all your eyes and ears. Otherwise, the officials and soldiers of the lord have the right to take your slaves. Take him directly to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world paused a little: "You also... tried it, are you, Kerry Ben?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an expression on the face of the elf that the soul of the outside world does not want to see, "Well," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world tasted the taste of the mouth, tasted the bitter taste without any reason, and then he finally thought of a topic: "eat Crab?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eat." said the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei looked at Gülen to leave, and then the elves Kerry Ben and Birdwin Walking somewhere far from the sea, the "wide dolphins" brought a piece of metal that was folded and only the size of the palms of the adult males. Kerry has placed it layer by layer. turn on. Let it be a grill with the knees that are about three feet long and wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomish's work?" Liona said she was carrying a fat oyster. The huts are located within the ring-shaped reefs, surrounded by vibrant, colorful corals of various sizes, grotesque caves, and a variety of creatures you can think of and can't think of. Leona has never seen the sea before, and has never seen such a wealth. After coming here, she can be said to be completely confused by an innocent blue, and sometimes her hair can be wet all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mi’s gaze swept past the king’s hair, and she left the spirit. The prince cut the long and knee hair to the shoulders, both for the sake of cleaning and to reduce the burden. After the hot dragon fire island, she shortened her hair to a boy like a caster. The extent of this is a rare thing on this continent, and humans are always keen to keep their hair. Even if it is an adventurer, women will braid their hair instead of arbitrarily cutting them off. Some aristocratic women will lose their hair if they lose their long hair because of an accident. The elves’ hair will even be used to defend. The bowstrings of the self and the tribe, and as a note to the only companion; but it must be said that after cutting off the long hair, Leona is more heroic and radiant, originally like a male-like facial features. After missing the long hair's cover and setting, it is like a jewel that has lost the golden base. She takes off her long skirt, puts on leather, tights, and puts on boots. The shoulders show strange style. When the flame-shaped sword walks up and down the street, in addition to the men, even the women will pout to her from time to time, rubbing their eyes and waving handkerchiefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mei Mei probably doesn't know that there is a hairstyle in another plane called Hepburn Head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Kerry has slightly raised the grill a bit, letting Leona stroke an inconspicuous depression, "Gnomes will be in their work." Leave a name on it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dwarf will also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarf will stay at the most "Conspicuous places," Kerry said: "Like the surface of the shield, the handshake of the hilt, or the nameplate of the chain, but the gnomes will only stay in the inconspicuous places, sometimes not words, but they The symbol used to replace his name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona touched it, it was a hammer, her eyes became hesitant: "The gnome also used a hammer To represent yourself?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry seems to be a little surprised: “No, the gnome symbols I have seen are only gears, Bearings or rulers, the relationship between gnomes and dwarves is not very good, they will not use the common symbols of the dwarves to represent themselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the bird grill, they do see a hammer symbol left in the inside of the grill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this possible for the dwarf's work?" asked Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dwarf does not make utensils for ordinary people," said the elf. "It’s not weapons, shields, or armor from the hands of the dwarves. They occasionally Jewelry will be created, but those jewels are usually magical."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the king turned the grill over. "This may be a hope to be A dwarf gnome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf smiled and shook his head, which is simply saying that a dwarf wants to be an elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we ask the tour operator," Liona said: "She will tell us where the gnome who built the shelf lives?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm afraid not," Kerry Ben: "The gnomes are basically under the control of the lords, and a few are out of the field with a high degree of vigilance. They won't make this. Kind of common utensils, this is in batches," his fingers slid on the iron frame, and it touched a few small points. The gnomes used this to represent numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care how the gnomes are," Bird said. "But I am really hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona smiled, she was light Lightly walk to Bywin, and gently kiss him on the side of his ear: "You can eat some oysters, dear." She said that the sun falling into the sea left on her raised cheekbones. A touch of vermilion floating marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Biedwin’s embarrassment, especially after he’s been wiped clean, his expression is not easy to be covered up, “I’ll come Open." He said, pulling a short knife from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oyster is also a delicious dish in the plane of the alien soul, but he is not used to eating, he put it on the grill - The gnome's folding grill is very delicate. The grille is not strip-shaped but grid-like. The residual seawater in the oyster's black shell quickly boils. The black-haired caster quickly puts some garlic in it. At the end, pour a little winter wine, the meat creaks in the shell, and the rich fragrance suddenly takes everyone's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona tasted a raw oyster and tasted a grilled oyster. She regretted that she had too few oysters, and Baldwin took it away. several. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give it to Gülen," he said in a playful tone as long as the man could understand: "He has a good date tonight." I took one to Crimmar: "I may get you there tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oysters in the mouth of Meimi instantly become like wax She used to be a small problem for the thief, but she did not expect that he would tell Bedwin directly, and Birdwin... didn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crazy?" Kremar asked, he has such a little bit... Hey, after all, his plane, in his country, this Things are always intimidating, if you are male, it is also, but there are plum and Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give him some creamy stewed crabmeat," said the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: I also want to eat onion cream crab... (to be continued). )<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
