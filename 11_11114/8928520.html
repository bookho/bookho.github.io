			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona even envied her aunt, Princess Diane, who was a bold and debauched woman. When she was fifteen, she married Morton Don Clay according to the will of Pharaoh. But this natural stun seems to never think of respecting and loving her husband like a civilian woman. She used her as a nothing before marriage. After marriage, she was unscrupulous and lover-in-law. The bloodline of Dylan’s roots should be known to everyone, but Morton Donkley finally mocked her and he gave him the greatest wealth. - His last name, his army and his territory were given to Baldwin, an outsider who had no relationship (Leona insisted on her opinion, although most of the kings saw it, a nobleman and ** An illegitimate child is far more noble than a serf or a slave child, not his nominal only child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, she said to herself, don’t think about Bedwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan’s face emerged in the memory of Leona, the cousin of Leona, who inherited his mother’s hair color, face and him. Father's eyes, his beauty is between men and women, with a kind of ruthless and fierce contradiction, people often whisper, because his mother Diane contains too many seeds, land It’s unusual to be fertile to raise such a flower-like son—but they soon discovered that this flower is not only thorny but also poisonous. His temperament and way of doing things is almost his father, Fukai. The reprint or the blue is better than the blue. And who is Fukai? When he was a boy, he won the favor of Pharaoh. He asked the Princess of Diane, who had more than 50 lovers at most, to listen to him. He was an ally of the Duke of John, but he also forced the current king to trust him. He It is like a dragon on a gold coin, but his tentacles stretch out in all directions in the dark like the roots of trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a wife, but in the same year he died because of dystocia, Leona didn’t know if there was any handwriting in it - at the default of Fukai Princess Diane is a wayward and selfish woman, her temper is only converging in front of Fu Kai and Dylan - Leona clearly remembers that she once killed a parrot alive, because her parrot is Leona’s wrist stayed on her wrist and licked the girl’s cheek. Thinking that Birdwin might also be twisted and squeezed between her delicate wrists, and the last drop of blood would be squeezed out, and Leona would shudder. Fortunately, Birdwin was stationed in Thunderbolt all the year round, and he returned to Wangdu. Not many, and almost all spent in the palace with his house, will also bring his own knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the King insisted on holding a grand and grand triumph for Baldwin, Leona knew that this was only to increase the weight of Birdwin, because He must be standing on the side of him and his daughter - the problem is that Princess Diane can not care about the idea of ​​the elder brother, when she loses her reason because of anger and jealousy - no one can guess what she will do Leona hesitated, not sure if she would let her maid leave the king early to warn Baldwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Birdwin should have expected this before, after all, the assassinations that have been inexplicable have already explained everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will protect you," Liona said softly, facing the dark cover: "I will protect you." I swear, she immediately She was deeply ashamed of her initial thoughts, because she thought that her father would not agree to let her be the wife of Birdwin, but if the Queen wanted a lover, it would still be within the scope of reasoning - but How can she do this! ? How can you put your loved one in such an unbearable situation, maybe someone will be proud of the Queen's love, but it will never be Birdwin, the noble and pure person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she will still protect him, and his wife, Penny, knows that Birdwin loves his wife like she loves Birdwin. They will have children, the children of Don Cree, living a happy life, calm and worry-free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't have this child." Penny said palely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The young count pretending to ask ignorantly: "He/she is our child!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are not my husband!" Penny shouted anxiously: "My husband is Baldwin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then she Seeing that the handsome young man suddenly stopped, like a statue that was solidified by magic, the sun-like and lovely smile faded from his face, and the sorrow and pain replaced by it made Penny dare not look again— — It’s like an innocent child who has been stabbed by his favorite person, right in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up suddenly, clenched his hands, and repeatedly paced in the room. "I forgot..." He looked at Penny. With a bitter smile: "I forgot... Penny, dear, I forgot that we are not real couples."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry ..." Penny whispered, she stroked the abdomen, soft and flat there, completely unaware that there was already a life inside - she thought of some inferior stories that I had heard in the village before, and how many of them Get rid of a fetus in a simple and rude way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She curled up, her eyes filled with tears, she once wanted to have a child with Baldwin, but she also wanted this child, he would definitely be beautiful A clever child, like his father—if it wasn’t for Byrdwin’s return to the king’s capital after twenty days, she might have given birth to him, in a hidden courtyard, or a little unknown. in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
