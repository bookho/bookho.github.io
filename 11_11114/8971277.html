			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has taken over the piece of metal and parchment, and when he touched it, he felt a weak magic. Passing his fingers, like he is touching a magic scroll, the elves are very sensitive to the power of magic, even if they can't be used, they can be noticed, but it's just a touch of power that will disappear at any time. . He took the debris to his eyes and observed it. It was dark and fragile. It looked like an old gold foil. Some wizards and warlocks used gold foil to decorate their spells, especially those who sometimes wanted to conceal the caster. people. Mithril and fine gold are good, but they are too easy to capture the clues that shouldn't be there... But the caster never slacks on their precious spellbooks, and can't choose the fine gold and secrets. In silver, gold and silver become the choice, and the power of magic is clearly flowing through other metals as they travel through them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of debris is detached from the corner of a book, engraved with fine patterns and symbols, and because of this, it is not The stomach fluid that the bat can melt the steel is blurred, and the priest makes the necessary cleaning and protection for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know," when the Elf Ranger repeatedly touched it, the thief couldn’t help but say: "There are thousands of such things in the port of Point." As long as you are willing to go to the black alleys, there will always be a few people who come up with some good things. Please appreciate the valley that is not the dragon, the cave where the devil is imprisoned, and the dangerous assassin. On an unnamed island, a mountain of gold coins... everything is enough for a bard to sing for twenty years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But I remember that there is indeed a poem describing this," said the elf. "Is the respectable and devout follower known as the listener, Ribold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Irmot's pastor paused. He was not a good at memory. He rummaged through his thoughts and nodded cautiously: "Yes, at the end of the book... ...the adult, who gave his name, he didn’t want to be famous for himself, but hoped for 10,000 Someone wants to check this record, it is not to be regarded as a fabricated story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So this," the thief asked, "What is the relationship with us?" What? The Master has his spell book," he said, similar to the rogue: "It is not a gold coin in front of me, not a flower that can be worn by women. Why do we need to fight for this? What is the reward for the remuneration?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like what you said with this respected ranger," Ilmot’s pastor said in a more brazen manner than a thief: "If you don't solve this, you are unlikely to leave here." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," he peeked at the thief’s immediate expression of danger, adding in time: "The gold coins found by the followers of the gods in the ruins It’s very pitiful with valuables, neither in line with his pre-life status nor with his identity behind him. It is said that the true treasure left by the vicious undead is not hidden, it is hidden, and That spell book is together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But in fact," said Kerry Ben, who passed the piece to Cremari. The once undead who was lying in the middle of the gun took the debris and began to cast a spell: "I didn't see what makes it different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It used to contain power," the priest said. "As you can see, I am not a powerful pastor, this village. I can stick to it until now, almost relying on it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The pastor squatted for a while, apparently he was not willing to say it, and he had doubts and dislikes about this power: "...death..." he said in a low voice, "Just inject power into it, the cloud of death." It will be shrouded in the head of the living."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't think," said the Lich. "There is no evil chaos or negative energy with corrosiveness and toxicity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it It can be done..." The followers of Ilmot said: "Until the night before you came."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It also failed to make Are you leaving this village?" Gülen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can," the priest squirmed his fingers uneasily: "Please believe me, I won't do that. I will warn you loudly in the first place." You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's only the devil knows." Gülen doesn't care, but he no longer pays attention to the priest of Ilmot. The caster gave the piece to Bedwin after casting the two methods. Because of the low-light battle, he was forced to stay in a state of at least the next morning, he was against the magic. Things like this have only a preliminary understanding, and they value their utility rather than the principle and the details. After fighting with the orcs in Thunder Castle, he only needs to know that a spell can freeze them, and a spell can make them all. It’s fine to burn coke, but out of courtesy, he took the little thing and carefully looked it in the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't Baldwin who made the thieves ridiculously and coldly smiled at this time, but the plum honey that leaned against the gray warrior. The only chair in the room was empty, and no one did it. Fro's priest curled up two feet that were as clean as pearls, half-sitting and lying next to Birdwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When taking care of the wounded, Fro’s priest took the opportunity to get a little warm and clean water, she used a comb to stain the water I combed my head, and now the rich, dark brown head was still a little moist; she wiped her face thinly and patted her cheeks to make them crimson, she always bit her lip, white as a shell The teeth leave a mark on the soft lower lip and deepen the color. The priest of Irmot only prepared a whale oil lamp in this room. After getting the piece in Baldwin, she took it from the small table calmly. From it, to the side of Birdwin, she worked tirelessly to carry it, sent the light and herself to the warrior's side. The thief now has a pair of very beautiful eyes, especially under the light, you can be in this pair The golden color of the sun, the green of the forest, the gray of the rain cloud and the blue of the sky are found in the eyes. As the light changes, the color of the eyes changes. Glan knows that people often refer to this kind of eye as a gem. Eye, more Indeed point that is opal gem, it is unpredictable and beautiful endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German turned his arms and turned, "Please tell, Respectable adult," he said in a bad tone, frowning at himself at the same time, because he did not notice when the priest of Ilmot left the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need to know this place in more detail and in-depth," Kerry said softly, the elves are not as concerned about whether others are enough for themselves. Dear, they prefer to get along with their friends. Although the thieves can't say that they are friends, this little resentment can still be ignored, and he really needs the help of thieves: "Can you complete this task? He smiled and put his hand on his belt: "I promise this is rewarded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let you arrange it." The thief said "I just want to leave this ghost place as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Kerry said: "We all want to." He paused: " I also have a bottle of honey here, if you think you can stick to it, we can share it this night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief will cut back into the belt: "You and me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or me," said the caster, and then he turned to Kerry Ben: "You are injured." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin looked up, but he didn't find blood on Kerry itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ribs pierce the lungs." Kremar said: "When the tower collapses, you are hit by a huge stone, from then on. You will unconsciously protect your right rib, and then when you are walking with Birdwin, you intentionally put the longbow in front of you, because in the bumps he will hit your body... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already had a therapeutic potion." Kerry said helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you haven't healed, you are going to fight with the bat again," the Lich said. "When you compete with them for a baby, from the roof directly "It fell to the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are clearly at the other end of the village," the elf said with amazement: "How can you know so much?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My spiritual servant, the lich said in his heart: "Stop the transfer of the topic," he said indifferently: "You need to rest, only me and Gülen tonight." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf sighed and succumbed: "How many spells do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you There are as many healing potions." The Lich replied sarcastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin laughed, he patted his side: "Fortunately, the priest of Ilmot has a very wide bed," he said. We can share it and give the honey to the two guys.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If needed...” Mei Mi said with awkwardness: “Maybe I can ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you allow me to throw you out as a bait when the bat comes," the caster said without a trace of emotion: "I will be very I need you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you hated me." After the church in Ilmot, the thief said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why,” the Lich asked. “You are very useful to me,” the caster raised his finger and let the thief see the slender silver rope wrapped around his wrist: “And you can always give me some unexpected enlightenment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My honor." Gülen said that he was about five feet away from the caster, but he also knew that in the caster. The scope of their vision is their field. This is not only extremely ridiculous but also stupid, but his body is not controlled by the will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few people in the village who are willing to pick up the torches at night, they don’t need them, they can never block the complete gap when they pass through the mud house. To the crying of the young children and the insatiable screams, because some people who were not so seriously injured were left at home, and their family cooked the herbs given to them by the priest in the stove in the middle of the house. The stool is better to smell, not surprising, the ingredients in the stool are really tangible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How far do you think we can go?" the thief asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember the morning?" The caster said leisurely: "The farmers farmed in the fields outside the village, and in order to prevent the sacrifices from being too early Now that he is trapped, the mage or warlock who set up the site will also extend the scope to where they are going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief has never been silent Interest-free, even on muddy, uneven roads, the Master is not too much, the only remaining gleam is clear to them, their degree is also fast, probably only used ordinary One third of the time, they came to the field outside the village. They walked along the path that was trampled by the cows and people. After passing through the wasteland everywhere, they came to a field where sweet potatoes were planted. The shed in the ground is empty, its owner may have died, and perhaps may not dare to equate his life with a few baskets of sweet potatoes. Then it is a dense thorn, and the trace of humanity ends here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s foggy," said Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," said the Lich: "We have reached a place where we need to be vigilant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I thought you hated me." After leaving the church in Ilmot, the thief said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why," the Lich asked: "You are very useful to me," the caster raised his finger and let the thief see the slenderness wrapped around his wrist. Silver rope: "And you can always give me some unexpected enlightenment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
