			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long do you think we still have to wait? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It depends on Kelsey, but I think she will choose before the Red Dragon final battle, because at that stage, the priests of Gredi Will be gathered in the temple and the sanctuary, praise Greddy, and sacrifice her, pray that the blood and death of the enemy can make the red dragon stronger - even Kelsey, she will not be at that time Make mistakes that should not be made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we don’t have to wait too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is fleeting, people lurking in the dark unexpectedly did not wait for them Expected news, Yadel continues to be busy in the palace and the beach, there is no sign of attack and nuisance, and his slaves are working hard as usual, every day people are helplessly far from their loved ones, but compared The slaves in the kingdom of Grenada, their losses can be said to be minimal – in a hemispherical underground cave, there is a clean water ball, which allows them to get clean and warm drinking water. As for food, in addition to rough wheat bran, they are able to obtain rare fish, shellfish and a vigorous red algae from the sea. This red algae floats in the sea like a solidified blood clot. Ominous legend, but also sticky and stinking, not like anywhere It can be eaten, but the mucus on the young leaves is cleaned and then softened in salt water to the extent that it can be chewed and swallowed. There is also a sea worm that grows very fat and the dark body is full. The soft spines are very similar in shape to the mites, and when they are caught, they will squirt all the internal organs. When they are cooked in the pot, they will shrink into the teeth of the steel. I may not be able to bite the ribs, but Ya Under the guidance of Cremal, Dell told them that this kind of thing can be eaten raw after removing the internal organs - ah, there is a sea worm that looks like a dragonfly, they are hidden in the sea sand, but the tide When the smooth sand surface will leave the hole that they excavated when they breathe, insert a finger into it and pull out a white strip. The sea worm is different from the former one in a hot water. Nothing can be melted, so it has never been on the table. It is also Kremar. He told Yadel that the juice will be left after the sea worms melt, and they will condense when it gets cold at night. At this time, you can dig out with your fingers. Eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalal has tasted these three things, the taste can be said to be unforgettable for life, but for the vacant long-term stomach, they are unparalleled treasures. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He puts down his palm, the soft food that shakes looks like solidified beef and sheep fat, but as long as you smell it, you can have the urge to vomit. Putting it in your mouth will make you feel like you have a dirty excrement, but it does make people full, and they won't get sick or become weak – just at this time, He heard the noise from the distance. He handed the seaweed leaves used to hold the food to the leaders of the slaves. The latter immediately swallowed the remaining food and threw the leaves directly into the seawater - they used The seaweed leaves, large and small, are cooked and eaten. The mature leaves of the red algae are like thin sheepskins. They are very flexible and can withstand the test of burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the dark cave, the glare of the sun gave Rosada’s pastor a slight squint, and the slaves’ stagnation was not far from him, they Deliberately bowed his head and prevented himself from seeing the priest of Rosada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And further afield, it is the clerk of Cremari and the priest of Gredi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the red robe, people think more about the warlock, but Red Dragon Grede also chose this color for their pastors, just from the style On the top, they are very different. The warriors' robes have small buttons, from the bottom to the ankles, while the priest's robes have bare arms and partial chests, and the belts are decorated with gold and precious stones. The sea breeze blew, and the robes were faintly visible from the cracks in the waist, and their sleek faces were like jewels wrapped in extravagant scorpions and silk satin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If anyone is most familiar with these slaves," said Kremar’s attendant, "Probably Yadel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor led the visor to transfer to Yadel: "I heard that your master has left a fallen white robe," she made a gesture, the attendant let go, Ya When Dell went over, Pastor Greddy reached out and his sharp nails fell on his cheek. There was a brand of blasphemy. "It's a pity," she said. "If there is no fall, he will be more valuable." The attendant smiled meaningfully. "My master doesn't seem to care much about this," he said. "He is full of curiosity about everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one." Yadel bowed, and then calmly said that the look of the attendant immediately became cold: "Maybe you don't know," he said: "In Grenada, lies are not allowed. The crime of pardon, especially when you are standing in front of a priest of Greedy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is 亵渎," The priest added, “It’s also humiliating – such a crime may not even be borne by your master.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not a lie,” Yadell said: Go see it, or use spells, magic, no matter what, you can't find a pregnant woman from the slaves - my master supports them to complete this huge project, everyone has to work hard day and night Women and children are no exception. Some pregnant women lost their children before coming to Grenada, and the rest of them..." Yadel looked around. "I don't think there is a fetus that can be strong enough to continue. Survive in this situation."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gredi’s pastors certainly won’t believe him this way, but it’s true that nearly one million people have no pregnant women, this is the black-haired dragon’s leaving the grid. Before Rinada warned Yadell, Grein's favorite sacrifice was a pregnant woman, and in the absence of his Grenada, his warlock attendants would not care about a slave, and Yadell's The identity is also destined that he can't get the upper hand in the conflict. As for the succubus Ferek Hill left by Kremar, and the uninvited gray robes, Yadel knows that they will never be willing to ask for it. One, or a lot of slaves, even a small finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has configured the potion and handed it to every lucky and unfortunate future mother. Although this potion will make them lose their children, they can nourish their bodies and keep them. Their lives, maybe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then give us women over the age of fifteen and over twenty." Greedy's pastor said a little less happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The temple is very generous this time," said the attendant. "Every woman is willing to change with an adult male," he looked turbid. Seawater: "Strong and powerful than women."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel knows that he should not hesitate, but every moment at this moment is extended to hundreds of years He turned and looked at the slaves. Most of them were Tirans, but some of them were black-haired dragons. The rider Keou and the barbarian grabbed each other from the sword of the dragon tooth or the dragon claw knight. Out, but in the end he still calmly asked: "How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "One hundred ... fifty." Yadel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can relax a little more," Greedy's pastor walked over to him, "minimum two hundred and fifty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The proportion of women is originally very low." Yadel said: "Young girls simply can't insist on coming here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is our Highness of Kremar ready to let them breed their little scorpions here?" said the priest of Greedy: "This is Grenada, not the Dragonfire Islands - if you Worried that your master will punish you when he returns," she said gently, sideways, in the ear of Yadel: "The temple will give him a thousand slaves a year for the next twenty years, all adult. Male, after all, 'mother' is also very much expected to see this building group under her wings early in the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are future sacrifices "Isn't it?" Yadel said: "If you are old, some of them are very ugly. I don't think that such a sacrifice can win a powerful Rui. "Gredi's favor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You almost have to convince me." Greedy's pastor said sweetly: "So, two hundred and forty-nine ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two hundred." Yadel said softly: "No more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two hundred and forty-eight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel shook his head: "It's too hard."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then... a thousand," said the priest of Gerdi, very, very, very slowly said: "10,000, the poor pity, you think you are bargaining with whom? I can kill everyone here, including you," she said thoughtfully. "You have to know that there are many people who are skeptical that your master is using his authority and blood to do something ridiculous... you What do you think? He seems to like you very much, and he trusts you, and the slaves with their claws and wings. You know, 'Mother' is so fond of him, you know how many people are full of him. Deep hatred? If, I mean, if he did live up to this pet... the bottomless abyss is down," she swayed her nose, her red lips pulled open to the sides, revealing White's teeth: "You Do you know what he will face? He will be..." She lowered her voice, as if she had not made any sound: "The entire enemy of Grenada."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
