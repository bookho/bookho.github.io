			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft prevention section, tomorrow will be replaced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picolomini grabbed the linen under the plate and wiped his hand. The beeswax candle lit the room like a white, he could find all The details - if the child is ten years old, some people will believe it. After all, his face and body have been separated from the child's stage. His hair is dark brown and only has a little bit of curl at the end. His eyes are the same color as his hair. His calmness is like an adult monk. His standing is elegant and dignified, his skin is white, and he is happy when he sees it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there are still some places on the angelic face that make Picromini feel familiar, he looks to his classmates, then closes his eyes quickly After a while, this faculty is not eye-catching, but not every bishop can ask for an eight-year-old child. This person and the price can be put into the child's adulthood. After all, the child is still It is quite common for a teenager to die in the middle. Once the beneficiary has died, all the ideas and expectations related to him can only be said to be castles in the air. It can only be said that this child is willing to let people take this risk for him. Although Cromini’s uncle also loved him very much, he was not so crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valencia, the parish of Spain, Ha, Rome, don’t you have a Spanish cardinal? Piccolomini finally remembers where he saw it. This face, Rodriguez Borgia, he is eight years older than Picromini, but he is one hundred times shameless than the latter. Everyone knows that he and his lover are open to the public. And gave birth to four or five children, and now one of them is standing in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rodriguez Borgia," said Picromini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Perugia nodded cautiously, "Come to us." He said to the child with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Borgia wants the supreme position." Picromini said, looking at Borgia with his sharp eyes. Face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who doesn't want it?" said Bishop Perugia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His odds are small," said Picromini. "His enemy is Giuliano de la Lovere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So far, no two identical surnames have been allowed to appear consecutively on the pope's lineage, and he cannot become a pope."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Pope. The Lovere is only forty-one years old this year, he can wait for the first class," Picromini said: "It seems that this Rome will The turmoil is difficult - Borgia does not even dare to keep his family in Rome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are still small," Bishop Perugia Says: "The smallest one is only two years old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He entrusted one of his sons to you," Piccomini said: "My Classmate, I really didn't think that you deserve to be so trusted. Is it that St. Francis shows another miracle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can leave "The bishop of Perugia turned his head to Xiaobo. Georgia said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Valencia gave a ceremony to the two bishops and left the room. During the whole process, he did not rush to interject and express his opinion. There is no panic and anger, and the ability to control the body and emotions is obviously more than many adults, a Borgia, Picromini, if Rodriguez Borgia can really If you wish to become a pope, this child will become the sharpest knife he has stabbed at the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you can talk about what you want me to do," said Picromini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Perugia licked his neck. "You have twenty-five followers," he said. "Not the smallest one."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picolomoni raised his eyebrows dangerously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One more should be no one to pay attention," Perugia said with a brazen shame: "Or stay one less, St. Franciscan monastery internal school (Note: Refers to preparation The vacancy worth of a priestly student is worth one hundred Florin gold coins, equivalent to three small stallions with good teeth. It is constantly increasing in value. Given that the crimson vest is so expensive, maybe tomorrow it will It is equivalent to the six little stallions." He pinched a small insect caught in the folds of his neck: "I think someone will be willing to exchange with Little Borgia."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you want money, or a vineyard? Or a church?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bishop Perugia looked up at the beam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vineyard," he said: "I guess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I want it One-third of the proceeds," Piccomini took a sip of water in a wooden cup with honey added: "And I only allowed him to follow me until the pope was elected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong with a Borgia disciple," said Bishop Perugia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he is not the job I should do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So who is yours? Employer?” Bishop Perugia asked: “Medic?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picolomini’s eyes suddenly became severe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait...etc," Bishop Perugia raised his hands. "This is just a simple logical topic. My old classmate, my class." It’s not as bad as you thought – when was the child you brought in? I think, it wasn’t 1478 years ago, after 1478, what happened in 1478? We all know that the Medici family is almost It was said that the Paqi family was in the nest, and it was said that Lorenzo de Medici had escaped into the sacred room and was lucky to be spared - and then I remember that just before that day, I received yours. Believe, you told me that at the invitation of the Archbishop of Florence, you will preside over the first weekday mass and the appreciation of the holy things after the resurrection of the Cathedral of Santa Maria..." He laughed awkwardly here, "Lorenzo Poison, no, don't ask me how I know, but Piccolo, our teacher once said that your medical skills are like a wizard. It's you, not someone else, let Medi The strange people have returned to his life and can be in the next three days. Can stand up and preside over revenge against the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," he continued: "Scott IV announced the confiscation of the Medici family All the property in Rome, and the expulsion of Lorenzo and the court members of the whole of Florence, and claimed to be the command of the entire Florence, who accompanied Lorenzo to Naples, convinced the King of Ferdinand of Naples I, let him abandon the covenant with Siscott IV, and become a friend with Medici? Without you, I doubt whether Lorenzo de Medici can enter the Berdych Palace." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picolomini leaned back, neither denying nor admitting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You only have three followers when you left Rome," said Bishop Perugia. "Now you have a full twenty-three followers, each with a knight. The general line, who is paying their expenses? Lorenzo de Medici has always been a generous person, I know, then Florence is not so safe for the present Medici, except the king and the pope, Those so-called citizens who like to be old and tired, and who are nervous, and a member of the Dominican Association are constantly squatting. The dean of the Convent of San Marco, Florence, is called Savona, and he has been in it since 1482. Crazy to attack everything, from the pope, the church, to the Medici family - the dark tide, my friend, if the members of the Medici family want to be able to retain more bone blood, I am not surprised. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, although you are said to have twelve illegitimate children, I know that you are a little devil who can only cry and scream, irrational and intelligent. I’ve never been afraid to see it on the wall. Little angels must frown, I don't think that you will let any such a screaming puppy turn around at your feet for no reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter VII, Gooseberry and Belladonna (I)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bishop of Perugia is, he hopes that Bishop Bicroimini And his "followers" can leave Assisi as soon as possible. Everyone knows that anything will happen before the chimney of the Sistine Chapel (Note 1) - but in any case, even the Borgia in Rome may not be a despicable pilgrimage. Excuses or shirks, public opinion is far superior to the Bishop of Piccolo, who is a red-shirter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many ways to worship the Franciscans. Yes, people agree that the long and hard way of pilgrimage is the most devout and most orthodox way of following the path of the saints and walking through every path through which he barefooted, not to mention the cost of the road. Time and energy, plus the threat of hunger, disease and thieves, you have to be young (at least not older than the Franciscans before the vocation), strong (can withstand all kinds of A torment, and a strong and intelligent person (you don't want to know how many poor pilgrims are lost on the road to life). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
