			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 117th chapter will be (2)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of Norman in the Highlands is This triumphant investment in amazing human, material and financial resources - he is simply a bribe to entertain the people of the kingdom, every citizen, whether you are rich or poor; is a businessman, or It’s a soldier, or just a farmer. As long as you can open your mouth and scream for a long time, you will get a piece of blue dyed wool. Although its texture is rather crude, it is also a good thing for the average family. Accidental wealth, every criss-crossing intersection has people distributing bread and ale, just how much you love to eat and how much you can drink; Fro's priests spend their way through the streets, surrounded by floating children, clowns and Juggling; and those knights in gorgeous costumes, their coats of arms embroidered on their robes and cloaks, indicating their surnames, enemies and allegiance, their shackles looking after their armor and weapons, they are Sparkling in the sun<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord and the princes came one after another, bringing the knights and soldiers they promised, and the king occasionally stood in the shadow of the absent-minded Duke of John, his brother It doesn't look so pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these people are loyal to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although their loyalty is in need of purchase, in order to satisfy those who are never satisfied, the king has paid countless gold coins, hundreds of seals, written Or verbally promised a wide variety of requests. In general, these requests will be related to territorial jurisdiction, inheritance rights and marriage rights. For example, an earlord asks the king to marry a wife who is near his territory, even if he Only thirty years old and the daughter-in-law is nearly sixty years old, but she has five vineyards and three pastures. Hey, isn't this a coveted beauty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to marriage, the rulers of Norman Norman are unconsciously immersed in distress, and Leona and the crown on her head are no better. The bait, there are already several powerful and wealthy princes who want to marry him, and his courtiers are all eager to move - in order to show their sincerity, their gifts to the king are full of Wang Ting, but this is not enough What the king wants is that they are completely on his side - it is not difficult to make the right choice. You see, only Leona becomes the queen and her marriage is valuable. If not, a princess who does not have the right to inherit is really Not as good as a daughter-in-law with five vineyards and three pastures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same unhappy with the Duke of John is Princess Diane. She can't disobey the king's orders. Now she is irritatingly swaying her feather fan. The rock of the stone and ruby ​​reflects the magnificent light in the sun. As Wen walked into the gate, she whispered her head and refused to meet the shame of this shackled blood. This made her extremely surprised to see her niece's cheeks, the natural, even the most expensive rouge. The gorgeous colors that couldn't be compared to it made Diane frown, and Leona squinted before she looked around in her own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really awkward for Princess Xi’an. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s really nothing, then Leona doesn’t have to hide it, except for Diane, everyone is watching the hybrid... Diane slams the fan In her hand, perhaps after the banquet, she had to find her own brother to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king stepped forward and embraced Bydwin tightly, pinching his neck and calling him my dearest friend - people So whispering, because this title is often reserved for the Earl or the Marquis, they can almost confirm that Birdwin Don Clay will go further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet was already ready, and people washed their hands with hot water sprinkled with lilacs and sat cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King generously let Baldwin sit in the highest seat with himself, although it can only be said to be with the last seat, but this is already a rare Honored, because at the long table covered with dark red silk, sitting on the King, Princess Leona, Duke of John, Princess Diane and her son - Birdwin’s nominal brother Dylan, princes and The senior magi of the royal family, the priest of the Norman kings and the chief priests, they were placed with gold plates and crystal cups in front of them, and the king’s chief cooker slowly stepped forward in the horn to personally serve the king with bread and butter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the king’s most trusted finance minister, Fu Kai, sat on the second-class seat, surrounded by lords and knights, who looked at Baldwin The eyes are full of embarrassment, a veteran Woking who is close to the green eyes when he plays with the intimate prince of Fukai. He is half-truthfully claiming to pull the bloody and despicable person from the high table. Drop his robes, tear off his necklace, collect his weapons, and hang him on the wall to dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can't be done," Fukai said with a smile, and he whispered when the servant under his head gave him bread and butter. After he left, he continued: "He is a person who is loyal to the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't we not?" Sir Alex said indignantly, "My mother is the daughter of the Marquis!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because of this, Fukai is bored Shredded bread, the wheat flour used in the bread provided today has been finely sieved 20 times, soft and golden, the aroma of the grain is strong and pleasant, and the butter is delicate as the tip of a girl's tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king deliberately favored Byrdwin, a civilian of unknown origin, which had some real affection. After all, they fought side by side in Thunder for many years, but more He is the flag that the king showed to the courtiers. Look, as long as you are loyal enough, even if it is only a bottom-level small person, you can become a little baby trusted by the rulers of this country. This is not without any effect. It is true that some knights are willing to give everything to their king in order to become the second Byrdwin. According to Fukai, some knights even mortgage the land and houses to replace the soldiers, weapons and equipment. To enrich the power of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people heard the sound of the snare, the wine servants brought wine and honey, the wine was in the big wooden barrel, and the strong servants opened the wood. The faucet at the bottom of the barrel, the blood and amber wine rushed into the big gold cup or the big silver cup inlaid with jewels. The guests are willing to drink directly from the cup. If you want to pour it into the small cup you carry with you, you can. Wild boars, deer, cattle and argali, all kinds of rare beasts and birds were cooked and sent to the table, and the bard played his sitar or Solt Lily, accompanied by music. With the singing, people indulge in eating and chewing, only a few people's minds have completely gone to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin is concentrating on capturing Penny’s every move. His wife, Penny, is not yet qualified to sit with the king, but her position is far away. Dewen is not too far away, the flames in the hearth are burning, and the seven rifle from the top of the dome makes the whole hall bright as white - she is thin, but it is beautiful, maybe those The gift played a role, and Birdwin thought, and he looked at Penny's long, black hair with a novelty. It was high up, with flowers and delicate hairpins. She was pale and worried about Bedwin. Whether she is sick or not able to rest well - she has always been like this in the past few years, she will be tossing and turning for a few days before he returns, it is difficult to sleep; her lips are coated with bright rouge, Baldwin I sincerely hope that it is made of roses instead of meteorites. He has heard the smell of meteorites from his colleagues and tastes sour and bitter, but because it is stronger and longer lasting than the rouge made of rose juice, There are still many women who use this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny is struggling not to see her lover. For some malicious arrangement, her lover is arranged to sit opposite her, and the two can only look up when they look up – she notices that he is wearing a lock. Zijia came to the meeting, and every look he saw in Bedwin would make her heart violently twist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny’s pleasing pleasing eyes to her lover when the servant’s chicken sauce was mixed with the rice and almonds Unexpectedly caught by Birdwin, but the lord of Thunderbolt did not understand what Penny would reveal the sullen expression - it was just a very ordinary young man, hey, if you have to say something. He had a pretty good face - Birdwin toasted him, and after a brief, almost undetectable hesitation, his enemies also raised a shiny silver cup to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Penny is going to faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a lack of interest in food is probably Princess Diane, she is condescending, searching for her goal with that sharp eyes - handsome The knight and the beautiful boy, there are not many such people, but unfortunately most of them have been "taste" by Diane, she swept the past slowly, and stopped at Kerry for a while and then turned to him. On the right side, then the long princess of Norman whispered softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you looking at, mother?" Dylan asked with a good temper, hope is one of the "nightingales", so he will be simple to arrange More. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The black hair," said Diane: "If I am not mistaken, black eyes, sitting next to Kerry Ben, white robe - he is a "Priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Dylan glanced at the opportunity to raise his glass: "He is a mage, a half-elf."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is he strong?" said Diane, pinching a piece of venison with his fingers and eating it with gusto, her appetite came back with her other kind of ** It is. If the answer is yes, she has to reserve more strength for tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe," Dylan said with some helplessness: "I am not sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If he had fought a fierce orc, he believed that he would not be too weak when faced with a wonderful **," said Diane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
