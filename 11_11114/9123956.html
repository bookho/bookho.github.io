			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a brilliant street. ..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls, the natural light is covered by artificial light, and every place here is like a flame. The people who come and go are dressed in lavish manners, and even the waiters and servants are covered with silk cloaks and cloaks. These precious fabrics reflect the dazzling fascination under the golden light of palm oil and whale oil. Light - all the mansions, facing the street are the colonnades supported by countless columns. These colonnades are tightly connected, not the white alabaster pillars holding multi-color mosaic tiles. The black sandalwood pillars carry stacked cedar stigmas, and even if the drizzle continues, the people walking in the colonnade will not get wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you can only say that the merchants here are swimming in this vast black water, although there are thousands of gold coins every night. Flowing in and out between their fingers, but they are only allowed to do ordinary transactions - like silk wood sesame oil and ordinary slaves. From time to time, there are idiots who are new to the first time, or deliberately make a big voice, accompanied by echoes of disgusting and irritating eyes, but generally no one will go against those people, and only standing here is newcomers. It is not easy to find a place here, and the thieves and assassins who wander here will soon help them solve any unruly voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They trade as if they have met the best friend, if the buyer and the seller wear robes with wide sleeves, then they will hold in the sleeves Holding each other's hands, bargaining with the feeling of the fingers. Merchants in Grenada sometimes come up with goods that are extremely attractively priced – they are mostly stolen goods, but for merchants, the origin of the goods is not what they care most, they can earn from them. How much profit is taken, this is why many outsiders are willing to pay large sums of money in exchange for the qualification to enter the black market. Of course, this method is only suitable for buyers and non-Grenada sellers, only through the Grenada. A rigorous tester can be lucky enough to play for Grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A highland Norman businessman showed a satisfied smile, he only used a price of one-third of the usual price to buy a ship of silk, these silks are from When Serris came, he had already paid a hundred gold coins to the batch of goods. Silk was produced in every place, but only the silk of Serris was the most silky and bright, and the heirs of Norman had been born. For this, Man Wang held a 90-day banquet and asked the merchants to take out a lot of silk so that he could wrap the whole king with silk. For the whole, the silk resources of the Norman King’s capital in the Highlands have dried up. Even if he rents the silk at the usual price, he can make the gold coins pile up in his own room, let alone he only took out the original one-third of the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not satisfied with this, in order to thank Greed, he also needs to worship the icon and symbol of the great goddess, as well as slaves, "I still need some ewes that are pregnant," he said. "Dedicated to a sacred and wise mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada’s businessman glances at In the first half of the sentence, the Norman merchants in Highland can go out and buy from the lord, but since he said that these are dedicated to the mother - all he needs is a slave, pregnant. The slave, "Do you want a black ewes? Or a white ewes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mother likes the black ewes, or the white mother What about sheep?” asked Norman’s businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada’s businessman smiled a little and waited until his hand was stuffed with a beautiful red garnet to give the answer: “The one The noble mother never minds the color of the skin, but the beautiful face and noble identity will make her happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman businessman frowned at once If it is only a slave, a serf or a civilian, the problem will not be great, but a beautiful woman like a noble person is not from a powerful family or a family with a bloodline. It’s hard to get in, let alone take the mother with the child – after a moment of indulging, he simply took out a small bag of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have some pure-bred ewes here, and some have a crown on their heads." The merchants of Grenada said after smiling. The troops of Grenada were swept from a neighboring Principality. One of them was the servant of Dagong, and the maids of her, all of whom were the daughters of Sir Alex and the Knights. The skin was tender and tender. It is a condensed milk fat - they are ruthlessly smashed on their way back to Grenada, and many people are pregnant. After being pregnant, the girls will be gathered together to get more food and water, and they will not have to be insulted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fifty." The merchants of Grenada said that their hands were once again handed over together, and the sellers reported The price made Norman’s businessman startled. “This...” He suddenly bit his tongue, but the screams that were previously surprised have attracted a few unsightly sights, his sweat immediately. Immersed the back and the palm of my hand, the businessman of Grenada grinned in disgust, but he needed this person, so he pulled the other hand and brought his attention back to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I may only buy five." Norman’s businessman said with dismay that the grandfather’s prostitute would not count on her, and her price was the highest. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can come up with what we need," the merchant of Grenada said: "Exchange is also possible."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?" Norman’s businessman asked with expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada’s businessman continually said the names of several goods, but several of them even the Norman’s businessman had never heard of it, he sighed Shaking his head, he wanted to trade a piece of goods with the new king, but now it is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So black iron..." The merchant of Grenada whispered, "And, what about stainless steel?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman’s businessman trembled. Of course, Highland Norman had iron ore, so black iron and steel were originally one of Norman’s productions, not only in production, but also in quality. The leader, but from the beginning of Norman, the sale of black iron and steel is not allowed to be written in the law of Wangdu. Merchants who dare to sell black iron and steel will be confiscated of all property and then sentenced to death. He didn't want to stand in the cage and be starved to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if not a lot? The new king does not trust the knights and lords who used to be loyal to the pharaohs. They were deprived of the title and drove out of the kingdom. Since they are no longer knights, their armor, shields and spears, and Of course, the wide sword is useless. It can be purchased at a very cheap price. He can buy the sword shields and send them to Norman in the name of scrap antiques or something else, but he may not have that much time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then set up a contract." The merchant of Grenada said after a moment of thinking: "I can allow you to owe, but the corresponding black Iron and steel you have to gather in a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman’s businessman is of course willing, the problem is that everyone knows Grenada’s The contract was not established in the temple of the god of fairness and justice, and the red robes of Grenada were guaranteed for this contract, and each red robes was so evil and deceitful - he did not dare Signing this name on such a contract, perhaps this is a contract to sell the soul to the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are still unacceptable," said the merchant of Grenada: "Then I can only say that the timid can only get to the dregs and Garbage," he said scornfully, then turned to receive another guest, who came from Longhuo Island, where he sold cane sugar and beet sugar and bought back slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least let me sign the contract I will sign." Norman’s businessman pleaded, and the object he was begging was impatiently out of a blind man. I took out a piece of parchment and threw it to him. Norman’s businessman had a lot of parchment in his throat. He was relieved. In any case, the evil and terrible contract would not be casually thrown into a common In the scorpion, he pulled open the parchment that was rolled up together - there was no gold rim and no pattern, it was a piece of stuff similar to the parchment he used to keep accounts. The contract was simple and clear. The blank part is used to fill in the content. Although the interest in the contract is very high, but he only has more peace of mind, the merchants of the Grenada suddenly feel good and heartfelt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the Dragon Fire Island now?" The merchant of Grenada asked unintentionally, but the guests from Longhuo Island certainly knew that if he Nothing to say, then next time he may not be here, this is one of the contents of the transaction: "As always," he said respectfully: "Calm, but sometimes there will still be battles, the lords are always It’s almost a tradition to cross each other. However, he continued: “The most recent war came from the side island. I don’t know if you know that the owner of the side island is not on the island. He is a mage. So I went out to travel recently, but he handed the side island to his friend management. It was a Norman, it was strange, a Norman, and his soldiers and soldiers’ ancestors became the one. The rulers of the island, yes, do you have slaves of the Normans, they are very rich, and every businessman on the island of Longhuo receives their call, if a Norman slave is sent to them, They are willing to use the equivalent of ordinary Li twice the price of redemption "Here, he suddenly paused, exposed look of regret:" Maybe I should not tell you that this news "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;..</div>
