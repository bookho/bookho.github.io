			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A businessman screams at Demon, deeply, not to a Master, but to a consul, who is the leader of the White Tower Cloth Guild It is three times as old as Demon, but he is still humble as Demon's most loyal servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon just nodded that he had accepted this respect. Since he became the consul, he has received more respect and surrender than his father and his More brothers, those who have ignored him and ignored him, are willing to kneel at his feet, listen to his decree, and act with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down behind the desk of the consul, which was made of rare tulip wood, with extravagant gold inlaid with gold, vermilion The front panel is engraved with peacocks and lions. The former is the symbol of the morning god Rosada, while the latter represents their princely lords. Demon considers when it is possible to replace the peacock that disgusts him. Sitting down on the high back chair behind the table, this chair has the same material and more exquisite as the table, but unfortunately it is not very comfortable to sit up - although it has a velvet cushion filled with feathers, but the back of the chair It's too high and the sculpting is too complicated. When you sit down too well, they will poke your back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also change this chair, Demon thinks, in fact, he wants to change the decoration of the entire room, it is easy to let others Think of the former consul - that is, his father, although he is very incompetent - whether as an official or a father. Demon will re-arrange the room according to his own preferences. He has imagined to use the Mithril rune to hang the walls of the room, or to hide them under the mahogany floor, covering the silk carpet, in the triangle. The wand and the reel were displayed in the cupboard and the multi-storey cabinet, and the golem was placed at the window and the door... Then he shook his head, no, it was not a consul’s room, it was a mage’s room, he might be able to get less Put on a little magical tool, but don't make it too distinctive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can build a tower for himself. Before he even thought he could get this position, his best idea was to force Antonio to return. In his father's manor, he then took his own tower, but now he can have his own tower - before Demon had the right to read the scrolls and instruments, he never knew that the White Tower was so rich - transit tax , market tax, transaction tax, personal freedom tax (when a serf is liberated), inheritance tax... wartime tax and disease tax paid in the event of war and plague... and charter and monopoly warrants - just cloth The leader of the guild came to obtain a scarlet velvet monopoly warrant, for which he sent a gemstone and Mithril worth a thousand gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the White Tower, Demon's father also has two manors and surrounding woodland and cultivated land. The management of the manor will send various taxes including marriage tax, forest land tax, waste tax and head tax every year. Mills and bakeries , the rent of cattle, farm tools, and all the harvests on the farmland belonging to the owner (for the farming of the serfs and tenants). These former governors never said to Demon that he only talked about matters with his eldest son, but Yadel was explicitly told that he would own half of the annual income of one of the estates after becoming the chief pastor, and Demon only Can become one of the management of the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now they all belong to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You could have gotten more," said a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demon jumped out of the chair, and he fiercely slammed into the source of the sound and made an aggressive spell gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two venomous snakes emit their own unique laughter: "Your mentor, my master asked me to see you - oh, poor little Demon, only got such a little bit of something, but he is already satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon is not surprised by the visit of the mentor, he has Prepare, even if he is standing in front of him is a mentor, he will not be more flustered: "Call to my respectable mentor," he crossed his hands on his shoulders and bowed reverently: "Just think "Take a temporary break," he said. "I am sorry that I failed to follow the original plan - but as we have seen, things have changed so little..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," the Venomous Devil said contemptuously: "Your father and brother have been sent to you to mourn the wasteland," it said, squirming and hanging from it. Hanging down on the light stand, let the two shovel-shaped heads face the mage wearing a black robe: "And your brother, too Not far from death, there are only two left in the blood of the White Tower and the Lord of the Hill, and you, you, you should kill her, and then inherit all the things she left behind," Shouting his head and slamming his wings violently, "You are stopping at this time, stupid boy, what are you thinking about? Don't tell me that you want to match that female, her body is flowing. Stinky blood, the blood of the elf, you can find other females, as long as you kill her, become the master of this land, you love to find that female match, you can even summon a succubus! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf will immediately sever the relationship with the White Tower, which will affect his tax and other income. After all, most of the merchants here are for the jungle." Sugar, lead, fine gold secret silver - Demon said in his heart, but his mentor's magic pet is not wrong, he was indeed attracted by the Anzhen - the last time he saw Anzhen is still a few Years ago, at that time, she was just a kid-like wild girl. He had a sneer at his brother’s fascination until he Seeing her, she completely changed, like a caterpillar turned into a butterfly. She is beautiful and elegant, and she is pure and pure, which is suitable for his wife's request - although the other half of her body still makes Germany I feel uncomfortable, but this shortcoming can be tolerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he gets all he wants, he will kindly give her a peaceful death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought about it," Demon argued. "She is just a threatening child, a little girl, but if she dies... of course I will become the sole owner of this land. The problem is that Luzer, the lord of our princes, has been holding the white tower and the hills, eager to take it for himself, then I It will become very dangerous - as long as I am dead, Dagong will be able to take back the territory given by his ancestors on the grounds that San Rieg's direct blood has died."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake snake is full of suspicion and looks at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just wait a few years," Demon said. "I promise not to be long, but I really need time to clean up the white towers that belong to my father and The power of the elder brother..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five years," Demon Observing the look of the magic pet, but no one can see anything from a flat face covered with fine scales: "Maybe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stagnation for a while, like listening to something: "One year," it said with the left head: "The guild must have a fixed and reliable stronghold in the White Tower within a year - and then, for up to two years, you have to be white The true master of the tower and the hills, don't worry about Luzer Dagong," the head on the right side secretly cracked his mouth and revealed his fangs: "No thief or assassin can be stronger than the guild." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demon clenched his lips tightly, and the threatened anger burned his eyes and tongue, but he still restrained Didn't let the deadly spell spill over his lips; he knew that he was not talking about a simple pet, he stood behind his mentor, and his mentor stood behind the guild, his fingers unconsciously Touching the ring that he never leaves, spinning, the large inlaid gemstone ring also contains a secret silver ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he is still a second son who is not valued, he is happy to receive instructions, which indicates that he is useful to the guild and can receive rewards, but he is now Already the owner of the White Tower, he will be the owner of the hills in the future. He does not want to be controlled by the guild at all, and continues to contribute his talents and wealth to them - but this is not something he can decide, even if there are no sinister poisons. The assassin, he can not violate the intention of the guild, Demon had signed a vicious and meticulous contract with his mentor, the contract stipulated the number of years he must serve his mentor, if his actions can not let him The instructor is satisfied that his mentor can transfer the contract to other casters or devils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mage had thought about using the secret silver of the White Tower and other precious casting materials to exchange the contract, but since he came to warn him of the mentor's magic, he said that he had lost the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Answer!" The double-headed snake yelled with its two heads together: "Kid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Demon weakly lowered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know," said the Lich: "My mentor used to be ten Tracking a gray robe called Praton for a few years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor Beavis," Antonio Master exclaimed, holding his beard "I have seen his wife, a beautiful and kind lady, whose fate is cruel and unfair to her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In these ten years, I The mentor has accumulated a lot of experience in fighting against such evil people, especially for the gray robe.” The Lich continued: “Although I only had half a round (six years) with him, I already I learned a lot from him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like what you did in Beavis's home," said Antonio Master, sincerely: "I I want to thank you on behalf of every mage who uses this formula, Kremar, you are a tolerant and generous good boy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lemon Up He said that he had accepted this compliment humbly, and then he straightened up and said the most important part: "And the evil gray robe, Master Praton once cast a spell, this spell is not complicated, but it Almost killed my mentor - it made my mentor think that his wife's soul still exists and is in the hands of Praton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Kerry's eyes were slightly lit, and the Lich knew he had guessed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Praden summoned the soul of my mentor's wife - it seems so, in fact, it is changed by a sly devil, When my mentor gave up the rebellion, he rushed to try to bite his throat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He didn't succeed." The Elf Ranger is sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
