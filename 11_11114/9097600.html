She was already dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eccentric, strange new gods Most of the pastors are women with dragons and blood, they are both warlocks and pastors, and Extremely embarrassed, fortunately, after they prayed to their gods, the feedback from each other was so weak that they could not cast powerful magic, so the resistance of Rosada and the priest of Ilmot was not so strong. Some of the pastors escaped through the dark passages in the prayer room, and one of them was followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is facing down on the rock, the sharp corners of the rock, but she has lost the right to feel uncomfortable - Ilmot A young priest turned her over, and the priest's hair and body clothes were almost burned, but there was nothing to appreciate. Her skin was like a scorched pig, black and white. The translucent blood flowed out, the lips turned upwards, and the swollen tongue stretched out. Although this time, this place, the time of discovery was so short, but her body was still vaguely stinking, the priest of good God. They whispered to each other and could not confirm which brother might have caught up with her and destroyed it so thoroughly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that, except for those pastors who were injured or died in rebellion, other pastors were only detained and waiting for Harvey’s grand trial to be judged. There is solid evidence that they have violated the laws of Bibi Dibao, and they will be expelled from Bibi Dibao at the very least. Bibi Dibao is not just a city. The surrounding land, the whole sea otter belongs to Bi The dynasty of the dynasty, of course, is now the Grand Duke of Harvey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Rosada held out his hands, and the morning light flashed golden light on the back of his hand. He silently sought help from his god - a moment later The warm and gentle wind of the stock passed over his cheek. He smelled a fragrant smell that was not supposed to be at this time. It was clear to the heart but at the same time the creepy chief pastor took back his hands and bowed to Rosada. The highest respect and gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should go back," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse of the priest of Greedy was burned to ashes by the fireball thrown by the accompanying mage, and then collected by the spell, although they were disposed of in the original place, It’s not a bad ending to take them away by the mountain wind, but think of the blood in their bodies, whether it is Rosada or the priest of Ilmot, they feel that they are cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the priests of Greety failed to obtain the right to stand up to the temple and the sanctuary in the inner city of Bibi Dibao from the former Harvey Archon and then Harvey, they were still in the outer city, a slut. The occupied wasteland created a shrine, which is a baby compared to the shrines in other places. Perhaps these pastors also think that this is just a transitional place - but even so, this temple still has other shrines. The incomparable extravagance and luxury, the black stone and iron threshold required are directly from the port, the threshold and the wall are inlaid with obsidian and ruby, the flame in the temple is endless, the pastors are not Putting it into the myrrh and other precious spices, as soon as you enter it, people will fall into a hot and chaotic emotion. Their reason and thoughts are like being outlined by the gold thread. The black iron gate was isolated outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is most evident in women, especially those who are wives and daughters, who are listening to the priests of Greety When the fortress built the goddess's palace on the ground, it was ecstatic. Before they had to quietly, they ran across the hills and ran to the Great Hall of the White Tower to pray that they would always have the husband's favor. Cursing her husband's lover to death or abortion, and being able to exalt and prosper, so when their husbands attempt to exile the governor Harvey and his party, some have the trust of husband or father. Women who are aware of love are rejoicing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When their husband/father is hung outside the Chamber of Deputies, and they are exiled with their family members, they not only have no regrets Annoyed, but it has become more and more mad. They either directly claim that Harvey is a blasphemy, or they dedicate everything (including young children) to Greedy, and even more to Greedy. They refused to come out of the temple. After the priests of Greedy fled, they even raised their weapons and torches against the soldiers of Beitburg and the priests of the gods. After discovering that their resistance was useless, some women cut off. Your own neck, or. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether there are people who have doubts about the practice of Bituminburg, probably only those who are trapped in the wasteland, whether it is out What kind of thoughts, the arrogant and cruel Greedy priests not only did not force them to go, but allowed them to live around the temple - when the priests of Ilmot and Rosada walked in the mist at dawn At that time, a child of the refugees discovered that he and his companions, his family yelled and screamed, and alerted the priest of Gredi, so that the whole operation had an ominous embarrassment at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the child was caught. He was filled with resentment and contempt for these Grepidian enemies. When a priest of Ilmot wanted to contact him, he was bitten by him and his bones were visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief pastor of Rosada stood in the morning light and prayed to his god, in front of him a piece knocked from the temple of Gredi The black rock fragments, after a long chanting and singing, a light golden morning light falls in his silver cup, the chief priest lifts it, closes his eyes, sip a sip, and then sip the water in the cup Slowly pour over the black gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the blackened ice encountered the hottest flame, the rock melted at once, and with it, Gray The first temple, the whole temple is like being pinched by an invisible giant hand, smashing and smashing, and the chief priest has not poured all the glass of water on the fragments of the rock, where the temple was originally stood, except There is nothing left outside of a piece of piecemeal glass, which may have been condensed by the quartz contained in the black rock, the last trace of the temple left in this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief pastor of Rosada heard someone crying and cursing, and some angry soldiers attempted to take these people out of the crowd, Alva Master I waved my hand, this is something that made him helpless too - these displaced people only got some small profits from the priest of Rosada, like the wasteland that did not belong to anyone (they actually Not being beaten), cheap and effective ointment, buying their children is more reasonable than the Thieves Guild, etc... But these meager benefits are enough for them to be grateful to this strange god It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that this situation is happening in any corner of this road, the Master can’t help but shudder, he can’t imagine if these priests would enter the tourmaline. In the Dyke Fortress, the tourmaline will become what it looks like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." A weak female voice said slightly: "Who should we pray to when we want children?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is also a contract for marriage..." A businessman said with dissatisfaction, "A marriage contract that does not receive a divine testimony is invalid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Agreeing to go to the temple of Tyre," Alva Master said without saying: "I want my child to pray to Jammu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the businessman suddenly became weird. Of course, the marriage contract between men and women is not because of love, but also because of love, more family and family, workshops and workshops, business partners and business partners, or knights and knights. Between the door and the door, it is because of the consideration of the interests, let the fair and fair Tell to witness - just like signing a commercial contract, you can certainly get his shelter and care, the problem is... ... well, his poor children, now that only a trace of enthusiasm and warmth in the ceremony of the marriage contract is gone, let them curse Harvey and Alva, this is not something that he can stop alone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Temple of Bibi Dibao has no enquiry." A soldier reminded Master Alva. Jammu is the god of the earth. Her temple is more located in the vast plains and wilderness. It is rare in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pastor of Jammu will arrive at Bibi Dibao tomorrow." Master Alva said that before the action, they would contact the main hall of Jammu. On several occasions, the priest of Jammu’s priest was given tolerance and timely help in this matter. Of course, for a pastor, spreading the doctrine and finding more believers for his gods was also a piece of A must-have job that cannot be deducted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy suddenly stopped, she walked in the bottomless abyss with a human female gesture, but even the most stupid inferior would not think Fortunately, I met a soul that fell from the devil or the devil's claws. She surrounded the dark red flame, radiating heat to the invisible distance, and the soul worms in the melting salt brine river. At the beginning, it was silently melted into the deadly breath. The devil did not escape, but squatted on the ground to show respect and surrender. In front of her, whether it was a lava torrent flowing over a rock or a poisonous infiltration by blood. The mud can't stop one or two, and the towering cliffs shattered in front of her, like an invisible profit. Open them and stretch out countless white bones from under the broken canyon. The tower bridge they built trembled in the crying wind, and Greedy walked away without fear, leaving a black mark behind her. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the passage is a tower, with no less than one hundred towers built on the soul of the king of the Ukrainian kingdom, each tower There are countless faces and countless limbs that capture any soul that is tempted by their dance and singing, whether human or demonic, and then shred it to fill the part that is merged or missing. A soul looks down. When she sees the red robes of Grety, she makes a cry that all souls can't compare. She used to be the priest of Gredi, but fell into the trap of Grazite. She couldn't break free by her own strength, and she was tortured all the time. She couldn't be relieved. When she saw the god that she had given her life and faith, she would be astonished by the kind of her side. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
