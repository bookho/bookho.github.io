They were taken away from the entire village by an entire village and then sent to the hands of slave traders after a long journey. They were forcibly broken up and divided into old ones. Young, young, young, and divided into men and women, the same is true for children. They don’t know where they will be brought, nor where their relatives are, not that no one wants to resist, but The rebellious people were pierced by the soldiers' spears; when they were merchants, they were hungry and thirsty. They got a bowl of turbid soup, and there was a herb in the soup. They lost consciousness when they drank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the kind of herb." Birdwin said that on the side of the island, only the lord's mansion can see the glamorous flowers. Plants, this is to ensure that slaves who are unable to get rid of the control of the herb can continue to survive, and handed over to the druids and pastors for experimentation and testing, as their understanding of the herb gradually deepens, The taboos are becoming more and more intense. It is said that the pastor of the god of morning light has submitted relevant documents to the main hall, asking the followers of Rosada to try to curb the spread of this plant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s disappointing that the movements of the white robes are not as fast as they are ideal, but there are several countries under the help of Pastor Gredith. The herb was started with the rulers of the region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as we said before, the ointments, pills and potions made from this herb quickly replaced most of the expensive ones because of their low price. Similar kind of supplies, some short-sighted civilians even reduced the number of prayers to go to the temple of the gods such as Rosada, and ran to sacrifice the Gredi, just because the priests in the Temple of Greed promised, as long as they can Let Greedy see his piety and get the herb products free from their hands. Although both Rosada and Tell have made a clear decree, it is certain that Gredi is just a false god, but those who live in difficulty It is not fully understood by the hard-working human beings (in fact, even some of the nobles' beliefs are not so stable), they only ask if the white robes can come up with something comparable to this herb, can't they? That's fine. You can't stop me from believing in a god that can give me this. What about fake gods? If you don't have this herb, maybe you are unfortunately injured or sick, they will go to the plains of mourning in two or three days. The harm of the herb to the human body is not as fast and obvious as the aconite or the mandala, so all the persuasion and guidance becomes extremely difficult. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the side islands, the original slaves also have people who are gradually becoming awake, but they are not so ecstatic, but become frustrated and disappointed. They want to be more "quiet" than long-term life, just like In the past, I felt no pain and I could not feel hunger. There are also some Norman soldiers who are misguided. Birdwin doesn't know how they are obsessed with this slow and deadly poison. Later, a thief who played for Gülen glimpsed the secret and remembers those scattered scattered on the coastline. The pub and the hotel on the edge? There is a mixture of fish and dragons, and of course, the tourists who sell this herb are ignorant of the harm of this herb, and the Norman soldiers who have paid great rewards because of the generosity of the lord have become the object of their struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Birdwin furious, almost overnight, and the pubs and inns on the side of the island were reduced to the original one-tenth. The wooden cards marked with the charge were hanged, their bodies were hung on wooden shelves, and the seabirds landed on their shoulders, licking their eyes, whether it’s a drug dealer or a tavern It is the same as the owner of the hotel. The priests walked between the soldiers and the knights, looking for soldiers who had been tempted by this drug to repair them. They wanted to keep them. After all, they are still weak, and in the knight’s thought, drug addiction can be spelled. And the demon is lifted, but Birdwin believes in Kremar, or believes that Kerry, the black hair's caster, said that the worst thing about this drug is not only the body it is controlled by. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers are likely to be attracted and wrapped up again, or not, but Birdwin is not willing to gamble, especially in winning the face. when. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Cobbert saw this unpleasant sight as soon as he entered the side island, he could not help but sigh, he There were also two crew members on board, so he was fired. "And Bibi Dibao is not so peaceful," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Li Oona asked with concern, after all, if they were to return to the land from Longhuo Island, then Bibi Dibao is the most reliable and most A convenient channel, she knows that the ruler of Betty Dyke is now the former governor of Harvey, but she is not very familiar with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bibi Dibao is also in an unstable state, its sky is still blue, but from the perspective of Cobbert, it still has the same as before the hurricane Black clouds gather in the heart of Harvey Dagong.
