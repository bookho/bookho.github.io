He should not blame his knights and soldiers. They trusted Yadell for no reason. When they, their wives, children and parents were ruthlessly expelled from Thunderbolt by New King and Dylan because of Bedwin’s relationship. Later, as their master, Birdwin was still ignorant of exile from their place thousands of miles away - this was not Baldwin's fault, but at the time he did not take on the responsibility of a lord - - It was Yadel who led them to find water on the deserted plains, identify the direction, collect herbs, build tents, dig traps, and lead them to escape from the orcs' claws and thieves' swords again and again, if Yadel How many people were finally able to leave Norman in the Highlands? How many, dozens, or a few? At that time, Yadel had not received the forgiveness of Rosada. He could not pray for the magical skills, nor could he get the guidance of the gods. He was just an ordinary person with a charge on his face. He could do this and how much effort he spent. It is self-evident that, as Leona said, he should not hate and hate Yadel. On the contrary, he should love him, thank him, and give him the reward and trust he deserves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t want to do this, and Baldwin knew that his soul would cry every night, but he just couldn’t control himself. Especially after he knew that Yadell had regained the favor of Rosada, how serious is the crime of Yadel, a god, a close relative. Isn't it more terrible than misconduct and negligence? How long has the White Tower’s disaster been? Two years or three years? His god will forgive him, and his god? Tyre of justice and justice, why not forgive him? From the gnome, he got a chain made of countless small iron rings. The first thing he wakes up every day is to reach out and touch one of them, but Tyre has only given him disappointment again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he not devout enough? perhaps. Look at Yadel, is he able to get Rosada's forgiveness, is it because he saved the lives of these people? If Tyre is also so hopeful and demanding, then he can do it too. He can also let Tyre get the glory that other gods can't get. He can do better than anyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Leona’s reminder is quite timely and correct. After discovering his own mistakes, Birdwin will not stubbornly turn a blind eye or fail to put down his dignity to correct him, and Leona is not only his lover, but also his Respected and loyal to the king. He immediately accepted the correction of the prince, and as soon as the next thing started, it would not be too difficult, and the ending would always be happy. The Cavaliers looked at his lord with joy and looked at his hand. Standing up, taking off his necklace and hanging it on his neck, and untied the short sword to hang him in his waist. When the knight and the soldiers cheered from the heart, they kept pressing on the shoulder of Birdwin. The stone with the heart has also been removed, and Yadel’s hand is so warm and powerful. He will become a reliable friend and comrade-in-arms like Xiu. Putting the sharp edge at the enemy and giving the back to them is what a follower of Tell should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is not convinced. He was not working for the devil, and when it came to Tyre, this guy didn't seem to have done anything good with him - he couldn't even do it with a gray robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant gave them twenty days, in fact, these twenty days were mainly used on Bywin’s new arm, if he could not return to the dragon temporarily Fire Island, then except for the last step. He can prepare all the previous things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can only one mage be able to cast spells on it?" Princess Leona asked, there is a mage in the Normans in the Highlands, those who climbed to the side islands. Merchants also have, if necessary, they can hire outside the casters for the managers of the side islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomish McGee lazily raised his eyes, "Yes," he said. "The magical fluctuations of each caster are different, even though we are very It's hard to see, but if the magic of the child belongs to a caster, and the caster of the parent belongs to another caster, even the ordinary golem will fail, let alone the silver golem."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona didn’t think that the merchants would hire a caster for them, strange wizards or warlocks would be unreliable, and they couldn’t force the gnomes to accept The two casters, now Craigar, are enough to make them dissatisfied. If it weren’t for the gnomes, there would be few wizards—at least not in their ethnic group. Even Krimer could not intervene in the gnomes. Go to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnomes are uneasily whispering, apparently they also thought of what Leona thought of. They licked their little feet and grabbed the rune seal hanging on their chest. With a small sword, the fiercely glanced around the knights and soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," said Byrdwin. "Before I was wrong - even without arms, I was Bywin. Don Cray," he still felt heartache when he mentioned this surname, except Dylan. Old Don Cray, he lived up to the old man's care, although he believed that he would return to the highland Norman back to Thunderbolt one day. "Is my children refused to admit that I am their because I lost an arm?" "Lord?" He smiled and looked around. "Is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will always be our lord!" a soldier immediately shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our loyalty belongs only to Highland Norman, Thunder and Don Clay!" The Cavaliers repaired a sigh, and Leona gave him a slight jaw because She knows that for these people, Norman in the Highlands is not referring to the broad land, nor the new king and his son who wear the crown at this time, just as he refers to Don Cray is not Dylan Donkley. Birdwin Don Clay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have come back to you," said another knight. "We will not leave unless you want to expel us."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless I am dead." Baldwin immediately said: "Otherwise I will always guard you, just as you are loyal to me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnomes have grimacing or vomiting. They are all selfish people, and they don’t care much about land and surnames. They settled in Longhuo Island. It's just because they hate dwarves and hate elves, and hate ignorant mortals who fear the machinery they make, even if the local rulers are willing to tolerate their existence for the wealth of gnomes. If there are sanctuaries, shrines, and mage towers not far from the gnomes, it is difficult for them to continue their lives and work with peace of mind, because gnomes use gems and runes to make runes and runes that can be used by mortals. The relationship between the seals, the Master and the Warlock think they have smashed magic. The mage who has a better temper will just drive them away. If they encounter gray robes or red robes, then they are not a tool that is worse than slaves or killed, and pastors and priests consider them to be false believers or unbelievers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they have almost no concept of the country, responsibility, and loyalty. Instead of letting them move, these human gestures flashed their titanium dog eyes to a certain extent—they didn’t believe every word that the Normans in the Highlands said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now both Yadell and Kreima, Gavin is not there, they are even more unscrupulous, ordinary steel and fists can't hurt them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to these gnomes?" The Cavalier said: "What bad things have you eaten?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can be said to have taken the most serious one seriously. The Normans in the Highlands are much taller and stronger than the adult males on the mainland. Many gnomes have almost only his thighs, one with Zhang’s tender face and gorgeous dress make the Cavaliers look like they are in the window of the Wangdu shop, a gleaming large doll. To be honest, his hand has been a little itchy. After he found an excuse, he did not hesitate to mention one, curiously secretly examined it, while still pretending to slap the back of the gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome wants to crush the rune seal on his body or pull out the little sword to give him a look, but he is "faced" by the knight "The specific posture can refer to those turtles that are held up by unscrupulous humans. His short arm does not touch the small sword hanging on the leg. The rune seal hanging on the chest is pressed against his chest and the knight. Between the palms, and the knight constantly patted behind his back. His eyes were black in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other gnomes, including McGee, carefully observed for a while and found that their tribes would not suffer any real harm. Without hesitation, he ran away with hesitation, and then laughed at the look of the people who felt safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin couldn’t help but smile for a while, taking the gnome from the repaired hand, "I think he is already good." He said seriously, that The gnome was going crazy, and as soon as he fell to the ground, he rushed to take a bite on the knight's leg. Even forgetting that he still has short swords and magic runes, and after a bite of dust he hated and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women Li Ona is even more blushing, she is more healthy and beautiful than when she is still in the kingdom, the kind of self-confidence and pride It is like a heat that is constantly emanating from her body. If Pharaoh sees her now, she will feel very happy. "When are they going to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight," said Bydwin: "Although we still have Gavin, Alva Master recommends How long we can hide this message for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean...Amos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is now the lord of the East Crown," Birdwin said: "He has the right to solicit any A caster who is willing to work for him," he said with a slight smile: "Although Krimaar signed a contract with him, no matter what the contract is, there are omissions to find."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Li Naina was once the heir to a huge kingdom, and of course she would not have any objection to it. In fact, even if Kreima is still on the side of the island, they will not be unprepared, and the island is actually It is too rich, and thanks to the volcano, the current East Crown can be said to be devastated. For several years, it is difficult to restore the previous grand occasion. The importance of the side island to the East Crown lord has reached a new level. In ten years (one-third or one-quarter of a mortal life), he couldn’t get involved. Even with one-tenth of the tax, it’s an unbearable loss – if it’s Leona. She will also toss and turn, trying to find out what to find out from this contract. Use portion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those priests of Talos, although they don’t know how the magistrates around Amos are dealing with them, they must calm the anger of Talos. I’m afraid that it’s not one or two grand sacrifices – no one and Cremari or Kerry Ben, those slaves who survived the hot lava and dust may end up One death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly know that the lich thinks, maybe the soul of the outsider knows, But he also knows that the time it takes to change it is far more than the destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not him." The avatar of the fire element said, "She" appeared in the obsidian disk connected to the fire element, just like an adult female elf. Slender and graceful, her body is composed entirely of blue-blue flames, and the red and gold flames wrap her "body" like a transparent neon. Her eyes are incredibly bright white, if no spells are released, even It’s the current lich, and it’s hard to get burned in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is sleeping." The Lich said, while extending his hands: "You should feel it, he is me, and I am him."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the fire element avatar said: "You are two souls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
