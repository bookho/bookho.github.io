Liona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German picked up an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him come to me." Birdwin said, not because of anything else, but the horses prepared by the knights are the tallest and strongest of the people. And Mei Mei actually remembers to bring him a chain armor, although it is not a secret silver but a steel, but it is always more reliable than the velvet cloak on Leona, but he just reached out and the little boy jerked Turning around, grabbed Leona's waist and buried her head deeply in the arms of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief smirked out of time, and Baldwin frowned at him. “Nothing,” said Leona. “You are safer at him,” she said softly to the child in her arms. “He is my knight, loyal and brave. He will protect you. Like protecting me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swear with my last name." Birdwin said that the boy did not reject his hands, and Bydwin put him In front of himself, he fixed him with a leather belt, "Wait," said Leona, looking for a brooch from her pocket to Bedwin, and Bydwin took it. On the boy's collar. Although the light here is dark, Mei Mi can still recognize that the brooch is inlaid with amethyst and moonstone, and she also knows that the virgin will not come up with a brooch that is useless except for decoration. "Why are you? Do you want to do this?” she asked, they are not so safe now, and this brooch should not be on Bedwin or Gülen even if it can't be worn on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her mother used him to exchange my freedom." Leona said that if she put it before, she would refuse to answer such a stupid question, but she Knowing that she and Birdwin, the relationship between Gülen and Plum is also very close, and Gülen, although he is a thief, but his performance and behavior can not say how evil, Birdwin Undecided, he always thought that this evil thief would only dare to act arbitrarily. Perhaps, but as a former heir to the throne, Leona saw something more open than Baldwin, and Gülen’s ability was obvious to all. He may be a dagger that has been soaked in venom, but as long as the dagger is facing their enemies, Leona will not make anything to Gülen that makes him jealous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exchange and raise." Gülen interrupted, sometimes Mei Mi's stupidity is quite cute, but unfortunately others may not think so. So he had to explain to Leona that the education received by Fro's pastor was too narrow: "Between the lord and the lord, between the knight and the knight, and even between the lord and the knight. This kind of behavior, after the child can leave the mother, um, most of them are after weaning, when they grow to a wheel high, their father will send the sons to other knights or lords, sometimes As a hostage, sometimes as a mortgage, sometimes just to avoid the mother's love to raise an incompetent heir, and the other is that the knight gives his son to the lord, his son is the lord's obedience, after adulthood It is easier for the lord to be recognized than others, and it will not be unnecessarily obstructed when it is sealed into a knight or inherits his father's territory. In addition, they can also meet other knight's sons in the lord's castle. Become friends and form a vague alliance. There are also pastors and mages who will teach them to learn the words, if one or two of them are lucky The caster's talent can also be discovered and guided in the first place, which is more than a stupid stay in the barren Grange. It is much better to roll the serf in the mud with the son of the serf or the wild boar."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei wants to say something, Gülen makes a gesture, "This child can be said to be a mortgage, or a hostage," he humbly squatted. One 躬: "His Royal Highness. Did you reach a covenant with the owner of the White Tower and the Hill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be said." Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin took a glance at the boy. If this huge change appeared on other children of the same age, they might face a cry. Endless or noisy nuisance, but even if he heard that he was just a mortgage or hostage, he didn’t make a sound or writh his body. His face was calm and the reaction of adulthood even made The Thunderbolt lord, who once faced the tens of thousands of orcs, was also a bit cold, but it was the best for Leona - An Zhen handed the boy to Leona, and Leona pointed out to the boy Baldwin is her knight who has explained a lot of problems. In a sense, the children of Anzhen can almost be said to be the responsibility of Leona from the moment he leaves his mother. There are many kings. Accepting a lord, or the lord accepting the commission of a knight, in their body can not continue to fulfill the obligation to rule a place, and when their heirs are too young, they accept the child, meaning they must The child raises an adult and makes him/her a good knight or lady, and may choose a suitable marriage for them. Before that, they have to try to get the child back to his father's territory. Inheriting his father's family name and power, the effort can be said to be no different from his own children - of course, this can not be said to be unrewarding, this child is not only the most determined support and the most reliable pillar, the king or It is the lord who can obtain a high tax from him and his father, as well as more food, soldiers and dedication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes, the lord and the knight may not be willing to give their heirs to their masters, just like Anzhen. The white tower and the hills she owns belong to her ancestors, and her ancestors are from Luzer. The ancestors of Dagong received this reward. If the blood was cut off, Luzer could recover this rich territory. If she gave her son to the latter, maybe a few days later Luzer’s castle There will be a small black flag, and the Grand Duke will not smash the cost of a funeral. Compared to the white tower and the hill, it is like a grain of sand in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona accepted the transaction, this child is her responsibility and obligation, she not only has to raise him to grow up, but also to consider after his adulthood, How to recapture everything his mother left for him. If Liona was only an exile soldier at that time, the possibility would be as low as possible, but if Leona was the Queen of Norman in the Highlands, then this It is not difficult for a child to become the owner of the White Tower and the Hill. - And this is also very beneficial for Leona, don't forget. The Norman of the Highlands Norman had not only had a war with Luther’s Grand Duke Luzer, but also captured him and extorted 500,000 gold coins (although not successful), she did not feel that the Luzer Grand Council was a German complaint. Guy, if he wants to find Leona looking for trouble. It’s also a rather annoying thing – and the owner of the White Tower and the Hill is willing to lean on Leona (based on his ordinance of Luzer’s grandfather, he cannot clearly rebel against his master’s ), then the pressure of Luzer Dagong to give highland Norman is much smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona gently vomited, still very early, she said to herself. This child is still so small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you know that Kreima has said something else to them?" Gülen asked, his finger pressed at the grip position of the dagger. There is no leak in the light. It doesn't matter if it leaks. The place where they hide is a jungle close to the river. There are countless fireflies in the jungle. Their tails are like bright and cold like cetacean candles. Light, even if everyone is riding on a horse, they can still see each other's expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei opened his mouth, but only paused and suddenly let go. Grabbing a reel, the thieves and the warriors were wary, but they quickly let go of their heart, because a rounded scorpion fluttered with a pair of small wings falling from the end of the night sky and fell in the arms of Mei Mi. A wonderful black boat emerges quietly from the other end of the river, as if it were not coming from the river but rising from the bottom of the river, or from the color of the night, one The thin figure waved to Birdwin, not others. It is the ship doctor of Captain Cobert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bottomless abyss is down," Birdwin said softly. "How can he be here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship doctor is unlucky, the fine-net guild does not know why it needs a lot of The pharmacist, some thieves waited in the shop in Bibi Dibao. They kidnapped the ship doctor. Fortunately, they didn't know that he belonged to the little bird. Otherwise, he might not be able to get rid of the vicious hyena. He accidentally met the aunt's maid during the escape. The white tower was also sheltered by the elves. At the time, the little bird was also a frequent visitor to the White Tower. The boat doctor often wanders in the streets of Baita, so he is recognized at once. He is just a small person. It is no more attractive than a dog. After reporting the ampoule, the ship doctor is taken by her maid. Hidden, and then he was given as a small gift to Kerry Ben and Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will leave first." The ship doctor said: "Kremar and Kerry will break for us."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They will face a thief in an entire city." Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think they will have any problems." The ship doctor grinned: "Otherwise, why do you think this is so calm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the ship doctors say that Baldwin’s party left the White River’s inland river, it’s still awkward, looking far away at the black iron gate that was pulled up, Baldwin and Lee Aona looked at it: "Even if there is Kremar, the whole thing is still going smoothly, I can't believe it." Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the Queen of Kreima also came back, it was called smooth." The thief reminded him coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are sure they have caught Bywin and others "Is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think anyone will dare to lie to me for the time being." Rika said softly, "Look, my dear sister, now All we need to look for is the black hair caster and the Elf Ranger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where do you think they will be?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter where you are," Rica said, opening the door to Ruiyite attentively. "If they insist on not appearing, we can have a carnival." What do you think of the wheel penalty, although old, rigid, but fun, and the inmates need a few days to die, or put them flat on the ground, smash their limbs with boulder, and then buckle on their stomachs A pot of iron, which is closed with a mouse, and then rises in the wok... We can start with the priest of Fro, and dress her & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp strip, there will be many people willing to take a look at the gold ...... "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
