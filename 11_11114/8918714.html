			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's words: Sorry, I'm sick... I'm sick... I have a good holiday all for rest and recuperation... sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People were urged to leave as soon as possible, and the return journey was longer and more painful than when they came, because then they had hope, and now there is almost only despair - Because the animals that were scared by the flames were ordered to be killed by the Knights of the Kings, their carriages and ox carts (which were lucky to stay here) turned into useless wood, and they were forced to leave the rest of the property. The people who died were left with food and water - they could only get what they could get, but now, for the next few days, they may have to live on those few full-bodied skins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers held torches, walked between the fallen animals, cut their legs, resisted on the shoulders, and the blood flowed from their necks to the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two unmanned carriages were temporarily tied with leather cords. Since there are no horses and cattle, it is ok to pull them by people. Only the knights who are seriously injured and unable to walk have the right to possess. Except them, even children have to walk on foot. So some men and women carry those children who are not at the waist. They may not know before, maybe there is still some contradiction. And the festival, for example, the little bastard who lacked the front teeth, he stole the neighbor's apples, bread and salted fish more than once - as a child raised by ** and faeces, he is flexible and not afraid of filth Dirty, also used to being chased and intimidated, so he did not hesitate to drill into the thick bat feces when he was abrupt, avoiding the threat of flames, arrows and swords, but was stepped by a frightened black cow. Broke his leg, he endured without crying and screaming, but climbed behind a stone to hide, expecting himself to survive... He survived, but he could not escape the birth day as he did. , The bean cake and dried dates hidden in the clothes were lost. A little bit of his leg hurts like being repeatedly beaten on the anvil, and all his strength is used to support his upper body, so that I don’t want to die in the smelly faeces – he can almost imagine that he will be thrown away, and the thick and sloping footsteps of the people gradually drift away, leaving only bats, mice and beetles. Once the fire disappears, the whole world is dark. They will be swarmed up and will burn him apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was scared and almost screamed when he was caught on one shoulder, but he quickly recognized the generous back and the even pendulum The last breakfast that only Sir Alex had the right to enjoy was more than enough. He had been tortured by the big butt because he stole a jar of honey and was tortured by high heat, sweat and stinky. So long, "Mrs. Garcia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about your daughter?" He remembered that she had a little daughter who was not very good. The jar of honey was meant to be mixed with milk. I bought it specially to replenish my body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people decide to stay here, such as a skill The craftsman who accumulated a lot of gold coins, his property brought from Thunderbolt was plundered by thieves, his eldest son died in the war of last year and the second son died just for his loved ones, his youngest son He died with his mother under the collapsed rock. The flame ignited his coat, hair and face. His fingers were burnt and blackened. Although he was still alive, he had no hope - he took off his necklace. Give the servant with the ring, bless him, and then ask him (if he is alive after everything is over) to give them a funeral. "If there is no way to find us," he glanced at the cave where the gravel fell from time to time: " Set up a small tombstone in the place where the sun can shine, tell people that we are buried here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people choose for their loved ones Stay, they are still alive, the problem is they are not Being buried under the boulder is because the injury is too heavy to move, the soldiers do not hinder them, and now there is no time to persuade and wait, they can only protect the people who are willing to leave one step ahead - but one follows The knight who walked in the carriage suddenly stopped, because he saw his favorite girl. She had not been riding a carriage or a oxcart like other girls. She supported her old father and walked slowly along the team. Later, this made them lucky to escape the original flame and sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a lost arrow that shoots into the back of the old man, they will be fine; if, the knight’s horse is not killed. If he doesn't have to carry his armor and sword, he can also carry the beloved girl's father back to his shoulders and leave here together; but all this is a hypothesis, they look at them in a hurry and move away. Looking at each other's eyes, "Marian." He whispered carefully and carefully: "It's dangerous..." He didn't finish, but Marianne and her father seemed to understand what he meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But where can we go?" The girl asked: "Where can we go?" She said, this is also the idea of ​​most people: "Even We can walk to the plains and the orcs will catch up with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No,” he said quietly: “Thunderbolt will leave them.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The survivors are unable to get through the towering and generous walls to see the inside of the Thunderbolt. If they can see it, they will be scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord of Thunderbolt has given up the double walls, the fort and the fort, and the mages who have performed the flight are constantly taking off from the top of the tower. All the arrows of the soldiers - the orcs violently beat the iron flaps at their feet; or fire a wall in front of the orcs chasing the knight, or create a swamp, a wizard casts a spell The air is filled with smoky smog and irritating odor, while the other wizard picks up a piece of grease to make the beasts who are blinded by the smog of the smoke rush faster - rushing into the third faster The storm trap created by the mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elf warriors walked and jumped on a solid roof, their long hair was like burning gold in the twilight of the twilight time. Every orc who is too close to a human soldier can receive an arrow from them. Sometimes they simply stand on the head of a dripping beast, so the orcs chasing humans will be stupid. I thought it would be easy to catch an elf in front of me - the younger and the toughest of the elves would patiently wait until the dirty furry was about to touch their toes - and then slowly raise the longbow - Use a bowstring to play their noses or directly hit their eyes with a bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of situation that is quite beneficial to humans continues until the orcs' priests cross the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tower of Rosada, the tallest building in the inner city, the orc has crossed the pre-set mid-line, which is more than half of the city. Just like the black locusts covered in gray-white cheese, it is so confusing - if there is no help from the elf warrior and the mage, the human soldiers are afraid that it is difficult to rush to the foot of a single city wall as planned. The side door of the wall was opened and the knight and the soldiers climbed the wall along the stairs in the hollow wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blocking the door!" a knight shouted, he is three hundred feet away from the single wall, but people can see the orc spray from behind him. The white mist came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
