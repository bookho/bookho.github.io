			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is simply an inhuman approach. In a few consecutive priests, the priests suddenly broke out of filthy power and became an abyss. In the passage of the passage, Kremar’s territory is actually the most calm – after the kings of Koma, Tara and Gedalia became the tables of the abyss monsters, the surviving people rushed around – they could go There are not many places. After all, in order to obtain the sanctuary of the gods, there are sanctuaries and shrines in any city and village. If these buildings are far from the crowd, people there may still have the opportunity to escape, but like the White Tower, the sanctuary and the temple of the gods are almost adjacent to the inner city or within the inner city, as if a cup was overturned. The poison, when the monsters poured out, people almost no time to react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today’s situation, only the territory of Longhuo, Cremari, and Grenada can enjoy the peace of the past, because the original There is no pastor and voter, and the subsequent Highland Normans have not yet been able to regard it as a permanent place to live. Grenada is ironic because the previous Gredi would not allow her country. There is a belief other than her... Others, only people in extremely remote places can get a little breathing space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you expected this very early?" asked Salil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have the talent to predict." The soul of the outside world replied, "But I know a word, that is, the car before the car, after the car. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the gods has only passed for a thousand years, and the dragons have left this plane for only a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the plane of the soul of the outside world, there have been gods that are so powerful that they can change the sky and change the moon, but they are annihilated, but their annihilation, Relative to their existence time is just a snap. Are they real or false? What brought them away, or made them weak, and then extinct? There are countless people who have fantasized, speculated, thought about it, and the soul of the alien world came here and came to Grenada. When faced with the record of the dragon, it could not ignore this strong similarity - if certain To say that there is any difference, perhaps this plane is more ruthless. The dragon is the original asylum seeker of human beings. The instructor guides that human civilization can be said to be built on the back of the dragon, but they have disappeared from the mainland to the whole, and only for decades. However, as long as it is one Only the ancient dragon, his age can be calculated in a thousand years, and for most of the dragon's children, they are not even young. There are also young dragons who are still instinctive and impulsive, have a relationship, and have to abandon the eggs that have not yet hatched (this is why Greddy's treasury is so rich). Although the rumor says that waiting for the dragons is a new plane, the resources are sufficient, and the area is vast, but like the joke that people say, maybe everyone is very good, so there has never been a The dragon has come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words left by the dragons, words, knowledge, magic, wealth, and laws, institutions, etc., have all been easily inherited by humans. Greddy is cruel and evil, but she may not be wrong in some places - human beings are not slaves to dragons. On the contrary, dragons are slaves to human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is similar to what happened to another plane...and how similar. Sometimes, the soul of the opposite world will also think that if someone passes through the astral and time before the destruction of the big witch and the demon, and sees it all, it will probably have the same idea. Especially after the elves decided to quit here, although there may be a push for it, the sudden death of the Jade jungle seems to prove that the invisible hand that controls everything does exist. This is the god of life. Angris must also maintain the power of silence - although it is not sad, but the soul of the outside world is still very happy that they can choose the right path, although this road must be somewhat rugged. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to support Crémac’s conjecture, even after the elves made their decision to leave, even those who had no reason to become stubborn and violent The Elf is gradually waking up, although the original methods of Kerry and Kremar are not rude, but they are not better than the human hand like a beast without wisdom. They can calm down and make Kerry feel comfortable - but there are still some Eya spirits left, compared to the Singer elves who want to make a difference in the future catastrophe. The fire of vengeance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grazt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they can’t find the footprint of the demon monarch, he seems to have disappeared, whether it is the bottomless abyss or the main material plane... and Not only Grazite, Kremar got some useful news from the mouth of the devil and the devil after smashing the chaos in several places. After Grazt, several monarchs were missing. It’s not hidden, demons or devils. It’s no surprise that before the disaster, the keen beast will hide. Only the ignorant little things will sing and dance happily, thinking that they will have a welcoming The feast of the meat mountain forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with no exceptions<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of Mask Believers sneak in the dark, because the natural enemies of Marquez, the temples of Tyre and Rosada are almost collapsed, their power has been greatly expanded in the local area, and in the places where they pass, people are either thieves. Prey, either become a member of them, but even if they become thieves, they are not so happy. There are classes among thieves, there are betrayals, conspiracy, or they are rolling up than any of these ordinary people have heard before. The crimes are terrible, and the poor people who are still in good faith are quickly immersed in the bloody whirlpool, but it doesn't matter. Now the guild is full of abundant new blood. They either quickly chill and smother, merge with the former, or step on the former. Follow-up<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bell is one of them. He joined the Thieves Guild as a momentary impulse - his wife was humiliated and killed by a thief, but no one can help him except thieves - A thief told him that as long as he became one of them, he would be able to defend his enemies without worrying about being retaliated by the guild. Because one thief was killed by another thief, he could only say that he was too incompetent.He believed, but soon he discovered that the guild only wanted him to inherit from his father, the cleverness and beauty of a distinguished bard, and even his wife’s things, initially their handwritingBut what can he do? His city has been controlled by the guild, and he has parents and children.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like walking on a narrow stone bridge with people in front and behind. Everyone holds a dagger. He must go forward and kill the person who blocks him. If you are going backwards, you must die. There may be innocent people among those people, but he has no choice.The problem is that as he gets deeper and deeper into the guild, he knows more about this dirty organization. He is full of hatred towards them and himself. He prays in his heart and hopes he can get a knot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current road is becoming more and more familiar, and Bell’s heart is getting heavier. When they see the familiar building, he is more remorseful and almost his heart. Come out - this is the temple of the god of literature, Diner. He and his father have come here more than once, reading the books and records for free. The pastors here are kind and tolerant, even though they are literature. The followers of the gods have never pushed those who are ignorant or ignorant, or who are penniless, to check or read them here, not only at no charge, but also to dine with the pastors. Sleeping in the room, wrapped in a blanketEven if they are only seeking medical treatment or begging, they will sing and read happily after the other party is warm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bell’s father even became a close friend with the pastors here. They are not rich people, and they donate very little, but sometimes, a pastor has never heard of it. The little story is enough to make them ecstatic<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bell was trembling, and when the door to the temple was actually opened from the inside, it was even more shocking.The man who opened the door for them was ragged and skinny, apparently a slut, so the price of buying him was exceptionally low, just ten silver coins, enough for him to sell the priests who had taken him to the thieves - now It was the darkest time before dawn, and the most slack moment of the day. Bell was like what was driven. When the thieves were about to cross the inner court, he shouted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dagger pierced Bell’s back, and the thief’s leader looked gloomy. He knew that this idiot was not trustworthy.Bell’s soul immediately got out of his body. Surprisingly, the wind mourning the wilderness blew from them, but failed to take Bell’s soul. Bell is just a mortal, able to persist without being taken away by the wind of death. It can be called a miracle. His soul is suspended above his body, almost forgetting everything, but his mouth is wide open, and his sorrowful screams come out of his invisible throat, the priest of Mask. Throwing the magic with anger and annihilation, this annihilation of this unwilling soul, but it is too late, the priests of Dinar have been awakened from their sleep, and began to fight with the thieves who sneak into the room - the planned slaughter of the squatting In a confrontational confrontation, the priest of Maske shouted his name, and the priests of Dinar also shouted the name of Diner, who believed in the god of literature, but they waved hammers and sticks. The time was no less than a show, and there was damage on both sides, but after the priest of the Diner retired into the inner hall, the situation showed a state of glue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests of the Diner are kneeling on the ground and praying to their gods. Although Dinar is a weak god, his followers will undoubtedly More devout than the thieves outside, the power of the gods came here with the prayers, protecting his followers from the vicious thieves, the thieves found that they could not open the door of the inner hall, and therefore could not get the property of the inner hall Or the priest who killed the false gods to please Mascus. After a few hours of futile time, they had to quit abruptly.After confirming that the thieves had left, the priests of Dinar cheered. They opened the door of the temple and converge the unfortunate companions. A pastor saw the body of Bell and saw his wound. He guessed that maybe It was this person who had a trace of goodwill in his heart that woke them up. He prayed mercifully to Bell and prayed for the dead. He held the cold hand and did not notice that the black blood had penetrated his skin. - He felt itchy throat, and after enduring for a while, he finally coughed up - the sticky filth fell on Bell's body, and immediately stretched out six claws and quickly climbed away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
