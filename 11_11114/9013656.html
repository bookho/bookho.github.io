The figure made up of smoke bowed to the red robe warlock and said, "May your strength be as deep as the sea, And your wisdom is as good as the stars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remove those unnecessary chills," Ostall said, and Lulus used to be a courage with him. The master’s counter-magic, his arrogance angered her warlocks. After his miserable death, they did not let go of his soul. Now his soul is tortured, detained and enslaved all the time. The situation may last for a thousand years or more, so the red robe does not need to be polite or respectful to him: "Speak your intentions, don't let me know if you have omissions or distortions."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A will." Luluus said plainly: "From the deepest and brightest places to find a spell book, it is written in dragon language, with inlaid gems and runes Pure gold cover, find it between anyone discovering its secrets, all people who have touched it must be completely controlled Come "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" it looks to me, "Oscar Tal ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;牟路斯 gestures, part of the smoke from his body, condensed, showing a soft glow of gold and blue but Austal can only see To its surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only thing I saw was this."牟Luth said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal glanced at him: "Do you remember your disciple? The son of the Lord of the Dragon Fire Island called Beavis?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;牟路斯 is indifferent, and the sorcerer who had been gloating for him described to him how many of his disciples’ wives died in pain, thinking that it was an unfortunate accident. Only Kluth knew that it was entirely out of the malicious trick, and everyone associated with him could not escape her eyes and ears and he could not even find the soul of Beavis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He seems to have a disciple too." Austal stared at the soul that was barely able to see the wall through it. "One half-elf, his name is Kremar. Have you heard of him?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." said Lulus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should probably go see him," Ostal said. "According to my unsuccessful apprentice, he inherited everything from Beavis. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides me, there are still a few people who accept This task?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;牟路斯 silenced for a while, slowly swallowed a few names, and Ostor repeatedly weighed in the heart : "I need more information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only so many."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You will get more." Austal said that he stretched his hand and made a gesture of eviction. "Well, leave here, 牟路斯, I don't need you anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have not paid me yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No remuneration." Ostall said, maybe there will be One or two warlock apprentices will be stupid enough to give some of the detained souls of Kuluth some rewards. The energy of the law is the blood of the devil and the devil, but Austal will not: "Go to the soil that mourns the wasteland," he threw a magically treated feldspar into the fire, and the flame rose violently. The soul of Kuluth made a scream, and the originally unstable figure shook a bit, and it dissipated from the obsidian fire plate: "You only have to eat that." Red robe said, facing the stars. ember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for a while, brought up the fire, walked out of the tent, turned it over, and let the screaming wind smack the ash inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few orcs in the downwind fiercely sneeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to come here." A business like a beast snoring said behind the red robe warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not?" Austal said: "You need my leader of the Gersh. If you don't have me, you will drop half of the number in the long winter, and there will be no new scorpions to survive." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why we are caught in such a dilemma is not because of you? Red robe?" Geshe said that he is higher than when attacking Thunderbolt. But also to be thinner, after all, he was busy leading the tribe's warriors to find enough food for women and scorpions throughout the winter, such as argali, bison, horn deer and other tribe orcs. He didn't trust humans from the beginning. He used only a small part of the potion that he brought. He had to say that he was under tremendous pressure at that time. If the beasts really got the Thunderbolt under the protection of Kawu, then the least number of people played. The Blizzard tribe can only get the least trophy, and his warriors will be ridiculed and light, they will feel angry and want to expel or kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even if they lost the battle, some people think that the Blizzard tribe and its orc, Gersh, lost the courage that the orcs should have, and they plundered It is no surprise that human beings must first rob their families, but there is nothing strange about the orcs. There are no morals and laws at all. They worship the strong, admire the priests, but despise wisdom and thinking. After that, the Blizzard tribes have withstood After a period of pressure, but very quickly, the dark clouds over their heads flew to the heads of their enemies. The orcs who were catalyzed by the medicinal water had a stomach that could never be filled. They ate more than theirs. Father and uncle added up more. After eating the animals and slaves in the tribe, they began to eat the weaker orcs, and gradually fell hungry to the orcs with lofty positions, no matter how Said that the latter can be much more fat than the former, after a bloody battle, several tribes even have only one or two orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blizzard is now the largest and strongest tribe in the entire whistling plain, and Geshe has gathered a number of strong orc warriors and orc women who have escaped. Instead of reducing the number of people, the tribe has expanded by nearly a third. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think I told them that these children will have a good appetite." The red robe warlock said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not normal," said Gersh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not normal for a cub to grow into an orc warrior in a few breaths." Austal said he made an invitation gesture. Gersh followed him into the tent that looked from the outside and might force Gersh to leave his tail outside, but actually allowed the four wives and twelve cubs of Gersh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gersh sat cross-legged, and Austal gave him a glass of red wine. The orc leader took a bite of the liquid inside. Under the influence of magic, the human blood mixed in the wine was just squeezed out. It was so fresh and sweet, and Gersh put out his tongue and licked the wine dripping on his hair. He pulled out a brown skin from the side, pulled the drawstring, and poured out the contents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin looks plain and rough, but in terms of the number of stones that are poured out, it is still a considerable size pocket. The little stones that were simply polished and able to emit a ray of light suddenly piled up a small hill up to the warlock's knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Livestock, slaves," said Gersh "There are horses, weapons, especially arrows and bows, no matter how much you take out. And..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want a mage and a warlock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal finally officially saw this A rude and dirty orc looks at it: "Everyone knows that Wuthering Plain does not welcome Masters and Warlocks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now it is."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your priest will think that you are despising them, and you will be regarded as a blasphemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you offer a rich sacrifice The product, the powerful Kawu luxury will not care about these small problems. If they insist, then I don't mind sending them to personally sue to the sin of Kao Luxury." Geshe touched his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are doing something that is extremely dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One can be better than any A priest pleases my god Kauka," Geshe said: "I will dedicate the entire Thunder Fort to him, perhaps more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※ ※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan Donkley boarded the double wall of Fort Rey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow passage of the dragon's abdomen is covered with lush vegetation. The blood of the orcs and humans melts the snow and ice, and moistens the underlying land. The grass seeds sprout and can rise in the wind from the plains of the whistling plain overnight. Passing them over, igniting the green scorpion, straight through the towering tower, rolling to the new inner city. Even in this season, the wind here is as cold and sharp as the sword of steel casting, each inhaling the body. The air cuts the throat and lungs like a small knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his nominal father. Morton Don Clay is almost stationed in his life. He is not willing to hand it to Dylan Don Clay, but he is willing to give it to An ordinary soldier, a despicable person without a surname. Dylan Don Clay must admit that he really felt pain when he first heard the news. He spent less time with Morton Don Cray than his mother, Princess Diane, but he heard His story and legend, a child's envious heart can not be estimated by the length of time, he learned how to become a mage in the courtyard without father, full of thought that he can get his recognition, but the end result, just like you What we saw was that he was a shame of Morton Don Clay, and before leaving the world, Morton Don Clay threw the insult back on his and his mother's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely because of this that Dylan accepted the invitation of the Duke of John without much hesitation. He is also the brother of Princess Diane, the sister of Dylan, he Sitting on the throne is much more suitable than Pharaoh, although the process is so short that they have not even thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, you have to mention Bordwin Don Clay, Birdwin’s feelings for Dylan are hard to describe, Dylan doesn’t love him. More correctly, he hates the thief who got the things he shouldn't get, but Dylan didn't want to look at him and died so easily and simply as he hoped, the former Paladin was slipping to the fallen. The abyss, but he himself is not aware, and his nominal brother is looking at it with joy, as if cherished to drink the only remaining wine in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan gently stroked the cold stone bricks: "This is what you don't want to give me," he sneaked into the stone like a child. The brick said: "But I still get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One piece Being able to please my priest than any priest," said Gersh. "I will dedicate the entire Thunder Castle to him, perhaps more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
