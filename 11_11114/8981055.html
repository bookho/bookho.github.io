After a chaotic crash, Kerry's arrow breaks, but Bird The warm double-edged axe has taken the opportunity to cut down its head - the head that is so big as the head of the cow is tumbling on the ground, biting tightly when it hits the legless field, and the sharp fangs are hard. Sliding on the carapace, it is embedded in a soft gap, just like a triangular sword piercing steel armor, everyone can hear the sour frictional sound - the venom of the blind snake in the field Boiling in the body, Tian Hao struggled in vain, it spewed more venom, poison The python skull half melted became unpleasant stench of Blackwater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the blind snake is soft on the ground, slightly trembles, blood flows from the inside, gray-white bats licking it, greedily extracting the remaining vitality ——Bedwin holds Mei Mi’s arm. She is too close to it. The former paladin picked up a stone and threw it at it. It didn’t move, it seemed to have lost the possible resistance, but when the thief threw a When the abandoned cloak, it slammed into the ground, just like the rest of the human beings embraced themselves and thought that the dead lover was wrapped around the thin clothing, and several bats escaped and were wrapped inside. Being caught, the flesh that they just swallowed is squeezed out of the body together with itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash. Gülen walked out from behind another bell, and no one could see how the thief moved in the shadows. His fine gold dagger had a white slurry, a spit that had just emerged from the slit. The worm was crucified by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Ranger turns his gaze to the Half Dragon and the Master. What Krymar said might be right. After the ruins were destroyed, there were no more new worms. Now they have to deal with velvet moths and bats, perhaps because of this. The semi-dragon doesn't care about other people. His magic and martial arts are going to the black-haired caster. He doesn't seem to be rushing to kill the wizard. A fine sword taken from the void passes the caster. The forehead almost took one of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semi-dragon put the tip of the sword in front of him and repeatedly rubbed the blood above his tongue. "It's so delicious!" He said with a bit of obsession: "I have never tasted this in the main material plane." Good blood - pure, vibrant, with great power - if not... I have to doubt that you are my kind, a mage with a dragon, your father or mother is a dragon Have you seen them?" he asked cautiously. The dragons have never been very concerned about the descendants of their own mixed-race children, but they occasionally pay a little attention to those who are better. The dragon’s nest is often accompanied by a red robe warlock’s mage tower, or even The camps or fortresses they built were the descendants of the dragon, from which they received shelter and guidance, and also played the role of guarding and plundering wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They often have runes set by dragons, rushing to kill them and eating them may find some trouble that they should not have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are a mage." Half-dragon tempted: "Why don't you stay with your great blood relatives?" He said half-truth "You look so small... maybe our battle is meaningless, if we are really descendants of a strong existence." He looked at the wizard's reel belt, which was empty. The syrup belt is almost empty, but it is like a pocket of a mage tower. He suspects that the mage does not use a trace of hesitation and sorrow to use them only because there is a curious dragon or father. The mother supported him behind him - the mixed hybrid almost thought they were sent by a dragon, but he quickly denied the idea because he saw the elf. It is a true elf, not a half-elf or an illusion. In any case, an elf will not work for the evil dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the elf was deceived, and the half-dragon pointedly pointed to Kerry Ben: "Let's talk well," he said falsely. You are a bit right, that is, I am indeed injured. Some minor injuries, but it did cause me some trouble - how to give the elf to me? His flesh and soul are enough to make up for what I am missing. I You can listen to your conditions, what do you want to exchange? Children, don't tell me, you came for those ignorant monkeys." He did not wait until he answered the mage and responded: he was not angry: "Or You have already..." He reminded him with a pretending gesture: "Is lost the ability to capture him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant calmly looked at the half-elves in front of her. She had lost all the virtues of the elves. More correctly, her body, even the virtues of human beings, was hard to find. She had fallen into a willingness and humanity. The coward who trades the devil, a blind person who uses the compromise and fantasy to pretend to be the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what you are talking about?" Perant asked sternly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is placed earlier, An Zhen said to herself, she will retreat because of the blame and disappointment contained in this sentence, perhaps now But she has no way to go back, like the tricks that thieves play with when they are bored - they let the women who angered them take off their shoes and stand face to face, beating each other, the heels against the knife, once they retreat their ankles The heels will be cut to the blood, and their children will stand on their shoulders, with noose around their necks, and if they fall down their children, they will be hanged alive – and she is now stepping on it. On the knife, the quilt was covered by her children and the people of the entire White Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know exactly what I am talking about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thief is not convinced. "Perant said, forcing the anger that rushed up and forth: "Even if they swear by their gods, they will not hesitate to betray their promises at the end of their interests - because of their gods Sakamoto is a sly liar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't believe them," said An Zhen. "I just need time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten years," Perant said: "You also gave them time. Do you know how much nutrients a prosperous white tower will give them? They will thrive. Their roots and tentacles will extend to every corner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will break them and burn them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you can't even do the equality on the surface." Perant said softly: "I don't think there will be anything like this in ten years." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The White Tower and the Hill have already had a male heir. Ten years later he will be able to inherit my position, then I will "Go to death," said An Zhen. "Every contract I sign will become a piece of waste paper. Everything I have said will also become a bubble. He will have his army and be loyal to his knight. Thousands, and the white robe of Antonio Master and Rosada, they will uproot the thieves and their guild, leaving no trace of trouble," she said confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think thieves will be so stupid." Perant said <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are short-sighted." An Zhen insisted: "They value gold coins better than everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant sighed and turned away: "How can you be sure that human beings will be loyal to a baby?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a boy," said An Zhen. "They don't admit that I am because I am a girl. If I am a male, then neither Demon nor Yadel will have any chance." "She spit out the name maliciously and saw that Perant's action of pouring the light wine into the cup paused." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yalale is a good boy," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah," An Zhen said sarcastically: "Are you selected him? If you are here at Yadel, then you will not hesitate to think about it." Do you agree with all his requirements?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not agree even if your father is standing here," Perant said: "Gray Ridge and Silver Crown The assets of the jungle will never be used to raise an evil organization. I, every member of the Grey Ridge and our king will not allow it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside. Anzhen stood up and didn't feel as furious as Perant thought: "Lie," she said sweetly. "You can always find a reason, just like Yadel killed his brother, you can still find him. There is enough evidence to try to get rid of his crimes - you will promise him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She unbuttons her chest and takes out a secret inlaid with crystal Silver ornaments, the opposite of the ornaments are silver crowns. "Do you remember? Perant, you promised my mother, in front of her sickbed. Under the testimony of the priest of the death god Cranvo, you Promise to her, you will protect me, you will help me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will guide you." Perant went on to see this accessory. He was like seeing the beloved friend again, the pain biting his heart like a viper: "But you never accepted us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your request," An Zhen said in a tit-for-tat manner: "You ask me to give up my innate power, I handed over to another person from my father inherited something "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"You want to stay in the Grey Ridge!" Perant said inexplicably: "You complain that you can't rule others as a human!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is "Awkwardly!" An Zhen shouted: "I don't want to do that, it's you. You forced me - you can help me, as long as you have your support, I can not do it, I can control the whole White Tower! But you didn't, you chose Yadel, you! Do you know how sad I was when I got this news?! You are like those humans, you gave up me, without any hesitation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is true," Perant said sadly: "Ahn, you are not suitable to be a consul, nor is it a lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am a girl?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stupid man, Perant said in his heart, but how is he? I also know that I can't say this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to entangle this thing anymore," said the stupid: "I just want to know, are you willing to reach your promise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I said no?" Perant pushed the overflowing light wine to the center of the table. Anyway, he and Anzhen would not want to drink. Nothing, nothing can extinguish the anger in their chests - what surprised him was that Anzhen gripped the pendant and lowered his noble knees, "Uncle Perant," she looked at him, from the baby. The pale blue eyes that have changed have been filled with the unspeakable firmness of the elves: "This is the last time, I need help, the humans in Baita need help, I don't want much, you can still get what you want - - I will limit those thieves, the elves can still safely use the White Tower as a starting point, everything is the same as before, as long as ten years - this is good for you, otherwise," she said innocently and cruelly: "Before your new city has not yet been established, you really have to be outside. Sever the connection, put yourself in a dangerous, ignorant situation? Dear Uncle Perant, how close the thieves are to you - do you really want to see them cut off another Il's head again? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can feel that Perant's body is stiff, like a ruthless petrified spell descending on this cold elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed: "You won't, right, Perant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
