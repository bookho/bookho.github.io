The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two female lions sitting in front of it sat shou whispered, and then had a pair of quiet brown-eyed female lions The answer: "Dream." The female lions and beasts lying around them thought about it and began to nod frequently, apparently very much in agreement with this answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world also nodded, and then said the next mystery, "I have seen the dance, it is nothing."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This riddle makes the female lions and beasts repeatedly think about it for a while, but it’s not that they can’t guess the answer, but there are too many possible answers. They have disputes and are not sure. Which one is the most correct: "Is there a limit?" The brown-eyed female lion body beast asked: "Does it have life, is it lifeless, tangible, or invisible?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you say that it is lifeless," the soul of the alien world replied: "Without life, it will cease to exist; but if you say that it has life, it has no blood. No meat - if it has a form, no one can touch it, if it is invisible, it is common for everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown eye The female lion was indulged for a while, then smiled: "Shadow," she said, her voice soft and hoarse: "Yes, our little guests?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&& Nbsp; "Incomparably correct." The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female lions and beasts are all slap in the face (slap their thick forepaws), although they live on the entire plane as non-human monsters. But like the male lion body beast, the female lion body animal also has the wisdom of ordinary people. Their favorite is to listen to the story of the traveler and crack various puzzles and riddles. For this, they are even willing to use gold coins and treasures. And a variety of services to exchange, it is also worth mentioning that their character is much better than the male face lion beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he did not deceive us," a female lion beast listened to a few sad and happy stories (free souls from different worlds) The chicken soup Xiaowen), whispering with his companion: "I don't mind becoming his mount. Just three riddles every night, and a story, or a gerbil that he cooked by himself."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a little difficult," said the brown-eyed female lion beast to the black-haired dragon. "You need a male lion, because you want it." The commanding army is the Dragon's tooth, an army composed of the eagle-headed lion and the human being, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The soul of the opposite world Say: "What I need is a friend who can make all the lion-faced lions tremble. He will be my arm and my sword. When necessary, he will be able to let those birds not be against me. The order of the yang is overcast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-eyed female lion body beasted for the "bird head" in his words," You shouldn't let him bring you down, so it's really not enough respect for our enemies."dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bird has not respected us, "A female lion beast said, "It may be too stupid. They never understood our rejection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This topic aroused women The lions and beasts have their complaints. Many of them have been forced to give birth to the eggs of the eagle lion. The problem is that after the eggs hatch, they can only be eagle lions, and they are still young. It was stupid and brutal at first, and some young, even the first female lions and beasts of the first birth would try to raise and teach them, but soon they found that it was useless, and the young ones raised them when they were hungry. Mothers will be attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a difference between the two, the evil generations will never listen to the voices of the weak, they are used to trample and enslave the latter, just as they also Willing to be ruled by a stronger existence.” The soul of the opposite world said that it did not believe that life was evil when it was in another plane, but after this plane he discovered that with or without wisdom, certain life It is the innate evil, which cannot be changed or changed. Therefore, it did not intend to accept Griffin from the beginning. No matter whether the eagle or the lion is willing to loyal, it will not, because They stood in the two camps from the beginning, and they were separated from each other by the gap that was impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay," said the brown-eyed female lion beast, the soul of the alien world noticed that all the noises she had spoken at the beginning immediately fell low. It is quite possible that she is the leader of this group of female lions, like the male lion beast they had encountered before. She has a stronger body and dignity and beauty than other female lions. The face: "There is never an answer to this question. Dear guests, before the bonfire, my husband will come back, please tell me another riddle, then you should rest, I know you always need rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Which things in the world are the longest and the shortest, the fastest and the slowest, the most segmentable and the most extensive, the most unrecognized and the most precious; without it, what? Everything can't be done; it destroys all the small things, and makes all the great things endless?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This riddle makes all the female lions They were caught in long thoughts and discussions. They twitched their tails and got a lot of answers, but none of them could be unified, and their first leader was slightly frowning, and then they thought hard. The look, but when she captured the aura, she slowly calmed down from the passionate emotions. "This is a very good riddle." She said: "Like the brilliant gold in the sand, Like the first flower that blooms after the rain, its brilliance and fragrance can last for 10,000 years or more. Our little guests, is this your wealth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the soul of the opposite world denied: "It comes from A wise old man, I brought it from him and treasured it in my memory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very happy that you are not lying," brown-eyed female lion The beast said: "Please listen to my answer, my answer is - time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The longest is time, because it never Exhaustive; the shortest is time, because all people have no time to complete the plan; the person waiting is the slowest; the person who is happy, the time is the fastest; it can be extended to infinity, or can be divided Infinitely small. At that time, no one paid any attention. After that, everyone expressed regret; no time, nothing could be done; it was not worth remembering for later generations, it was forgotten; great, it made them immortal."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————— —————————dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the male lion beast beats the wings from the sky When they landed, the first thing they smelled was the rich meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this used to entertain me?" shouted loudly in the air, with a black long scarf wrapped around the hair and half of the human face. The wind will take away the sound, so even if it is yelling, only a few can be caught, but the head of the male lion's body is not as dull as humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if I want to," the leader of the male-faced lion beast said sadly, "Moussa, would we still have a cook for you?" "The human face lion beast and the eagle lion beast are used to enjoying bloody food, but the human face lion beast will occasionally curiously taste human barbecue and boiled meat, but if they say they will deliberately keep a human The cook is absolutely impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I did smell the scent of scented bark and pepper." Moussa muttered to himself, and they had seen the lit up on the sand dunes. That pile of campfires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-eyed female lion beast has stood up, she raised her wings and flew into the air, under the eccentric dub of Moussa, two faces The lion body sweetly picked up a kiss and rubbed the face and neck with relatives - and when they finally fell on the delicate sand, the female lion beast and the male lion and beast that looked after them had already Stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the leader of the male lion beast said before, he did not allow Musa to ride on himself, but Moussa is not without a mount, he is The tribal leader of the desert barbarian, of course, also has his own mount, a eater that looks no smaller than the Deinonychus. They were in front of the only human beings present. Moussa’s eyes were staring at the young black-haired youth in white robes. Although he knew that the other was a dragon, he must admit that the dragon did not have a flood. With an evil appearance, he looks like a pastor of the god of morning light, and he has not left the sanctuary of the temple since he was a young child, and he has grown carelessly under the laurel tree, only Some of the distress is just that you can't remember the lyrical lyrics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar?" Moussa said that he was standing about three feet away from the caster. For strangers, this distance is a bit too close. But for a mortal, this distance is the most appropriate - Moussa can be sure that his machete can cut the other's throat before making a gesture or a spell. He slightly fantasized about it. That scene, but quickly got rid of their entanglement - his reason and experience tells that if they are indeed enemies, then the biggest possibility is that he is hit by a protective spell that has already been set, turning into a pile of coke or meat. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world failed to answer him in the first place, which is somewhat rude, but it has been seen on the plate in Longhuo Island as a dish. After the mosquito, I felt that my vision was wide enough, but now it knows, um, that is still very early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
