			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afra has just calmed down a rebellion three days ago. What is unbelievable is that the insurgents did not belong to Grenada and are red. The dragon played for dozens of hundreds of dragon tooth knights, but those slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slaves from the countries that were destroyed by the Grenada can be said to have been sheltered by Krimar and Yadel to survive today. When the dark-haired dragons realized that they had to leave, he also told them clearly that they were no longer his slaves (his cohabitants so hoped, and the lich did not care about these mediocre mortals), They can go to any place they are willing to go, with clothes, family and a little money. It can be said that even their former Grand Duke or King may not be able to do better. It is a pity that not everyone is willing to accept this precious gift. In fact, quite a few people are full of hatred and resentment against Grenada. Even Yadel is no exception, let alone as a red dragon. A direct descendant, Krimar, a member of the royal family of the Greinada. But in the same way, when the black-haired dragons control this place, they dare not act rashly, but when they know that he is about to leave, and hand over the island and the city’s domination to a little girl who is only ten years old. Their malice was rushing out like a mushroom after a rainstorm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are no pastors and no masters among them. These people will also show fear when they see the eagle lions and animals that hover over them. Look, but that doesn't mean they have nothing to do - they use the liquid dripping from the branches to burn red spots on the newborn babies. These babies are the first batch of Crayfa after being out of control of Grenada. The birth of the child is hope, but also the future, even if their parents are slaves, but when it is heard that there is a common disease in newborns, Yadel did not hesitate to rush - just in Yadale When I was concentrating on the spots on my child, I couldn’t confirm whether it was chickenpox or smallpox. A slave who used to be a herb merchant ignited a ridiculous herb, and several female babies who were still giving birth rushed. Going up and grabbing the priest's limbs, Yadel just hesitated for a moment and was shot fiercely to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After controlling Yadel, the slaves made a request. They want Cree, all the people who have been associated with Grenada, things and things must be rolled out immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Afra is easy to say that it is easy to flatten out. This so-called rebellion, these poor people, if they are rebellious in advance, while the soul of the outside world is still there, the punishment of the occupants may only be expulsion, and the first one can also get a clean and tidy death. But Afra’s father is the son of the thief’s god Mask in the mortal world, and her mother is a sly and false believer. Their indifference, suspiciousness and sharpness are completely inherited by Afra, and this vicious species The seeds were transplanted into the temple of Grenada, Gredith, without having to think about how Afra, as a hostage and sacrifice, would be treated in the followers of Grein, imposed by Kremar The magical tattoo on her can make a tenacious male warrior give in, but because of the soul of the outside world, she can taste a little sweet taste after a long and profound torture - just a little sweet The taste makes her eyes no longer able to accommodate other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the defeat of Grei, Grenada fell into a slight turmoil, and when the soul of the outside world rushed to the "honeycomb", Afu The robes on the pull have been soaked in the blood of the priests. "Ah," she smiled as she saw the dark-haired dragon. "The blood of the predecessor's pastor is stinking." She said with regret. Show her sharp canine teeth in the dark light. Yes, she is only ten years old. When she has neither the blood of the red dragon nor the blood of the devil or the devil, she is easily scorned by people - she even endures, even if the magic tattoo on the back has been given She is no less than the power of any pastor. She never tries to resist or escape. When she hides herself, she is like a little mouse. If a certain pastor must remember this miscellaneous, then she may even Afra's face could not be described. But she had to find out earlier than anyone that the statue of Gredi was decaying and collapsing. The priests whispered inquiring into each other in horror, looking for scrolls and runes in a panic, Afra was relying on her own Power begins to revenge - she has a thief's natural memory, remember every slap, every whips, every soldering iron, every time humiliating and playing, she is so familiar with the entire hive, after all, she wiped almost every On the floor of the promenade, she was like a spider sneaking into the hive, slowly and orderly clearing her prey one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soul of the alien world finds her, she is even lying on her feet, an elderly female dragon who is considered by all to take over as the chief pastor. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She really is Kreima..." The leader of the Dragon Knights cast a look at Yadel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalal was injured in this rebellion because some slaves thought he was the running dog of the Grenada people, the pain and hatred that had been suppressed in the past All of them poured on him. Although they couldn’t kill him, they could smash Yadel’s tongue and break his fingers and break his leg bones—there was no way for the priest to pray for the escape. For the reason, these injuries have now healed, but the deeper scars are in the heart of Yadell - he can understand why they do it, and can forgive them, but he still feels wronged and angry, especially in them. When I saw Afra’s single face to them, I wanted to bully her...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afra’s life, Crimmar did not conceal Yadel, but When Afra began to call his father after Krymar’s departure, Yadell could not stop her. There was a sorrow in the heart of the priest. Afra’s mother might still scream in vain for the vain run, and her father became a cold and cruel thief leader. He didn’t need children, even if she was him. The treasure that the deep-loving wife left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let this misunderstanding continue, perhaps a good thing for Afra, who inherited Crayfa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ones standing in front of them are the heads of the slaves. They are divided into two places, one with a strong male and the other with another. People are surrounded by an elderly man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direct insurgents have been thrown by Afra to feed the sharks, but the slaves of Krefa still have uneasy fluctuations, but the dragon claws Who is it? They are the elite of Grenada, the descendants of the evil red dragon. It can be said that it is effortless. They have captured about twelve people from the cover of the slaves. They are the brains, heart and spine of these slaves. No matter what the problem, you can solve it directly on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong man, if Yadel remembered correctly, he used to be the chief knight of the lord, although at that time people were rumored to be the illegitimate child of the lord. Fortunately, fate and the lord made a joke. Obviously, the knight and the lord had no blood relationship. He was lucky enough to become a slave instead of a corpse. He became a slave to the black-haired dragon. At the time, the performance was very fearful, and the knees touched the ground faster than anyone else, but it was such a guy that provoked this bloody and unnecessary rebellion. Hundreds of people have died as a result of their hopes and tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the chief knight is simply scornful of this statement, perhaps because he realizes that he can’t escape, his courage has become bigger,” Tomorrow? Hope?” He said with a big smile: “Are you laughing at the mean slaves? What else can we go back? Can we go to the army of the Grenada people and order them to get out of us? "The territory of the land?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can go anywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be a homeless Residents, "The former chief knight said: "The soldiers and the guards drove, lived in the swamps and sand, lived with worms and rotten mice. Is this what you call a new life?" Dell, with satisfaction, found a bit of mercy in the latter's eyes. He likes these really good people: "Don't you know why we are doing this? Pastor," he said loudly: "We only have Cray. Law, unlike you, you can go to any one Place, as you said, the lords will greet you like a king, and the temple and the sanctuary of Rosada are as beautiful as the palace. You are his darling. Is there anyone who will not reach out to welcome you? But we, we are a group of poor people who have lost their homeland, and why do we become what they are now? Because your friend, your master, the Highness of Grenada led the army to invade our homeland. Yes, he left our life, let us be a slave, to build such a magnificent city for him, but we are going to thank him for this. How many of us are daughters, sisters and The wife died because of the false god he believed in. We worked for him for ten years, day and night. Every corner of the city has the flesh and blood of slaves. It should belong to us! What we do is nothing but Take back what we should get back! Of course..." His tone suddenly turned sharply: "Adults, we feel very sorry, I mean, I don't know they treated you like this, I do I said that you are a good person, I know that you have tried to save us... Please believe that this is not our intention... But, adults, we really have no way to go... we are just some mortals."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not just a mortal." Afra suddenly said, "Tell me, even if you get Afra, how do you drive Crayfa? Not an island, not a city, it is a creation of magic. Don't tell me who else of you has a rune of gnomes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
