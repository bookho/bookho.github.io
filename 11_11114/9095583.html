First, the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Flore, followed by the Church of San Lorenzo, the Church of the Holy Cross, the Church of All Saints... The bells of the bells are coming and going, resounding through the warm and dark sky, summoning the people of Florence to look around Early Mass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to go out of the house is the bankruptcy of the workshop owners, helpers, apprentices and short-term workers, Japanese workers and other poor people in the city, these people are meager and unstable Therefore, they are unable to pay sufficient taxes in exchange for the full citizenship. They have no right to set up their own guilds, and no other guild will allow them to join. This makes them almost impossible to obtain any political and economic security; they and their families Can only live in the parish of San Frediano, or the parish of San Pietro in Tolino, the parish of St. Ambrosio, which is close to the city walls, dangerous and remote, from the resurrection of the Sunday Mass. The main church (the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Flore) is separated by nearly 20 parishes and a river of Arno. So many people have already fixed their whole body before the bells are still ringing, the sky is still gray: the male owner put on a new linen and fine cotton shirt, the woolen tight-fitting jacket, the wool coat, the low mouth. The wide-legged sneakers are shining brightly, and there may be an oval bonnet; most of their wives only have a more decent cotton or ordinary woolen cloth with sleeves, but this does not prevent them from constantly Make some changes in the sleeves and neckline, as well as on the accessories; for example, change the slightly outdated round neck into a more popular big neck nowadays, lace the cuffs, or wrap the chain around the neck. (The poor people who don't have much luxury capital often use this method), just like her husband will have silk-embroidered pockets in his waist every festival; most of the children's clothes come from parents and adult brothers and sisters. Only the white long dress worn at the beginning of the Eucharist must be new. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men, women, and children meet with their neighbors and relatives on narrow, cobbled streets. In the past, they were always dead, and the unclear city was filled with countless sharp laughter and elated embarrassment. ·<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Christ is resurrected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resurrected!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They inform each other and confirm the news of the resurrection of the Son, greet and amused, passing through one dark and damp street in chasing and pushing, these streets are winding, Criss-cross, but no matter what the order or length, there is no rule at all, the degree of chaos and complexity is not inferior to that of a knocked goat intestine - the layout of Florence in 1478 is very interesting, as a division It is neither wealth nor status, but surname and blood. Family members with the same surname, along with relatives, dependent priests, businessmen, mercenaries, servants and artisans belonging to oneself, or Live around a square so that you can gather the most power and support the most in the shortest possible time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Square boulder grows like a climbing plant next to a stretch of leaves - a thick wall that is isolated from hatred and hatred, and a guarded swallowtail Passports and battlements, barriers, heavy iron bars, awl-like cage towers, large and pointed, two-color arches with shields and crests greedily compete for every inch of space and light. Their thick shadows are intimately stacked together, so that between the two blocks, there is always only one line in the sky, and the streets must be dark and dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling committee of Florence has issued relevant decrees more than once, trying to contain or correct this bad trend, but always because of all kinds of reasons. The strong family is always connected to a specific block, and it is never easy to move. For example, Albizzi Street belongs to the Albizzi family, and the residential threshold in the Piruzi Square is mostly engraved with Piruzi. The national emblem, while the base of the Baldi family is on the Baldi Street on the south bank of the Arno River... and the San Lorenzo district of the Medici family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medici family’s residence is located in the eastern part of the ruling square. The brown fort-style buildings are rough, old and square, like the tower of Babel’s forgotten in the world. The cornerstone, except for the arched windows of each layer, the only decoration is the triangular relief decoration at the position of the main entrance threshold - the two giant lions on both sides guard the symbol of Florence, and the stamens in the coat of arms are prominent. Lily) - not the ridiculous lilies and small ball-like crests of the Medici family, because it is also the office of the Florentine ruling group, the then Medici family's parents, Cosimo I, on this issue Made a fairly generous concession. ·<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His efforts have paid off quite a lot in the next half century. The signs of lilies and small balls spread day after day, spreading from the least noticeable places, and proliferating...today, it And the power and philosophy of the Medici family it represents covers almost the entire city of Florence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliano de Medici, the second son of the Medici family, covered in a scarlet sleeved cloak, slowly stepping out of Weiqi The Palace of Olympiad follows a shadow of a zigzag tower towards a straight and spacious passage (compared to other roads). Like the second son of all the family, he is taller, handsome, strong and bohemian than his brother Lorenzo... The last point seems to make him more attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Florence give way to him, pay tribute to him, or shout "Medic" name to support, and the second son of Medici With a more humble and welcoming attitude - no matter what he salutes, he is a rude butcher, a notary public, a prominent member of the chamber of commerce, or a sculptor who wears a tight-skinned leather pants, or a hat and hair. The prostitute who hangs the bell in accordance with the law, or the confessor wearing a black spire, he can give him the justice he deserves. This kind of pleasant and satisfying behavior seems simple and easy, but it is quite rare in a crowd of his age, especially when the young man has the wealth, status and appearance that ordinary people can't reach; so, Although his face was a little pale, his movements were a little stiff, and the timing of his response was not perfect, but the people of Florence, especially the women, agreed that his rudeness was not derived from the arrogance in his heart. After all, two years ago, it was his lover, "Venus in the world", the day of the death of Mrs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their inference is not entirely wrong, but it is also far from the truth. Most of the reasons for this young man’s embarrassment come from, not emotion, and this must be attributed to Giuliano and his brother’s father, the “gout” Piero de Medici. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of phenomenon is a disease cursed by the devil. It always falls in the middle of the night, there is no trace, no way to predict, in a flash can make a healthy and strong It is difficult for young people to move and suffer. - A quarter of patients compare the pain of gout attacks to being pierced by a sword; one-fifth compares it to a bone break; one-third is like a charcoal fire, and the rest thinks this pain is fundamental Unable to describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliano belongs to the last type, and he developed a disease before the dawn of Good Friday (the first two days of the resurrection Sunday). He has already tortured him for a whole night and two days, during which even a slight activity or touch may cause him to faint. In the worst of times, the red and swollen knees and calves could not even bear the weight of even a silk sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brother Lorenzo de Medici also had the same dysentery - their father "gout" Piero de Medici gave the two sons the Medici-style high nose, raised jaw, narrow and long When the eyes and the tough facial contours are also engraved into the list of the eccentric diseases of their own life; just as he gives honor, status, power, and money to the next generation of Medici, it is also hostile. , blasphemy, resentment, and hatred are all invested together - although this is not his intention, but the world is always the case, who can do everything smoothly, satisfactory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second son of Medici breathed slightly, licking his teeth and waiting for another wave of pain in the past - he narrowed his eyes and looked up, St. Ma The red octagonal vault of the Cathedral of Lia Del Flore is in sight. In order to expand the plaza, the ruling party made a resolution. The ignorant powers originally living in this area were charged with various crimes in the blink of an eye. Their property was confiscated. Houses and towers were forcibly demolished, and everyone, including vulnerable women, newborn babies and dying old people, were forced to humiliate in a few days to migrate to remote areas and even be exiled - the feelings of the Florentine people are always so Extremely, not at the end of the balance, at the end of the scale - they never care about lifting a family, someone is high; never minding that he falls heavily and tramples into mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Christ is resurrected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resurrection really!" This announcement is obviously rushing With his own, Giuliano had to suppress the intolerance and temper caused by the pain, and replied with a glimpse of the canon. At the same time, he turned around as little as possible, preparing to kiss the nasty informant three times in accordance with the rules of Easter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glittering Francisco de Pach emerges from the shadow of the gallery, the eldest son of the Pach family, the in-law of Giuliano. Bernardo Bendini is like a heel that follows his upper back. The two young people are wearing a gorgeous dress today, especially the young Pach, who is open with a silver-colored embossed brocade jacket embroidered with a gold-colored emblem, revealing a creamy white velvet tight-fitting blouse with a pearl and a neck hanging. The gemstone necklace, the pleated wide sleeves can be stuffed into another little Pach - fortunately today his shoulders, sleeves, and tights are not as exaggerated as the past - - Juliano remembers that when he saw the young Pach two days ago, the pleads (the shackles of the shackles) between his legs were embroidered with delicate patterns, set with gems and pearls. The filler makes it look like a baby head with a hat, not to mention the rest of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
