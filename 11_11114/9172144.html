			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baroness turned for a week and looked at the room that she might have to stay for a few days. The room was about nine steps long, nine steps wide, ground There are stone bricks on the wall, white lime coating on the top, beds that are not narrow, cotton and fur bedding, boxes and chairs and desks, and candles on the desk. The knight, who was responsible for escorting her, came in with a torch, and the baroness stepped forward, gently plucking a burning twig from the burning torch, the flame was only a few inches away from her hair and face, and it was blue. The skin brings color and warmth, "No windows." The baroness said: "Is it afraid that I will escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knight repair did not answer, he waited for one Yes, I saw that the twig was about to burn in half. The Baroness didn’t seem to ignite it. It was a little bit of fire, lit the candle, and the dark room suddenly became brighter – this action seemed simple It’s easy, in fact, to know what fine control it needs – when you turn around, you have to admit that you’ve been taken aback, because in this short moment, the Baroness has two more from him. The three-step place moved directly to his back, almost the chest is close to the chest, the breathing is clear and arguable, and the repair can see the little one in the eyes of this fascinating woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a knight, this is very inappropriate, especially repair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be upset about this." The baroness said calmly, and the burning twig was almost approaching her fingers, which made the Cavaliers The line of sight can hardly leave her hand. It is a pair of rough different from the civilian woman. It is also different from the hard hand of a female mercenary. It looks so beautiful. Besides the rose-colored water, the nail is also depicted. The rich pattern is said to have been learned from the elves, but some people say that it should first be popular in the palaces of the southern countries. Norman’s extravagant style has only arisen, and the repairs have only been seen on the nails of Mei Mi. Once or twice, it is like the pattern of flying leaves, but they are not even as complicated as the half of the Baroness: "If I don't have a little skill," said the Baroness, "I can't stand here and talk to you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange scent, the flame had burned to the fingers holding the twigs, but the Baroness still did not let it go, the spices dipped on the nails were in the heat Was rumored, knight Glanced at his prisoner, not even swapping the torch to the left hand - he just took a light shot at the waist, his short sword came out, and the steel weapon was rotated with a subtle but clear bloody suffocation for half a week. Hold, the baroness only felt cold, the flame on her finger fell to the ground, the boots repaired by the Cavaliers, and it quickly went out - like the singer of the nightingale. atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have a good rest," said Xiu, using a tone that can be said to be gentle. "The Royal Highness may call you tomorrow." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baroness raised an eyebrow: "His Royal Highness? Just Your Highness, then what about our Lord of the Lord?" She arrogantly put her hand on one shoulder. Remind the knight that his allegiance to the object is like a madman who hurts himself, and a woman, at least not a woman who is not their enemy, should have received the most basic respect. Oh, look at what she caught – a woman who was disappointed because of the gentleness of her repairs (his emotions were not disturbed by the Baroness) happily rolled up her lips, for Birdwin and the daughter Liona. As the leader of the "nightingale", of course she could not know nothing about it, but as she saw and guessed today, the lovers did not seem to be as sweet and tacit as people thought, without any gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not something I can know." Remedy, while feeling a slight sadness, he is no longer the person closest to Birdwin. As time went by, the battle between the new king and Chun'an and the rolling, more and more people gathered in the majesty of the royal girl Li Oona, the knights, especially the young knights, approximated blindly... worshipped Devin, for them, Birdwin is the hero of the singer of the book and the bard who left the parchment and the flute to come to them - humble origins, glory of merit, excellent martial arts, he covered The noble status and title of the body is not because of the blood, but entirely from the strength and loyalty of the person - and has acquired a beautiful (albeit a little non-mainstream) princess's love, even if he does not hesitate to leave the surname and the throne, what else? Can people enjoy the same glory as Bywin? Probably only the royal girl Li Aona, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Bird seems to be more willing to get along with these young people, he is not directly alienated and cold to be repaired But repairs, and those who once obeyed the command of the king, the Knights who imprisoned Birdwin were able to detect the difference, just like the repair, they were silent, and when the night was quiet, let the fine needle prick themselves. The heart - they thought their loyalty would never be shaken and changed, but in these young people, like the hot sun, bright and dazzling, their hesitation and disobedience are like the melting of snow. Gray-black stains underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was preparing to return to His Royal Highness, she was in the room of the king, the room for the deliberation, and saw that the companion was shaking her head, indicating that he would not go in, and then he heard the vague roar. There was a scream, and he sighed long in his heart. This is not the first time that the prince Liona and Birdwin have had a dispute - if it is still in the Thunder, perhaps he will be infinitely biased towards Byrdwin, but He has been exiled for so many years. Unlike Bydwin, on the long and difficult road of exile, they must use whatever means to play tricks to make the most people survive. Therefore, today's repairs are more biased towards the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Thunder Castle, except that human beings are orcs, it may be only taxation and annual debriefing that Bedwin is troubled with, but the outside world is different, in ordinary people. Body. It is difficult for you to find the dividing line between good and evil. They are all gray, not black, nor white. More people just live in chaos. Maybe they are not evil people, but they are credulous, ignorant, and paranoid— - The act of righteousness and light is like a white cub, but we all know that white cubs are the easiest to die in the wilderness. Needless to say, they are soldiers, knights, strangers, and even enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have to learn to lie, use, and give in, after paying the price of blood and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the royal girl, Leona’s Highness, even in the Thunder Castle, Xiu has heard that Pharaoh will know that he can’t get a male heir again. The daughter who was similar to the exiled came back. In those few years, Leona was raised and taught as a male heir, and the repair did not feel that Pharaoh would only let Leona see those. It has been written on parchment or told by people that the act and means of the king have proved this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Bydwin. Don Cray did not change, he stubbornly refused to change, he was burdened with depravity, perhaps because of this, he demanded himself - - He wants everything he does, no matter what, to be the weight that will restore the balance. And repair... has vaguely felt something wrong, repair is not a follower of Tyre, but he will also pray to the fair, the protector of the commander, the god of justice and justice, or listen to the preacher’s preaching, He doesn't think that Tyre is a god who will be impressed by glory, strength, and sacrifice. Now, repair can only hope that Birdwin's loyalty to Leona and Highland Norman will give him the forgiveness of Tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hitting the ground, the repairs suddenly jumped out of their own thoughts, and Birdwin slammed the door and rushed out. The knight standing at the door had no time to salute him, and from the open threshold, I can see that the girl Li Naina showed a tired and helpless look. She could not convince Baldwin, but she could not accommodate Bedwin. - Some people in the eyes of Birdwin are as dirty and evil as the rotten goblins, but if these despicables can help them. Leona said that some of them can be regarded as a special businessman, and in the eyes of the king, it is possible to exchange gold coins or other things that are not so important for their most urgently needed assistance. Well, she is not going to be friends, in-laws or allies with them. Whether they are good or pure has nothing to do with the king, and it has nothing to do with Birdwin or any of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wend always insists on not being associated with any evil person. The former Gülen has made him quite vocal, and today, the Baroness is It became the cutting edge of the last thread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona knows why he hates the Baroness so much, and Baldwin’s wife, Penny, can be said to have died from the Baroness’s “nightingale”. The Baroness’s “nightingale” taught me to confuse her, to make her pregnant with a child who was not Baldwin, and to induce her to kill her husband. Without a doubt, Penny was a The key is that it opens the door to conspiracy and releases the sorrow, despair and pain hidden in it. If you must get to the bottom, in the case of Leona’s father, the Baroness is not so innocent, not to mention Penny, Lee Oona’s hidden in the necklace pendant is also a “nightingale” from the princess. The close-knit maids heard about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if Leona knows this, she must accept the Baroness. After the new king and Diane, the Highlands Norman has fallen into the king’s office and does not want to see it. In the chaos, now that Thunderbolt and the king have fallen, it is imaginable that it is only a matter of time before Norman’s entire territory can be prevented from being effectively eaten by the orcs. It is the fastest time to find and gather those who are still willing to be highland Norman. The battle of Sir Alex and the Cavaliers - Leona is not impossible, but compared to the "Silver Finger" and "Stolen", the Baroness's "nightingale" is more reliable, in any case, the leader of the thieves union will not leave His own lair, quietly waiting in the small room arranged by the king girl to listen to orders at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
