But in fact, almost every caster, including some seemingly sacred priests, is a pragmatic pragmatist. They will love the beautiful tapestries, the gorgeous silver pots, the intricate carvings and statues, but they are more than ordinary people. They not only demand their beauty but also require them to have extremely practical functions, just like the smog cottages of Alva Master. Metal Golems, when they are at rest, everyone who sees them will be amazed by their lifelike and ingenious work, even if they have one or two alabasters and bronzes in their own courtyard and foyer. The people who made Miao Miaojie as the Betty Dyke had always had a fanatical attitude towards the United States. Although Alvara said that he was an outsider who had lived here for a long time and obtained the highest status, he was also contaminated by some of their habits. Master Alva will not put the sculptures of two snakes in the foyer, as one of the most important locations of a building. It is not a pity that this place has only the effect of viewing and changing clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his hall, as we have described, almost everything can cause fatal damage to the wizard’s enemies, and the haze cottage is only Al One of the Waffle's places for friends and rest is not his tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Master had expected his tower to be taken by other people, perhaps the inhabitants of the White Tower and the enemies of the elves before leaving the White Tower, those shameless The thieves used it, he resolutely ruined his own magic image, the magic trap and laboratory in the tower, the study room was cleaned up, some of the huge instruments that could not be taken away were also corrupted by the spells he cast, except some He couldn't ruin and take away things in a short time, like his summoning room. In order to avoid an evil thing that was inadvertently summoned by him to break through the ban, the whole room was not only placed at the bottom of the tower, but also placed and placed various layers of restraint and shackles if not before the millennium catastrophe. The silver golem reappears in the hands of the gnome McGee and the Lich, and they may have to work hard to get out of Bedwin. But this is a special room after all. Other rooms can only be said to be slightly more dangerous than ordinary people's bedrooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a room for a disciple below them. He may be more hurried than his teacher when he left, and his copy table is still half a volume. A piece of parchment is covered with dust. The ink bottle was dumped, polluting the paper, and the pen fell under the table, but the fixed ruler of the two handles on the table had been dismantled and removed, and it might now become a thief's finger knife or dagger. The bed was also lying down, there was no account (I didn’t know if it was taken or not), but the pillows and sheets, the blankets were kept, when they fell. Birdwin fell on the side of the single bed, and the whole bed slammed over. The former paladin fell to the ground with a gray face, and the gnome followed, and he dexterously rolled the body into a ball. Like a rolling ball, it rolls over the plum robes, and the thief Gülen falls on the other side of the bed like a big cat, his hand on his fine gold dagger, in the pygmy When he wants to stand up, he will pick him up with his toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If McGee is a dwarf. It is sure to be thunderous because of the rude behavior of thieves. I have to use my big hammer to knock Gülen’s head as a chopping block. But McGee is still a dwarf. Gülen’s move only makes his face in the dark. Shortly gloomy for a while. But he just stayed in the original, that is, the position designated by the thieves did not move at all, but Gülen did not intend to let this small enough team to make more mistakes because of some untimely moves, he flipped the gold dagger, The refined gold originally emits a soft silver-blue ray in the dark, so the thieves asked the gnomes to plate a layer of black matter on the fine gold. Lest your sneak attack and stealth become a big joke that is worth a hundred years in the thief group, but in the position of shaking hands, he left a thin line without processing, like now, in a glimmer of light In the darkness that is hard to find, he can let his companions see what he wants them to see without having to light the candles or open the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a moment, but McGee and Birdwin have seen the flash of steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A small device." Gülen said that he had determined that the owner of the room had left: "The thieves used it to capture people who entered their room without permission." "The messy and tiny serrated clips, each can jump like a silent puppy, and there is no doubt that even if there is no rust, it has been soaked in the feces and there are several interlaced steel wires." They are pulling the machine, they may have a smashing arrow, or they may be sharp alarms, but fortunately, they fell from the roof, and the thief did not seem to think that the top is also a breakthrough. Good direction, his layout is almost on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German quickly dismantled the device left by the thief, and Baldwin restored his new arm to the style of a wide sword. Lightly pushing the door open, but to their surprise, the corridor and the steps that rotate along the outer wall of the tower are empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They didn't find us?" Meimei muttered, moving her fingers to the ankles without notice, when she was falling. Twisted, she glanced at the place where they left before leaving the room, there is a creepy silence like the outside, "Is it Creemar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Gülen said: "unless they are all blind and blind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up, or down?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a lot of windows in this tower." Gülen said: "I remember that not every window is made of stone bricks." Closed, we may be on the fourth floor or above. I remember that only the windows below the fourth floor were sealed. The four floors were also above, but I have seen them. They only nailed the boards barely outside. I I hope that is also true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are only likely to encounter more and more thieves, and of course, there will be, but as long as they are cleaned up, Don't worry about rapid proliferation, Mei Mei unconsciously aimed at Birdwin as long as he could open the window. She, Gülen, and Gnomes are all fine, but the windows on the Master's Tower are not used for archery, but they are not too big. They are worried that Birdwin could not drill out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We go up," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room in Bedford was detained at the bottom of the tower. They had to escape from the first floor of the tower, but it was also the most defensive place. The transfer was obviously restricted and disordered here. Kreima cast spells, and the raging flame sent them to a certain level of the tower. The specific layer is unknown. Birdwin couldn’t know if the caster had expected this for a long time. They rolled out from a burning hearth, and their enemies followed two warlocks. They were all dragged by Kremar, but those thieves, even if they were afraid of the scrolls of the plum and the rune of the gnomes, perhaps the sword of Baldwin and the dagger of Gülen, but it was like Like the lion's hyena, even if you don't dare to go forward, you can always see their towering ears in the shadow of the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not necessarily safe to represent quietly, they are not only greeted by fresh air and blue skies. There is also a torrential arrow like a rainstorm, and Mei Mi holds the reel. This is the black-haired caster who co-authored with the Gavin Norman's Gavin, and whether they can retreat from the whole body may want to see them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is replaced within one hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a room for a disciple below them. He may be more hurried than his teacher when he left, and his copy table is still half a volume. A piece of parchment was covered with dust, the ink bottle was dumped, the paper was contaminated, and the pen fell under the table. However, the fixed ruler of the two handles on the table has been dismantled and taken away. It may now become a thief's finger knife or dagger. His bed is also lying down, there is no account (I don't know Was taken away or not originally). But the pillows and sheets, the blankets were kept.

The gnome followed, and he dexterously rolled the body into a ball, like a rolling ball, rolling over the plum robes, and the thief Gülen fell on the other side of the bed like a big cat. His hand was placed on his own gold dagger, and when the gnome McGee wanted to stand up, he was put aside with his toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If McGee is a dwarf, he will definitely be thunderous because of the rude behavior of thieves. He has to use his big hammer to knock Gülen’s head as a chopping block. But McGee is still a gnome.

For this reason, the thieves asked the gnomes to plate a layer of black material on the fine gold, lest they The sneak attack and sneak became a big joke that was worth a hundred years in the thief group, but in the position of shaking hands, he left a thin line without processing, like now, it is hard to find in a glimmer of light.
