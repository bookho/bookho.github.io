			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf toe rarely takes such an adventure, but this time he must, because all the dead are the ones who are the most damn - he is alive, then this task It is a failure. [Latest chapter reading] The wolf toe is not smart, but the leader of the guild has clearly told him that the tolerance of the guild is based on every successful task. As long as he fails once, his privilege will be Deprivation himself will also be punished - the wolf toe has seen the guild members who have been punished, sometimes he and his animal tools are still performers, he does not want to try their own taste at all; at the same time he is lucky, he is not ignorant Man, his father is a priest. He also saw the so-called casters in the guild and in the mission. They are not like the stupid civilians or slaves who believe that the sword does not invade. His father was cut off by the double-edged axe and limbs. And the casters, they are even weak and unable to resist a small dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He succeeded in hiding his actions in the flames, smog and the wolf's tumbling and screaming, but the smog is too annoying, they are like long hair The little hand couldn't stop his eyes and throat, and in the final step he couldn't stop coughing, but fortunately the distance was enough for him to cut the axe over the fragile white neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His favorite axe can cut down a thick eucalyptus tree at a time, not a bowl of humans, a bowl of orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The axe was cut on the raised arm, and the wolf toeded his eyes, but he did not panic. He knew that the sharp axe would be cut. Break the arm, then go down, cut the neck, and maybe cut off half of the shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the imaginary bloody scene did not appear, the arm of the caster wearing a white robe (the wolf toe thought he was also a pastor) was not broken. It was safe and turned and grabbed the joint between the axe and the wooden handle. A huge force pushed it away from the wolf's toe, and then the other hand of the black hair caster appeared in front of the wolf's toe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something pulling his strength from the body of the wolf toe, he fell down heavily and straight, his eyes wide open, his saliva from Zhang The mouth opened out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is alive, still able to breathe, can make a sound, but can't move, can't even shake a little finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar is stunned to give this ugly half-orc second eye, he stepped on the body where the wolf and the young wolf are still burning, to see Ya Dell's situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadell was in the body of the chief pastor... in vain, trying to block the bleeding hole with his fingers, but the blood still overflowed his palm, and the chief pastor looked at him and looked at his young disciple, he Maybe he wants to say something, but the sound slips away from the broken trachea; he may still want to hold Adal’s hand, but touch his hair, but as we know, human power is As the blood flowed away, he had to look at Yadel and look at him until the last glimmer of life dissipated from the muddy eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar turned his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks he can never get used to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster is looking for the cave of the chief pastor. He remembers that it is near the cave of Yadell, and the drugs that Kremar brings are collected there. I found it, got it in, it was dark and wet inside, but fortunately the powder and potion were all in small bottles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got out, he heard a faint voice calling for help, and the spellcaster dispelled the smoke from the source of the sound, not surprisingly discovering others. Alive, a child who is about to change from a boy to a boy, an apprentice of Pastor Rosada, his face is bitten and bloody, his body is also, but he is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, when Yadell saw the apprentice, his eyes became a bit weird: "Also...does anyone still alive?" he asked hoarsely, his eyes red. It’s like dropping blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, there is a half-orc." Kremar said, "You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yaliel silently looked at the apprentice, the apprentice squinted and lowered his eyes, screaming, on the one hand, the pain is indeed unbearable, on the other hand, out of fear - a despicable traitor to the betrayed by the betrayal, He knows that this black hair caster, who is always dressed in a white robe, is a friend of Yadel. He may refuse to treat him because of Yadel's request or out of anger, throw him here and wait to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Yadel did not say anything. He silently accepted the help of Krimar, and then watched him give the apprentice the same treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the half-orc?" When he was ready, he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Suddenly and want to cut my head with an axe." Kreima simply replied, dragging the body of a young wolf under the apprentice's neck, the elf's powder and potion have a miraculous effect, his face is already It gradually healed, but the nose and lips must not return, and his teeth and gums were exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc was still lying, Yadel looked at him for a while, and he lowered his knees hard and rummaged through him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guild's mark." Yadel said tiredly "Help me a favor, cut off his clothes and look at his shoulders or chest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just an ordinary adventurer." Toe said, "I just curious to come over and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then I found out that my head is not in line with your aesthetic?" Crimmar sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An ordinary adventurer would not wear a woolen coat and a silk shirt, a lizard-skinned boot, and would not carry a gold chain and carry Steel axe and dagger." Yadel said that the haze swept across his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf toe closed his mouth, Kremar cut his clothes, but they had nothing but dirty skin and stinky fur Can find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An ordinary adventurer also has the right to dress himself up beautifully." The wolf toes insisted shamelessly, "There are also a few pieces that can be used for Self-protected weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you believe him?" Yadel asked Crimmar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale pulled out the dagger that was originally a wolf toe, gasped, and placed his cold blade on his eyelids: "I don't believe it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light morning light is changing when Crimmar returns to the Grey Ridge Bright and vivid, the starlight river has a golden scorpion, and the otter sits on the wooden pier next to the water to comb his fur, and he screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich who regained control of the body was already aware that someone was waiting for him when he was nearly a hundred feet away from his home, but he did not expect that person would actually be Kerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a bad news to tell you." The Lich said bluntly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also have a...not very good news to tell you." Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar took out from his own arms, the singer, who was almost stunned by feathers, handed him: "Sorry," the lich is not Sincerely said: "No loss of heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gosula yelled again when he saw Kerry Ben, but this time is not anxious It is anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bad news you said is this?" Kerry originally held Gosula in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a pity," said the Lich. "No. Kerry Ben - is a pastor of Rosada, a pastor," he added: "They were attacked by a group of giant wolves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the blue eyes of the elf: "Only two people survived, Yadel, and an apprentice , everyone else is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unexpected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Lich Pulling a finger out of his pocket, the thick black hair on it has been scraped clean, and the gray-blue tattoo marks are visible – a grid of densely slanted diagonal lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A thief union called 'fine net', they accepted a generous commission, and the giant wolves were sent by a thief from the storm. The temptation to the north, he is a half-orc with the blood of the priests, their leader, and their minds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who's commission?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person who has little power to know." The Lich said: "But Yadel knows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Kerry has raised his head and he read the name from Kremar’s dark eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
