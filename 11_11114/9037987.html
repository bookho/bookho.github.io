			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Stand up,” said Kremar, “Let me see your face. Read the book w/ww.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man stood up immediately, and he looked up, but in order to show his obedience, he did not look directly at the caster, but instead placed his sight on the edge of the knee-white robe - That's right, black gowns, white gowns, gray cloaks, and people's descriptions are no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar is also observing this person, he should be a man, but has an unspeakable sense of violation - he only uses a grayish white The linen is wrapped around the waist, although the corners of the linen are embroidered with delicate flowers, silver chains on the neck, and a pair of dark gray whale boots, but this dress suggests that he may not have one His own identity, he rarely stored long, but completely removed his head, so that people can clearly see the bones erected behind the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about an elbow shorter than the black caster, with fair skin, a pair of calm, brown eyes, and a crisp, beautiful sound. The ability of ordinary people to observe and observe and the dexterous tongue that has been cast magic, and the killer that his master has given - as the ninth son of the lord, the inviting person has an entire island, he has his own soldiers, Land, oceans and reefs, thousands of slaves and hundreds of gnomes. I want to read the book., 1`<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The island owned by the ninth son of the East Crown owner is about a few miles away from the Red Throat Port. It is rooted in warm green. Among the seawater, a large reef with a strip-shaped extension is separated from the East Crown by a wide-packed shallow sea lagoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central high elevation of the island is like the ridge on the spine of the turtle. The fortress and palace of the Lord's Son are in the center of the towering ridge. From there, Overlooking the entire island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extremely attentive hospitality began when they agreed to the invitation. It is gratifying that they were left in the basket and left behind by the slaves, wearing luxurious clothes. The servant summoned a beautifully decorated soft sedan with a dark brown tulle covering the sun, carried by two seemingly thin slaves, but even one of them was carrying a fine gold sword. It can reach hundreds of pounds of Bedwin. They are still light when they lift the sedan chair, just as it carries only a phantom rather than a real human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's priest slightly lifted the fabric hanging from the fingertips of the little finger to the underside of the car, gently licking and assessing their value, and then she was not surprised to make these thin fabrics not fly around. The pendant was made with precious sea pearls. I want to read the book w·ww. She hesitated, and still controlled her fingers, did not pull out a few, in order to ensure that afterwards, she struggled to turn her eyes to the outside world - They are walking through a delightful shade of green – both precious and common trees. The birds with beautiful feathers sing in the dense branches and leaves, and they are comparable to the parasitic plants that stretch out from the green-brown branches. Their petals are strong and tender, and their colors are bright. Bright, some like a naked male, like a flying white dove, or like a cute hood or a wide-brimmed hat, they pour down like a tidal wave, scattered and clean Subtle fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owners of the island welcome them in the spacious pillar hall, which has no walls. The cool sea breeze passes through the entire hall without any obstruction, giving people unparalleled coolness and fresh air – some of them are unexpected, the owner of the island is also a young man, and come to greet Their servants have an age of almost the same age, wrapped in gorgeous silk and precious Mithril, wearing a pair of ingenious lace-up flats, Mei Mei heard the glan around him snoring slightly, it seems that he is also very Know the value of the shoes - if Meimi can steal it, then she does not have to worry about how to be accepted and taken over by a strange Fro Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t talk for a long time, exactly. I want to read the book ╋·1╋k╳a┼n╬s╳hu·c·c The young lord’s attention is almost on the black caster, but he quickly understands They were asked to rest, especially the Master, and apologized for the impolite and rude behavior of the servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way he apologized was to whipping everybody who was sent by him - these people were whipped. Then people put alive starfish on those horrible wounds. The way the starfish prey on prey is to turn their stomach out, engulf the prey, secrete digestive enzymes, melt it and absorb it, and have a big appetite. Young sea stars can eat one-and-a-half times their own weight in one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Gülen couldn’t look directly at this scene. Plum honey is pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meimi’s face didn’t get better until she returned to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that a slave?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be said." Gülen said - he has his own room, but he and Mei Mi are still not finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't quite understand. I want to read the book. -1·k`a/n," said Mei Mi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be the son of the lord of the East Crown." The thief played with his fine gold, letting it rotate in his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the sons." The thief added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey compares the gap between him and the son of another lord, it is a world of difference! "Is not married to have children?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that there is no difference between a illegitimate child and a married child on Longhuo Island. The male of Longhuo Island has no wife." Lan has some helplessness. Drake is a poor quality. He is good at and willing to gossip. The thieves are always willing to get some free information: "They only have slaves. If they want children, it is very simple, from their own slaves. Pick a pleasing eye that you can see, and a female slave who can give birth. If not, then go buy one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sticks his tongue and licks it The blade of the dragonfly, this handle is not attached to the magic, but its blade is always cold, whether it is in the Norman Highlands or the Dragon Fire Island. "The slave girl will be kept in his house or palace for a period of time to ensure that the blood is not polluted. If the girl is born... It can be said that it was lucky hundreds of years ago, because the Longhuo Island had Hundreds of lords, they need to use marriage to consolidate the alliance, or to paralyze the enemy, but since the forces of the Dragon Fire Island finally got an unprecedented balance - East Crown, West Gate, Nanxun and North, each big island There is only one lord, one voice, one ruler, and the lords of other islands are just small people who are not worth mentioning. They no longer need to succumb to anyone, so their female descendants will only become a slave." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about men?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men will be left behind." The thief changed for a more comfortable The posture, "Be aware that women's production is limited, and men are how many descendants they want to have, so they always have as few as dozens, as many as hundreds, and their ages are similar." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;</div>
