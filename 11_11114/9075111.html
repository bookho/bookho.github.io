Open, the extra parts are rolled up and tied together - fortunately, Mei Mi will not wear anything in the robes like some priests or mages - there is also a sleeveless long shirt and shirt inside. The hem is enough to cover the buttocks and some less elegant parts, but the pygmy McGee still shouts his nose unsatisfactorily, running away from the priest Fro, and the human males certainly cannot see the ones at their height. The spring is shining, but McGee’s head is only on the hips of the plum. The gnomes are not interested in women outside this race. They think that humans or other humanoids are both poor and dirty. It is completely inferior to the small elegance of a gnome woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich did not care too much and paid attention to Plum and McGee, who followed the snake of the Mithril in a smog and dull light. In the corridor, the luster of the metal changes and flashes steadily. Under the influence of the spell, it may be faster than the average male human running. If Cremari's body does not have half the blood of the elf, He will be as breathless as the gnomes and priests that follow, and they will be embarrassed—they ran into the turns, corridors, or walls of the walls, even on the way. It is the sword and arrow that is punctured under the floor. If the attack is toward the black hair caster, then he may throw a spell to dispel the obstacles in the road, but after a few thieves, they also noticed The mystery, they changed to give up the caster in front, and attacked the priest and gnome behind the caster, but if they thought they could pinch a soft persimmon, it was a big mistake. From the initial horror She took off, her goddess was watching her, and generously gave her strength, she became sharp and strong, and although she did not like to face the enemy, but this does not mean she has no sharp tips. Teeth and claws - sometimes not even needed. She may have cast only one of the most primitive gods, making the enemy hesitate, timid, full of fear, or being ordered to fall to the ground - even for a short moment. But that was enough for the gnome McGee to lift his two toy-like shackles tied to his arms, shooting every enemy he could see, being in the height of the gnome and the evil taste of racial traits. The position he is aiming at is almost below the waist, he does not need to hit the key (although some guys are really a bit unlucky). Because the hollow arrows that are as fine as a large needle contain the venom taken from the blue-ringed octopus, and one pierces into the skin and muscles, based on the pressure, the venom will inject into the enemy's body - the kind of shame, only in When the attack is carried out, the venom possessed by the beautiful small octopus that dazzles the blue light will be poisoned to a person with a little bit of damage. Although it will not die immediately, the person who is caught by it will be destroyed first. The nervous system, he will feel paralyzed, unable to speak, unable to move. I can't breathe. Although my mind is sober, I only die painfully and slowly because of suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McGee brought all the things that made him feel safe. Adventure is not a pastime that gnomes will choose, but he said that he wants to be a dwarf, when Cremal and others did not appear. He can only dress himself up as a dwarf, remove the jewelry, not apply the powder, reject the satin and tulle, and put on the leather apron. With bare feet, with fake beards and fake eyebrows, he spoke deliberately in a whisper, but he was also very clear. These are not enough. Just look at his people and those human beings who can always snicker to know, so he continues to live away from the people and their isolated life. He took every exquisite and luxurious ornament in the room. Changed his mark (his original mark is a bird that is coiled with beautiful grassy patterns), and the things that have been created have been changed from the delicate gadgets of jewelry, chain armor, and rune plate to hammers and shields. . Even if I was annoyed by the lord, I was not ignorant of the ordinary gnomes who had been exiled to the craftsmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But every night, the travel notes and poems that were pressed under his bed, the parchment scrolls that he repeatedly flipped through and the edges were broken, told His dwarf is not like this. If McGee started to become a dwarf rather than a dwarf because of the indifference of the innocent people, his heart has been uncontrollably directed since he saw the records of the adventurous life. The grand and gorgeous story went away - isn't it? This is the goal of a gnome, or a wise creature that has expectations for yourself. Look at his people. What do they look like? Decorative gorgeous locusts only! They are indifferent to the things outside the Dragon Fire Island, or the East Crown, or that the things on the island do not have much to do with them. Anyway, whoever rules the islands will need them to serve them, the dwarves Hate the water, even if it is robbed to the Longhuo Island, it will die very quickly because of its stubborn temper and straightforward temperament. So who else? Elf? No, even a madman knows what an elf means - only gnomes, these Lotte, selfish, gorgeous, benevolent or hateful, can only leave a little impression on their little hearts. Will be willing to crouch at the feet of human beings, and use their skills in exchange for the so-called peaceful and affluent life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not right! McGee thought, he irritatedly flipped through every piece of parchment. No, no gnome became a recognized hero. They couldn't even be a wicked person who dared to confront the adventurers. Only in certain At the end of the chapter, you are fortunate enough to get a word. If those who write these poems have better and more things to write, then even these few words will become a luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the gnome not stronger than the dwarf? Since his tribe and his parents once contemptuously called the dwarves "the hamster," they should have been stronger than the dwarves. Shouldn't the descriptive descriptions be used in the gnomes? Standing next to the knights and elves should also be gnomes. If you get the king to receive and give the gold cup, you should also be a gnome. People are throwing petals and welcoming them. All the places they admire should be gnomes. But he only saw dwarves, dwarves, dwarves, and countless dwarves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McGee once wanted to participate in the ranks of adventurers as a gnome, but unfortunately, those adventurers are not laughing. After arbitrarily teasing and mocking, he threatened him to play him as a ball. He tried to make him a substitute for a halfling. Although McGee never left the Longhuo Islands, he also knew that the halflings never There is no role as a thief and a liar. There are also some adventurers who promise to promise, but the final goal is to first obtain some free weapons and equipment from him - they also mentioned the dwarves, who are talking about the dirty, rude, violent "hoof" The eyes and the tone are completely different from the gnomes, although they often curse the dwarves, because the dwarves are always very good at using their hammers to promote justice and justice. But this is completely different. The dwarves will make them fear, let them admire and let them respect (even if they can't stop them from cutting a dwarf's throat if possible), and the gnomes will only make them disgusted and despised, even if Gnomes are also quite dangerous at some point - if you need to compare it wisely, the gap between the two is like a wild boar and a skunk, and if a hunter can offer his own strength when rounding up the wild boar, It allowed him to brag in the pub for a few days, but if he only singled out a skunk - it would be dangerous. It's tough, but many times, hunters are even ashamed to mention that their prey has included a skunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I will be a dwarf, McGee thinks this way, but before Kremar and others came to Longhuo, he could only pretend to be A dwarf, not a dwarf, is the companion of Kreima who gave McGee hope that they don't think it is ridiculous for a dwarf to become a dwarf, and it is not a different eye for him. Treat each other. This is good, McGee likes it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s not just the reason that McGee has followed them away from the Long Fire Island – the artists who were brought by McGee’s unmarried wife. "When she left McGee and she was arrested, he was only cast because he had learned from the letter eagle of Luzer's Grand Duke that he had the command of the mutant Cremaar - he and Kerry Ben Use the flying wing boat to rush from the gray ridge to the Bibi dike, and then transfer from the Bibi dike to the side island. Just a short stop, I rushed from the side island to Bibi Dyke and transferred to the White Tower. McGee insisted on going with them to rescue Birdwin and the daughter Liona. His release was from Crema. Daren’s trust in them, but he knows that trust alone does not allow him and his unmarried wife to get rid of previous charges, even if they do not betray and sell their new owners, but they mistakenly bring the enemy to Bedwin, etc. In front of people, it is already a big mistake, and I want to recover. It is not a matter of moving the tongue, or something that can be solved with one or two precious jewels - he is offering his own strength, wisdom and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't like his unmarried wife, but McGee knows that the source of the whole thing is nothing more than a female gnome who wants to win the favor of her future husband. If he can play a role in this action, then he can pray to their new lord and ask him to forgive her, while McGee also holds a subtle ambition - that is, if he can show With their own strength, can they get a place in their future team? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that he thought he was ready, but when he was there, he knew that preparation was never enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he ran across a corridor, the floor under his feet suddenly collapsed. He heard the priest of Fro, screaming, her feet in his Shaking in front of him, he jerked out his hands and grabbed the beautiful satin shoe with pearls, but it was too slippery, his hands couldn’t help, and the fingers of the gnomes pierced the plum. In the gap between the instep and the toes, Fro's priest could not contain the painful groaning - snoring, she walked in front of the gnome, and when the ground collapsed, she quickly jumped forward and threw her upper body above the floor. Her fingers scratched the floor and her nails cracked, but she didn't dare to let go anyway. Gülen described to her what kind of traps thieves often set in their own guilds, like this under the collapsed floor. The tarred barrel is a pottery tank filled with acid. She struggles to climb up, but there is a dwarf on her foot. The weight and height of the gnome are no different from a child of three or four years old. But at this time, Mei Mei thinks he wants The lead-cast giant is still heavy, but she doesn't even dare to do the action of shaking her legs and kicking him. She is almost at the limit - she tries to pray for a god, to make herself strong or fly. But she only said a few words intermittently and realized that she could never finish the prayer before she fell. Mei Mi changed to call the black hair caster, but what made her desperate was that the caster did not seem to Feel the problem at the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mckey licked his head and looked down, only one or two inches from his toes, a calm translucent yellow-brown liquid, which was stored in In a huge pottery jar, it seems that the waves are not shocking, but the gnomes can smell the sour smell that makes him tremble. The gnomes have never seen a variety of acids and other corrosive solutions. After all, these things are often used in jewelry and weapons. He closes his eyes, swallows a sip of his mouth, and endless regrets and fears hit his heart. Yes, he regrets, why did he come here? He is just a gnome, even if he wants to be a dwarf, then he can live as calm and comfortable as a dwarf dressed as a dwarf, instead of hanging on the feet of a Froor, waiting for himself to fall into The acid, struggling to die in great pain, even a part of the body may not be able to stay - no, he does not want to die, McGee silently shouts, almost madly grasping the feet of plum, blood from His fingers flowed to his arm, and Fro's priest might be cursing, or cursing, or pleading, McGee couldn't hear, and he screamed sharply as the foot swayed down, he The boots are immersed in acid, and the acid flows into the pits that are corroded, soaking and swallowing his toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
