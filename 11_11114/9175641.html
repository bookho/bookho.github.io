			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of Grenada may have never been so quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who should be responsible for the failure of Grenada are silently imprisoned in their own homes, not in people's In the carnival, the image of the Virgin is pulling on the icy ground, not because of anything else, just Grid. This ancient red dragon has not appeared in the rock caves of Wangdu after unfolding the huge wings that are enough to cover the sky (this scene has not appeared for hundreds of years), and has not issued any gods. Oh, the shame and resentment in her heart is imaginable, but she was twice injured in the silver-crowned jungle, the first because of the saints of Angris, and the second because of the useless descendants— - It is impossible to break through the barrier of the lock without paying enough price, but it is different from the god of the orc, which is called the animal of the orc, but all the evil and chaotic fans can Becoming a follower of this one-eyed god, his followers include orcs, half-orcs, giants, goblins and humans, as well as fallen halflings and gnomes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs who crossed the three walls of Thunder Castle are tens of thousands of people, but the orcs who remain in the Whistling Plain are close to 20,000, and their leaders are not unwilling to give up. The status of his own, respecting Geshe is king, because the number of tribes is only a few dozen, at most more than one hundred people, which may include women and children and slaves. In the eyes of Gersh, they are like the plains. The gravel is generally small and naturally overlooked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the orcs can breed through orcs, humans, or giants. They are like weeds on the plains of the whistling, and they can be spread over the plains for more than a decade. Every corner of the scene - after the loss of Gersh, the situation in the plains will probably return to its original appearance - the tribes of all sizes will endlessly cross each other, and before the winter comes, they will entangle together and plunder the slaves south. And food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If possible, Greedy also hopes that he will be able to abandon the stupid goods that have stigmatized her in the silver crown jungle like the orc god Kay. Let the elf's sword arrows punish them for her, but she can't, the blood of the dragons will become richer or more thin because of the mixture. If they let these people die in the jungle, then the future grid The proportion of Warlocks produced by Reinada will be much lower - this means that Grenada will become weak, which is something that Red Dragon Gregorian will never allow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old red dragon licked the wound in his own nest, his eyes were sinister and sharp, and she knew that many people’s beliefs were shaken because she and them She was also teased by the elves, but she also believed that she would soon re-establish her authority and stand in their heart and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven days, the King of Granada is filled with the stench of blood and internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slaves walked under the slabs of the sky, and the dripping on the top of the head was not muddy water, but blood, and the noble blood could not guarantee that their owners could escape. For the punishment of the noble people, those who once wrapped the silk satin are on the street, the hooks pass through the flesh, they use their bodies to pull the heavy stone statues, but these are lucky, some are Greed believes that the people who need to take responsibility for this battle are penetrated on sharp lances, and these lances stand on the sides of the street, like strange decorations. If ordinary people are punished by puncture, the quickest ones can be relieved in the short time that Xinghe rises to Yokohama, but these people, they were specially selected by the priest of Gerdi, took the potion, and put the spear After being intentionally stabbed and shunned, these "ornaments" can be screaming and struggling for ten days in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slave hides his face behind a heavy cargo with a smile, but he hasn’t laughed for a few years. This smile is more like a hyena before preying. Smell the air, these people will also bleed, will feel pain, will despair to pray for a death? His heart couldn't help but feel that the slaves in his room saw it, but he said nothing, he would not report his own kind to the manager, nor would he reveal the latter's illusions. Before he became a slave, he was a scholar. Because he was young, he knew how to write and count. He lived longer than every slave here, but such luck is soon to end - their masters will let these things go. Have you seen your slaves who have suffered humiliation continue to live? After the arrival of the new slaves, they will die, and there will be no one left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy punishment almost smashed every Grinada in the kingdom, they were scarred, frustrated and angry, but Red Dragon, New King and None of the bloody dragons dare to speak, pray for the forgiveness and calm of this great existence, although they know that they may have been cursed millions of times by their courtiers and subordinates, but the weak curse of the weak is even millions of times. They were silent than Griffith's spit, until Grydy summoned them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy appeared in the form of a red dragon. She was entrenched in the center of the hall. The throne of the keel was removed. The huge body covered the light cast by the glass skylight. The scales of the ancient red dragon were dark red, some similar to black. The gap between the scales, like the charcoal fire that has not been completely extinguished, has a vague and slender red light, but unlike other red dragons, unlike the dragons, the body of Grein has not exploded a trace of heat, the closer she is to her The colder, like the new king, his hair bursts with a thin layer of frost, which makes him look like a colored ice snowman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the only minority in the royal city of Grenada who has not been punished, even the two red dragons can not help but reveal subtle Looks awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the side of the new king, usually his eldest son, Mitt, is standing, but today this position is occupied by another person, when people see him At that time, the expression could not help but be a bit weird, because some people, such as Austal, have recognized that it is not someone else, it is the birth father of his "disciple" Dylan, and the leader of the dragon thorn certainly knows that he and Greed It’s close, but I didn’t think it would be so close—as a mentor to Dylan, of course he knew that the Chancellor of the Treasury had no trace of dragon blood. He was not even a mage, just a mortal, but now Austal’s Seen, his face and hands were covered with red scales, and the erect pupils were surrounded by deep gold irises. The distinctive features of the dragons were revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just another mischief of “mother”. Austal comforts himself, but the heart that beats hard has not subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the hall have even become breathing. They know very well that there is no trace of heat around the body of the "mother", which does not mean that she has changed. It’s weak, but because she is accumulating all the anger, so that the heat around her body is absorbed relentlessly, and these anger are brewing into the most violent dragon fire, even the dragon fire, even the fine Gold Mithril is also inevitably melted into smoke - no one wants to try it... but maybe others can? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————————<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired dragon was not obstructed when he returned to Grenada, and even someone directed him - when he asked if he could see the "mother" At the time of Reti, the attitude of the maids was more enthusiastic and courteous than when they first came to Grenada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——There was something abnormal, the lich sighed, but it was still in my expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If she is not very satisfied with the gift, the soul of the opposite world says, can we run? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sorrow of the soul of the outside world, the undead who once died stepped into the cold hall, and everyone’s eyes fell on him. Some are full of worries (from New King and Mitt), some are full of malice and hatred (from Kelmen), and some are full of luck (from the twin brothers of Red Dragon) - their ideas should It is the same, that is, the newcomer will undoubtedly become the first victim of the Red Dragon Gree Dragon Fire. If there are still people who hold different opinions, it is probably Austal. His eyes are very curious. He doesn’t think that this dark-haired dragon is stupid to his hands. Empty land is self-investing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People think that the old red dragon will say something, but she said nothing, the transparent three-layered photographic film is closed, she looks calm When I fell asleep, my eyes were motionless after the stimuli, and the light lingered, like the gold that sank in the deep pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is finally willing to leave the arms of the elves?" The first person to speak, the amount, not unexpected, is Kelmen, fate seems I am willing to tease this pretentious dragon, he lost the most powerful support on the battlefield, that is, his mother, the only female red dragon. After returning to Wangdu, he learned his My sister, Kelsey, also had an accident in a demon riot caused by a false call. Of course, all the Grinada people knew that the so-called accident was nothing more than a particularly ingenious murder of design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Dragon Claws were also severely damaged in the battle, and the knights who lost the knights fled, and the knight who lost the Devil's claws still needs to manage. Seeking and taming a new mount, and the wounded (the former fortunately received assistance, whether it was coercion or trade), and the gap left by the deceased... If his red dragon mother is still there, So at least, people will be jealous, but after losing her, Kelmen found that his steps became more and more difficult - he was very normal, and the new king did not like his second son, all Everyone knows, and after Kremar has mastered the dragon tooth, Mitt is in an awkward position. If possible, the new king must be willing to let his eldest son replace Kelmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
