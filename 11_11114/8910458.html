			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey robes probably didn’t expect this - among the many casters, the gods’ servants, the white robes, were the most, and dressed The common robe of the black robe, followed by the warlock (red robe) carrying the devil or the dragon's blood is roughly equal to the black robe, the least gray robe, and only one percent of the caster - considering the caster's Rarely, then, obviously, the Grey Robe Master will not be a common thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray robes that master the Necromancer spells have lost interest in the pleasures of the common customs and **, neither like nor are they good at communicating with others, in order to facilitate Casting materials and avoiding the harassment of white robes and fools, they set their homes in desert swamps or gloomy graves; the owners of magical tools and materials stores may occasionally see his beggars, golems or apprentices. Come and pick up the scheduled spells and experimental materials, but if you want to take the opportunity to glimpse his bottom, maybe you don't have to wait until the next day, there will be a dead spirit that night, come and knock on your head to see you. How many things have been heard and seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you are a direct blood relative or spouse of a gray robe, a parent, a brother or a wife, or you, your guild is early When he was an apprentice, he established a stable and good relationship with him - although the two are not so reliable, the world knows that the way of thinking of the gray robe and the red robe is completely another plane - but at least Make sure you can walk to him alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is known to the world is that the place where the gray robes and some of the undead are concentrated is the seventy-seven islands, although its name is seventy-seven. The archipelago, in fact, is a combination of thousands of small islands, and there are always islands that sink or rise for a variety of reasons, the smallest of which is only a hundred steps, and the biggest is A hook (30 acres, or 0.12 square kilometers), the island and the island are filled with reefs, whirlpools and undercurrents, the dark sea water grows like high seaweed like land forest, countless hungry fine-toothed octopus, Poisonous sea snakes, squid, squid and squid are among them, like birds and worms in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no day, no night, the sky is dark and gloomy, the clouds are low, and the ghost trembles in the wind and mourns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich does not know that this gray robe is the guild through which the guild got the gray robes, but even the undead, he is even a mage, It was just a little chick that had not left his mentor for a long time. This may be the first battle he participated in, not the battle. At first, he threw panic into the crowd - but a missile or fireball or acid ball could have the same effect; then, he threw the epidemic to the elf, and the gods were on, did his mentor not? Have you told him that epidemics has always been half the work of elves immune to most diseases? Well, these problems are still second. What's worse is that he never seemed to think about hiding his identity and starting to cast spells that manipulated dead bodies after half a battle. The Lich was also a gray robe, but he was still a From the time of the apprenticeship, he knew that not everyone had the experience of facing the Necromancer and his creations—in a battle with more than ten participants, as a gray robe that was not alone, or a chance to make a big splash. Let the bloody red robe, a Necromancer is more suitable to jump out before and after the curtain to give them a surprise surprise - but if you have prepared a spell to manipulate the body, then you can be earlier Use, when your enemy has not realized that there is a gray robe standing here. You know, when people see his injured friend or relatives standing up again, the first reaction will never be vigilant - if you are lucky enough, then you will be able to manipulate one more object, even if No, sometimes one is greater than one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than being like this, although the bodies that stand up are as dense as spears, the elves have already spawned the lush vines one step ahead. Humans have already prepared for this, and they have not caused much damage, at least for the past. For the deceased, this inferior mistake would cause him to be unscrewed by his mentor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, it’s not that he is dissatisfied with such an enemy now – the Lich feels he is very busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the three red robes are apprentices, and the third is the mentor of the first two, but this is not good news - If you are standing here with three levels of red robe warlocks, then it is very likely that they will fight each other clearly or secretly for various reasons. If not, then the lich is very willing to give them some; but Based on the teaching method of torture and torture that has always been adopted by Hongpao, before the apprentices fail to leave their mentor, they are always respectful and docile to their mentor, and as an apprentice, they are also familiar with the way instructors and companions There is almost no flaw in the idea of ​​casting spells with each other—a mentor, two apprentices, as solid and sharp as a triangle, unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who had been back to the main material plane felt pressure for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, before he tore the last reel, the reinforcements of Rebecca finally arrived - the thunder thrown by Master Alfred immediately killed one The guy with the red robe, it’s a pity that it’s just an apprentice – but their arrival really made the game tilt in a direction that favored humanity. The red robe and his apprentice were keenly aware of it, after another intense collision. They first disappeared into the smoke; and the gray robes that knew it later whispered a spell after a short curse, and more of the dead climbed from the bloody mud – they rushed to humans along with the thieves , forcing them to retreat. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave suddenly began to shake when people screamed in horror, the stone fell from the sky, the wall shattered and the ground rolled, the torch was extinguished by the oncoming turbid airflow . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything was quiet, the elf mage around Kerry Ben cast a trick, lit his fingers, a little light in the dark It’s not visible, but it’s enough for him to figure out what happened just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We were blocked," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
