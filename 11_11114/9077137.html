The coat of arms of the Norman royal family is a violent bear. This bear is a magical creature. Before the Norman country in the Highlands, it was the threat of the orc only. It was twice as large as the Northern Snow Bear and four times as many as the Grizzlies. It was like a wind, strong and powerful, and it could drive other Animals, especially bears, are not very close or nervous with humans, because they almost all live in the deepest part of the Silver Crown, and even the elves can rarely find them, but in any case, Huge catastrophe a thousand years ago They also had appeared before mankind, otherwise Highland Norman king first thought is how to transfer it to its own coat of arms on it? But as Leona knows, they are one of the many savage creatures that have spread to the magical creatures, and now they are not far from extinct, and I heard that, like the big birds hanging in her father’s side room, The last violent bear has also become a blanket under the seat of King Grenada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent bear embroidered on top of her crotch, covered in golden fur, stands like a human, wearing a crown, claws sticking out, respectively There is a treasure ball and a scepter, which is the thing that the Duke of John has always coveted. Behind it is a two-handed wide sword. The bottom view is a gemstone blue shield, surrounded by dark colors. Red flower belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Pharaoh is not dead, and Leona has not left the kingdom and is trying to become a qualified heir to the throne under the guidance of her father, Her privilege of rights and honor is not so strong. To be more precise, she does not realize what position she is standing on. After all, she has been at Seannor since she left the Fort. Living in the monastery, the life there is calm and rich, accompanied by her teenage girls and female pastors in the aristocratic family, their conversations have always been surrounded by music, dance, flowers and love, Leo Na’s favorite shooting, fighting and riding can hardly find the same. Even if she is not the eldest daughter of Norman, she may be left out and scorned. The priests of Sean Nos, although many of them joined the vortex of war and politics, they are all male. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman men in Highlands are not as cold and cruel as women, but they have a long-standing ingrained perception that women are fragile, soft and stupid, except for housework and reproduction. Beyond, no matter what you do, it will lead to a disastrous consequence. The result is that men need to pack their heads and tails. They love them, love their mothers, love their daughters, love their wives, but never listen to their opinions on anything. What a daring woman wants to say, they will not wave their fists and whip, but they will laugh, then walk away and use this as a joke to the companion in the pub, so when Leona Once I heard that my father wanted to change the law of Norman Norman and let her become the queen of Norman in the Highlands. When she became the master of this vast land, she had such an instant that her father was crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thinks this is like a dream, and it is still an unrealistic dream. She dreams of how to be a king with her father in the dream, at the beginning. When she was not used to Pharaoh's attitude towards her, he sometimes asked her to wear male clothes, stand behind him as a waiter, or replace the pastor and mage, and copy a wide variety of instruments for him. Or go down to the dark and stinky dungeons, and talk to the rebellious enemies who have been tortured by endless torture and hunger. As we have described before, Pharaoh never succumbs to let Leona see and hear the original. The things that were touched by a woman even included some rude parties that could not be made public, although Pharaoh was not crazy enough to ask his daughter to participate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, Leona’s biggest delusion is to become a female ranger or warrior, to become the wife of the owner of the Thunderbolt, to fight side by side with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did she start to be as eager for rights and status as a man? Is it time for people with more spirits to bow to her? Or did the riders of Tell and Rosada gather around her and seek her advice? Or can she just stand in vain and watch the Cavaliers send Bedwin to jail under the orders of Wang Shu and Fu Kai? To be more correct, it is the old king of Norman in the Highlands who fell down, but it is too late to modify the inheritance law and publicly establish the status of Leona to the public. Leona still remembers how her aunt was resolutely standing on John's side. She didn't even leave a look to Leona, even though Pharaoh brought Leona to her as her heirs more than once. In front of her, she also wanted Dylan to enter into a marriage contract with Leona. However, Pharaoh and Leona said that a heir to the throne and even the new king’s marriage has always been a heavy chip that can change any situation. Light throw, and Dylan Donkre’s blood is too close to Leona. If he becomes Leona’s husband, it’s hard to say whether the future crown is worn on their son’s head or on his own head, so For the proposal of the princess, Pharaoh has always been perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Leona, of course, she never thought of making Dylan her husband, Dylan inherited his father's eyes and face, even if there is some ambiguity in the bloodline, it is also very popular with women. Welcome, but Leona hates Fukai and doesn't feel good about Dylan. Although Birdwin is quite wishful thinking that Dylan is a good brother, the king always feels that the green eyes are dug from the body of the snake. Down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming to the Dragon Fire Island, this feeling is getting stronger, if the Highlands Norman, Beitburg and some local rulers they passed through If the rights are subject to certain restrictions, then on these hot and closed islands, as long as you can embark on the ladder leading to the only throne, then it is a paradise-like beauty for some people. ... Leona spurned this system, and because of this, when she realized that she was free to control the lives and will of the slaves who served them, she would still be frightened by the fact that she was being tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona is not alone, although in Norman Norman, most people don’t want to see a little girl on the throne of the king, but Pharaoh After all, there are still some loyal courtiers, and the weak body of the Duke of John also makes a lot of people still staying on the sidelines, and the message of the channel that Kerry has not known shows that many nobles and knights feel the pharaoh. The death is not as simple as the Duke of John said. Everyone knows that Baldwin is just a civilian with no foundation. He can get both the title and the army and rely on Pharaoh. Before the tragedy, Pharaoh is still interested. From the jazz to draw the knights and soldiers to his beloved friends and courtiers, what is the reason for Baldwin to kill him and give him the reward and honor of the pharaoh? Even if the Duke of John can replace it, he may not be able to give a better reward. Moreover, he has not ordered the succession of the throne to order the death penalty of Baldwin. It has been speculated that the Duke of John and Fukai killed Pharaoh and then The charge was pushed to Baldwin, so some stubborn and loyal courtiers felt that they could not accept a monarch to sit on the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is what many knights and people criticize is that the new king will agree with Dylan Don Clay’s request to evict the soldiers of Thunderbolt. We, the library of Wangdu, and the temples of Rosada and Tyre, which record the invasion of the orcs, the ink is not so old, the cruelty of the orcs and the bravery of the Thunderbolt soldiers are like soldering with a soldering iron. It’s so deeply engraved in people’s minds that they are afraid of the orcs’ re-invasion and that Thunderbolt is unable to resist, so that the entire Highland Norman is caught in the mud of disaster, and is also serving in the Thunderbolt for several years or It is the soldiers and knights who have felt unrest and anger for more than a decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are some people who have suffered losses under the new king’s decree. John is a small man who must report, and he is greedy. He not only killed some people who loyal to the old king, but also refused him or not. Resolutely revenge in the neutral position, how long Li Naina left the king, how long the whirlpool of Wang Du’s whirlpool has been rotated, and the people who were involved in it did not know how many, some people are not at fault, just because they have gathered a large number of Wealth is concerned by Fukai. The consequence of concern is that it is imprisoned, executed or exiled because of an unwarranted crime. Their property is naturally included in the emptiness of the new king. If it is not Rosada and Tell And several other good priests and knights came out to order, and the entire king may have ruined two-thirds of the houses and streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not counting the various taxes that the new king will raise every few days and the gift of the gift of the parties. It is supposed to be the new king in the highlands. At Norman, every place was dedicated by the local lord, but John’s weak body even could not go up, let alone leave the king, so he ordered the lords and jazz to send their gifts. Wang Dulai, the gift is not a big deal compared to the harsh tax, but it is inevitably despised by the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Leona didn’t think that the modification of the inheritance law could continue and pass in the months after Pharaoh’s death, and I’d like to come to the Duke of John. This violent thunder, but what about it, this law can be modified to show that his control of the country is not as strong as he thought, maybe the princess is also pushing a little secret, if the woman can also become the heir to the throne She also has the right to inherit the throne. Even if she is not so interested in this country, then Dylan, what crown can be more brilliant than the king's crown? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for Leona, this is good news and bad news. The good news is that as long as it allows Billwin to clear the charges, she is no longer The king of Norman in the Highlands, but the heir to the first throne of Norman in the Highlands, and the bad news is that if John gets her, she will probably die on the road because of misfortune, leaving only the body to indicate her identity. Was transported into the kingdom of Norman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what are you going to do?" Leona said: "The Count of Anzhen, you are just the nominal owner of the White Tower."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are also, no, the king, you have no name, but there will still be people who are willing to die for you." An Zhen said: "Demon's father And my brother is dead, Yadel is not clear, I am the only blood of the Baita and the hills, but I still have a child, I and Demon's children, his blood is pure and full of Someone will be willing to admit him and loyal to him." She looked casually at the window, hanging a silk carpet on the window, but she was able to see through the silk carpet to see the outside: "And I have it now Strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
