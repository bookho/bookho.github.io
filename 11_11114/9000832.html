			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud noise swayed nearly half of the multi-spirit, and all the survivors who survived the raging plague involuntarily jumped up, or It is widening your eyes. The eldest daughter, who was soothing the people in the courtyard of the governor, seized a pregnant woman who almost fell on her, and smiled at her fearful apology and thanks that she did not mind her unintentional offense. - She returned the big-bellied woman to her husband, and when she came back, she unconsciously brought a bit of worry: "What happened?" she whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s in the Longhuo Islands, this kind of vibration and sound will be considered as a dragon that sleeps under the pillars of the island. This interesting saying is The Seris people brought to the southern islands, but they didn't. I saw Leona in a book. The curious and brave caster used the power of magic to sneak into thousands of feet of water. Even so, he did not see the scales of the dragon, and did not find the so-called pillars, but found a lot of giant starfish, colored sponges and feathered sea otters. He brought these things to the surface of Shanghai, and described everything he saw in the book in detail, but the lords of the Dragon Fire Island and his slaves dismissed them. They thought that the ancient giants were like gods. The dragons are there. They are entrenched in the hot and bright volcanoes, scrubbing their scales with tumbling lava. Every time they explode and crack, they are looking for a more comfortable sleep posture. The black people see. The plume is that they are ejected from the nostrils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Spirit belongs to Highland Norman, and the Highlands Norman is located at the northernmost and highest point of the entire continent, their feet are hard and even the dwarf is born. When I first dug up the rocks that I couldn’t dig through now, not the sea, people had no idea about the earthquake. The chief priest of Klanwo took a look at his brother, and the mask that took off the beak was bent because of a nose. The big nose, more like a white crow's priest, ran to the tower of the ruling official's mansion, overlooking down - he saw the mansion that gave birth to sin and death, where the red flame was rising . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests of Ilmot who are looking after the patient have earlier noticed that things are moving in the right direction, they give the patients potions, they The eyes can then become bright. The complexion is rosy and the mind is beginning to recover. They are no longer squirting and vomiting continuously, and the breathing is slow and powerful. When the priests throw the prayers of the gods on them or give them carefully prepared potions, some Patients who are already in a state of sudden death will also wake up. Rather than before, no matter what kind of treatment is accepted, it will only lie on the dirty bed, and will not succumb to the queue leading to the mourning of the wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They woke up and immediately began praying for water and food. Although it is still very weak, even ordinary people can see that they have begun to improve - Baldwin is the former, and Mei Mi is the latter, she is almost ecstatic, but she immediately discovered that Il Mort's priest was ready to leave Bedwin's room after he was given a bottle of healing potion and was determined to be effective: "Where are you going?" She pleaded, rudely holding the other's gray robes: "Adult I haven’t fully recovered yet.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief pastor of Ilmot regained his robes: “His condition has stabilized,” he said. "There are more serious patients waiting for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he is a Sir Alex."<br /><br />&nbsp The director of Ilmot was sighed, but even among his brothers, he was a patient and kind person: "I am going to treat a prince." He is witty. Say: "And his age is only this one...one third or even less of the warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "Come to my side." Birdwin said, "I don't need treatment anymore, plum, please give me some water, or, if there is, a little bit of bread in the broth." No longer feels that something is horribly melting in the body, but he does feel pain, which is a torment that the internal organs must re-grow under the influence of healing. He ensures that his stomach is long and perfect. Because he feels that he is in another sense of emptiness, he needs to get something to fill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't mind other followers of the gods praying to her here." The chief pastor of Ilmot reminded him when he said goodbye, "Ms. It is no longer the scope of the Ilmot Church. You can pray to your gods in order to get a magical skill - the people who need help here are not just one of your adults."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went out, not far from the room in Birdwin, there was a special person who needed to be carefully cared for - he walked into the room and the priests bowed to him. The teenager lying in bed turned to him. The chief pastor caressed his forehead lovingly, closed his eyes, prayed to his god and had a powerful healing technique. The white light shone from the misty sun like a warm snowflake, and the juvenile accepted it with peace of mind. They--the snowflake infiltrated his skin and shirt, and the priests found it unfortunately that it had previously failed to function. The root cause of the disease was removed from the weak body, and he still needed to recuperate for a while. But he will live healthy and live for fifty years or more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona was originally intended to be with the people of Dorin, even if she lived in a tent, but it did not matter in the tent; but in the insistence of the pastor and resident of Ke Lanwo Next, she was transferred to the consul's room - fortunately, the instructor was just outside the inspection when his illness occurred. His room was very clean, located in the highest part of the building, overlooking the square from the huge window. Atrium, "Look at that window," Liona said to the little girl biting her finger: "I will sit in front of the window and look at you - I am with you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said so, did this, and even refused the hot bath, sesame oil and clean clothes, although she needed these after a night of Mercedes-Benz, but she did not want to let people leave their sights. For too long, she sat at the window, letting the bright sun illuminate her shiny red hair, simply ate a few biscuits and drank a glass of honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is very warm, and from the priest of Ilmot, the root cause of the disease has been purified, and the patients will soon regain their health, Li Oona squinted, avoiding the glare of the glass, and holding her jaw in one hand, she was very tired. But for the people of Dorsett and the question of Baldwin, she was sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honor to you, the king of Norman in the Highlands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona recovers her Sight, I found that it was the priest who tried to persuade himself to stay away from the multi-spirit and for the multi-lingual to allow himself to enter the multi-spirit, who wore a gray robe. Three drops of gray tears under the eyes indicate that he is in the position of leader in the followers of Ilmot: "I hope that the benevolent Ilmot will save us from suffering - Ilmot is the most pious Followers, I also want to pay tribute to you, if not with you, there are fair followers of Crawford. The disaster caused by this city is far more than that."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what we hope to get," said the chief pastor of Ilmot. "We are willing to bear their suffering for everyone in the world - Your Highness, I I am happy to tell you that your friend, the soldier, he has improved and will soon be healed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona gave him A happy smile from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can visit him later," said the chief priest of Ilmot. "But before that, if you allow, I hope you can Promise one of my requests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a child who wants to see His Highness immediately." The chief pastor of Ilmot said: "His name is Mullen." .Lorennos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard of the name of Lorenos. The lord of the Spirit is the possession of this surname."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mullen is the nephew of the lord of this place." The priest of Ilmot said: "In the beginning, I was lucky enough to have this young Lorenos, the consul With his deputy, and the garrison captain was the first poor man to fall under the devil's claws. When we entered the Spirit, he helped us control the whole city and avoided the rapid spread of the disease - he I also took out the family crest and opened the inner library of the ruling bureaucracy. Many of the reels, wands and herbs we used came from the inner library - not with him, the people you see here may only A fraction of the present."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A brave and decisive child." Li Oona sighed. Then she thought of one thing. Showing a strange look, "But if I am mistaken, please forgive me - the respectable follower of Ilmot, before I have entered the Spirit. The lord of the Spirit has wanted to burn the entire city. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what the one thinks." The chief pastor of Ilmot said: "In fact, except for his nephew, His wife and two daughters are also here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is his wife and daughter a patient?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Ilmot’s chief pastor seemed to be disturbed by something unpleasant memory: "But they have not seen each other for a long time - the lord has a beloved lover There are also a few unmarried children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Leona said: "So let him come see me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't mind he just just healed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can walk in here to express him Body The disease is gone," Leona said. "I don't want to fear a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mallen Lorenos is in a pastor Under the support of the room. Just like Leona’s praise, he is still a child, like all the teenagers, because his body suddenly rises and becomes thin, his back is slightly arched, but it may also be due to serious illness, his lips and cheeks. There was still a lack of blood, but pushing the priest's arm and standing and kneeling down to Liona was still very smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He greeted Leona with a weak and trembling voice, and expressed his apology that he could not personally go forward. His words contained deep and true emotions. This is not what a strange princess deserves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you have seen me before today?" asked Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The teenager said, "But please don't be surprised, my understanding and respect for you is from my father - he It was once one of your father's favorite courtiers. Our beloved pharaoh once pointed to you and said that you are his heir and asked my father to be loyal to you - but it is a pity that my father I left me forever in the second year of returning to Doring, but every word he said was deeply remembered in my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are His son." Leona has found the surname of Lorenos from her memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the multi-spirit heir should be you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it’s not a new king, no, then the respected adult is just a duke--an uncle’s illegitimate daughter is his lover, and he is also very Willing to take his territory and money from the hands of an orphan to the person who should have protected this child - I was hiding in his wife's skirt and I was lucky enough to survive, I am not afraid of death, even if I should be I die a hundred years later, but I can't watch my father's honor fall into the hands of his brother, not his son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mullen..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Highness, I am complaining to you, Your Highness, I am also appealing for you. Please help me, just like helping yourself - let it be People, let the people who deserve it break their hands - the respectable king, the heir of Norman Norman. I beg you, as long as you are willing to pity me, help me, I will give all my loyalty With love, any moment. Any place, as long as you have a letter, a summon, a gesture..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mullen..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, you have the right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry," Liona calms And sadly said: "But listen to me, I must tell you, I can't help you... Mullen, because I... I came here just to give up this right in my hands."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf hangs his head. Even when dealing with tree monsters and demons, he didn't feel so exhausted: "I won't interfere with your practice," he said softly. "But are you really thinking about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have considered it for a long time," Leona said. "It’s not just thought, I put it into action, but as you can see, Ranger, I am There are too few things that Wang Duo can do, too little, although there are so many people who believe that Baldwin is innocent. But their words cannot be conveyed to the ears of the new king and the gods. On the contrary, I The move caused some people's dissatisfaction, I was driven away by Tyre's priest. Rosada's pastor is no longer willing to let their brothers contact me, those who have sworn allegiance to me seem to be respectful and honest, indifferent and alienated They don't promise me anything, but they ask me a lot. Some of them swear that if I only get married with their son, I will support me to become the king of Norman in the Highlands. They don't even mind what I did after I stepped on the throne. The first thing is to forgive Bird. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young girl with red hair smiled a little: "If I didn't spend a full five years with my father." She stroked the hunter. Knife: "I may believe them, but I know that they are only deceiving and perfunctory. If one day I can wear a crown, then before that, I suspect that Baldwin’s head has already fallen to the ground. They only want to be the grandfather of the Norman kings of the Highlands. If this is achieved, even if I am not indispensable - then, maybe they can become the king of Norman in the Highlands."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I stayed up all night, thinking hard." Leona continued: "Until a white-headed stunned me - it caught a sly escape in a messy banquet Rats, rich foods all over the table, human bows threaten its life, but it is not tempted or intimidating, unwavering - it comes for the mouse, just for it; then, What have I done so much for? The person I love - if I don't have him, everything I do is meaningless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry, you told me that my protection Instead, it will implement Baldwin’s crimes, but in fact, even without me, they can bring this terrible crime to an innocent person; you also reminded me to use my rights and identity for Baldwin. Fighting for a complaint is a chance to forgive, I have tried it, and the result is as you heard it." She stood up: "I know why you said that... you don't just want to protect Baldwin." You don't want me to get involved, because in your opinion, I don't have the obligation to pay for Byrdwin - there is no such power, but Ranger, I love him, my love for him is better than everything. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it better than the throne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice that they are all familiar with suddenly inserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you don't know, Your Highness," Dylan Don Kreila walked into the room and squatted in a shallow sigh: "There is a big part." The nobility wants to amend the inheritance law and allow the daughter to inherit the father’s surname and territory.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kremar looked at the pastor of Cranvo, “He threatened us. "The pastor used the silence to "say." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible," said Leona. "My father, the old man of Norman, has gone to the plains of mourning, and his promises have been buried. Black soil, they can't get even a little benefit from them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can't," Dylan said: "They have daughters and granddaughters." He stared at Li. Aona: "If the inheritance law is changed, then you will become the first heir to Highland Norman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona is silent for a while:" ... I am not prepared to change my mind - Dylan, maybe you are willing to sign the instrument as a prover?" She smiled happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are they discussing? The alien soul casts a small spell so that he and Kerry can talk to each other without knowing the tongue without using their tongues and fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the 72 ancient decrees of Norman’s Highlands - Kerry Ben said in his heart that Leona will be the protector of Birdwin. As a protector, if he is willing, he can bear the crime of being protected. The problem is that the crime of Jun Jun is too heavy for a member of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really know what you are doing?" Dylan said: "Please allow me to remind you, my dear cousin, if you insist on this, He glanced at Baldwin: "The crime you are going to bear for may lead you to be exiled, deprived of your family name, and the new king will take back your territory, Billund and Oulu, even more you will Never return to Highland Norman for the rest of your life."
