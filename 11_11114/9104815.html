			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allahites usually use small boats that can only be controlled by one person. It's not so much a boat, it's better to say that it is a blown-out seal skin; this kind of boat has only a short life, because the water will soak the soft seal skin and pour into the ship from the gap, so every time Alati Lit People only use this kind of boat as a temporary means of transportation, that is, when the ice sheet breaks on the ice sheet or when the tide rises or when the tide rises - when fishing in the shallow sea or chasing the seals . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also have a relatively large vessel that can accommodate six to eight people and have a rudder, which they specialize in whaling. Some people may be surprised that since this kind of vessel is specially used for whaling, it seems to be not so solid in appearance and in essence. It is not known that the Alatilite is deliberately making it light and slippery. . In addition to the steel ships made by the gnomes, there are no ships that can withstand the flapping and impact of whales. In this case, why should they use the precious gold-like wood in the north to make ships, and the light and slippery seals? The kayak, on the other hand, will be pushed forward by the impact of the big whale, or it will fly high. Unless a whale is pressed against their boat, there will be very few Alati. People sink into the sea with their ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these two are not the boats that the adventurers need, they have to cross the entire night sea, although compared to other seas, the night sea is like It is a narrow belt, but this belt is also two thousand miles wide. Even if everything goes smoothly, they will sail for nearly ten days under the dim white light of the Yongzhen period. Ten days to go, ten days back, only twenty days or a little more time for them to find the collection of metal dragons on the ice sheet. Of course, even if this time is exceeded, they can continue to stay in the more dangerous North Sea, but in this plane, the eternal and permanent nights of the Northland and the extreme nights of the other planes are not a trace. A similar place - the eternal night of the North Sea is Yong Ye, and the night is full of blizzards and hurricanes, but like a mad lady, it will calm down without warning. One, or a few deep nights, it allows people to have a glimpse of the fascinating aurora like a gauze covered in white snow - that is, the elves often look at the group, although at that time, they dare not easily Try to enter the sea of ​​the extreme north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alati's big ship made for the adventurers can't, Perant sighed softly, from the Aratitians from the ship they took After leaving the big ship that had not been seen, the druid put his hand on the ship. Suddenly, the sound of the seabird became weak, or disappeared, and the gray-blue water swayed slowly. At any time, like the blade, the sharp wind is like catching the feet, the shaman closes his eyes, quietly enjoys the rare calm, and belongs to the power of life, this power from the druid The hand emanate, and spread like a stream of water to the entire hull. A child first made a small exclamation - he was hidden in the shadow of a big ship, a slender one, not like being able to survive here. The branches stalked out and circled his fingers, releasing a flower that was only as big as a thumb, but in the world of the Alati, the flowers are rare things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is this the son of nature?” Nanuk asked, the plants he had never seen before growing out of the soil inside the ship – so thin a layer of mud, but like an opened treasure. Are these vines or lichens? Or a shrub? No one knows that their branches and roots spread around, turning over the ship's side, and the entire hull is covered with them; they have brown stems, purple stems and black stems, and sapphire green or moss green The leaves, they not only open flowers, but also fruit, the fruit is like a star, and the flowers are like clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaman nodded, for a long time, a long time ago, when the gods of the Alatitians were not yet asleep, the shaman could do it. In each eternal period, they will produce grains and trees, as well as herbs for healing. At that time, the Alatites were more powerful, stronger and longer, but now... "Yes, "The shaman said: "They are the darlings of the god of life, Angris - the venerable and eternal god always looks at them, as the starlight shines on their path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow only swept past Naunuk’s eyes—more quickly than the shadow of the bird, and then the dark brown eyes were once again occupied by rock-like perseverance . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that we are going to bid farewell to our friends." Nanuk said that after these strangers did so much for them, the Alati Litite If they are not seen as friends, they will only be treated as brothers and sisters - they need a warm and affluent farewell party, because those black irons, the tulip tribes don't mind taking out some of the seal meat, and their treasures. The salted puffins, which were buried in shark meat and fermented for three years under the ground - Nanuk has always been sorry that the puffins they had marinated last year were so few that they could not pile up their friends’ plates. Fortunately, there are opportunities to make up for it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so happy that those salted puffins have already been eaten." After knowing that the Alatitians were going to host a farewell party, the Norman’s Princess Li O'Nan is lucky to say that because of her surname and blood, so the last pickled puffin she was fortunate enough to be assigned to one - she must admit that in the Norman Highlands, there are also such as wild boar chopped soup and roasted unicorn The animal head is a strange dish that has been criticized by many people in other places, but it can at least be said to be a dish. As for the Alati people, it is said that the guests are fortunate enough to taste the delicious food. A scent of scent is so strong that even the spellcaster's spells sigh like the stink... The shape and color are hard to be called meat, and there are tiny thorns inside, according to Crimal, it may be The bones or feathers and the like - the black hair caster does not have to suffer this kind of torture, because in the celebrity's cognition, he is still a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant’s name, Leona, has long been known. After all, he is the manager of Gray Ridge. It can also be said that one of the messengers of the elves is very few outside. He often appears in many occasions that require the silver crown jungle... ...for example, when Leona’s father became King Norman, Leona had seen this tall and majestic elf and heard about him... he is said to be as cold as humans. Strict, there is more reason that the elf does not have much rationality - but when Li Naina has a sincere fear of him, it is probably that he swallows a whole whole salted puffin when. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona... She also has her runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the next day, their seal kayaks sailed in the indigo On the sea, Leona’s mouth still seems to be stuffed with a whole salted puffin. This time, the pickled puffins on her plate are more than the last one, and she used it last time. The last relevant rune. Fortunately, she also has a companion of the caster, who can dispel the terrible smell of the salted puffin and secretly give her a piece of ice - after the numbness of the mouth is frozen, the taste of the salted puffin becomes very faint, the problem is The feeling of being thick and with a little bone residue is still quite clear, and every breath after her seems to be deeply remembering this strange dish - this is not food, but weapons, the girl is discouraged I thought that she couldn't even determine if she would suggest that the elves use different routes when they return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Norman’s princes of Highlands don’t know is that even if the elves will return the same route, they will not see Nanuk and their tribes. It is. Because of Perant’s reminder, not only the Nanuk’s tribe, but also the Tuhua tribe decided to move to another place farther from the coast, so as not to be attacked and retaliated by the sea ghosts – the Alati Lit Always following the seals and the movement of the fish, the migration of the family is not difficult for them. Their only regret is that they may never see their new friends again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pygmy McGee may be the most accustomed of all people, although the sea here is almost the same as the sea of ​​the Dragonfire Islands. The sea of ​​Longhuo Island is blue-blue, warm and lightly salty; the sea here is deep, so the color is also biased towards the night instead of the white, especially the white ice floes appear gradually on the sea. After that, the sea water changed from the original indigo to the copper green, then the deeper deep cyan, followed by the obsidian-like black, only the surface of the sea can barely find some transparent gem blue, he But finally, I know why it is called the Yongyue Sea. The gnome is sitting on the bottom of the boat with his chin. Perhaps the god of fate is showing a smile to the adventurers. In the two-night voyage, they have no In the face of the storm, I did not encounter powerful monsters (those sporadic harassment will ignore it), but the sea is still the sea after all, the thin seal leash is even more bumpy like a swing dancer's ass, like Bo Devin and Lee Na and others have been able to lie down and hug each other to resist the vomiting of the throat from time to time, and the gnome McGee’s troubles are just the water that continues to plunge into the ship, even if he even covers his face with a head A huge snow bear skin, it is always inevitable to be covered (the cold dog food that was shot indiscriminately... no), he put out his tongue and licked his lips, the sea of ​​the night sea is more than the sea of ​​Longhuo Islands. It is lighter and cleaner. After all, compared with the warm south, there is too little life in the northern part of the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McGee had thought about staying in the tribe of the Alati, but the hard life of the Alatiist made him daunting. Others did not say that they lived in the igloo, eating raw meat, covered with simple Dealing with exuding fur, and the caravan rarely comes here, McGee doesn't feel like he can climb the Longji Mountains alone. As for the dwarf's secret road, he suspects that he will be patrolled short when he appears there. People poke dead. Sometimes he doesn't understand why he did that. After the initial impulse disappeared, he was left with annoyance. He tried to take out the dwarf's drawings several times and asked Perant to give them back, but that was not the case. Has the crime been lost and the benefits? This is not something a gnome should do, can he be like a dwarf? But the dwarves don't steal, they just break all the things that hinder them like a hammer - this cognition makes the dwarf fall into endless depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even knows that he is essentially full of distrust of his companions and is afraid of their future journey, he wants to stay on land, but Perrin It is obviously not allowed - the soul of the Alati Litite is as pure and fierce as this sea of ​​the North, and if a dwarf is left here, they may complement each other and even cherish each other, but a gnome, forget it, in him When being treated as a friend, the Alati Litite will inevitably be hurt, but when he is regarded as an enemy, the Alati Litite will have a delicious dish called pickled gnome meat - gnome Because this imagination unconsciously turned his eyes, he looked at the bow, where the black hair caster was sitting, while the other elf was checking his own quiver, although he was sitting at the stern, the gap between the two About sixty feet, but McGee did not feel that this distance would affect the tacit understanding between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where is Perant? In front of the boat. The ship of the Alati Litti - that is, the ship carrying six paddlers, one helmsman, and one forked hand, only one third of their current ships, one quarter Wide, but they obviously can't recruit a group of Alatis to be an oarsman. This seal is wrapped in whale skin, and it is impossible to erect a mast with a whale bone frame. Of course, there is no sail. . So the ship’s power was completely entrusted to the Druid’s animal friends. A group of whales were willing to accept the employment. They began to take turns to fix the white krill after being fed by a warm current. The rope at the front of the boat pulls it all the way, many young whales even use them as a game, and the older whales don’t care about the weight of the kayaks and the people above, if there is anything embarrassing. They probably hate the shape and smell of the kayak, because this shape and smell often means that they have to lose one or more of the ethnic groups, but this problem is quickly solved by the aromatic plants that the elves have spawned. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
