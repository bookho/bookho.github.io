			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers on the triple wall are almost fascinated by the sight, the monsters are like a wave, and the magical barrier It’s like the most sturdy and tallest rock, and the flash of stars shines frequently. The flesh and blood of the monsters bloom like a flower on the barrier. This scene was seen in the winter of last year. But this time it is more horrifying than the last time. After all, the orcs will still hesitate before the pain and death, but these monsters seem to have only one purpose, that is, to break through this firmly They are separated from the delicious food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mad fight continued, but humans have lost their initial fears, and several wizards have allowed the soldiers to gather the torches and observe the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look," the wife of the soldier’s wife, and his closest friend, said: "These guys are still very smart." He pulled the less willing soldiers. Going to the pass, Dylan had to be awkward in determining the scope of the protective array. After all, the materials used in the array were too amazing. Nothing else, the meridian lines of the criss-crossing were enough to make a mage tower complete the whole. The inner layer is modified, so the barrier is only about three feet away from the cornice. It is like a hand that can grab a monster in, grab, or be taken away by it. Its arm can be much longer than humans. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the daring companion, it’s hard to say whether it’s from wisdom or instinct, because soldiers have seen ants huddle together. Form a dense tip to get a high path, water or food, and these monsters do the same. When they notice that they have no access to the wall, they first dig the ground and dig deep. When the soil is coming in the winter, even if it can't reach the hardness of the steel, it is similar to the rock. But for the monsters, this is only a small problem. They quickly dig up a ramp that allows a monster to pass, but Di Len thought of this, the array is a three-dimensional square, it is like a transparent cage enveloped outside the Thunderbolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monsters then chose another way, they climbed each other, kinked, grabbed each other, just in a flash, a crumbling tower stood In the darkness, from the tower to the tip of the tower, monsters are falling, their height has exceeded the wall, but still can not find even a trace of space - the caster and mortal looking up at all these are exposed A happy smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where did they get these monsters from?" The soldier murmured, but the ugly chickens and elves are not here, his problems are doomed The answer is, and even if the monsters are as numerous as the waterdrops in the sea, from the beginning, the intensity of the predecessor of Dylan is calculated from more than thirty days. Some people's hearts are involuntarily shaken. It seems that Dylan Don Clay, or Dylan Hyde, their new king is not necessarily wrong. When a lord is sealed of the territory of others, isn’t it necessary to delete the original knights and soldiers? After all, they are not loyal to them before, and if the magic can repel the orcs, then the number of soldiers and knights does not need to be as much as before, know that the tax of Thunderbolt is not enough to bear this heavy The burden, the income of the Don Cree family is partially filled every year into this huge mouth that seems to be never full, and the king of the king, as well as the Norman's Sir Alex and the Knights, they not only have to take out gold coins, Also responsible for providing knights, soldiers, armor weapons and horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The soldier suddenly heard a scream, and he took his eyes back, and was shocked because his friend even stretched out his entire upper body. The monsters that are flying in the air and outside the barrier come to a close-faced "contact", separated by an invisible wall. When the monster becomes more and more crazy because he sees the live meat, he laughs and waves. I started to signal the soldiers to follow suit. And their captain was unhappy to make gestures, let the soldiers pull him down, if not the latter must hold the torch for the casters, he will definitely come over and kick the bastard's ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier ran over and he reached out to his friend. At this time, a violent white light suddenly burst in front of his eyes, and he closed his eyes subconsciously. Even so, the soldier’s eyes were still white, like a noon, with his eyes closed and looking up at the feeling of the sun, a hot water hit his face. The soldier’s first thought was another prank, but he was puzzled at the place where they were, and there wasn’t a cauldron boiling in boiling water. He stretched out his arms and wiped his face, hair, and ears, and this time he sniffed. When it came to a strong bloody smell, the liquid flowing into the eyes made his vision blurred, but he was able to see the empty walls - just between a few breaths, all the people seemed to be gone by the devil, disappearing There is no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier turned and he saw a monster, or a lot of monsters, claws and long, fangs that passed through the barrier they trusted and trusted. They looked like a grain. Inlaid with raisins on the bread, half outside and half inside, and the soldier's friend was swallowed by the first monster that crossed the barrier. The soldier seemed to hear glass cracking or ice. The melted crisp sound, the barrier finally broke completely, the monsters poured down like hail mixed in the rain, they fell on the hard ground, but unharmed, a monster slammed over, The remaining part of the soldier's friend was bitten, while the other few vaguely formed an encirclement of humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human accidentally found that his heart was calm, just like when it finally came to the end of the drama, they thought it was a comedy, but it was actually a tragedy. Play: "Come on." He raised his spear, "You bastards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------- ———————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gersh looked at it at the top of the cliffs on both sides of the mouth. If the casters on the walls were calm enough or not so selfish, humans might have such a slight breathing opportunity, but they didn't, they were broken. Before the crack, they released the spells and hurriedly fled, ignoring the torches for them. They were simply the knights and soldiers of the subject matter. Some soldiers were immediately torn or towed away, while others could only Rushing to the horse road or the arrow tower, but this only slightly delayed the death that is bound to come. Already - when the barrier has lost the ability to kill monsters, these monsters have covered the sky above the wall. After the barrier disappears, the monsters who are holding each other’s towers collapsed, but at a glance, humans Even the places where the footholds are lost are lost, although the people who fled the arrow tower are still projecting arrows, spears and dumping grease and igniting, but their resistance is only a drop in the bucket for the monsters that almost overlap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several wizards who threw their spells at the monsters, but when a monster jumped over the tower, and jumped a few tens of feet away, After pulling a mage down, no one will stop again - the magical flash swallows a lot of monsters, but that is the last spell he can release. The caster's flesh is no different from the mortal, if it must Say yes, you can only say that the meat of the pamper who is pampered will be more fat, and Gersh thinks maliciously that one third of the mouth of the mouth is occupied by monsters, the warlocks drive them, and the orcs are not Allow, do not dare to approach them, these monsters will not distinguish between the caster and the mortal, and will not distinguish between the orcs and humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes Geshe annoyed is that these monsters are too ate, and he is worried that when the orcs follow them all the way, even A bone can't be found. After all, they are all swallowed after the meat is torn apart. Of course, the orcs can live on cereals like humans, but his people are not horn deer and argali, occasionally Vegetarians are only for the purpose of excreting the body's filth. If it is so long, they will become weak, just like those human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the warlocks will indeed tame and deal with these disgusting feces as they promised, Gersh thought, he saw behind the triple walls, There are strange lights that are one after another. After all, there are still casters who used to work for Morton and Birdwin. They turned away from Bedwin and turned to Dylan to be loyal, but their families are Thunderbolt, so they won't, at least not immediately choose to give in at the beginning. The red robes have no intention of buying or deliberately assassinating them. Anyway, the monsters will clean up all the living things in the Thunderbolt. Maybe there will be one or two fish that slip through the net, but even if it is the caster, the power of one person is still Extremely meager, the plan to incite the red robe and the orcs can only be said to be an extremely absurd joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the orcs crossed the triple wall, Gersh and the priests set foot on the stone floor of the inner city, he still felt incredible, so simple, orc The king looked around and he wondered if he would wait for him to relax his vigilance and the ground would shake. Then, like that time, the collapsed houses and the rolled ground buried the orcs in this ancient city. - But he laughed almost immediately. If so, the price paid by human beings is too great. Nothing is more familiar with the human taste than the nose of the orcs. He smells bitter and bitter, and smells the liver. Greasy, and the intestines are full of tempting stench, accompanied by a strong bloody suffocation, although the monsters did not leave anything as he expected, Gersh said, their favorite food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An orc screamed in surprise, and he found a fallen monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's dead?" Gersh looked at Rica, this red robe didn't know when it happened, anyway, he was like a warm afternoon. A neighbor who met during the walk walked out of a small alley with ease: "I thought you didn't want them to live forever," Rica said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
