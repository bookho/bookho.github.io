A little, and half of this is given to his little daughter, "Yes," he glanced. It wasn't like a common rat from a barn or field, its fur. Glossy and very clean, there is a silvery thin rope around the neck, perhaps left by its original owner. It may be the pets of the human gnomes that are used for fun in the castle. These are just more than the knees of the big man. For higher baubles, rabbits and hounds can be considered huge, so if they want to raise one or two animal partners, they will only choose creatures that are small for ordinary people. Like a skylark, a hamster, a human dwarf that Dagong’s father likes very much, but he still has to raise it... But if his little daughter likes this, she can of course leave it: “It’s really cute,” he said softly: " Well, I have already seen it," the ruler of this little Principality raised his hand exhausted and stroked the child's ear: "Take it to your mother," he believes his wife will do something to Keep your child safe, like pulling out the hamster's teeth and claws, and maybe taking a shower with petals and essential oils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was the first time I saw such a hamster." A voice, and a person suddenly appeared next to Dagong, dressed in a red robe, It is a warlock, but he is the uncle of Dagong. Like many royal and aristocratic families, children with caster talent will receive assistance from a whole family and country to help them go further and further under the magical galaxy. In contrast, the common rights are almost no longer related to them, but most casters will not care about this, magic, what is magic, magic can make them stronger, more beautiful With long life, profound knowledge and long-term vision, these are not a mortal who can exchange money or power. When some caster's life is about to end, there are still different choices than mortal waiting. they. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagon’s little daughter smiled at the warlock, she was not afraid of this person, although many people would subconsciously put it when referring to the elder Low voice, moving away from sight, but for her, this is a very kind and very strange old man, she has taken the shape of a butterfly in his hand, can fly the honey, and saw the small summoned by him. The man held a contest in her bed, including the banquet after the game. "Do you want to see the charcoal ball?" She said, apparently she had given the hamster a good name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you like," the warlock said, "Let it be loaned to me for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Of course," said Dagong’s little daughter, who placed the hamster in an armchair opposite the desk under the direction of the warlock. The chair cushion was squid red flannel, and the black little hairball was placed like It was a shadow cast by a circular lamp. Before the girl left, the little girl stroked its fluff with the index finger: "You want to lick, charcoal ball." She said: "If you are jealous, don't bite people everywhere. Run around, I will give you beans to eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock and the big common gentle smile sent her out of the room, and just after the door of the room was closed again The warlock almost raised his hands at the same time, and a spell was ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," hamster, or use a name we all know, little devil Asmodeos said: "Wait, wait, wait." Humans!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little devil." The warlock said indifferently, and the Grand Duke had seized one of his own pendants and hilts, and was used as a hang. The rune seal hanging from his chest ensures that he is not affected by the devil's spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was ordered to come," said the little devil, which trembled his body, and his tail and wings jerked from the back: "As a messenger." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the messenger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Krystal of the King of Grenada." The little devil screamed sharply: "The dragon who has pure blood, the descendants of the great and honorable god of marriage and the god of birth." dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Dagong took a deep breath and he was not surprised. His small territory has been destroyed by the warfare brought by the Grenada people. If he wants to say something to be thankful, it is that he is a Never mind the lucky ones, he did not care only about his palace and the city wall like other rulers. After more than ten years in office, he ordered the roads to be sorted and constructed like a spider web to connect with each of the smallest villages and the largest. City, which allows poor people with only legs to quickly escape from the battlefield, not priceless Grenada became the Legion of Merit and animal food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows very quickly. When he looks out from the top of the tower, he can see black chess like a bottomless abyss. If it is as this little devil said, the leader of this army is the king of Grenada. Son, then there will be a red dragon wearing a golden crown on the flag. But what he didn't think was that the dragon would actually send a messenger. It could be said that it was a very appropriate little devil. What else did he want? Everything is just waiting for him to take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May Kylemar’s Highness," the tone of the Grand Duke sounds exactly the opposite of what is in the words. "He sent you, what do you want?" The result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil snorted twice, sounding like he was laughing at Tyran’s Grand Duke or Kremar, but it did not forget that he wanted to Things to do: "Please allow me," and it is as hypocritical as Dagong: "First to you, to the distinguished Grand Duke and his uncle to explain a fact," it casually pricked the cushion with the tip of the tail, like It is pricking a human flesh: "Maybe you have already guessed this," it gestured to the scarred map: "You are going to lose your country."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a fact. Dagong looked down at the map, and the small nails painted in red on his head represent the Greinada people. Every time they stay in one place, that place will Leave a nail and overlook it from above, you can see a clear forward Toward his king. Just the night before, the last big city fell, and the king of Tilan has become an isolated city. Dagong was wary when the Grinada appeared in the mouth that was once controlled by a despicable spellcaster and liar. He not only increased the strength of the defense, but also sent a message to friends and in-laws for help, including The younger husband of his little daughter, but they were not attacked by the Grenada people, they were blindly blinded, and they did not hear it. This is the invisible that the Grinada people bound with blood and death more than a thousand years ago. Any law that dares to intervene in the war between Grenada and other countries will also be regarded as an enemy by Grenada, and the death of the enemy of Grenada is only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't blame them for standing by, if he is, he will do the same, he has his own people, his country and children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to do under your Royal Highness?" said Grand Dylan, "I want him to open the gates of his own, let his soldiers and Did the knight slaughter my people in the streets and courtyards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," the little devil stretched out his claws and grabbed the rope on his neck." This is exactly the case when Dagong reveals a sardonic smile: "But only half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say?"dudu2();<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are willing to order the opening of the city gate," Asmodeos said: "Let your soldiers put down their arms and let your people... yes, those human beings, Go to the street and pick up the rope around your neck..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is he crazy?" Dagong said: "I know that you are going to Destroy the city, this country, but how do you think that I will promise this ridiculous request? My soldiers do not have a lion body or a fear dragon, nor a knight of the Grenada. Strong, not to mention that the caster I can have may not even be a third of you, but I will not give up easily. My people's body also flows with the blood of the strong, one thousand. Years ago, we had the same ancestor as the Grinada people. We have not been smashed before, and we will not be jealous now. If there is a future, our children and grandchildren will not write 怯懦 into their own dictionary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are willing to do this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to say I can put myself The country, its own people, their dignity sold for a good price," Dagong interrupted the little devil's words: "Then exempt," he said: "I am a grandfather, not a businessman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the contrary," said the little devil, "My host means," it smacked his wings smugly: "If you are willing to order your people to give up Resistance, then," Asmodeos licked his tongue: "My master's army will still occupy. And burned here, but all people, unless he perfunctors, resists or lies, or unfortunately have an accident at this moment, or there will be no soldiers or knights on the blade or spear The blood of the innocent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong has to wait for a while to understand the meaning of the little devil's words, his expression immediately becomes doubtful, but the eyes are full of No trust, everyone knows that the three legions of Grenada, especially the Dragon Tooth Legion and the Dragon Claws, will attack from time to time even in the stalemate of hundreds of years, and the territories and cities that they attack will only Leaving a white land that has been ravaged by flames. In this process, soldiers and knights can kill anyone at will, no one will pursue them, no one will blame them, even their mounts can enjoy themselves if they have a city. Half of the people can stay, so people can be sure that the sight of the lucky god must be beside them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
