( . .)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Midwinter Festival is the last festival of each year, also known as the Dead Winter Day, because this day happens to be a harsh winter past. Half the day. Compared with the serfs and civilians in the caves, mud houses and straw sheds, wealthy and powerful people certainly don’t care too much about this, but the lords and the kings will form alliances with other countries or renew the covenant and call on this day. The loyal courtiers and priests gathered in the fort, and ate around the burning stove, the old and weak, the old and weak, the sick sausages made of sick animals. The best and most thorough use of simmered bacon and something similar to lamb pudding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter in Longhuo Island is warm, food is almost never scarce, and the huge wealth is destined that they will always get the best things. They are almost meaningless. The father who is the lord can invite his son or slave to his own island whenever he wants it. But this year, Tuanguan Island may be a bit exceptional, because Amos is suffocating a Strong lions, Xiguan, Nanxun and the lords of the North have rarely taken the opportunity to launch a war that is expected - perhaps they are waiting for the inevitable conflict between the lord of the East Crown and his only courtier - - Fortunately, Amos is not stupid enough to reach this point. After the harvest festival, he sent an invitation to invite Kreima and his friends to come to Dongguan Island before the Midwinter Festival, which was held by the Lord Amos. A grand celebration, he not only invited Kreima, but also invited the other three lords, although the lords would only send one of their sons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few months, the place that was once devastated and erased by lava has been re-enclosed by rich green, just this green and Compared with the place where the fire element is eroded, it is slightly weaker. As long as you lower your head or open the dense foliage, people can still find the black shiny volcanic belt from the giant tumbling magma. The bowl overflowed and flowed in all directions. Some of them flowed to the hidden port that Cremari and other mages had used, slipping from the towering platform, forming tear-like condensation on the walls of the vertical and sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress and palace of the East Crown lord were rebuilt, and Amos was not like his father, and several other rulers of the Dragon Fire Island, like no effect. Extravagance and waste, his palace has no ebony. There are also no alabasters, all of which are gold-pointed asters. This gray stone has golden and purple points, and its hardness is higher than that of alabaster. It is also beautiful after grinding and carving. Even if the slabs are not used, the doors and windows use ironwood that is not easy to burn and has finer texture. However, because of the lack of fabulous statues and gold and silver jewels, his hall is a bit monotonous and simple, more like a temple of an unknown god. The guest whispers, thinking that this is his slave and eunuch. reason. After all, this is already a secret that is similar to the public, and his only weakness has been made up by Yadel. The "real" Amos has also melted into the lava, as a believer or a false believer, his soul. Either it has been nailed to the wall of Cranvo, or it has been forked by the devil to make food, and even if it is able to recall his soul? They were originally brothers. They have the same face, and when they stand face to face, they will be confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just don't quite understand it," said Xiu. He swept through everyone in the temple like an eagle-eyed, sharp eye. They all had hypocritical smiles. The word elegant is a trap, and it is not much different from the nobles in Norman King: "I thought that there was such a big turmoil in the East Coast Island, and those vultures couldn’t wait to rush to divide it. As a result, I turned out to be I couldn't wait for a war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to balance," Yadel said: "Probably."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is it because of the geographical position of the East Crown?" Xiu said, walked over to open the long window, the entire height of the long window exceeded the repair. It is about nine feet and five inches, and the bottom is only three inches from the ground. Each long window can be opened or even removed. There are at least two walls in the room. This can be used as a door or as a window. The activity is cut off. At the same time, the sea breeze will run through the room, bringing the fresh and cool air that people expect. As a knight, his first point of view is naturally related to his career. He recalled it. The map that covers the entire Longhuo Islands, as the name suggests, is located on the east side of the island, the northernmost part, almost away from the islands, the south is farther away, the north is slightly farther, and the west and the east crown can even be said. Separated by an inner sea, if the lords of the other three islands want to annex the East Crown, their subsequent distribution of interests will only be very troublesome – as to whether they can send troops alone, then he...”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to consider whether the other two islands will take the opportunity to do something? "The sea breeze in the evening is extremely fierce. It is like being pushed by a strong man. His voice disappears without a trace, but Yadel has captured some of the most critical words." He nodded. "This is from your point of view.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile: "Yes, you are the pastor of Rosada, who taught this? Yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale’s look dimmed a bit: "My long brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He repaired his body unnaturally. He remembered that when Yadell first arrived at Thunder Castle, he also investigated the details of the fallen priest. After all, the two brands on the cheeks of Yad’s cheeks were pretending to be pretending. It was too terrible. He knew that Yadel had pierced a dagger into the chest of his eldest brother. He coughed twice and tried to divert the topic from this sad content: "So from the perspective of the pastor? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the perspective of the pastor," Yadel said: "He Fear of change.” Rosada’s pastor stood up from the lowstand—to avoid being extinguished by the sea breeze, the whale wax candles in the room were covered with polished shells that were nearly transparent, and the light emitted was as beautiful as pearls. It was bright, and a fat snakehead moth was attracted by the lights. When it got into the shell, it couldn’t come out. Yadel picked up the shell and pinched it out. “You may have noticed that on the main island of Longhuo Island. There are no temples and no sanctuaries, and the main island is full of the majority of the island's population and the most powerful people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repair is not a pastor, not sensitive to some things, but since Yadel is raised. He is still able to quickly detect it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This issue I discussed with Kremar," said Yadell: "The Dragon Fire Island is a deformed place, from those who escaped a thousand years ago. The people who came here after the disaster caused by the Great Holocaust began. At that time even the gods fell into a deadly turmoil. The priests of the main material plane could neither gain strength from them nor let them listen. To his own arc, the pastor's situation was the worst and the least popular. Because they were seen as angering the gods - there is no priest, there is no temple. There is no sanctuary, the original The buildings are gradually being abandoned over time, and the ensuing is their scorn and neglect of the gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference is now, the gods have Re-focusing on the sights. Xiu, now the people of Longhuo Island are like fish trapped in the water, they dare not break the existing balance, attract more attention - so even if the East Crown has Shaky, they will only watch far away, looking for a small piece of opportunity Small pieces of grain are eaten. Not whales."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I heard that slaves have no faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not because of their own will--repair, the lords of the Longhuo Islands have stolen the people of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is the anti-theft chapter, updated around 10 am tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress and palace of the East Crown lord were rebuilt, and Amos was not like his father, and several other rulers of the Dragon Fire Island, like no effect. Extravagance and waste, his palace has no ebony. There is also no alabaster, all of which are gold-pointed ochre. This gray stone has golden and purple points. The hardness is higher than that of alabaster. It is also beautiful after polishing and carving. Even if the doors and windows are not used. . It also uses ironwood that is not easy to burn and has a finer texture. However, because of the lack of beautiful statues and gold and silver jewels, his temple is a bit monotonous and simple, more like a temple of an unknown god. Whispering, I think this is the reason why he has been a slave and an eunuch. After all, this is a secret that is similar to the public, and his only weakness has been made up by Yadel. The "real" Amos has also melted into the lava. As a believer or a false believer, his soul has either been nailed to the wall of Cranbo, or the food has been forked by the devil. And what if he can recall his soul? They were originally brothers, with identical faces, and when they stood face to face, they would be confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just don't quite understand it," said Xiu. He swept the eyes of the temple like an eagle-eyed eye. They all had a false smile, and they used the words elegant but trapped everywhere, and the king of Norman. The nobles are not much different: "I thought that there was such a big turmoil in the Tung Guan Island. The vultures couldn't wait to rush to divide it. As a result, I could not wait for a war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to balance," Yadel said: "Probably."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the location of the East Crown?"
