			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last night that Kreima and his companions spent in this small village - when Kerry told the village chief With the keen sense of the elves, he perceives the people around him to breathe a sigh of relief - they are not the gangsters who tend to be evil, nor stupid enough to think that the adventurers are only doing trivial things. In fact, it is because they have profoundly grasped the terrible monsters (deformation blame) and they are afraid of Kerry and others who can easily kill them. Maybe they will tell themselves and other adventurers. It’s kind, it’s not going to wave the swords to innocent people, and it won’t ask for the rewards they can’t afford, but women and children will try to be less obvious when they see Cremaar or Birdwin. But he hid very quickly, especially the black-haired caster, who felt that someone might spread salt on the way he walked - just don't know if there is such a custom here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the village may be able to represent most people. He took all his savings and asked his villagers to meet his previous attitude. The adventurers all asked, even asking if they needed "sweet soothing", the girl in the village could not, but he could let the boys go to the town to find one, or two; but his tone and words are both Not as friendly as before, sometimes he is talking to them, but he is always reluctant to touch any of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really weird,” said Gülen. “They see us as if we are watching another group of monsters.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost." The black-haired caster said that while finishing his scroll, "For them, like monsters, we are all dangerous people who need to be vigilant." A roll of reel is inserted into the reel belt, gently try to extract and put it back, to ensure that it does not cause problems at a critical moment. "In addition, perhaps they still have some resentment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Resentment?" The thief raised his arm. "Don't tell me that there are distortions we haven't found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just anger." Kremar said: "This is very calm until we appear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there was a goblin here before we appeared," Mei Mi carefully Said: "And these deformed monsters have been crouched for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They don't think so." The soul from another plane said, "If you say that goblins and deformed monsters have nothing to do with us, then they can only show that they have a terrible bad luck, even if we leave, It may still affect the future life of the villagers; but if we can blame this fault with us, then we will leave the village when the disaster is caused. Then the bad luck of the village will be over, and they will be able to start again without worry. There will be any terrible things coming to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief spoke a bit: "A group of ungrateful bastards," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is easier to blame others than to blame yourself," said Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry, who was half-squatting on the ground to check the horseshoe, smiled a little, and he was very happy that Krimamar could understand this, and the time of the Ranger’s travels could almost A human race is five or six generations. He has hundreds of friends and companions. Among them are humans, elves, and even dwarves. They have encountered such things more than once - initially. Even he couldn't help but feel anger and sorrow. He didn't understand why human beings couldn't face mistakes and disasters, especially some of them were the mistakes they made and the disasters they called. They refused to accept the facts, discern the truth, and sometimes even The people who gave them help or gave answers were addicted and swords. But the wise young elves soon understood - they were just fragile, not just the body, but their spirit and soul, so that they could not bear the implied reality behind them. Heavy responsibility, whether it is from the self or from others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a handful of people with a strong will and a high-spirited person who can face everything calmly, like Yadell and Birdwin. The Elf Ranger is very happy to see that his friend has not lost his lofty reputation, his innocent reputation, his distinguished status and his complete body, and he has become frustrated and degraded, although he cannot raise his name in the name of Tyre. Weapons, but he is still able to defend justice and justice with life and dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he has Leona, the king of Norman in the Highlands, a noble and pure human woman. The elves are convinced that they will be able to elute their grievances one day, returning to the kingdom of Norman in the highlands and the cheers of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he is also very happy to hear that Kremar can say that, Beavis taught him very well, he is a good boy who is tolerant and wise - He didn't care about being alienated by some ordinary people, and he understood why they did it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he thought of Beavis Kerry, he sighed. He stood up and pushed open a big breeze that the horse was standing on. The little pony and its brothers were given by the villagers. Their gift, perhaps because of the first time outside of home, this pony is obviously overexcited, it keeps wanting to chew a chewing elf with soft hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t say goodbye to anyone, leaving the unfortunate village in the morning mist, Kerry wanted to leave these two pony - they It’s not an ordinary adventurer, you don’t need horses to carry your luggage and tents, not to mention the fact that they will cross the entire snow cover swamp, but considering that this may be mistaken for dissatisfaction or contempt, he has to bring them, the problem is The two pony drove their speed greatly, so in the next town, the thieves dragged them away and sold them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only took a short break in the town and continued to move south. In order to recapture the time of the fallacy, they did not stay in other villages and cities. After walking for several days, the elves asked them to unload the saddle, remove the stables, and put the horses that had been with them for a long time back into the woods, using magic horses, which were raised by the Norman royal family in the Highlands. The Master made it more expensive and more powerful than the Luzer's collection, and their hooves left a pit with a depth of one finger when they stepped on the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are nine bright black tourmaline-carved pony in the box where the statue of the magic horse is placed, but Kerry has only married three of them. "We may later Use them," he explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trust me," Gülen whispered, "I am not so satisfied with this arrangement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Mei Mi glared at him, but in the end he still had to hold the thief's waist, the magic horse's back is very smooth, and she is sure that if she falls down halfway, the bastard will definitely be silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan laughed loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona also had a small dispute with Baldwin about who was sitting in front of him, and Baldwin thought he even had only one hand. I can perfectly control this tall magic horse, but Leona obviously has different opinions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bedwin sat behind," Kerry Ben said. Ignore his best friend to look at him with the look of "You swollen and can betray me": "The person sitting behind can use the weapon." He used his eyes to signal the weapon of Birdwin and Leona, Leo. Na does not have to say that the flame-shaped sword almost surpassed her shoulder, and Birdwin’s wide sword was not short. Among them, there must be a weapon to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birdwin immediately remained silent, and Leona gave Kerry a playful wink that represented "thank you," gracefully and briskly leaping over the back of the magic horse, and Birdwin fixed her flame-shaped sword. After that, I also jumped on the magic horse that began to rub the hooves on the rocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the remaining two. There is nothing wrong with Kerry Ben and Kreima. Anyway, Kerry is responsible for driving. The soul from another plane is always a frequent visitor in the back seat, but Kerry suddenly smiles and compares with him. There is no gesture that Cremaar can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world thinks about it, and feels that there is nothing wrong with it. By the elves who seem to be Gaulle’s flowers, they are ridiculous, he is in the stars. The little prank on the river has become the secret of a person who is only stunned by his sadness. Although the magic horse will not be ups and downs like a normal horse, he really likes to be dragged like a kite or a balloon. The feeling of flying fast in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past paladins, princes, thieves, and Fro’s pastors watched the only mage among them release a spell to themselves and let them float. Then tie himself to the Elf Ranger with his beloved silver string. Leave about one person in the middle to stretch your arms so long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong with it?" The black-haired caster curiously asked him that he was taller than them, so he could clearly see every face. The expression on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...nothing," the first thing I said was Gülen: "I just think...this is really an idea that has never been better before. Very wonderful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me too." Liona said, try to make your smile not so big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." Kerry Ben pulled back everyone’s attention: "Go!" he whispered: "We are going to be before the next dawn." Arrived at the Snow Covered Marsh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" : "瑞意特?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good," said Ruiyite, applauding gently, "very good," she said sincerely: " I never thought that you could do so well - you are now the real master of the White Tower and the hills - so powerful. So smart, who dares to deceive you, and who dares to defy you? "She bowed to Anzhen's hypocrisy and exaggeration. "I am so happy that you are not a stupid Demon to be my collaborator. I think we will soon see the resurgence of the White Tower, it is not only It is a hill, and it will be the brightest pearl in the entire Star River. The gold coins will break into the water like water. The caravans will flow day and night. The goods will pile up into mountains and people will become The people of the people are proud, your name and power are as omnipresent as the sun, even the king and the Grand Duke will pay tribute to you, dear lord, that would be a wonderful sight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Really.” Anzhen proudly said that although she was already hot and breathless for the illusion that was within reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But are those tobaccos really good?" After a little calming for a while, she couldn’t help but worry if the plants that were said to be able to exchange countless gold coins could The hills survived. Some people had planted tobacco in the hills before, but they were not root rot or the leaves were black and atrophy, and they could only be thrown away in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not only the elves will caress the plants," Reyte said: "Our warlocks can do more than they do." As she knows, there are others who are trying to cultivate the devil's fingers. Austal is exploring this news. From her, the devil and the ghost, if possible, he will snatch their fruits, if not, at least Be ruined, lest you encounter an enemy that is not so good to deal with in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in you." An Zhen said that although she believes that it is better to believe that Ruiyi is more convinced of the latter’s thirst for power, if this If things get messed up, Ruiyite will be unlucky together. To be honest, if it has nothing to do with her, Anzhen is very interested in seeing Ruiyi’s jokes, but unfortunately, she and Ruiyite are eagerly hoping for this. Things can be as good as they expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reiite quickly left Anzhen’s mansion, this half-elf and semi-human woman has fallen to the point where she does not want to be with her, she It seems that she is completely unaware that her soul is rotten and stinky with ** - this is not the worst, and the worst is that she still feels like a pure white lily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if things are not bad, Greed’s pastor’s heart is still full of impatience and irritability, a white tower resident with heavy cargo When she passed, she didn't have time to give way, and Ruiyite's whip immediately pulled his face. The tip of the hook dug out his eyes. The venom on the whip burned the skin on his face. The dissolution of a black hole that can see the teeth and the gums - his tragic sound makes Reyote's mood no longer so bad, but it will take a while to wait for it to really turn better - before the dinner, Ruiyite got her The response you want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock who inherited the devil's blood agreed to cooperate with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are running all the way, the warm daylight is gradually receding from their eyes, the woods gradually It becomes sparse, and the soil becomes soft. It is like a human blood vessel splashing under the horseshoe like a small stream of plant veins. The water is clustered by the stars, the surface is full of mist, and there are constantly waterfowl and small The beasts were shocked by them and flew around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
